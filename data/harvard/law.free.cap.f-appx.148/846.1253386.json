Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court erred by enhancing his criminal history category based on facts neither admitted by him nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-19\">We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact on a motion to suppress for clear error, and its application of law to the facts <em>de novo. See United States v. Tokars, </em>95 F.3d 1520, 1531 (11th Cir.1996). Because Gooden preserved his <em>Booker </em>claim in the district court, our review is <em>de novo, </em>but we will reverse and remand only for harmful error. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). Preserved constitutional and statutory errors under <em>Booker </em>are reviewed for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291-93 (11th Cir.2005). Constitutional error is \u201charmless\u201d when the government can show beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1291. We review statutory error under a less demanding test: whether a review of the proceedings, as a whole, shows that the error either did not affect the sentence or had only a slight effect. <em>Id. </em>at 1291-92. \u201cIf one can say with fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was <em>error.\u201d Id. </em>at 1292 (internal marks omitted). The government has the burden of proof under both standards. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-20\">After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>The Fourth Amendment guarantees that individuals will be \u201csecure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. Const. Amend. IV. \u201cThe Fourth Amendment generally requires police to secure a warrant before conducting a search.\u201d <em>See Maryland v. Dyson, </em>527 U.S. 465, 466, 119 S.Ct. 2013, 2014, 144 L.Ed.2d 442 (1999). However, searches of vehicles are, in certain circumstances, an established exception to the warrant requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 466, 119 S.Ct. at 2014. Under the \u201cautomobile exception,\u201d if (1) a car is \u201creadily mobile and [2] probable cause exists to believe it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment ... permits the police to search the vehicle without more.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467, 119 S.Ct. at 2014.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Officers can search any container in an operational car without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe that the container holds evidence of a crime. <em>California v. Acevedo, </em>500 U.S. 565, 579-80, 111 S.Ct. 1982, 1991, 114 L.Ed.2d 619 (1991); <em>United States v. Watts, </em>329 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Because there is no dispute that the car Gooden was driving was operational, our inquiry is limited to determining whether the officers had probable cause to search the automobile for evidence of a crime. <em>See Watts, </em>329 F.3d at 1286. \u201cProbable cause for a search exists when under the totality of the circumstances \u2018there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Goddard, </em>312 F.3d 1360, 1363 (11th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2332, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)). The magistrate judge found probable cause existed to search the car for the presence of controlled substances or paraphernalia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-9\">At the point in time the automobile was searched and the trunk opened, the police had smelled the odor of marijuana coming from it and had arrested the driver of the car for actual possession of crack cocaine found in his pocket. These facts more than adequately establish probable cause to believe illegal controlled substances or evidence of the arrested driver\u2019s possession of controlled substances would be found in the car. Thus, there being probable cause to search the car and it being inherently mobile, the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d to the warrant requirement authorized the search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">The facts in the instant case reveal that (1) both the search and its scope were valid in this case and (2) the district court did not err by denying Gooden\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">We also are unpersuaded by Goo-den\u2019s <em>Booker </em>argument. Gooden contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>that the district court erroneously enhanced his criminal history on the basis of facts not admitted by him nor found by a jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 749-51. There are two types of <em>Booker </em>error: (1) constitutional error, which is a violation of the Sixth Amendment and occurs when a district court enhances a defendant\u2019s sentence based on judicial fact finding under a mandatory sentencing regime, and (2) statutory error, which takes place when the district court applies the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion. <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Here, the district court committed both constitutional and statutory <em>Booker </em>error. First, the plea agreement did not specify a drug amount to be used in calculating his sentence, and Gooden objected to the facts contained in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d). Thus, Gooden was sentenced on the basis of facts that he did not admit and that were not proved by the government to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1331. Second, the district court sentenced Gooden under a mandatory Guidelines system. <em>Id. </em>at 1329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">Nevertheless, we readily find that any <em>Booker </em>error in the instant case was harmless, even under the more demanding \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard for constitutional errors. <em>See Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948. While the district court did not announce an alternative sentence, it did note that the PSI presented a \u201cpersuasive argument ... that an upward departure could be justified,\u201d in light of Gooden\u2019s extensive criminal history. The district court further stated that \u201cthe most important sentencing objective\u201d in imposing Gooden\u2019s sentence was \u201cprotection of society,\u201d and indicated that <em>\u201ceven without the benefit of the Sentencing Guidelines </em>in this case, [the court] would be looking at a sentence at the top of the statutory range, not necessarily the tip-top, but within a year of it.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">The statutory maximum term of imprisonment for Gooden\u2019s offense is 120 months. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). The district court unambiguously indicated that, even without the Guidelines, it would impose a sentence \u201cwithin a year\u201d of the 120-month statutory maximum, which would yield a sentence of between 108 and 119 months. Gooden received a 100-month term, which was the bottom of the Guidelines range and, notably, was <em>less </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>than the sentence the district court said it would impose without the Guidelines. Accordingly, the record demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that any <em>Booker </em>error was harmless. <em>Cf. United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir. 2005) (holding in a preserved-error appeal, that the district court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the district court considered sentencing the appellant to the 20-year statutory maximum). Accordingly, we affirm Gooden\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-14\">. In his plea agreement, Gooden reserved the right to appeal the district court's denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b870-7\">. Another exception to the warrant requirement exists for inventory searches, conducted pursuant to an established procedure, on legally impounded vehicles. <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 372-73, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 3098-99, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976). In the instant case, the officers conducted the search as an inventory search, the validity of which forms the crux of Gooden\u2019s argument on appeal. However, the magistrate judge found the search of Gooden\u2019s vehicle and seizure of firearm evidence valid <em>both </em>(1) based on an inventory search <em>and </em>(2) pursuant to the automobile exception. Because we find the \"automobile exception\u201d of <em>Dyson </em>applies, we need not, and do not, reach the validity of the inventory search. <em>Cf. United States v. Strickland, </em>902 F.2d 937, 942 (11th Cir.1990) (upholding validity of the search of a vehicle on a different basis than the ground asserted by the searching officers; \u201d[t]he absence of Strickland\u2019s consent to [the search of a spare tire contained in his vehicle] does not necessitate the suppression of the evidence derived from the tire search, however, if there is another valid basis justifying the intrusion.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b871-8\">. The government asserts the appeal waiver provision in Gooden\u2019s plea agreement bars his <em>Booker </em>claim. A sentence appeal waiver contained in a plea agreement, made knowingly and voluntarily, is enforceable. <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1345, 1350-51 (11th Cir.1993). \u201d[I]n most circumstances, for a sentence appeal waiver to be knowing and voluntary, the district court <em>must have specifically discussed the sentence appeal waiver </em>with the defendant <em>during the Rule 11 hearing.\u201d Id. </em>at 1351 (emphasis added). Absent this discussion, a sentence appeal waiver is also enforceable, when \"it is manifestly clear from the record that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-14\">Based on our review, the district court did not mention the appeal waiver at Gooden\u2019s plea colloquy. Moreover, it is not \"manifestly clear\u201d that Gooden understood he was waiving the right to appeal his sentence based solely on the written provision in Gooden\u2019s plea agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 1352 (rejecting view that an examination of only the text of the plea agreement is sufficient to find the waiver knowing and voluntary). Accordingly, we will disregard the waiver and proceed to the merits of Gooden\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1353.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b872-16\">. Based on our rejection of Gooden\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim, we do not reach his final argument, which concerns the scope of our remand order if we were to vacate and remand his sentence based on <em>Booker, </em>because it is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
