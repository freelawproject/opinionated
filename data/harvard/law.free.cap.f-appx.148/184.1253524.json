The Government has moved to dismiss Peeler\u2019s appeal based upon a waiver of appellate rights in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-23\">We deny the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss. We conclude, however, that Peeler waived the right to proceed with each of his claims on appeal, except his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We have reviewed that claim and determine that it does not \u201cconclusively appear[]\u201d on the record that counsel was ineffective. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). Peeler may raise his ineffective assistance claim in proceedings under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2005). We grant the Government\u2019s motion to file a reply to Peeler\u2019s supplemental brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
