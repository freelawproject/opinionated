Whitehead alleges that, from January 15, 1999 to January 18, 2001, Appellee\u2019s actions (and inactions) denied him access to the courts. Whitehead\u2019s complaint also asserts ineffective assistance of counsel and several state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">After over a year of discovery, during which Whitehead filed several successful motions to compel, Appellee moved for summary judgment. Whitehead filed a response opposing summary judgment, supported by an affidavit. The District Court granted summary judgment to Appellee. Whitehead appeals from this order, again proceeding <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">The District Com\u00ed had original jurisdiction over Whitehead\u2019s federal civil rights claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343 and supplemental jurisdiction over his related state law claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the underlying facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Pennsylvania Coal Ass\u2019n v. Babbitt, </em>63 F.3d 231, 235 (3d Cir.1995). Summary judgment is appropriately granted where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). A party opposing a summary judgment motion cannot rest upon the \u201cmere allegations or denials of the adverse party\u2019s pleading\u201d but must respond with affidavits or depositions setting forth \u201cspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). We can affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on any basis supported in the record. <em>See Fairview Township v. EPA, </em>773 F.2d 517, 524 n. 15 (3d Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-16\">The District Court granted summary judgment to Appellee on the ground that Whitehead\u2019s suit was barred by the two-year statute of limitations for civil rights actions. We affirm on the alternate basis argued in Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Upon review of the record, we conclude that Whitehead failed to support his allegations regarding Appellee\u2019s actions or to point to any evidence that would demonstrate the existence of any injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-17\">To show a denial of access to the courts, Whitehead would be required to demonstrate that Appellee\u2019s alleged actions (or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>failure to act) \u201chindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim.\u201d <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 347, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). The legal claim must relate to a direct or collateral challenge to Whitehead\u2019s sentence or conditions of confinement. <em>See id. </em>Whitehead alleges that Appellee\u2019s actions prevented him from filing a direct appeal in his criminal case and frustrated his attempts to file two petitions for post-conviction relief (\u201cPCRA petitions\u201d). Appellee argued that Whitehead was not denied access to the courts as he had exhausted his direct appeal rights and therefore could not demonstrate any injury. We agree. Whitehead was sentenced on June 11, 1998, making July 11, 1998 the deadline for filing a direct appeal. <em>See </em>Pa. R.App. P. 903(a); <em>Com. v. Cavanaugh, </em>500 Pa. 313, 456 A.2d 145, 146 (1983). Whitehead, therefore, cannot attribute any impediment to his direct appeal process to Appellee\u2019s alleged actions occurring approximately six months later. As to the contention that Appellee impeded his post-conviction proceedings, Whitehead offered no evidence that would demonstrate that Appellee received either PCRA petition or failed to send Whitehead any documents essential to his filing a PCRA petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">As to Whitehead\u2019s remaining claims, Appellee was entitled to summary judgment as to the state law claims, and we find no error in the District Court\u2019s implicit dismissal of the ineffectiveness claim. As argued in Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Whitehead failed to support his state law claims with relevant factual allegations or evidence. The basis for Whitehead\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is unclear, as his pleadings do not identify an attorney in connection with this claim. Even\u2019if Whitehead had identified an attorney, this claim would fail under \u00a7 1983 because attorneys performing traditional defense counsel functions are not \u201cstate actors.\u201d <em>See Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 324-25, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981); <em>Black v. Bayer, </em>672 F.2d 309, 314 (3d Cir.1982) <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>972 F.2d 1364 (3d Cir.1992) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Appellee was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the record before the District Court and will affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-13\">. As the parties are familiar with the facts, we recite them here only as necessary to our discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b144-5\">. Whitehead has supplied this Court with several exhibits which he claims support his allegations. Our review of the record reveals that none of these documents were presented to the District Court; therefore, we do not consider them on appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(a); <em>Fassett v. Delta Kappa Epsilon (New York), </em>807 F.2d 1150, 1165 (3d Cir.1986) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
