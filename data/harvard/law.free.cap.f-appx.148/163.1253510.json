The conviction was based upon an incident on November 21, 2000, when Officer Foll\u00edn of the Sumter Police Department and a confidential informant purchased cocaine from Brown in an undercover drug buy. We affirm Brown\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-18\">Brown first contends that the district court erred by failing to suppress the identification of Brown by Officer Foll\u00edn and by failing to adequately instruct the jury on the reliability of suggestive eyewitness identifications. Brown argues that Officer Follin\u2019s identification should have been suppressed because it was tainted by Officer Follin\u2019s initial identification of Brown. Brown argues the initial identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive because Officer Foll\u00edn identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Brown by looking for Brown\u2019s name in a police department photograph book.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">We apply a two-step test to determine whether identification testimony is admissible. \u201cFirst, the defendant must establish that the photographic lineup procedure was impermissibly suggestive.... Second, even if the procedure was suggestive, the in-court identification is valid if it was reliable.... The factors the court may consider in measuring reliability include: (1) the witness\u2019 opportunity to view the perpetrator at the time of the crime; (2) the witness\u2019 degree of attention at the time of the offense; (3) the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the perpetrator; (4) the witness\u2019 level of certainty when identifying the defendant as the perpetrator at the time of the confrontation; and (5) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilkerson, </em>84 F.3d 692, 694 (4th Cir.1996). In essence, the court examines the totality of the circumstances surrounding the identification. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>114 F.3d 435, 441 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Officer Follin did not use an impermissibly suggestive photographic line-up procedure. Aware of Brown\u2019s name and of Brown\u2019s appearance, Officer Follin simply turned to the photograph of Kenyatte Brown in the book and confirmed that it was the same person who sold the drugs to the confidential informant on November 21, 2000. Even if this court were to find that Officer Follin\u2019s identification of Brown was impermissibly suggestive, Officer Follin\u2019s identification of Brown as the drug dealer is reliable. First, the purchase occurred in the afternoon on a clear day and took less than a minute. The drug purchase was videotaped, and Brown\u2019s face was visible on the tape. Officer Follin viewed the videotape prior to picking Brown\u2019s picture out of the photograph book. Officer Follin also testified that during the drug buy, he observed Brown walk across the front of the vehicle Officer Follin and the confidential informant were traveling in and stop at the passenger side window. Officer Follin\u2019s vision was not obscured, and Brown was not wearing a mask or other covering over his face. Second, Officer Follin testified that at the time of the drug sale, his attention was not focused on anything except Brown. Third, Officer Follin drafted a report of the purchase solely from his memory upon the completion of the controlled drug deal. In the report, Officer Follin described Brown as five foot eight and one hundred fifty pounds. Police records subsequently described Brown as five foot nine and one hundred sixty pounds. Fourth, the confidential informant stated to Officer Follin just prior to the drug sale \u201chere is Kenyatte.\u201d After Officer Follin and the confidential informant completed the purchase, Officer Follin again asked the confidential informant who sold the drugs to them. The confidential informant responded Kenyatte and Keshawn Brown. Examining the totality of the circumstances surrounding Officer Follin\u2019s identification of Brown as the drug dealer, we find Officer Follin\u2019s identification of Brown sufficiently reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">We next consider whether the district court properly instructed the jury on eyewitness identifications. We review the district court\u2019s jury instructions for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 384 (4th Cir.1999). The district court instructed the jury that when evaluating eyewitness testimony, to consider factors such as the general credibility of the witness; the length of time that the witness observed the defendant, including visibility and distance; the manner in which the defendant was presented to the witness; the witness\u2019s prior familiarity with the defendant; and the length of time between the incident and when the witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>next identified the defendant. We reject Brown\u2019s argument because the district court\u2019s jury instruction adequately informed the jury on evaluating eyewitness identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Brown also contends that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing his sentence based on facts not found by the jury. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court enhanced Brown\u2019s sentence based on Brown\u2019s prior drug-related convictions. We find no merit in Brown\u2019s argument because \u201cthe Supreme Court continues to hold that the Sixth Amendment (as well as due process) does not demand that the mere fact of a prior conviction used as a basis for a sentencing enhancement be pleaded in an indictment and submitted to a jury for proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">For these reasons, we affirm Brown\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to be relieved as counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
