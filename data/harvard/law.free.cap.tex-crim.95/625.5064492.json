It seems to be well settled that if the indictment upon its face charges no offense it may be raised for the first time in this court, because the defect is one of substance. White v. State, 1 Texas Crim. App., 211; Holden v. State, 1 Texas Crim. App. 225; Cox et al. v. State, 8 Texas Crim. App., 254; Woolsey v. State, 14 Texas Crim. App., 57; Maddox v. State, 14 Texas Crim. App., 447; Gonzales v. State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep., 141; 124 S. W. Rep., 938; Dunn v. State, 158 S. W. Rep., 300; Jasper v. State, 73 Texas Crim. Rep., 197; 164 S. W. Rep., 851; Ryan v. State, 75 Texas Crim. Rep., 510, 176 S. W. Rep., 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In Osborne v. State, 93 Texas Crim. Rep., 54, 245 S. W. Rep., 928, it was recognized that if the defect be one of substance advantage of it could be taken for the first time on appeal. We are not discussing or considering lack of form or duplicity. The distinction between those defects and one of substance is clearly drawn in Melley v. State, 93 Texas Crim. Rep., 522, 248 S. W. Rep., 367. Whether failure in an indictment to charge an offense is a defect of substance is not left to conjecture. Article 575, Code Criminal Procedure settles that question. We quote from such article as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">\u201cThere is no exception to the substance of an indictment or information, except,. -1. That it does not appear from the face of the same that an offense against the law was committed by the defendant : \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Then follows three other matters which are denominated defects of substance not material in this discussion. It only remains then to determine if from the face of the indictment in the present case it fails to appear that the offense of forgery was committed by appellant. If it does so fail to show upon its face- then the judgment must be reversed and the prosecution dismissed, otherwise, not.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The instrument declared to have been forged is set out in the indictment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">\u201cWESTERN UNION TELEGRAM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\">Nov 29 P M 427</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-11\">Nov, 29 JD Houston, Texas 1922</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-12\">Mrs. M. Neustadt,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-13\">4135 W Lake St. Chicago, Illinois</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-14\">Wire hundred fifty dollars at once. Letter following will explain. Waive identification. Must have it. Harry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-15\">J. Bainbridge</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-16\">Harry Neustadt, Burnett Hotel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-17\">There are no explanatory averments whatever. Whether the words \u201cJ. Bainbridge, Harry Neustadt, Burnett Hotel\u201d were a part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>original telegram as filed in the telegraph office for transmission or whether they were notations placed upon the telegram by some one other than the purported maker does not appear. The instrument is not an ordinary commercial instrument and there are no allegations whatever explaining who \u201cHarry\u201d is supposed to be, nor the relations existing between him and the party to whom the telegram is addressed. In Cagle v. State, 39 Texas Crim. Rep., 109, 44 S. W. Rep., 1097, the court was considering a purported release of a landlord\u2019s lien on six bales of cotton. The release was copied in the indictment with no explanatory averments accompanying it. The indictment was held bad. The general rule for testing the sufficiency of indictments in forgery prosecutions was announced in that ease in the following language:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">\u201cIt may be considered a safe test, if the instrument is such on its face that it imports an obligation in regard to money or property, and will afford the basis of a civil action without resorting to extrinsic testimony, then a charge of forgery can be based thereon without any extrinsic averments. If the instrument is not of that character, but by the aid of extrinsic averments does create an obligation or liability with reference to money or property, then, by the aid of such extrinsic averments, it can be made the subject of forgery. Under this rule it is apparent that a promissory note, a check, draft, or order for money, plain and unambiguous in its terms, is the subject of forgery without any extrinsic averments. If the meaning of the paper itself is not clear, but of. doubtful import, then it may be given point by an innuendo, and in such case no extrinsic averment would be necessary, or, it may require both. If, however, the paper is not one of the ordinary instruments used in commercial transactions, but is contractual in form, and depends on extrinsic facts to create a liability, then it would appear that such extrinsic facts must be averred in the indictment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The foregoing principle has been applied in many cases where there was an entire absence of extrinsic averments or where those resorted to were insufficient. (For indictments declaring orders for goods to have been forged held bad for lack of explanatory averments, in some of which cases the question was raised after trial by motion in arrest of judgment, see, Womble v. State, 39 Texas Crim. Rep., 25; 44 S. W. Rep., 827; Colter v. State, 40 Texas Crim. Rep., 165; 49 S. W. Rep., 379; Crawford v. State, 40 Texas Crim. Rep., 344; 50 S. <em>W. </em>Rep., 378; Polk v. State, 40 Texas Crim. Rep., 668; 51 S. <em>W. </em>Rep., 909). Many other authorities involving instruments of various kinds will be found collated under the fifth paragraph, Section 1398, Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C. In Belden\u2019s ease (50 Texas Crim. Rep., 565, 99 S. W. Rep., 563) the instrument purported to be an order for the payment of money, but was held not to be the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>of forgery without explanatory averments. In Young v. State, 84 Texas Crim. Rep., 179, 206 S. W. Rep., 197, the alleged forged instrument was a telegram which read: \u201cJohn Friedman, 816 St. Charles Street, Brownsville, Tex. Send jewelry here. 304 Main Ave. (Signed) J. E. Landon.\u201d We have been unable to distinguish that instrument from the telegram in the present case except that one relates to property and the other to money, and with the further difference that in Young\u2019s case the purported author of the telegram is certain, which is not true with reference to the one now under consideration. Judge Prendergast, speaking for the court in that case said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">\u201cWe cannot tell from said telegram without extrinsic averments how it comes within our forgery statute. On its face, if it had been true, it cannot be told how it would have created, increased, diminished, discharged, or defeated any pecuniary obligation; nor that it would afford the basis of any civil action; nor that it would have transferred or in any manner have affected any property, without resorting to extrinsic allegation and testimony. If there were any facts which would meet the requirements of the statute and the rules stated, then it was necessary for the pleader to allege them, and without them the indictment is fatally defective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Everything said by the court with reference to that telegram may be said about this one and more. Here it does not appear who \u201cHarry,\u201d the purported signer may be. Whether it is a given name or a surname is left to inference; whether he (whoever he may have been) had money on deposit with Mrs. Neustadt for which he might call at will, is not averred. Nothing distinguishes it in its legal aspect from the Young telegram. For the same reasons stated by the court in the opinion in that case we conclude that the indictment in the present case is fatally defective. In the absence of any explanatory averments showing who the purported maker of the instrument was, the relation of the parties and other matters necessary to give validity to it, we must uphold the contention now made that the indictment is defective in substance and ehai\u2019ges no offense against the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing is granted, the affirmance here- . tofore ordered is set aside, and the judgment is now reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
