Prosecutrix lived in the country in the Briary community, was organist of the Sunday School at that point, and appears to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>been seventeen years of age. Her name was Reynolds. We do not think the ease one which calls for a lengthy recitation of the facts and content ourselves with a statement of the salient points in the evidence which appear to us to support our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\">It was shown that appellant began keeping company with prosecutrix in December, 1920, and went with her almost exclusively up to November 3, 1921, at which time he ceased his visits to her entirely. Her association with other young men during that time is shown to have been only occasional. No attack is made on her character, nor any reflection cast upon her chaste relations with other men during said period. Appellant\u2019s promise to marry was abundantly shown by testimony aliunde; his correspondence beginning in February 1921 and ending November 1st of said year, was in testimony and breathed deep affection and addressed prosecutrix as \u201cmy future wife\u201d and was signed as \u201cyour future husband.\u201d The birth of a fully developed baby in January 1922 reflects the probable fact of conception on the part of prosecutrix in April 1921, and in his letters appellant refers to an April date as one he would remember as long as he lived (said date being that of an act of intercourse, according to the girl\u2019s testimony). That appellant continued going with her after her condition would seem obviously noticeable, viz: in November 1921, and that in said month he told Bob Evans that he was going to marry Miss Reynolds who lived in the Briary community, is also shown by testimony other than that of the young lady. She says that before he ceased keeping her company she had told him of her condition. She also testified that on the occasion of their first act of intercourse in January 1921, same took place in a car on the roadside near the Machet place; this testimony is to some extent corroborated by another witness who swore that he saw appellant and prosecutrix sitting in a car in January or February on the roadside near the Machet place. \u25a0 The engagement to marry, the constant association, the abundant opportunity, the reference to the unforgetable date, the testimony of the parties being seen apparently at the time and place identified by prosecutrix as that of the first intercourse, and his continued association with her and writing to her up to within about two months before the birth of her child,- \u2014 the testimony aliunde that as late as November 1921 appellant expressed his purpose to marry her, all these and others seem to-us to present facts and circumstances amply sufficient to justify the conclusion that there is evidence in this record other than that of prosecutrix which tends to' corroborate her 'story that he met her, an innocent girl, courted her, engaged himself to her and begg\u00bfd her into doing what she said she knew to be wrong but which she did because he had promised to marry her and because she loved him, and because he \u201cjust begged me into it.\u201d The only requirements of the law as to corroboration in a case of this kind is that, it be of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>sufficient cogency and strength to tend to connect the accused with the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Finding no error in the record, and believing the evidence measures up to the recpiirements of the law, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">June 27, 1923.</p>\n<author id=\"b139-9\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A3x\">\u2014 We are asked to review and change our conclusion that the evidence in this ease aside from that of the prosecutrix, tended to show that appellant had carnally known her. Just how far this court may go in its interpretation of the expression \u201ctending to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense\u201d as used in speaking of corroborating evidence in Article 801 of our Code of Criminal Procedure, has not been held and to our minds is not capable of exact definition. It is well settled that the corroboration may be by circumstances, and it seems to us. that with varying cases evidence of greater or less cogency might be demanded as tending to show the connection of the accused with the crime. The real theory of the law is that the accomplice through connection with the crime becomes prima facie unworthy of credit and that the State should not be permitted to rest a conviction upon the testimony of one who is thus unworthy and that the rule will be laid down as in our statute that there must be corroboration-of such accomplice in. every case, which corroboration must go to the extent of tending to connect the accused with the commission of the offense. That there would be necessity for more cogent corroboration in the case of a hardened criminal who had been participating in crime and probably had brought about the crime under investigation and had then turned State\u2019s evidence, than would be required where the witness was a young woman of previous good character and reputation who had fallen in love with a man and as a result thereof been led astray from the paths of virtue, but who might in all other respects be apparently worthy, would seem easily possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">Reverting to the facts of this case, we observe that the birth of a child to prosecutrix shows her intercourse with some man. If married it would be attributed to her husband. If unmarried but engaged -to marry, as appears without dispute in this ease, and in constant association about the time of conception with the man to whom she was engaged and who she expected to marry, these would be circumstances which would tend to support the proposition that her intended husband was the father of the child. Such proposition would be further strengthened by the circumstances that she was shown to be of good reputation for virtue and chastity and that no suggestion was made in the .record or otherwise of any unchaste <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>conduct on her part with other men. In our opinion the circumstances meet the demand of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
