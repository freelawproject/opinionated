The bills of exception relate to such matters as depend for their soundness upon the facts. Having no facts before us we can not conclude same show any error.

We regret we can not recognize such an agreement. The duty is on one appealing his ease to diligently follow the preparation and presentation of the documents necessary to properly perfect such appeal. The law requires that statement of facts and bills of exception be filed within certain times. If agreements could be made by attorneys for the respective sides that such papers might be actually filed at other times but dated back, and the courts would enforce such agreements, the statute would in effect be thus abrogated. It is stated in the motion that a statement of facts was.prepared by the appellant and left with State\u2019s attorney, but there is no statement as to when same was so left.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">We regret that we are not in position, in view of the plain declaration of our statute, to grant appellant\u2019s motion, and name will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
