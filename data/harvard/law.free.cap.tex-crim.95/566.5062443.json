Our Assistant Attorney General objects to the consideration of bill of exceptions No. 1 because in question and answer form. The objection is well taken and the bill will not be considered. Rylee v. State, 90 Texas Crim. Rep., 482, 236 S. W. Rep., 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">Prom his bill of exceptions No. 2 as qualified by the learned trial court, we learn that in the absence of the appellant the jury communicated in writing with the court, stating that they could not agree and asking to be excused. The court wrote on the back of said written request, which was returned to the jury, the following: \u201cThis court will be in session until August 5th, 1922,\u201d which communication was signed by the district judge. The date of this communication appears to have been July 6, 1922. Article 756 of our Code of Criminal Procedure, referring to the three preceding articles under the general head of communications between the court and the jury, says in plain language \u201cIn every case of felony the defendant shall be present in court when any such proceedings is had, as mentioned in the three next preceding articles. His counsel shall also be called. In cases of misdemeanor, the defendant need not be personally present.\u201d This appellant was on trial for a felony. In Cowart v. State, 65 Texas Crim. Rep., 482, the court made a written communication to the juxy in the absence of the defendant and his counsel. The following expression occurs in the opinion of this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">\u201cOur statutes provide in article 753 of the Code of- Criminal Procedure, that the jury may communicate with the court in regard to axxy matter; in article 754, that they may ask for additional instructions, and in article 755, they have the right to have a witness re-examined on any matter involved in the trial, but in article 756, it is provided: \u2018In every ease of felony the defendant shall be present in the court when any such proceeding is had as mentioned in the three preceding articles. His counsel shall also be called.\u2019 This question has been before this court frequently, and a list of the authorities will be found collated in sections 874, 875, 876, 877, 878 and 879 of White\u2019s Ann. Code of Crim. Procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>In Booth v. State, 65 Texas Crim. Rep., 660, it appears that while the jury were deliberating upon their verdict they sent to the trial court a note in writing in substance as follows: \u201cThe jury can not agree upon a verdict and there is no hope of reaching a verdict, the jury wants to be discharged.\u201d This message was delivered to the court and the following reply sent orally to the jury: \u201cTell the jury as long as there is life there is hope, and this court lasts four weeks longer.\u201d This message was delivered to the jury. The proceeding was all had in the absence of the accused and his counsel and as soon as they learned of same they took an exception and brought the question before this court for review. The court, speaking through Judge Davidson, used the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">\u2022 \u201cThis court has held in all the decisions construing these articles, that when the trial is for a felony, the presence of the defendant is necessary whenever any proceeding mentioned in any of the preceding articles is had in the case. Por collation of authorities, see White\u2019s Ann. Code Crim. Procedure, secs. 874, 875, 876, 877, 878 and 879. The decisions have been harmonious and unbroken to the effect that violations of these articles constitute reversible error. In fact, it is a plain provision of the statute enacted by the Legislature. In the very recent case of Cowart v. State, decided during the present month, the judgment was reversed for a violation of one of these statutes in an opinion by Judge Harper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">As far as this court is aware its decisions have uniformly upheld the principle announced.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Because of the error of said communication, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">\n<em>Reversed a/nd remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
