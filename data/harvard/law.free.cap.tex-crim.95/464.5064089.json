It was picked up by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>State\u2019s witness. Appellant testified that the pistol was not in a condition to be used as a firearm in that the cylinder would not revolve; that he had taken it to have it repaired but was unable to get it repaired. He was corroborated in some degree by the testimony of his father that there were two pistols at his home, both of which were broken. The pistol in question came into the possession of the State\u2019s witness, but neither by him nor by anyone else was the testimony of the appellant controverted. The pistol being in the condition described, appellant, under the facts, was not shown to be guilty of any offense. See Cook v. State, 11 Texas Crim. App., 19; Dillingham v. State, 32 S. W. Rep., 771; White v. State, 66 S. W. Rep., 773; Branch Ann. Texas P.
