Crowley v. State, 92 Texas Crim. Rep., 103, 242 S. W. Rep., 572, Cecil v. State, 92 Texas Crim. Rep., 359, 243 S. W. Rep., 988; Copeland v. State, 92 Texas Crim. Rep., 554, 244 S. W. Rep., 818; McNeil v. State, 93 Texas Crim. Rep., 259, 247 S. W. Rep., 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">At the time appellant was arrested he was found in possession of twenty-nine half-gallon fruit jars of whisky. He had broken some of the bottles or jars before the officers could overtake the automobile in which he was transporting it, but admitted to them at the time of the arrest that he had started with eighteen gallons. The State proved over objection that there was also found in appellant\u2019s possession along with the whisky a pint beer bottle about half full of coloring material such as is used for coloring white whisky red, the objection being that it tended to prove other offenses against accused, viz, either of selling whisky or of having it in possession for the purpose of sale, and that it was prejudicial to appellant in the jury\u2019s consideration of his plea for a suspended sentence. The objections are not tenable. The proof shows part of the liquor found was white corn whisky, and part red whisky. The presence of the coloring material was <em>res gestae. </em>The jury were properly put in possession of all the facts to enable them to fix the punishment and exercise their judgment in passing upon the issue of suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In view of the fact and the qualification of the trial judge to the bill of exceptions relative to argument of the district attorney no error is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b536-9\">on rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">October 24, 1923.</p>\n<author id=\"b536-11\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ANvh\">\u2014 Our statute requires the introduction of some evidence whenever the accused in a felony case enters a plea of guilty, but there is no statutory designation of what evidence shall be introduced. It is made to appear that at the time appellant was arrested with the liquor in question he had in his possession a quantity of coloring matter presumably to effect the color of the liquor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>before it was sold or delivered as the ease might be. \u00a5e are unable to conclude that testimony of the finding of such coloring matter was not part of the <em>|res gestae </em>of the transaction, nor that its admission was contrary to the contemplation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\">Complaint is also renewed of the statement made by the prosecuting attorney to the jury in which he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\">\u201cIf all juries suspend sentences in cases of this kind fellows like the sheriff and myself should just as well throw up our hand and quit. \u201d .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">This was not a comment on any evidence not before the jury, nor was it any abuse or vituperation nor does it seem to be in the nature of an appeal to the passion or prejudices of the jury, and could have been understood by them but as a mere expression of opinion by the prosecuting attorney. The trial court qualified the bill of exceptions by saying that the statement was in reply to argument of the defense. It seems that the defense was arguing in favor of granting a suspended sentence upon the proposition that perhaps the object of the law granting it was to reform offenders, and it is stated that the argument objected to was in reply to this character of argument by appellant\u2019s counsel. \"We are unable to bring ourselves to believe the error, if any, of the argument to be such as to call for a reversal of the case, and the motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
