Art. 815 of our Code of Criminal Procedure contains the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">\u201cProvided, that such stenographer\u2019s report when carried into the statement of facts or bills of exception, shall be condensed so as not to contain the questions and answers, except where, in the opinion of the judge, such questions and answers may be necessary in order to elucidate the fact or question involved. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The bills of exception in the instant case are in question and answer form and contain no statement of the trial judge, as indicated in the portion of the statute above quoted, showing that it is the opinion of the trial court that the questions and answers are necessary to be set out in the bill of exceptions in order to elucidate the issue involved, nor is there anything to lead us to such conclusion. Under the holdings of this court bills of exception in question and answer form will not be considered. Jetty v. State, 90 Texas Crim. Rep., 346, 235 S. W. Rep., 589; Rylee v. State, 90 Texas Crim. Rep., 482, 236 S. <em>W. </em>Rep., 744; Romez v. State, 93 Texas Crim. Rep., 92, 245 S. W. Rep., 914. The motion of the Assistant Attorney General must be granted.-</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Examining the statement of facts, the sufficiency of the evidence being the only question remaining, we observe that, according to the State\u2019s case as made out by its witnesses, appellant sold to one Yinson a yearling which belonged to the prosecuting witness. If he did so, it is without dispute that this was without the authority or consent of the owner of said yearling. Appellant denies having appropriated the yearling in question or having sold the same to Yinson. By his witnesses he attacks the reputation of Yinson. These are all matters for the jury and have been solved by them adversely to appellant\u2019s contention. Looking to the State\u2019s case, it presents testimony amply sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">October 31, 1923.</p>\n<author id=\"b605-6\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AzIC\">\u2014 In his motion for rehearing appellant presents a long explanation why his bill of exception number three was presented in question and answer form and a persuasive argument that this court should consider it. A re-examination of the bill confirms our view that it presents no exception to the rule against such practice. The explanation of the learned trial judge to the bill would show no error in his ruling upon the matter complained of if it should be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
