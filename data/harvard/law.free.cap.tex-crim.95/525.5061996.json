All of these things occurred at times and places when no one could possibly have known the facts save her and appellant. He did not testify. The State had introduced in evidence his photograph. During the closing argument the attorney for the State placed this photograph upon a desk in front of the jury, and ostensibly addressing the picture, said: \u201c0. Roby (which is appellant\u2019s name) why did you seduce this poor little girl in October, 1918? Why <em>ain\u2019t </em>you man enough to give the jury all the facts, that they may know the full truth about this matter? Why did you seduce this girl at the time when her brother was fighting the battles of his country in Prance, you at that time were here making indecent proposals to her and seducing her? Why don\u2019t you answer these facts? You don\u2019t answer.\u201d The argument was objected to as being a comment upon the failure of appellant to testify. The trial court sustained the objection, and charged the jury in writing to disregard the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">It is indeed to be deplored that prosecuting officers in their zeal will continue to ignore the positive provision of Article 790, C. C. P. that a failure of a defendant to testify \u201cshall not be alluded to or commented on by counsel.\u201d The inhibition is positive, and the effect of its violation the same whether the comment be direct or by a subterfuge. The trial judge did right in directing the jury not to consider the argument, but he should have gone further and promptly granted a new trial because of its use. As long as the statute remains in its present form we must perforce reverse where its terms are deliberately overridden. (Many authorities will be found collated under Note 29, page 716, Vol. 2, Vernon\u2019s C. P., and Sec. 375, Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">While the jury was deliberating upon the case the fact that appellant had failed to testify was referred to several times. The foreman of the jury each time admonished them that under the court\u2019s charge that was a matter they were forbidden to discuss. As presented we would hesitate to reverse for this alone, but it tends to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>show that the improper argument had found lodgment in the jury\u2019s mind, and was working to appellant\u2019s detriment.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b549-6\">[This case reached the hands of the reporter in October, 1923. Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b549-3\">We advert to another matter in order that it may not occur again. Counsel for the State sought to prove the condition of appellant\u2019s health, intimating in the presence of the jury that he was shirking military duty, and although objection was sustained, he again alluded to it in the argument. This was manifestly unfair. Prosecuting officers should know that in cases involving charges of the character here under investigation the feelings of jurors are ordinarily and naturally not in sympathy with accused, and should refrain from any act or reference calculated to arouse prejudice, thereby jeopardizing the conviction if- one should be secured.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">For the reasons stated, the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
