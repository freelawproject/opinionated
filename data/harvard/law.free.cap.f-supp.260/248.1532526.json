The order complained of sustained the findings of the Commission, Finance Review Board, in its report and order, dated March 11, 1965, in Schneider Transport &amp; Storage, Inc., Control and Merger, \u2014 Packer City Transit Line, Inc., reported at 101 M.C.C. 39 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-24\">The order approves the acquisition by Schneider Transport &amp; Storage, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \u201cSchneider\u201d or \u201cvendee\u201d) of Packer City Transit Line, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \u201cPacker City\u201d or \u201cvendor\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and merger of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>their respective operating rights <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, Section 5, Title 49 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Plaintiffs are motor common carriers who are authorized to transport paper and paper products from origin points in Wisconsin to destination points in Illinois or Iowa similar to those which would be served by the merged Schneider and Packer City operations authorized by the Commission. They challenge approval of the merged authorities which would combine \u2014 without imposition of a tacking restriction \u2014 at their common point of DePere, Wisconsin, Schneider\u2019s previously held authority to transport paper and paper products from the Wisconsin points of Peshtigo, Port Edwards (which includes Nekoosa and Wisconsin Rapids), Kaukauna (which includes Kimberly), Appleton, Neenah, and Menasha, with the Packer City authority to transport the same commodities from DePere to all of Illinois and the eastern half of Iowa. A tacking restriction would prohibit the single line movement of paper and paper products from Schneider origin points to Packer City destination points. Such movements would require joint line service by Schneider and other authorized carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Plaintiffs contend that the record contains no substantial evidence to support a finding that either Schneider or Packer City had participated in paper commerce from and to the points involved. They claim that consistency with the public interest, a condition for approval of operational mergers incidental to acquisitions under Section 5(2) (a) and (b) of the Act, Section 5(2) (a) and (b), Title 49 U.S.C.A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> would require a showing of public need \u2014 not made in this case\u2014 for reactivation of dormant rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Review of the record discloses that Packer City transported numerous shipments of paper and paper products and other commodities by single line service to and from Shawano and the DePere area to Illinois and Iowa. Further, Pack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>er City participated in a limited number of interline shipments of paper and paper products originating at Appleton, Men-asha, and Neenah, Wisconsin, destined for points in Illinois and the eastern half of Iowa by interlining with another carrier, Mrs. Harry H. Long, doing business as Harry H. Long Moving and Storage (hereinafter referred to as \u201cLong\u201d), the originating carrier. Long\u2019s movements in these shipments were by lease of equipment and driver of Packer City. Seven of the shipments took place before negotiations commenced between Schneider and Packer City on May 1, 1963; twelve occurred during the subsequent period, prior to date of execution of the contract between these parties on July 29, 1963; and eight in the period between date of contract and assumption of control by Schneider in November 1963.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Although the documentary proof concerning the lease arrangements with Long and the interline shipments in question may be open to question, other evidence suffices to establish that Packer City utilized its rights. Representatives of plaintiffs testified to their personal knowledge of the Long-Packer City interline service. They considered Packer City a competitor in the paper and paper product traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Activity under rights does not require a showing that the carrier served all points within its authority. Black Ball Freight Service v. United States, 223 F.Supp. 191, 196 (S.D.Idaho 1963); and see, United States v. Carolina Freight Carriers Corp., 315 U.S. 475, 480, 481, 62 S.Ct. 722, 86 L.Ed. 971 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">There is substantial evidence of record that Packer City utilized its rights. The Commission, not the court, passes on the credibility of the evidence and the weight to be accorded thereto. Alabama Highway Express, Inc. v. United States, 241 F.Supp. 290, 295 (N.D. Ala.1965), aff\u2019d 382 U.S. 106, 86 S.Ct. 255, 15 L.Ed.2d 190. Whether or not this evidence constitutes a sufficient showing of activity under all the circumstances of the case is a question for the particular knowledge and expertise of the Commission which has wide discretion in the determination of consistency with the public interest under Section 5 of the Act, Section 5, Title 49 U.S.C.A. McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, 321 U.S. 67, 87, 64 S.Ct. 370, 88 L.Ed. 544 (1944); Ratner v. United States, 162 F.Supp. 518 (S.D.Ill.1957) aff\u2019d 356 U.S. 368, 78 S.Ct. 913, 2 L.Ed.2d 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Plaintiffs contend that approval of the acquisition without imposition of a restriction against tacking would have a material, adverse effect on their competitive status. They admit that they have been subject to the competition of the Long-Packer City interline service in the past. If a tacking restriction were imposed, they would still face the competition of Schneider interline service together with another authorized carrier. The record shows no probative evidence from which it may be concluded that substitution of single line for joint line service would cause additional injury to plaintiffs. The Commission took note of the capacities, operations, and competitive position of plaintiffs and concluded that they would be well able to stand any augmented competition that might result from the acquisition and unrestricted combination of operating rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">Orders of the Commission may not be set aside by reviewing courts if they are within the Commission\u2019s statutory powers and are supported by substantial evidence. Schultz v. United States, 59 F.Supp. 338, 341 (W.D.Wis. 1945); McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, 321 U.S. 67, 87, 88, 64 S.Ct. 370, 88 L.Ed. 544 (1944); and see, Seaboard Air Line Railroad Co. v. United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>382 U.S. 154, 157, 86 S.Ct. 277, 15 L.Ed. 2d 223 (1965). Plaintiffs have failed to show that the Commission abused its discretion in the determination that the transaction was consistent with the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The order of the Commission is hereby approved.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-15\">. By application filed October 7, 1963, authority was sought for the acquisition by Schneider Transport &amp; Storage, Inc. of control of Packer City Transit Line, Inc., through purchase of its outstanding capital stock; for the merger into the former of the operating rights and property of the latter for ownership, management, and operation; and for the acquisition by Al J. Schneider, Agnes Schneider, and Donald J. Schneider of control of the operating rights and property through the transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b298-5\">. Schneider operates as a motor common carrier, over regular routes, of canned or prepared foodstuffs, from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Green Bay, Wisconsin, serving no intermediate points, and, over irregular routes, of (a) paper and paper products, between Port Edwards, Peshtigo, Green Bay, DePere, Kaukauna, Appleton, Menasha, Neenah, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, (b) paper and paper articles from Manitowoc, Wisconsin, to Menominee, Michigan, and (c) wet lapwood pulp, including ground pulp, sanitary paper tissues moving in parent rolls, and materials, equipment, and supplies used in the manufacture of those commodities, between Cheboygan, Michigan, and Green Bay, Wisconsin.</p>\n<p id=\"Al6\">Packer operates as a motor common carrier, in interstate or foreign commerce, pursuant to certificates issued in Nos. MC-123400 and MC-123400 (Sub-No. 1) of various specifed commodities, over irregular routes, including those detailed in the opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\">. \u201c\u00a7 5, par.
