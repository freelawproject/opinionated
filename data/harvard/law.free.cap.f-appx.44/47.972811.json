The district court sentenced appellant to concurrent 108-month prison terms on the distribution counts and a consecutive 84-month term on the firearm count, followed by 8 years supervised release. Counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing for reversal that the district court erred in sentencing appellant for brandishing \u2014 rather than merely possessing \u2014 the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">We conclude that, based on the testimony of an undercover agent at sentencing, the district court correctly sentenced Piza-no-Cornego for brandishing a firearm. <em>See United States v. Carlson, </em>217 F.3d 986, 987-89 (8th Cir.2000), <em>cert, denied, </em>531 U.S. 1095, 121 S.Ct. 822, 148 L.Ed.2d 706 (2001). We have also reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and have found no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-8\">.
