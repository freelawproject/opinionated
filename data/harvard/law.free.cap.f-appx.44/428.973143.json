Owens, a pro se prisoner, seeks a certificate of appealability from the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for habeas relief. Owens pled guilty and was convicted of Feloniously Carrying a Weapon, After Former Conviction <em>of </em>Two or More Felonies, and he received a twenty-year prison sentence. After the statutory period for withdrawing his guilty plea had expired, Owens filed a petition for state post-conviction relief, asserting three grounds for relief: (1) denial of a direct appeal through no fault of his own; (2) denial of his right to counsel as a result of a conflict of interest; and (3) denial of his due process and equal protection rights by enhancement of his sentence. <em>Owens v. State, </em>No. PC-2001-704, slip op. at 1 (OMa.Crim.App. Aug. 17, 2001). The OMahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA) denied relief, <em>id. </em>at 4, rejecting Owens\u2019s first ground on the merits and the second and third grounds as proeedurally barred. The provisions of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) apply to this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">As to the first and third grounds, we deny a certificate of appealability substantially for the reasons given by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">In his second ground for relief, Owens argues that he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel when his attorney \u201centiced\u201d him into pleading guilty by stating that if he did not accept the offer the prosecutor would withdraw from plea negotiations and \u201cpick a redneck jury.\u201d (Aplt.B.10.) Owens argues that such enticement amounts to a conflict of interest. The OCCA did not consider the merits of this claim because it concluded that this claim was proeedurally barred because it was not raised on direct appeal. The district court denied habeas relief on this claim, reasoning that it was proeedurally barred because \u201cthe Petitioner was aware of the factual basis for this claim, and could have raised it as a ground for withdrawal of his plea.\u201d (Slip op. at 2 citing <em>English v. Cody, </em>146 F.3d 1257, 1264 (10th Cir.1998).) The district court concluded alternatively that this claim fails on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">We assume, for purposes of this opinion, that OMahoma\u2019s procedural bar of this claim is not adequate to bar our consideration of this claim, and therefore that our review of its merits is de novo. <em>See Johnson v. Gibson, </em>169 F.3d 1239, 1252 (10th Cir.1999) (deciding petitioner\u2019s claim on the merits after assuming that claim is not proeedurally barred). We conclude that Owens has failed to demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Fields v. Gibson, </em>277 F.3d 1203, 1216 (10th Cir. 2002) (holding that counsel did not render deficient performance in convincing the pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>titioner to plead guilty, because counsel \u201cdid not coerce Fields but merely \u2018strongly urged\u2019 him to do what they thought was in his best interest\u201d). Owens alleges only that counsel advised him that, if he rejected the plea offer, the prosecution would not make other offers and that the jury composition would be unfavorable. Because such advice plainly does not amount to coercion, <em>see id. </em>at 1210, 1212-14 (finding no coercion where counsel \u201cpulled out all the stops\u201d to convince her client to plead guilty, telling her client that if he did not plead guilty he would be sentenced to death, whereas if he pled guilty he very likely would not, and enlisting family members to urge him to plead guilty), Owens\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Liberally construed, Owens\u2019s petition also argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that Owens was ineligible for the twenty-year sentence he received. We assume for purposes of this appeal that this claim was exhausted and that Oklahoma\u2019s procedural bar is not adequate to foreclose our de novo consideration of this claim. Owens was sentenced under 21 O.S. \u00a7 51(B), which provided a sentence of \u201cnot less than\u201d twenty years for \u201c[ejvery person who, having twice been convicted of felony offenses, commits a third ... felony offense[ ] within ten (10) years of the date following the completion of the execution of the sentence.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Owens contends that counsel should have argued that \u00a7 51(B) did not apply to him because he had not yet completed his term of imprisonment on his prior felony convictions. We find no ineffective assistance of counsel. Owens\u2019s eligibility for \u00a7 51(B) enhancement began after he was \u201ctwice ... convicted of felony offenses.\u201d <em>See Kirken-dall v. State, </em>725 P.2d 882, 884 (Okla.Crim. App.1986) (\u201cWhen an appeal has not been perfected within six months of the judgment and sentence as provided by law, that judgment and sentence may be used to enhance punishment in a subsequent trial under 21 O.S.1981, \u00a7 51.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Contrary to Owens\u2019s present argument, the statutory phrase \u201cwithin ten (10) years of the date following the completion of the execution of the sentence\u201d describes only the end point, and not the starting point, of \u00a7 51(B) eligibility. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s decision not to challenge Owens\u2019s \u00a7 51(B) eligibility was not deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">For the foregoing reasons, a certificate of appealability is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-11\"> After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This Order and Judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-5\">. 21 O.S. \u00a7 51 was repealed effective July 1, 1999 (Owens was sentenced in April, 2000) and replaced with 21 O.S. \u00a7 51.1. The new \u00a7 51.1(B) is substantially identical in all relevant respects to the provision under which Owens was sentenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-19\">.
