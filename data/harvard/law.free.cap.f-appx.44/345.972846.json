LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b381-16\">Pro se petitioner Kenneth Brown, an Oklahoma state prisoner, seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-17\">We have reviewed the record on appeal and conclude that the district court did not fully explore whether Brown was entitled to equitable tolling of the one-year period of limitations imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). On remand, the district court should consider whether the refiling of Brown\u2019s habeas petition pri- or to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Duncan v. Walker, </em>533 U.S. 167, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001), merits the application of equitable tolling to his case. <em>See Hall v. Scott, </em>No. 01-7156, 2002 U.S.App. LEXIS 11389, at *9-*10 (10th Cir. June 12, 2002). In addition, the district court should apply the \u201cprisoner\u2019s mailbox rule\u201d in determining the dates Brown\u2019s habeas petitions were filed with the court. <em>See id. </em>at *2 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-20\">Having concluded that Brown has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, his application for a certificate of appealability pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) is GRANTED, the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus as time-barred is REVERSED, and this matter is REMANDED for reconsideration of whether equitable tolling is warranted. Brown\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-18\">The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The Court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
