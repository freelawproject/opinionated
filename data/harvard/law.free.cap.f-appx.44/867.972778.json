We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-24\">Bird contends that the district court committed error by including her juvenile convictions in its calculation of her criminal history score. Specifically, Bird argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>that inclusion of her juvenile convictions violates the Sentencing Commission\u2019s statutory directive to remove sentencing disparity pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991(b)(1)(B). Because this objection was not raised before the sentencing court, we review for plain error, <em>see United States v. Payne, </em>944 F.2d 1458, 1463 (9th Cir.1991), and find none.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">For each of the drug trafficking counts to which she pleaded guilty, Bird was exposed to a 120 month minimum sentence. Because the district court departed downward and sentenced Bird to only 37 months for each drug trafficking violation, well below the guideline range even for a defendant with a criminal history score of I, Bird cannot show that her substantial rights were affected by the district court\u2019s calculation of her criminal history score. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b903-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
