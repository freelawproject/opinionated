We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-24\">Ms. Glover claimed disability due to pain in her right elbow, left leg, and back. Her claims were denied initially and on reconsideration by the agency. Subsequently, the administrative law judge (ALJ), after a hearing in which appellant was represented by counsel, denied her claims based on a determination that she could perform other work than her prior employment, which other work exists within the national economy. That ALJ decision became the final decision of the Commissioner when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the appeals council denied Ms. Glover\u2019s request for review. On appeal to the district court, the parties stipulated that a final decision should be made by the magistrate judge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636 and Fed.R.Civ.P. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Magistrate Judge Ray made a careful review of the record and determined that the ALJ\u2019s specific finding is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole that Ms. Glover could perform a range of light work that exists in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">On appeal, Ms. Glover contends that the ALJ did not properly shift the burden of proof to the agency to show that she could do other work in the national economy and that the ALJ did not properly evaluate her subjective complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">We reject these contentions as without substantial merit and affirm substantially on the basis of the magistrate judge\u2019s well-reasoned opinion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-25\">. The Honorable J. Thomas Ray, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
