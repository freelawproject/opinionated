We have jurisdiction under 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(a) (incorporating into the Black Lung Benefits Act the appeal provisions of the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. 921(c)). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Donna Floyd (\u201cFloyd\u201d) gave birth to her third child, Arnold Dustin Davis (\u201cDustin\u201d), on February 14, 1989. Floyd was not married at the time, and no father was listed on the boy\u2019s original birth certificate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to Floyd, Dustin was conceived approximately two to three months after she separated from Tommy Walters (\u201cWalters\u201d), the man with whom she had been living since sometime in 1985. During the months that she was not living with Walters, Floyd occasionally slept with Clarence Davis (\u201cDavis\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">Floyd reunited with Walters some months after Dustin was conceived. At the time, both Walters and Davis knew that Floyd was pregnant, and both assumed that Davis was the father. Floyd married Walters on November 11, 1989, nine months after Dustin was born.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-14\">Davis worked as a coal miner from 1968 until 1987. The petitioner, Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company (\u201cTennessee Consolidated\u201d), was Davis\u2019s employer for most of those years. As a result of his employment in the nation\u2019s coal mines, Davis contracted a severe chronic respiratory disease that was diagnosed as coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis. The disease ultimately caused Davis to become totally disabled within the meaning of the Black Lung Benefits Act, making him eligible to receive black lung benefits effective in January of 1991, payable by Tennessee Consolidated. Davis was paid augmented benefits on behalf of three minor children\u2014 not including Dustin \u2014 from January, 1991, until July, 1993; and he was paid augmented benefits on behalf of two minor children \u2014 again not including Dustin \u2014 from August, 1993, until August, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-15\">Sometime in 1992, perhaps 1993, after Walters and Floyd again separated, Floyd was jailed for forgery. Three of her children, including Dustin, were placed in foster care during her incarceration. While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Floyd was in prison, Davis sought to legitimate Dustin as his son and to gain custody of him. His efforts \u2014 in which Floyd joined \u2014 resulted in a legitimation order entered on August 26, 1994, by the Juvenile Court of Bledsoe County, providing that Davis was Dustin\u2019s biological father and that Dustin was Davis\u2019s legitimate son. Dustin thereafter lived with Davis until Davis\u2019s death on September 23, 1996. Despite the legitimation order, Davis never sought to have his black lung benefits augmented on behalf of Dustin.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">On November 12, 1996, Charles Davis (\u201cCharles\u201d), a surviving minor son of Clarence and Kathy Bell Davis, filed a claim for survivor\u2019s benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act. As directed, Charles listed on his claim form the names of Davis\u2019s survivors, albeit his list did not include Dustin\u2019s name. On October 29, 1997, Tennessee Consolidated agreed to pay benefits to Charles, effective upon Davis\u2019s death on September 23,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">On October 23, 1997, the district director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (\u201cOWCP\u201d) received a letter from Floyd stating that Dustin was fathered by Davis and that Dustin should be added \u201cto his father\u2019s claim.\u201d J.A. at 54. On December 31, 1997, the district director issued a show cause order granting all parties thirty days to admit evidence why black lung benefits should not be awarded to Arnold Dustin Davis. In that order, the district director stated he was \u201cof the opinion that the documentation provided by the claimant constitutes sufficient evidence of the eligibility of Arnold Dustin Davis for black lung benefits on the record of Clarence Davis.\u201d J.A. at 51. When Tennessee Consolidated failed to respond to the show cause order, the district director entered a proposed decision and order stating: \u201c[B]y choosing not to respond to the order to show cause issued on December 31, 1997, the responsible operator, Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company, has tacitly accepted liability for the payment of benefits in this claim, and this proposed decision and order will constitute an award of benefits.\u201d J.A. at 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">Tennessee Consolidated thereafter requested a hearing before the Office of Administrative Law Judges. The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) to whom the case was referred found that Donna Floyd\u2019s informal request for benefits could not be accepted as a claim, and because no formal claim had ever been filed on behalf of Arnold Dustin Davis, he had no jurisdiction over the boy\u2019s request for benefits. The case was remanded to the district director with instructions to provide Arnold Dustin Davis with the opportunity to file a prescribed claim form.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">Floyd filed a formal claim on behalf of Dustin on September 3, 1998, and the case was returned to the Office of Administrative Law Judges for hearing. Before a hearing was held, Tennessee Consolidated moved to compel Dustin to submit to DNA testing in order to determine his paternity. The ALJ denied Tennessee Consolidated\u2019s motion by order dated February 1, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">A hearing was held before the ALJ on February 25, 1999, and a decision and order granting benefits was entered on July 22, 1999. The ALJ found that Dustin qualified as the surviving child of Clarence Davis pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.208(a) and (d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the ALJ found that the Juvenile Court of Bledsoe County had earlier granted the joint petition for legitimation filed by Davis and Floyd, had de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>creed that Davis was the father of Dustin, and had granted Davis custody of the boy. The ALJ rejected Tennessee Consolidated\u2019s argument that the order of legitimation was procured by fraud because \u2014 she said \u2014 Tennessee Consolidated had not pleaded fraud with particularity, rendering its contention regarding fraud to be no more than \u201cmere speculation and supposition.\u201d App. at 28. The ALJ also made clear that she found no reason \u201cto doubt the genuineness of the actions of the decedent, Clarence Davis, or the very frank, and credible testimony of Claimant\u2019s mother, Donna Floyd .\u201d App. at 29. Alternatively, the ALJ held that Tennessee Consolidated could not collaterally attack the state court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">On Tennessee Consolidated\u2019s appeal of the ALJ\u2019s order, the Benefits Review Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) both affirmed the ALJ\u2019s finding that Dustin was Davis\u2019s \u201csurviving dependent\u201d for purposes of the Black Lung Benefits Act and also affirmed the ALJ\u2019s denial of Tennessee Consolidated\u2019s request for DNA blood-testing. The Board rejected the ALJ\u2019s finding that Tennessee Consolidated could not \u2014 as a matter of law \u2014 collaterally attack the state court order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Board nonetheless found substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Tennessee Consolidated failed to proffer, much less establish, any basis upon which to collaterally attack the order of legitimation. On February 14, 2001, Tennessee Consolidated filed a timely notice of appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The court of appeals must affirm the Board\u2019s decision if the Bo\u00e1rd has not committed any legal error or exceeded its statutory scope of review of the ALJ\u2019s determinations. <em>Glen Coal Co. v. Seals, </em>147 F.3d 502, 510 (6th Cir.1998). Like th\u00e9 Board, this court reviews the ALJ\u2019s determinations only to decide whether they are supported by substantial evidence and are in accordance with the applicable law. This court does not reweigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">The Black Lung Benefits Act provides benefits to the \u201csurviving dependents\u201d of miners who die due to pneumoconiosis. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901(a). To qualify as a \u201csurviving dependent,\u201d a claimant must be \u201ca child or a step-child [of the deceased miner] who is ... unmarried; and ... under eighteen years of age.\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 902(a)(1) and (g). Under the applicable federal regulations, a claimant qualifies as a \u201cchild\u201d of a deceased miner if (1) \u201c[t]he courts of the State in which the beneficiary is domiciled [at the time of death] ... would find, under the law they would apply, that the [claimant] is the beneficiary\u2019s child\u201d; or (2) the claimant \u201cwould, under State law, have the same right as a child to share in the beneficiary\u2019s intestate personal property.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 725.208(a) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-13\">While the parties in this case dispute whether Dustin should be considered Davis\u2019s \u201cchild\u201d for purposes of the Black Lung Benefits Act, they agree that Dustin is unmarried and under the age of eighteen. They also agree that Tennessee law governs the dispute because Davis was domiciled in the State of Tennessee at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-14\">Before 1997, Tennessee\u2019s legitimation statute, T.C.A. \u00a7 36-2-201 (repealed 1997), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>provided men with a vehicle for obtaining judicial recognition of then* parental rights as a child\u2019s biological father. Similarly, before 1997, Tennessee\u2019s paternity statute, T.C.A. \u00a7 36-2-101 (repealed 1997), provided women with a vehicle to obtain a judicial declaration regarding the identity of their child\u2019s father. Unlike the paternity statute, the purpose of which was to require the biological father to support the child, \u201cthe purpose of the legitimation statute [wa]s to legitimate a child not already recognized as such by the law.\u201d <em>Bass v. Norman, </em>C.A. No. 164, 1989 WL 157884, at *3 (Tenn.Ct.App. Dec.29,1989).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Until 1996, legitimation proceedings could not be filed without the mother\u2019s consent. Because they were essentially uncontested, legitimation proceedings were less formal than paternity proceedings. <em>White v. Armstrong, </em>No. 01A01-9712-JV-00735, 1999 WL 33085, at *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan 27, 1999). Despite the informality of the proceedings and absent any improprieties or errors in those proceedings, a legitimation decree was recognized by the Tennessee courts as a valid adjudication of a child\u2019s legitimacy. Indeed, the Supreme Court of Tennessee long ago explained that \u201cthe plain purport of the [legitimation] decree, authorized by the act of 1805, was to render an illegitimate child a legitimate, and to place him upon the same footing as if born in lawful wedlock. He was thereby placed with the state and condition of a legitimate, and becomes the lawful child and prospective heir of the natural father.\u201d <em>McKamie v. Baskerville, </em>86 Tenn. 459, 7 S.W. 194 (Tenn.1888); <em>see also Helms v. Elliott, </em>89 Tenn. 446, 14 S.W. 930, 931 (Tenn.1890) (recognizing that \u201c[t]he event of legitimation makes the legitimated person, to all intents and purposes, the lawful child of the legitimating parents\u201d). More recently, the Supreme Court of Tennessee has held, pursuant to section 31-2-105(a)(2)(B) of the state code, that \u201cif there has been an adjudication of paternity prior to the death of the father, the child born out of wedlock inherits by intestate succession as a legitimate child, and title to the decedent\u2019s real property vests in that child immediately upon death of the decedent. No further adjudication is necessary to establish the child\u2019s right to inherit.\u201d <em>Bilbrey v. Smithers, </em>937 S.W.2d 803, 807 (Tenn.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">In 1994, when Dustin was legitimated, the Tennessee legitimation statute provided that \u201c[w]hen ... the relationship of parent and child is established between the petitioner and the child named in the petition and an order of legitimation has been entered ... the child shall be a legitimate child of the petitioner for the purpose of inheriting from the petitioner as if born to the petitioner in lawful wedlock.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 36-2-206 (1994). For purposes of intestate succession specifically, the applicable Tennessee statute provided that a person born out of wedlock is considered a child of the father if \u201c[t]he paternity is established by an adjudication before the death of the father or is established thereafter by clear and convincing proof.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 31-2-105 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">The Tennessee Supreme Court has said that clear and convincing evidence must \u201cproduce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be established.\u201d <em>Fruge v. Doe, </em>952 S.W.2d 408, 412 n. 2 (Tenn.1997). Parentage may be proved using several different types of evidence. In addition to direct evidence of paternity through blood tests, the courts may consider (1) the declarations and conduct of the child\u2019s biological mother; (2) acknowledgment by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>father; (3) family resemblance; and (4) evidence concerning access, opportunity, and capacity to have children. <em>McDowell v. Boyd, </em>No. 01A01-9509-CH-00413, 1997 WL 749470, at *3 (Tenn.Ct.App. Dec.5, 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">In <em>McDowell, </em>the evidence revealed that (1) the putative father, David Boyd (\u201cBoyd\u201d), was involved in a sexual relationship with the mother before the child\u2019s birth; (2) the mother repeatedly told her son and others that Boyd was her son\u2019s father; (3) Boyd acknowledged his son by embracing him and giving him a gift upon the son\u2019s graduation from high school; (4) Boyd acknowledged to friends that the boy was his son, although he also told his wife and other family members that the boy was not his son; and (5) the boy and Boyd had common facial characteristics and mannerisms. The Tennessee court determined that such evidence constituted clear and convincing proof of Boyd\u2019s paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In <em>Majors v. Smith, </em>776 S.W.2d 538 (Tenn.Ct.App.1989), an appellate court found clear and convincing evidence of J.D. Smith\u2019s paternity where (1) the mother testified that her daughter was Smith\u2019s child born out-of-wedlock; (2) the mother testified that Smith paid medical bills and regularly gave her money for the support of the child; (3) a number of witnesses testified that Smith had acknowledged to them that he was the child\u2019s father; and (4) the child testified that she and the deceased had a close personal relationship, that he supported her, took her to visit relatives and attended basketball games where she played. Neither the trial court nor the appellate court was persuaded that the testimony of several defense witnesses \u2014 to the effect that the decedent had either told them that he had no children or had never mentioned to them that he had a child \u2014 was insufficient to cast doubt on the mother\u2019s/daughter\u2019s evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Applying Tennessee law, the ALJ in this case determined that Dustin was the child of Davis not only because the Bledsoe County Juvenile Court\u2019s legitimation order constituted \u201cclear and unequivocal proof that the State of Tennessee, under the laws that it would apply, has determined that Clarence Davis [wa]s the father of Claimant,\u201d J.A. at 27, but also because she otherwise found clear and convincing proof of Davis\u2019s paternity both in the record and in Floyd\u2019s \u201cvery credible\u201d testimony at the hearing. J.A. at 29. Indeed, the evidence before the ALJ revealed that, from the time of Dustin\u2019s birth, Davis acknowledged Dustin as his son; that Davis told his mother, his many siblings, and his other children that Dustin was his son; that Davis often bought food, clothes and other items for Dustin because he loved Dustin; that Floyd told her parents as well as Tommy Walters that Dustin was probably Davis\u2019s son; that Walters himself thought that Dustin was Davis\u2019s son; that Davis sought custody of Dustin, not Floyd\u2019s other children, when Floyd was incarcerated for forgery; that Davis tried to talk Floyd into legitimizing Dustin many times before Floyd was incarcerated; that Davis had custody of and supported Dustin for approximately two years before he died; that Dustin called Davis \u201cDaddy\u201d, albeit he also called Walters \u201cDaddy\u201d; that, when Dustin asked Floyd and Davis who his daddy was, both Floyd and Davis told him that Davis was his father; and that Dustin looks like Davis\u2019s sister, Cindy. Based upon the evidence presented to her, the ALJ concluded that, whether or not Dustin was the biological child of Davis, Tennessee law gave Dustin the same right as a child to share in Davis\u2019s intestate personal property, and \u2014 for that reason if for no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>other \u2014 Dustin qualified as Davis\u2019s \u201cchild\u201d for purposes of the Black Lung Benefits Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">We find no basis in the record for disturbing the Board\u2019s affirmance of the ALJ\u2019s award of benefits to Dustin. There is no suggestion that the Board exceeded its statutory scope of review of the ALJ\u2019s determinations, and we find no error of law. Furthermore, like the Board, we find that the ALJ\u2019s determinations as to paternity were supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">We reject Tennessee Consolidated's argument that the ALJ relied exclusively on the Bledsoe County Juvenile Court\u2019s legitimation order. She did not. As she stated in her order, \u201cthis court in its own review of the record has not found any reason to doubt the genuineness of the actions of the decedent, Clarence Davis, or the very frank, and credible testimony of Claimant\u2019s mother, Donna Floyd, in this proceeding.\u201d J.A. at 29. Indeed, without the legitimation order, the evidence before the ALJ was at least as strong as, if not stronger than, the evidence of paternity found to be clear and convincing in <em>McDowell </em>and <em>Majors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\"><em>To he </em>sure, the evidence did not include the results of a DNA test, which \u2014 perhaps \u2014 would have conclusively established whether Davis was or was not Dustin\u2019s biological father. At the time of the legitimation proceeding, neither parent requested such a test, both having acknowledged Davis\u2019s parentage. Moreover, Tennessee Consolidated did not request such a test when first given the opportunity to do so. In fact, when Tennessee Consolidated failed altogether to respond to the district director\u2019s show cause order, granting all parties thirty days to submit evidence why black lung benefits should not be awarded to Dustin, the district director concluded that Tennessee Consolidated had tacitly accepted liability for payment of benefits, and he entered an order to that effect. Only later, after Tennessee Consolidated appealed the district director\u2019s order and the case was remanded to the district director for lack of jurisdiction, did Tennessee Consolidated request DNA testing. The ALJ denied the request, noting\u2014 among other things \u2014 that DNA testing was not necessary to a determination of Dustin\u2019s eligibility or entitlement to benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act, given that eligibility could be established by one who was not a child of the deceased miner but who nonetheless had \u201cthe same right as a child to share in the beneficiary\u2019s intestate personal property.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.208(d). The Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s denial of Tennessee Consolidated\u2019s motion for DNA testing, finding no abuse of discretion on the ALJ\u2019s part where \u201cTennessee Consolidated did not proffer evidence to support and/or demonstrate that its request for an examination [wa]s reasonable under the circumstances and [wa]s based on a valid question necessitating the examination, but merely asserted its unsubstantiated opinion that an examination was necessary.\u201d J.A. at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">Like the Board, we are not persuaded that Tennessee Consolidated was \u201centitled\u201d to an order compelling DNA testing in this case. Tennessee Consolidated cites to a Tennessee statute, T.C.A. \u00a7 24-7-112, governing the admissibility of paternity tests in state court proceedings; however, the admissibility of evidence in this case is not governed by Tennessee law but is, instead, governed by federal law. The Board determined \u2014 and we agree\u2014 that, as a matter of federal law, it was within the ALJ\u2019s discretion to refuse Tennessee Consolidated\u2019s request for DNA testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Furthermore, the case cited by Tennessee Consolidated, <em>White v. Armstrong, </em>Case No. 01A01-9712-JV-00735, 1999 WL 33085, at *5 (Tenn.Ct.App. Jan.27, 1999), does not support its argument for DNA testing. In <em>White v. Armstrong, </em>a Tennessee appellate court held that a father, who at one time agreed to the entry of a legitimation order, was later entitled to post-judgment relief based upon genetic testing which excluded the possibility that he was the child\u2019s biological father. The court in <em>White v. Armstrong </em>did not hold that an outsider to a legitimation proceeding was entitled to use the results of genetic testing to challenge a legitimation order. Nor did the <em>White </em>court hold that an outsider to a legitimation proceeding could use the results of genetic testing to negate the effect of the Tennessee law which provides that, for purposes of intestate succession, a person born out of wedlock shall be considered a child of the father if \u201c[t]he paternity is established by an adjudication before the death of the father or is established thereafter by clear and convincing proof.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 31-2-105 (1994). As the ALJ correctly noted, the Black Lung Benefits Act does not require a claimant to be the biological child of the putative father; it requires only that the claimant \u201chave the same right as a child to share in the beneficiary\u2019s intestate personal property.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.208(d). Because Tennessee Consolidated has cited no authority to suggest that Dustin would NOT \u201chave the same right as a child to share in [Davis\u2019s] intestate personal property\u201d even if genetic testing now proved that Dustin was not Davis\u2019s biological child, this court cannot say that the ALJ abused her discretion in denying Tennessee Consolidated\u2019s motion to compel DNA testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Having concluded that the ALJ\u2019s determinations were supported by substantial evidence and that the Board committed neither legal error nor exceeded its scope of review, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-11\">. The name given to Dustin at his birth was Arnold Dustin Johnson. Johnson was Floyd\u2019s maiden name. A judge later ordered that Dustin\u2019s last name be changed to Davis and that his birth certificate be changed to list Davis as his father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\">. The ALJ also relied on section 725.208(f)(1). The Board, however, correctly determined that such reliance was misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b702-7\">. We do not decide whether the Board was correct in rejecting the ALJ\u2019s finding that Tennessee Consolidated could not collaterally attack the state court order because that issue is not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b703-6\">.
