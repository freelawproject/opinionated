Having carefully reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm. Even assuming Grady had a legal basis for filing these motions (he already has had a direct criminal appeal and has brought a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion), he failed to set forth a particularized need for disclosure of grand jury materials, <em>see United States v. Broyles, </em>37 F.3d 1314, 1318 (8th Cir.1994), <em>cert, denied, </em>514 U.S. 1056, 115 S.Ct. 1441, 131 L.Ed.2d 320 (1995), <em>and </em>all of Grady\u2019s arguments in the proceedings underlying these appeals raise issues that were or should have been raised on direct appeal, <em>cf. Thompson v. United States, </em>7 F.3d 1377, 1379 (8th Cir. 1993) (per curiam), <em>cert, denied, </em>511 U.S. 1010,114 S.Ct. 1383,128 L.Ed.2d 58 (1994) and 511 U.S. 1038, 114 S.Ct. 1556, 128 L.Ed.2d 204 (1994); <em>Dall v. United States, </em>957 F.2d 571, 572 (8th Cir.1992) (per curiam). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Grady\u2019s motions for grand jury records and for the district court to recognize its jurisdiction to review his constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Accordingly we affirm, <em>see </em>8th Cir. R. 47B, and we deny Grady\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal with grand jury records.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-9\">. The Honorable Stephen N. Limbaugh, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
