R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-23\">Appellant Jeffrey Williams seeks to appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. To proceed on appeal before this court, appellant must obtain a certificate of appealability (COA), <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). Appellant sought a COA from the district court, which request was denied. Appellant reurges that motion here. A COA will not issue unless appellant makes \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). He can make this showing by demonstrating that the issues he seeks to raise are debatable among jurists of reason or deserving of further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Appellant seeks to raise six issues on appeal, all based on claims of ineffective assistance of both retained and appointed counsel in representing him on federal drug-related charges. Construing appellant\u2019s pro se pleadings liberally, see <em>Cummings v. Evans, </em>161 F.3d 610, 613 (10th Cir.1998), and after careful consideration of the proposed issues in light of applicable law, we conclude appellant has not met the standards for issuance of a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Appellant\u2019s motion for a COA is DENIED and this appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
