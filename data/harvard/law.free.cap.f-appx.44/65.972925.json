On appeal, Rogge argues the District Court erred in finding his \u00a7 2255 motion was successive and unauthorized because his prior filing was found to be a mislabeled 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. He argues he is entitled to relief on his motion because a defect in the indictment deprived the District Court of federal jurisdiction, and his trial counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-21\">We need not reach the more complicated issue of successiveness because the record plainly demonstrates that Rogge\u2019s motion was filed well beyond the one-year limitations period, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, with no applicable exception, <em>see United States v. Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (\u201c[Defects in an indictment do not deprive a court of its power to adjudicate a case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-24\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment dismissing Rogge\u2019s motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-16\">.
