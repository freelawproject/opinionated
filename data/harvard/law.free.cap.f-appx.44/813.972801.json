See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b849-18\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-19\">Hernandez first argues that the district court erred when it concluded that it did not have discretion to grant a 1-level departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. This provision does not contemplate or authorize such a departure. Because Hernandez was not qualified for a departure under \u00a7 3B1.2, the district court was also without discretion to consider his request for a departure pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-23\">Hernandez also claims that he is entitled to a departure under \u00a7 3E1.1, which requires a defendant to \u201cclearly demonstrate[ ] acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d Only in \u201crare situations [will] a defendant ... clearly demonstrate an acceptance of responsibility for his criminal conduct even though he exercises his constitutional right to a trial.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 2. Hernandez\u2019s inculpato-ry statements evince no contrition or remorse for his actions. <em>See United States v. Connelly, </em>156 F.3d 978, 982 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that \u201ca failure to demonstrate contrition and remorse weighs against a finding of acceptance of responsibility\u201d). Considering that \u201cthe sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 5, we cannot conclude that the district court clearly erred in denying a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-24\">Finally, Hernandez claims that he should be resentenced pursuant to <em>Ap-prendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). In <em>United States v. Nordby, </em>225 F.3d 1053, 1059 (9th Cir.2000) (overruled on other grounds), we held that, pursuant to <em>Ap-prendi, </em>an individual cannot be sentenced above the \u201cprescribed statutory maximum,\u201d which is the maximum punishm\u00e9nt to which the defendant could be exposed \u201csolely under the facts found by the jury.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) provides a maximum sentence of 20 years\u2019 incarceration and indefinite supervised release without regard to a finding of any particular drug amount. Because Hernandez\u2019s sentence of 235 months does not exceed the prescribed statutory maximum, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b849-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
