Hamby appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Hamby contends that the district court erred in concluding that there was sufficient evidence to support his first degree murder conviction and the attendant special circumstance finding because the prosecution did not prove the element of implied malice. He also seeks an evidentiary hearing to decide issues of fact underlying the finding of implied malice. Finally, in his supplemental reply brief, Hamby withdraws his previous agreement with the facts set forth by the district court and requests an evidentiary hearing to present new evidence of his innocence and to raise six arguments that are outside the scope of the certificate of appealability. We affirm the judgment of the district court and deny Hamby\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing on the newly raised issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">A. The Scope of the Panel\u2019s Review</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">The claims that appear in Hamby\u2019s supplemental reply brief are not properly before this court. Hamby raises them for the first time on appeal and failed to exhaust them in state court. <em>See Slaven v. American Trading Transp. Co., </em>146 F.3d 1066, 1069 (9th Cir.1998). We also deny Hamby\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing in order to raise these issues for the first time. <em>See Duncan v. Henry, </em>513 U.S. 364, 365-66,115 S.Ct. 887,130 L.Ed.2d 865 (1995). Moreover, the argument in Ham-by\u2019s pro se opening brief that the district court should have granted him an eviden-tiary hearing to introduce new evidence is not properly before us because it falls outside the scope of the certificate of ap-pealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">B. Sufficient Evidence Supports Ham-by\u2019s Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">The state court decision here was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat 1218 (April 24, 1996) (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). This court reviews de novo \u201cthe determination of what is \u2018clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u2019\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). <em>LaJoie v. Thompson, </em>217 F.3d 663, 668 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Hamby\u2019s conviction for first degree murder by means of a destructive device or explosive, CaLPenal Code \u00a7\u00a7 187, 189, and the attendant special circumstance finding did not violate his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process because there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the requisite element of \u201cmalice\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jackson v. Virgi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number><em>nia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>see also People v. Johnson, </em>26 Cal.3d 557, 162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 443, 606 P.2d 738 (1980) (harmonizing California law with the federal constitutional standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Implied malice exists when \u201cno considerable provocation appears, or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart.\u201d Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 188. Implied malice has a physical and a mental component. <em>People v. Nieto Benitez, </em>4 Cal.4th 91, 13 Cal. Rptr.2d 864, 840 P.2d 969, 977 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Hamby\u2019s conduct satisfies the physical component of the implied malice test because there was a \u201chigh degree of probability\u201d that placing the bomb where it was and leaving it there until the following afternoon would result in death. <em>See Ma-soner v. Thurman, </em>996 F.2d 1003, 1007 (9th Cir.1993). The unpredictability and \u201cinherently dangerous nature\u201d of explosives made death highly probable. <em>People v. Morse, 2 </em>Cal.App.4th 620, 3 Cal.Rptr.2d 343, 356 (1992). Furthermore, while the bomb site was not in a residential area, there was enough human activity in the area that a rational trier of fact could have found that Hamby placed the bomb in close proximity to people. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Hamby\u2019s subjective knowledge that the bomb was dangerous to others is sufficiently established by: (1) Jill Sinclair\u2019s question to Hamby about the likelihood of school children walking through the area, and (2) the existence of litter on the route to and from the bomb\u2019s location, permitting an inference that Hamby knew that others visited the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">Hamby\u2019s challenge to the special circumstance finding rests on his claim that the state did not establish implied malice. In light of our conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to support the implied malice element, the special circumstance finding was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">Because Hamby\u2019s conviction for first degree murder and the special circumstance finding were supported by substantial evidence as required by <em>Jackson, </em>the state court\u2019s decision was not contrary to clearly established Supreme Court law and must be affirmed. <em>See Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1153-54 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b915-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
