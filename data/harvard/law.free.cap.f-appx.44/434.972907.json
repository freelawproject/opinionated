McKAY, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">This is a pro se federal prisoner 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 appeal. Mr. Johnson was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. In his habeas appeal, Mr. Johnson alleges that his sentence is unconstitutional for six reasons, each of which the magistrate judge addressed in a well-reasoned Report and Recommendation. On appeal, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report denying the petition for relief. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and \u201clegal conclusions de novo.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Gibson, </em>173 F.3d 1278, 1282 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Appellant seeks a certificate of appeala-bility. In order for this court to grant a certificate of appealability, Petitioner must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To do so, Petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">We have carefully reviewed Petitioner\u2019s brief, the district court\u2019s disposition, the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, and the record on appeal. Nothing in the facts, the record on appeal, or Petitioner\u2019s brief raises an issue which meets our standards for the grant of a certificate of appealability. We conclude that we cannot say that reasonable jurists could debate whether \u201cthe petition should have been resolved in a different manner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-16\">Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
