R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">This is a pro se state prisoner \u00a7 1983 civil rights appeal. Mr. Harrison\u2019s spending at the prison was restricted to $7.00 per month of the $50.00 per month that he earns at his prison job because his account was in arrears. In his \u00a7 1983 complaint, Mr. Harrison claimed equal protection and Eighth Amendment violations and denial of access to the courts. The magistrate judge recommended that Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss be granted. After consideration of Mr. Harrison\u2019s objections and Defendants\u2019 response to the objections, the district court adopted the recommendation and dismissed the complaint. Mr. Harrison appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">We agree with the district court that Mr. Harrison\u2019s claims should be dismissed. Appellant agrees that his claims of Eighth Amendment violations fail \u201cbecause he has not alleged any \u2018wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain\u2019\u201d Order at 3 quoting Plaintiffs Objections at 5. Appellant also concedes his access to the courts claim because he admits that he cannot allege actual injury at this time. Additionally, we agree that the claims against Charles Ray should be dismissed with prejudice. Though Mr. Ray has not been served, Appellant \u201cmakes no distinct allegations against him which would suffice to keep any issue open awaiting possible service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Mr. Harrison\u2019s only viable claim on appeal is his equal protection claim that he is being treated differently than other inmates because he is indigent. Because Mr. Harrison is neither a member of a suspect class nor does he allege that a fundamental right has been burdened, Defendants\u2019 action must \u201conly bear a rational relation to some legitimate end.\u201d <em>White v. Colorado, </em>157 F.3d 1226, 1234 (10th Cir. 1998) (quotation omitted). \u201cReasonable regulations are necessary to balance the rights of prisoners with budgetary considerations.\u201d <em>Twyman v. Crisp, </em>584 F.2d 352, 359 (10th Cir.1978) (citation omitted). We agree with the district court\u2019s determination that \u201c[t]he limitation of plaintiffs spending is rationally related to a legitimate end.\u201d Order at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">After a thorough review of the briefs and the record and for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned February 15, 2002, Order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, we hold that no relief is available to Mr. Harrison pursuant to \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">The decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED. Appellant\u2019s Motion to proceed in forma \u25a0 pauperis on appeal is GRANTED. Appellant must continue making partial payments on court fees and costs previously assessed until such have been paid in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-27\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
