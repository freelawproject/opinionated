We sua sponte consider whether these appeals must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-23\">On January 3, 2002, the district court issued an order that construed a claim and held that the patent was infringed and invalid. The district court ordered that case closed, but later acknowledged that it had erred in closing the ease because there was a pending counterclaim regarding inequitable conduct. The district court determined that the counterclaim should be adjudicated and denied the parties\u2019 joint motion to enter an appealable judgment, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), regarding the claims related to infringement and invalidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-24\">In the recent letter to this court, the appellants state that they believe that the district court\u2019s previous order, closing the case but not disposing of a pending counterclaim regarding inequitable conduct, was appealable. We disagree. Pursuant to the express terms of Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), in the absence of a determination that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay and ... an express direction for the entry of judgment,\u201d any order or other form of decision, \u201chowever designated, which adjudicates fewer than all of the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties.... \u201d Thus, because the district court denied the parties\u2019 motion to direct the entry of judgment under this rule, there is no appealable judgment and the appeals filed by the parties must be dismissed, notwithstanding their desire to have their appeals heard. <em>Spraytex, Inc. v.
