We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s determination of subject matter jurisdiction, <em>United States ex rel. Aflatooni v. Kitsap Physicians Servs., </em>163 F.3d 516, 520 (9th Cir.1999), and for clear error its findings of fact relevant to that determination, <em>id. </em>at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">The district court correctly determined that Gilbert\u2019s complaint was based upon prior public disclosures, <em>see United States v. Alcan Elec. and Eng\u2019g, </em>197 F.3d 1014, 1018 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that information revealed in prior litigation is publicly disclosed), and that Gilbert was not the original source of information, <em>see Aflatooni, </em>163 F.3d at 526 (explaining that a relator lacks true knowledge of alleged wrongdoing when his allegations are based purely on speculation and conjecture). Ac-eordingly, the district court properly dismissed Gilbert\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Alcan, </em>197 F.3d at 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-14\">The district court properly denied Gilbert\u2019s motion for relief from judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(a); 60(b)(l)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"A-2\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
