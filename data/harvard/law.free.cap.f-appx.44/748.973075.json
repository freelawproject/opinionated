Mr. Proffit seeks leave to proceed without prepayment of fees, the district court having certified that his appeal was not taken in good faith. We grant Mr. Proffit leave to appeal in forma pauperis and leave to the district court the details of calculating the initial partial appellate filing fee, and the collection of the balance of the $105 appellate filing fee. <em>See Henderson v. Norris, </em>129 F.3d 481, 484-85 (8th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-17\">Further, we affirm the dismissal of all of Mr. Proffit\u2019s claims except for his allegations that defendants retaliated against him in various specified ways in connection with his lawsuit against prison officials. On remand, Mr. Proffit should be directed to amend his complaint to identify: (1) each person he is naming as a defendant; and (2) what retaliatory act each defendant took against him.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
