Nelson, </em>222 F.3d 545, 550-51 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (9th Cir.2000). However, George admits that the gun belonged to him, and the gun was found in his house in the same basement where he was cultivating marijuana. <em>See United States v. Kyllo, </em>37 F.3d 526, 531 (9th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Gillock, </em>886 F.2d 220, 223 (9th Cir.1989). Moreover, the district court discredited the testimony of his common law wife that she had hidden the gun from George years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>prior, and such credibility determinations are entitled to deference on appeal. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e); <em>United States v. Andra, </em>218 F.3d 1106, 1107 (9th Cir.2000). Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the district court erred. <em>See United States v. Parrilla, </em>114 F.3d 124, 126 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Similarly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to find that George carried his burden of establishing that it was \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that he possessed a weapon in connection with the offense. <em>See Nelson, </em>222 F.3d at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b288-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-29\">.
