FERC required PG&amp;E and Edison to provide a series of \u201cwholesale\u201d electrical interconnections to Laguna and to Fresno so that Laguna and Fresno could take advantage of a California retail access program and enhance competition in the market of electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-16\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to Section 813(b) of the Federal Power Act (\u201cFPA\u201d), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>8251(b) </em>and we affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the procedural and factual history of this case, we do not recount it here except as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-17\">As this case concerns the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the FPA, we will follow the framework enunciated in <em>Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>(1984). <em>Chevron </em>\u201cmandates that absent a clear expression of congressional intent to the contrary, courts should defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutory language.\u201d <em>Friends of Cowlitz v. FERC, </em>253 F.3d 1161, 1166 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also, City of Seattle v. FERC, </em>923 F.2d 713, 715 (9th Cir.1991) (court generally shows \u201cgreat deference\u201d to the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the law it is charged with administering).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Under FPA \u00a7 210(c), the Commission cannot grant an application for an order directing interconnection unless it is determined that such order (1) is in the public interest, (2) would either (A) encourage overall conservation of energy or capital, (B) optimize the efficiency of use of facilities and resources, or (C) improve the reliability of any electric utility system to which the order applies, and (3) meets the requirements of FPA \u00a7 212. The central issue in this case is whether the interconnection orders in question violate \u00a7 212, specifically \u00a7 212(h).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In its decision, the Commission ruled that \u00a7 212(h) presents no barrier to the Commission\u2019s order because \u00a7 212(h) only applies to requests for transmission and, since here the Commission was only ordering interconnection, \u00a7 212(h) is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">It is true that some provisions of \u00a7 212 do not apply to \u00a7 210 interconnection orders and only apply to FPA \u00a7 211 Commission orders (i.e. orders requiring the <em>transmission </em>of electrical power). However, Petitioners argue that the Commission\u2019s interpretation that \u00a7 212(h) does not apply to \u00a7 210 orders was unreasonable. In support, Petitioners point out that when Congress intended to limit a sub-section of \u00a7 212 to transmission orders, Congress expressly provided that the sub-section applies only to an order \u201cunder section 824j [\u00a7 211] of this title.\u201d <em>See </em>FPA \u00a7\u00a7 212(a), (c)(2)(B), (i)(2)(B), (i)(4), (j) and (k); 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824&amp;(a), (c)(2)(B), (i)(2)(B), (i)(4), (j) and (k). Petitioners reason that, since Congress failed to employ such a directive in \u00a7 212(h), it must have intended to not exempt interconnection requests (i.e. requests filed under \u00a7 210) from the requirements of \u00a7 212(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The Commission, however, points to the language of \u00a7 212(h), which states that \u201cNo order issued under this chapter shall be conditioned upon or require <em>the transmission of </em>electric energy ....\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824ft(h) (emphasis added). As this wording refers only to orders requiring transmission, the Commission reasoned that \u00a7 212(h) does not apply to requests that merely require an interconnection order.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">It is noteworthy that Congress omitted language in \u00a7 212(h) explicitly limiting that section to \u00a7 210 orders, yet used such language in other sections of \u00a7 212. <em>See </em>2A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.06 (6th ed. 2000 &amp; Supp. 2002) (\u201c[W]hen the legislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another, the court assumes different meanings were intended.\u201d). However, we have held that \u201ccanons of construction are mere aids to the determination of legislative intent\u201d and common sense must be the ultimate guide. <em>Polson Logging Co. v. U.S., </em>160 F.2d 712, 716 (9th Cir.1947). Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>\u00a7 212(h) specifically refers to \u201ctransmission,\u201d we cannot say that the Commission\u2019s interpretation (i.e. that \u00a7 212(h) only applies to transmission orders and not requests for interconnection) is unreasonable under <em>Chevron.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b207-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-7\">. Subsection 212(h) prohibits the Commission from ordering retail wheeling or sham wholesale transactions. Wheeling is the transmission of power across a utility secure territory. Retail wheeling is alternately defined as state-ordered transmission of power by utilities for other power suppliers or allowing a distant producer to use another company's network to reach retail customers directly</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-11\">. As to Petitioners\u2019 argument that the Commission did in fact order transmission as well as interconnection, we find such an assertion unsupported by the record. Indeed, a look at the IA reveals the following language: \"PG&amp;E has, and will have no obligation under this Agreement to supply District any wholesale electric power or any other electric services ....\u201d; \"Under this agreement, PG&amp;E does not undertake to provide or make available any transmission service, distribution service, or Ancillary service ... \u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
