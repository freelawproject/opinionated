Paalan\u2019s appeal because he has appealed from a nonfinal order. Paalan opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Paalan filed a complaint in the United States Court of Federal Claims alleging four claims for military back pay and other compensation pursuant to different theories based on various statutory, regulatory and constitutional provisions, and a claim for compensation for alleged takings under the Fifth Amendment. The United States moved to dismiss and Paalan moved for summary judgment and discovery. On March 4, 2002, the trial court granted the United States\u2019 motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part, denied Paalan\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and granted Paalan\u2019s motion for discovery in part. The trial court concluded, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">Because [the United States\u2019] motion to dismiss is granted only in part, [Paal-an\u2019s] claims survive as follows: (1) whether plaintiff received military pay pursuant to 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a)(1) and DODPM \u00a7 10317(d) between October 11, 1995, and November 28, 1995; and (2) whether the Government\u2019s continued retention of plaintiffs personal property, with the exception of his gun and ammunition, constitutes a compensable taking under the Fifth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">On April 22, 2002, Paalan filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">The United States argues that the Court of Federal Claim\u2019s order is nonfinal and not appealable because some of Paalan\u2019s back pay and takings claims remain pending before the Court of Federal Claims. We agree. Because the March 4, 2002 order disposed of only some of Paalan\u2019s claims, leaving other matters unadjudicated, the trial court\u2019s decision is not final and appealable. Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed. <em>Cf. Aleut Tribe v. United States, </em>702 F.2d 1015, 1020 (Fed.Cir.1983) (\u201cAn appeal from an order that disposes of only some claims of an action may <em>not </em>be made without waiting for a decision on the remainder of the case, unless the requirements of Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are met.\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b531-15\">(1) The United States\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-16\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-11\"> The court notes that Paalan's appeal could also be dismissed in light of his failure to pay the filing fee. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
