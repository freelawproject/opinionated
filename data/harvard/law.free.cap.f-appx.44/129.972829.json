He argues that the jury instructions erroneously defined \u201ctransportation of illegal aliens\u201d as either attempted transportation or completed transportation, two distinct crimes with different elements, thereby allowing the jury to convict him without -unanimously agreeing on the same crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-21\">\u201c[Federal] Rule [of Criminal Procedure] 30 ... requires that a defendant object with adequate specificity \u2014 an objection must state distinctly the matter to which the party objects as well as the grounds of the objection.\u201d <em>United States v. Elias, </em>269 F.3d 1003, 1017-18 (9th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>70 U.S.L.W. 3656 (Apr. 4, 2002) (No. 01-1502). Because counsel\u2019s objection to the jury instructions did not meet the specificity requirement here, we review only for plain error. <em>See Jones v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 373, 388, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 144 L.Ed.2d 370 (1999); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>201 F.3d 1145, 1148 (9th Cir.2000). Plain error occurs when (1) there is error; (2) that is plain; (3) that affects substantial rights; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>see also United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>v. Perez, </em>116 F.3d 840, 846 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">We have previously recognized \u201cthat attempting to transport, which requires specific intent, and actual transportation, which requires a showing of general intent, are separate and distinct crimes.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Martinez, </em>273 F.3d 903, 914 (9th Cir.2001). Where a defendant has been charged with duplicitous counts, we have held that the error is not necessarily fatal. \u201c[A] defendant indicted pursuant to a duplicitous indictment may be properly prosecuted and convicted if either (1) the government elects between the charges in the offending count, or (2) the court provides an instruction requiring all members of the jury to agree as to which of the distinct charges the defendant actually committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 915. Neither of these corrective measures was undertaken in this case. Although the district court generally instructed the jury that its verdict must be unanimous, the jury may have convicted Ya\u00f1ez-Del Rio without a unanimous verdict because, to find him guilty of transportation, the jurors only had to find him guilty of either attempt <em>or </em>actual transportation. With no instruction that attempt and actual transportation constituted separate crimes or that the jury must agree on one crime, \u201cthere is a genuine possibility of jury confusion or that a conviction may [have] occur[red] as the result of different jurors concluding that the defendant committed different acts, [and] the general unanimity instruction does not suffice.\u201d <em>United States v. Echeverry, </em>719 F.2d 974, 975, <em>modifying </em>698 F.2d 375 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We hold this to be plain error that deprived Ya\u00f1ez-Del Rio of his right to a unanimous verdict. Therefore, we reverse Ya\u00f1ez-Del Rio\u2019s convictions on counts two, three and four. Because the instructions for counts one and five required the jury to rely on the erroneous definition of \u201ctransportation of illegal aliens\u201d outlined in counts two, three and four, we likewise reverse Ya\u00f1ez^-Del Rio\u2019s convictions on those two counts. We remand the case to the district court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b165-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
