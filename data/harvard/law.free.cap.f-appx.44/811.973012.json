As Rodriguez readily admits, however, these comments \u201chad absolutely no relevance, and bore no nexus\u201d to him, nor did the prosecutor attempt to connect Rodriguez to these activities. The prosecutor\u2019s comments did not \u201cso infect[ ] [Rodriguez\u2019s] trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Rodriguez also makes several arguments concerning the validity of his sentence, none of which require reversal. For purposes of sentencing, Rodriguez did not dispute that he had flown from Los Ange-les to Chicago in order to occupy a \u201cstash house\u201d where authorities found him in a garage with a co-defendant who was loading a car with over twice the amount of drugs necessary to trigger the highest base offense level under the guidelines. Considering that Rodriguez was not simply facilitating the shipment of a \u201csmall amount of drugs,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 2, and that \u201cthe guidelines did not intend for every defendant who was less culpable than his codefendants to be granted minor participant status,\u201d <em>United States v. Andrus, </em>925 F.2d 335, 337 (9th Cir. 1991), the district court did not clearly err in denying a mitigating role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Because Rodriguez did not qualify for an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2, the district court did not have discretion to consider a departure under \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Rodriguez also argues that his is the \u201crare situation!]\u201d where a departure for acceptance of responsibility is warranted even though he put the government to its burden of proof at trial. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 2. Rodriguez can only point to inculpatory statements he made to the arresting officers as evidence that he \u201cclearly demonstrate^] acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). These statements evidence no contrition or remorse on Rodriguez\u2019s part. <em>See United States v. Connelly, </em>156 F.3d 978, 982 (9th Cir.1998) (holding that \u201ca failure to demonstrate contrition and remorse weighs against a finding of acceptance of responsibility\u201d). Considering that \u201cthe sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 5, the district court did not clearly err in determining that Rodriguez\u2019s is not the \u201crare situation[ ]\u201d warranting a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">Finally, Rodriguez claims that he should be resentenced pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). In <em>United States v. Nordby, </em>225 F.3d 1053, 1059 (9th Cir. 2000) (overruled on other grounds), we held that, pursuant to <em>Apprendi, </em>an individual cannot be sentenced above the \u201cprescribed statutory maximum,\u201d which is the maximum punishment to which the defendant could be exposed \u201csolely under the facts found by the jury.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) provides a maximum sentence of 20 years\u2019 incarceration and indefi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>nite supervised release without regard to a finding of any particular drug amount. Because Rodriguez\u2019s 235-month sentence does not exceed the prescribed statutory maximum, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b848-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
