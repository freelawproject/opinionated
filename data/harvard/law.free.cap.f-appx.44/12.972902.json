Elliott filed a timely notice of appeal, but his attorney has moved to withdraw because he is unable to identify a nonfrivolous ground for appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel\u2019s brief is facially adequate, and because Elliott did not respond to his attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), we limit our review of the record to the potential issues addressed by counsel, <em>United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-19\">At the time of his cocaine violation, Elliott was serving probation on an unrelated state offense. Shortly after his arrest, however, the state revoked his probation, and Elliott began serving the resulting state-imposed sentence. According to Elliott, the issuance of a federal detainer on the cocaine violation prolonged his detention because it rendered him ineligible to participate in the state\u2019s work release program.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-20\">Counsel now considers whether Elliott could argue that the district court should have reduced his federal sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b), to credit him with the time he spent in state detention. But Elliott\u2019s days in state custody were credited against the unrelated state sentence, and \u00a7 3585(b) expressly excludes such time from also being counted towards his federal sentence. <em>See United States v. Ross, </em>219 F.3d 592, 594 (7th Cir.2000). Moreover, because Elliott waived this argument at his sentencing hearing by conceding that his federal sentence should not run concurrent to his state-imposed term, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, comment, (n.6), such a claim would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-21\">Counsel next considers whether Elliott could challenge the district court\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>to deny his motion for downward departure under U.S.S.G \u00a7 5K2.0, and correctly concludes that such an argument would also be frivolous. Generally we lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a discretionary sentence departure. <em>See United States v. Lovaas, </em>241 F.3d 900, 902 (7th Cir.2001). Only if the district court refuses to depart downward because it concludes that it lacks the legal authority may we review its decision. <em>See United States v. Zaragoza, </em>117 F.3d 342, 345 (7th Cir.1997). Here the district explained that it had the authority to depart but exercised its discretion and declined to do so. Accordingly we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
