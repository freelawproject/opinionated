Attorney General Ashcroft has been substi- \u2022 tuted for former Attorney General Reno, the original defendant-appellee in this case. Fed. R. App. P. 43(c). <em>See, e.g., Abdille v.

The District Court entered summary judgment after concluding that Hubbard had failed to present a prima facie case of discrimination or sufficient evidence to \u201ccast doubt\u201d on defendant\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for the alleged adverse employment action at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fort Dix, New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-22\">We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">We exercise de novo review over a grant of summary judgment. <em>Goosby v. Johnson &amp; Johnson Med., Inc., </em>228 F.3d 313, 318 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Title VII prohibits employers from engaging in gender or race-based discrimination in employment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(a). The ADEA prohibits employment discrimination based on age. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(a). In order to prevail on a pretext theory of age, sex, or race discrimination, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>Goosby, </em>228 F.3d at 318 (citing <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)); <em>Keller v. Orix Credit Alliance, Inc., </em>130 F.3d 1101, 1108 (3d Cir.1997) (applying a \u201cslightly\u201d modified <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework to an ADEA claim). Once a prima facie case<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> has been established, the employer \u201cmust come forward with a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment decision.\u201d <em>Goosby, </em>228 F.3d at 318. If the employer can proffer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the proffered reason was merely a pretext for unlawful discrimination. <em>Id.; Starceski v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>54 F.3d 1089, 1095-96 n. 4 (3d Cir.1995) (\u201cAt all times the burden of proof or risk of non-persuasion, including the burden of proving \u2018but for\u2019 causation or causation in fact, remains on the employee.\u201d). In order to show pretext, plaintiff must submit evidence which: \u201c1) casts sufficient doubt upon each of the legitimate reasons proffered by the defendant so that a factfinder could reasonably conclude that each reason was a fabrication; or 2) allows the factfin-der to infer that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Fuentes v. Perskie, </em>32 F.3d 759, 762, 765 (3d Cir.1994) (explaining plaintiff must \u201cdemonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, ineoheren-cies, or contradictions ... that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them \u2018unworthy of credence\u2019 \u201d) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">In this case, Hubbard resigned prior to finishing a probationary period<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of employment with FCI Fort Dix. Defendants contend Hubbard was asked to resign because of allegations of clinical mismanagement and unprofessional behavior. Warden Doug Lansing gave multiple reasons for his decision to terminate Hubbard\u2019s employment, including: (1) the Mortality Review Committee\u2019s conclusion Hubbard mismanaged an inmate\u2019s care; (2) Hubbard demonstrated frequent communication problems with other staff members; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>(3) Hubbard\u2019s refusal to grant certain privileges to physician assistants that was inhibiting the provision of adequate health care at the Health Services Unit. Hubbard concedes that defendant has met its burden of articulating nondiscriminatory reasons for its employment actions, but she contends that she has presented ample proof of the weaknesses and implausibilities of these reasons to demonstrate pretext. We disagree. During her tenure at Fort Dix, Hubbard apparently brought certain alleged problems with alleged uncooperative physician assistants to the attention of her supervisors but never suggested she was being discriminated against because of race, gender, or age. Furthermore, Hubbard stated that Warden Lansing, the chief official and decision-maker at FCI, did not treat her differently because of her membership in a protected class. In fact, when Hubbard alerted Warden Lansing to her \u201cproblems,\u201d he accommodated her and even arranged for her to shadow a more experienced physician for a time. But when Hubbard was unable to develop satisfactory working relationships, Warden Lansing decided not to retain her. In these circumstances, Hubbard has failed to demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of fact whether discrimination was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d a cause of the alleged adverse employment action. <em>Fuentes, </em>32 F.3d at 762. This is fatal to her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">For these reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b580-9\"><em>. </em>A prima facie case is made when plaintiff establishes: (1) she was a member of a protected class; (2) she was qualified for the position sought; and (3) nonmembers of the protected class were treated more favorably. <em>Goosby, 228 </em>F.3d at 318. For purposes of this appeal, we will assume <em>arguendo </em>that Hubbard established a prima facie case of discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b580-13\">.

Here, the Human Resources Administrator at FCI Fort Dix provided Hubbard with the opportunity to resign voluntarily before she was terminated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
