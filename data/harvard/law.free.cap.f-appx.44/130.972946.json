Cal. v. Stone, </em>197 F.3d 1003, 1005-06 (9th Cir. 1999), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 902,151 L.Ed.2d 871 (2002). Despite the court\u2019s statements about jurisdiction, the dismissal was most appropriately viewed as a dismissal on the merits, for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. <em>Id. </em>at 1008. Thus, the district court had subject matter jurisdiction, and could in its discretion have awarded fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In explaining its denial of fees, the district court fully considered the factors this court enumerated in <em>Hummell v. S.E. Rykoff &amp; Co., </em>634 F.2d 446, 453 (9th Cir. 1980), and explained why none of the factors favored awarding fees. There was no abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
