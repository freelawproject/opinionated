Staufer, </em>38 F.3d 1103, 1107 (9th Cir.1994). The defendant bears the burden of showing sentencing entrapment by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Naranjo, </em>52 F.3d 245, 250 <em>&amp; </em>n. 13 (9th Cir.1995). Here there was no evidence of entrapment beyond the defendant\u2019s conclusory declaration. The specific transcripts produced involving two of the three drug deals indicate defendant\u2019s predisposition to commit the crimes and fail to reflect any unwillingness whatsoever. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 251 (noting agents had to persuade defendant to go through with drug transaction).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-18\">The defendant also claims that the district court\u2019s imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment and supervised release based on the quantity of the drugs involved in the offense violated the principles of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We have recently held that the mandatory minimum provision under which he was sentenced does not implicate <em>Apprendi. See United States v. Hitchcock, </em>286 F.3d 1064, 1073 (9th Cir.2002). <em>See also Harris v. United </em>States,-U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2420, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002). Defendant\u2019s supervised release claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Barragan, </em>263 F.3d 919, 925-26 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b196-16\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
