We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">Dentman contends that the district court erred by ruling that credit card account numbers found on a laptop in Dentman\u2019s garage constitute relevant conduct under \u00a7 IB 1.3(a)(2) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines and by including the actual fraudulent losses to those accounts in the total loss for sentencing. We review for clear error the district court\u2019s determination whether uncharged conduct is relevant for sentencing purposes under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2). <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>960 F.2d 903, 907 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-16\">In determining the loss attributable to a defendant, the sentencing court must consider a defendant\u2019s relevant conduct. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 1B1.3 (2001). Extraneous acts must be considered in the calculation of loss for groupable offenses like Dent-man\u2019s if they \u201cwere part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2). To be considered part of a common scheme or plan, the offense of conviction and the extraneous acts \u201cmust be substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar <em>modus operandi.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. n. 9. To be considered part of the same course of conduct, the offense of conviction and the extraneous acts must be \u201csufficiently connected or related to each other as to warrant the conclusion that they are part of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>single episode, spree, or ongoing series of offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining whether uncharged conduct meets one of these standards, the district court should consider the \u201csimilarity, regularity, and temporal proximity\u201d of the uncharged conduct to the charged conduct. <em>Hahn, </em>960 F.2d at 910. All three factors need not be present for conduct to be considered relevant for sentencing purposes; \u201c[w]hen one component is absent ... courts must look for a stronger presence of at least one of the other components.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The district court did not clearly err in ruling that the account numbers found on the laptop computer constituted relevant conduct under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2). <em>Id. </em>The filing of credit card numbers on the laptop evinces a <em>modus operandi </em>identical to Dentman\u2019s charged conduct; Dentman admitted that in producing the fake credit cards, he used the computer to download and store numbers obtained from skimmers. The sheer volume of account numbers found on the computer is sufficient to support the district court\u2019s conclusion that the laptop numbers were part of an ongoing and regular series of offenses. Although there is limited evidence regarding when Dentman obtained the numbers on the laptop (i.e., temporal proximity), that deficiency is outweighed by the strong evidence of similarity and regularity. The district court did not clearly err in ruling that the credit card numbers on the laptop computer constitute relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b893-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to pr by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
