Brown appeals from the final judgment entered in the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the Western District of Missouri after he pleaded guilty to possessing methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). The district court sentenced appellant to consecutive prison terms of 108 months and 60 months, followed by 3 years of supervised release. His counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing for reversal that the district court erred in not granting Brown\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.4 motion for a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-19\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to grant a downward departure is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Wolf, </em>270 F.3d 1188, 1192 (8th Cir.2001). Having found no nonfrivolous issues following our independent review of the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-20\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-17\">. The Honorable Gary A. Fenner, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
