Montgomery-Darnes seeks review of a final order by the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) finding that Montgomery-Darnes had faded to establish Board jurisdiction for her various claims against her employer, the United States Postal Service (\u201cPostal Service\u201d). <em>Howard v. United States Postal Serv., </em>AT-0752-00-0892-I-1 (Nov. 24, 2000) (decision of the Administrative Judge); <em>Howard v. United States Postal Serv., </em>AT-0752-0892-1-1 (Nov. 8, 2001) (final order of the Board). For the reasons discussed below, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">In short, the Board found that (1) it does not have jurisdiction over Montgomery-Darnes\u2019 claim that her employing agency, the Postal Service, had denied her requests for leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d); (2) contrary to Montgomery-Darnes\u2019 assertion, no evidence showed that the Postal Service had changed Montgomery-Darnes (then known as Christal Brown; the petitioner married at some point during the pendency of these proceedings) from full-time to part-time status; (3) in any event, even if the Postal Service had reduced her from full-time to part-time status, no evidence showed that Montgomery-Darnes had suffered a loss of pay or grade, meaning again she could not show the \u201cadverse agency action\u201d needed to invoke the Board\u2019s jurisdiction; (4) Montgomery-Darnes\u2019 generalized allegations of harassment arising from her requests for leave under the FMLA did not in and of themselves vest the Board with jurisdiction, as they too did not constitute an \u201cadverse action\u201d appealable to the Board; and (5) Montgomery-Darnes\u2019 discrimination claims did not fall within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction absent an otherwise appealable action. <em>(See </em>J.A. 2-3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">Conducting a <em>de novo </em>review of the jurisdictional issue, <em>see Herman v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>193 F.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed.Cir. 1999), we agree with the Board\u2019s determination and affirm it in all respects. On appeal to our court, Montgomery-Darnes appears to raise several new arguments in support of Board jurisdiction, or at least arguments that she did not clearly present to the Board and in either event has thus now waived those arguments for our review. <em>See Pierce v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>242 F.3d 1373, 1375 (Fed.Cir.2001) (affirming Board decision finding no jurisdiction when petitioner failed to present a particular jurisdictional argument to the Board itself); <em>Wallace v. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, </em>879 F.2d 829, 832 (Fed.Cir.1989) (\u201cOrdinarily, appellate courts refuse to consider issues not raised before an administrative agency. \u2018[Ojbjections to the proceedings of an administrative agency [must] be made while it has an opportunity for correction in order to raise issues reviewable by the courts.\u2019 A corollary is that the issue must be raised with sufficient specificity and clarity that the tribunal is aware that it must decide the issue, and in sufficient time that the agency can do so.\u201d) (internal citations omitted). To the extent we do not deem these arguments waived, however, we also do not find them persuasive. We address four of Montgomery-Darnes\u2019 arguments, below.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>First, Montgomery-Darnes asserts that the Board has jurisdiction simply because she is a preference-eligible employee, a disabled veteran. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(B) (identifying among the \u201cemployees\u201d who can appeal actions to the Board certain \u201cpreference eligible\u201d employees for the Postal Service). But even preference-eligible employees must show the requisite \u201cadverse\u201d agency action, <em>ie., </em>removal, a suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in pay or grade or a furlough of 30 days or less. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7512(l)-(5); <em>Dreher v. United States Postal Serv., </em>711 F.2d 907, 908-09 (9th Cir.1983) (holding that no Board jurisdiction existed for a preference-eligible veteran working for the Postal Service who protested supervisors\u2019 order that he take annual leave or leave without pay for a day in order to adjust to a new shift schedule; \u201c \u2018adverse action\u2019 does not mean any action which an employee does not like\u201d). Again, despite an opportunity to do so <em>(see </em>J.A. 49), Montgomery-Darnes offered no evidence showing that the Postal Service had reduced her pay or grade or had otherwise taken any of the other \u201cadverse\u201d actions described in \u00a7 7512. Indeed, as the Postal Service notes, the only evidence on this score shows at the time this case was before the Board, Montgomery-Darnes was a full-time employee who was still receiving her full pay and had not suffered any loss of grade or any other \u201cadverse\u201d action. <em>{See </em>J.A. 10, 66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Second, Montgomery-Darnes cites 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(9), claiming it gives the Board jurisdiction over \u201cactions by the Agency of denying me leave pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act, denying me work by placing my [sic] in a play-it-by-ear part time status, and retaliating against me for requesting and using leave\u201d under the FMLA. But again, even assuming the truth of Montgomery-Darnes\u2019 allegations, neither a change to \u201cpart-time status\u201d nor the denial of leave constitutes an adverse action appealable to the Board. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512; <em>see also Wood v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>938 F.2d 1280, 1281 (Fed. Cir.1991) (concluding that Board did not have jurisdiction over claim by employee that his agency, the Postal Service, had reduced the number of hours he could work per day). Further, the provision on which Montgomery-Darnes relies, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(9), grants a federal employee an individual right of action for certain \u201cpersonnel actions\u201d taken (or not taken) against that employee because she had exercised an \u201cappeal, complaint, or grievance ... granted by any law.\u201d The Board, however, does not have jurisdiction over actions brought under \u00a7 2302(b)(9), only over certain whistleblowing actions brought under \u00a7 2302(b)(8). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221(a)(2); <em>Serrao v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>95 F.3d 1569, 1575 (Fed.Cir.1996); <em>Weber v. Dep\u2019t of Army, </em>9 F.3d 97, 100 (Fed.Cir.1993) (emphasizing that the Board has jurisdiction <em>\u201conly </em>on claims brought under \u00a7 2308(b)(8)\u201d); <em>Spruill v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>978 F.2d 679, 690 (Fed.Cir.1992). Thus, we reject this argument as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Third, Montgomery-Darnes suggests that the Board does have jurisdiction under \u00a7 2302(b)(8), the whistleblower provision, as the Postal Service allegedly \u201cimposed a Prohibited Personnel Practice against [her] for disclosure of information to the Board and [t]he Office of Special Counsel that evidenced] ... a violation of law and mismanagement, abuse of authority and specific danger to public health and safety.\u201d We agree with the Postal Service that Montgomery-Darnes has waived this argument on appeal, since nothing in the submissions that she filed with the Administrative Judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) as to jurisdiction sufficiently identifies this provision as a basis for Board review. <em>(See, e.g., </em>J.A. 50-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>58 (letter discussing racial slurs that Postal Service supervisors allegedly made and Montgomery-Darnes\u2019 complaints about having to fill out medical leave forms when other employees allegedly do not); J.A. 56-58 (second letter discussing leave forms, having to go on \u201cplay-it-by-ear part time status\u201d and getting \u201cmentally stressed out wondering\u201d whether supervisors would make Montgomery-Darnes \u201cclock out\u201d early, before she worked a full eight-hour shift); J.A. 61 (stating Montgomery-Darnes\u2019 \u201cobjection\u201d to the motion to dismiss for lack of Board jurisdiction, citing her status as a \u201cdisabled veteran, a matter that is within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">And even if she had preserved this issue for review, we see nothing in the record that shows she met the prerequisites for bringing a whistleblower appeal to the Board, including the prerequisite that she exhaust her administrative remedies before the Office of Special Counsel. <em>See, e.g., Yunus v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed.Cir.2001) (\u201cThis court has held that the Board has jurisdiction over [a whistleblower] appeal if the appellant has exhausted his administrative remedies before the OSC and makes \u2018non-frivolous allegations\u2019 that (1) he engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8), and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency\u2019s decision to take or fail to take a personnel action as defined by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Last, according to Montgomery-Darnes, the Board has jurisdiction because the Postal Service allegedly discriminated against her on the basis of her race and disabilities, in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e~16, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 791. As the AJ correctly reasoned, however, the Board cannot maintain jurisdiction over a discrimination claim unless accompanied by an action that does lie within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction, <em>e.g., </em>one of the \u201cadverse actions\u201d set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7702(a)(1)(A), (B)(i) and (iii); <em>King v. Reid, </em>59 F.3d 1215, 1217-18 (Fed.Cir.1995); <em>Cruz v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>934 F.2d 1240, 1245 (Fed.Cir.1991) <em>(en banc). </em>Accordingly, because Montgomery-Darnes has not presented an otherwise appealable action to the Board, her discrimination claims, standing alone, also cannot establish jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
