He argues that the district court erred when it granted the government\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to suppress evidence that Ramirez-Arango applied for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>a pardon from his underlying conviction before his reentry. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(2). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">The government moved for suppression of the pardon application on several grounds. The district court granted the motion on the ground that it was clear from the face of the application that Ramirez-Arango was ineligible for a pardon until after the date of his reentry. We review rulings suppressing evidence <em>in li-mine </em>for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ravel, </em>930 F.2d 721, 726 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Ramirez-Arango\u2019s trial defense consisted of a denial of the government\u2019s charge that he lacked permission to reenter. <em>Cf. United States v. Corona-Garcia, </em>210 F.3d 973, 976 n. 1 (9th Cir.2000) (listing elements of illegal reentry offense). To prove its charge, the government introduced evidence that the Attorney General\u2019s records show no such grant of permission and that Ramirez-Arango confessed to having neither requested nor received such permission. Ramirez-Arango argues that his pardon application is relevant to his defense because it casts doubt on the government\u2019s proof. This argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">A request for permission to reenter may be relevant to cast doubt on whether that permission was granted. <em>Corona-Garcia, </em>210 F.3d at 979 n. 3. As the government correctly noted in its motion <em>in limine, </em>however, a pardon alone cannot constitute permission to reenter under \u00a7 1326(a). <em>See United States v. Blanco-Gallegos, </em>188 F.3d 1072, 1075 (9th Cir.1999). Evidence that Ramirez-Arango requested a pardon, rather than permission to reenter, does nothing to undermine the government\u2019s proof that Ramirez-Arango lacked permission to reenter. <em>See United States v. Click, </em>807 F.2d 847, 850 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">Although the district court granted the motion on a different ground, we may affirm on any ground raised before the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 850 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">Because evidence of Ramirez-Arango\u2019s pardon application is irrelevant to his defense, his alternate argument that its sup-' pression prevented him from presenting a complete defense fails. <em>See United States v. Dorrell, </em>758 F.2d 427, 430 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b871-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
