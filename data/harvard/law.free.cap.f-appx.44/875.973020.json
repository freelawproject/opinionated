The facts underlying the deportation are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-16\">On April 14, 1995, Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz pled guilty to robbery in violation of California Penal Code section 211. On May 9, 1995, Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz was sentenced to 365 days custody, five years probation, and a $200 fine. At that time, robbery with a sentence of less than five years imprisonment was not an aggravated felony and did not render one deportable. Additionally, at the time of Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s guilty plea, the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) section 212(c) permitted an alien convicted of a deportable offense to seek discretionary relief from deportation from the Attorney General, provided that the alien met certain eligibility requirements. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-17\">On April 24, 1996, Congress amended the INA through the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). AEDPA expanded the category of criminal convictions that would render.an alien ineligible to apply for INA section 212(c) discretionary relief from deportation. As relevant to this case, section 440(d) provided that discretionary relief from deportation could not be granted to an alien convicted of an enumerated aggravated felony. AEDPA \u00a7 440(d), 110 Stat. at 1277. However, because Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s crime was not then classified as an aggravated felony, he was not deporta-ble under AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-18\">On September 30, 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration and Reform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, which further restricted the availability of discretionary relief from deportation. IIRIRA enlarged the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include \u201ca theft offense ... for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) (1996). IIRIRA also eliminated the discretionary relief from deportation available under INA section 212(c), replacing it with a procedure called \u201ccancellation of removal.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">As a result of these changes to the immigration laws, the INS served Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz with a notice to appear on September 18, 1997. Based on IIRIRA, the INS classified Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s conviction for robbery as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d-a de-portable offense. On October 27, 1997, Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz appeared before an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) for a deportation hearing. The IJ concluded that Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz was an aggravated felon ineligible for relief and ordered Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz deported. After the IJ informed Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz that \u201cthere was no relief available and that he was not eligible for a \u2018pardon,\u2019 \u201d Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz waived his right to appeal the IJ\u2019s decision, and he was deported to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">On July 30, 1999, Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz was arrested in the United States by San Diego police officers. Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz was subsequently released to the INS and charged with being a deported alien found in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for illegal reentry on the ground that the underlying deportation proceeding violated due process by retroactively attaching new immigration consequences to his prior robbery offense. The district court heard argument on Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz's motion to dismiss, and the motion was taken under advisement. Despite concluding that Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal the deportation may have been constitutionally defective, the district court denied Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment because it concluded that Congress clearly intended the provisions of IIRIRA to have retroactive effect. The court later denied Gal-van-Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz entered a conditional guilty plea to being a deported alien found in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. On July 30, 1999, the district court sentenced Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz to thirty months imprisonment, three years supervised release, and a $100 fine. Gal-van-Mu\u00f1oz appeals, arguing that he is entitled to apply to the Attorney General for discretionary relief from deportation under INA section 212(c), the law in place at the time he pled guilty to robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz first argues that, because the defects in his deportation proceeding foreclosed judicial review, due process requires that he be afforded an opportunity to collaterally challenge the deportation decision in the context of this criminal proceeding. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, </em>481 U.S. 828, 838,107 S.Ct. 2148, 95 L.Ed.2d 772 (1987). The district court determined that Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz had satisfied the requirements of <em>Mendoza-Lopez </em>and that his collateral challenge should therefore be addressed on the merits. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Alvarado-Delgado, </em>98 F.3d 492, 493-94 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc). We agree with this determination and see no reason to disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">The district court rejected Galvan-Mu-\u00f1oz\u2019s collateral challenge on the merits. However, after the district court issued its judgment, the United States Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). In <em>St. Cyr, </em>the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>Supreme Court concluded, under the test articulated in <em>Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., </em>511 U.S. 244, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994), that Congress had not manifested a clear intent that IIRIRA\u2019s repeal of section 212(c) of the INA be applied retroactively and that such an application would \u201cproduce! ] an impermissible retroactive effect for aliens who ... were convicted pursuant to a plea agreement at a time when their plea would not have rendered them ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief.\u201d <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 320. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the repeal of section 212(c) could not be applied retroactively to aliens who pled guilty at a time when section 212(c) discretionary relief was not foreclosed to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">We conclude that the holding of <em>St. Cyr </em>applies to Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz and requires that he be afforded the opportunity to apply for section 212(c) discretionary relief from the Attorney General.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz argues, a contrary conclusion would likely run afoul of his due process rights. <em>See Dillingham v. INS, </em>267 F.3d 996, 1004-06 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that due process rights incorporate equal protection guarantees and that the government must have a rational basis for distinguishing, in imposition of immigration consequences, between similarly situated classes of aliens). We reverse and remand to enable Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz to apply for such discretionary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b912-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-7\">. The government\u2019s argument to the contrary would carry more weight if Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz had pled guilty to robbery <em>after </em>the enactment of AEDPA. <em>See United States v. Velasco-Medi-na, </em>No. 01-50064, - F.3d - (9th Cir. Aug. 12, 2002). If that were the case, AEDPA would have provided Galvan-Mu\u00f1oz with fair notice that his crime could be reclassified as an aggravated felony, in which case he would become ineligible for discretionary relief. <em>Id. </em>Such notice is conspicuously absent from this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
