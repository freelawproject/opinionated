Mayberry, a Michigan state prisoner, appeals pro se a district court order dismissing his civil rights complaint, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">Mayberry filed this complaint against prison officials, alleging that he was being confined to his cell as a sanction for refusing work assignments, without due process. The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and 1915A(b)(l). Mayberry reasserts his claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">Review of the complaint in this case reveals that it was properly dismissed for failure to state a claim, as Mayberry could prove no facts consistent with his allegations which would entitle him to relief. <em>Jones v. City of Carlisle, Ky., </em>3 F.3d 945, 947 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">Mayberry was not entitled to relief, as he has no liberty interest at stake to trigger due process protections. Confinement to his cell during work hours for refusal to accept a work assignment does not constitute an atypical and significant hardship. <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Rim-mer-Bey v. Brown, </em>62 F.3d 789, 790-91 (6th Cir.1995) (administrative segregation). Because the complaint plainly failed to state a claim for relief on its face, the district court\u2019s order of dismissal is hereby affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
