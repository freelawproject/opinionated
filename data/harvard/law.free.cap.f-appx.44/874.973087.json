We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-21\">Fonseca-Guerra acknowledges that his \u00a7 2255 motion was filed beyond the one-year time limit,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling. Even if equitable tolling is available under \u00a7 2255, <em>see United States v. Schwartz, </em>274 F.3d 1220, 1224-25 &amp; n. 4 (9th Cir.2001), Fonseca-Guerra is not entitled to it because he has not demonstrated that \u201cextraordinary circumstances beyond [his] control ... ma[d]e it impossible to file a petition on time.\u201d <em>Calderon v. United States Dist. Court (Beeler), </em>128 F.3d 1283, 1288 (9th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds in Calderon v. United States Dist. Court (Kelly), </em>163 F.3d 530, 541 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc). With one possible exception, the various explanations Fonse-ca-Guerra offers for his tardiness are unremarkable. Fonseca-Guerra\u2019s only serious contention is that he lacked access to a law library during his time at a holdover detention facility. However, even if that time were excluded, it would amount to seven weeks at most, which is well short of the five months Fonseca-Guerra needs to rescue his motion from the one-year time limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-22\">Moreover, nothing in the record indicates that the reasons cited by FonsecaGuerra or anything else beyond his control made the timely filing of his motion \u201cim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>possible.\u201d <em>See Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1107 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b910-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b910-23\">.
