He appeals, contending that the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> violated Rule 11(c)(1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by failing to advise him of the nature of the charge before accepting his plea. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Alcorta-Marufo, a citizen of Mexico, was deported on May 22, 1998, after being convicted of felony domestic violence. He reentered the United States on March 28, 2001, and was arrested on July 28, 2001. He entered a plea of guilty on September 17, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">In addition to discussing with him the other matters detailed in Rule 11, the district court asked Alcorta-Marufo whether he had received a copy of the indictment against him and whether he had had an opportunity to fully discuss the charges with his lawyer. Alcorta-Marufo responded affirmatively to both questions, and he raised no objections during the plea hearing or the sentencing hearing, following which he was sentenced to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">\u201cRule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires a judge to address a defendant about to enter a plea of guilty, to ensure that he understands the law of his crime in relation to the facts of his case, as well as his rights as a criminal defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 1048, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). A claim that the district court did not properly comply with Rule 11 is reviewed for plain error in those cases in which the defendant did not raise an objection in the district court. <em>Id. </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 122 S.Ct. at 1046. Such an error is grounds for reversal only if it \u201c \u2018prejudices the substantial rights of the defendant and would result in a miscarriage of justice if left uncorrected.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>270 F.3d 737, 739 (8th Cir.2001), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 1336, 152 L.Ed.2d 241 (2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Fountain, </em>83 F.3d 946, 949 (8th Cir.1996)). \u201c \u2018Plain error review is extremely narrow and is limited to those errors which are so obvious or otherwise flawed as to seriously undermine the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perez, </em>270 F.3d at 739 (quoting <em>United States v. Beck, </em>250 F.3d 1163, 1166 (8th Cir. 2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-22\">Alcorta-Marufo contends that the facts of his case are similar to those in <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969). In <em>McCarthy, </em>however, the district court faded to address the defendant personally regarding the defendant\u2019s understanding of the nature of the charges against him. <em>Id. </em>at 461-62. Here, the district court addressed Alcorta-Marufo personally and, as indicated above, inquired whether he had received a copy of the indictment and had had the opportunity to fully discuss the charges with his lawyer, to which Alcorta-Marufo responded in the affirmative. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>district court also engaged in a lengthy discussion with Alcorta-Marufo regarding the factual basis of his plea, the circumstances of which Alcorta-Marufo acknowledged to be correct. Moreover, <em>McCarthy </em>was decided prior to the adoption of Rule 11(h), which provides that \u201c[a]ny variance from the procedures required by this rule which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\u201d <em>See Vonn, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 122 S.Ct. at 1048. Finally, the fact that a defendant has been provided with a copy of the indictment \u201cgive[s] rise to a presumption that the defendant was informed of the nature of the charge against him.\u201d <em>Bousley v. United, States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 618, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998); <em>Vonn, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 122 S.Ct. at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">We adopt the following approach when reviewing the type of Rule 11-violation claim raised by Alcorta-Marufo:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">In determining whether the defendant understood the nature of the charges, it is necessary to \u201cexamine the totality of the circumstances. We examine whether the indictment gave him notice of the charge, whether he discussed the charge with his attorney or the judge, and we look at any other facts which are in the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-8\"><em>United States v. Marks, </em>38 F.3d 1009, 1011 (8th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Nieuwsma, </em>779 F.2d 1359, 1361 (8th Cir. 1985)). <em>See also Vonn</em>, \u2014 U.S. at-, 122 S.Ct. at 1055 (record information \u201coutside the four corners of the transcript of the plea hearing and Rule 11 colloquy\u201d may be looked to in determining whether a Rule 11 violation resulted in plain error).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">Alcorta-Marufo testified that he had received the indictment and had discussed it with his attorney. He also agreed with the recitation of facts as stated by the district court. Given the straightforward nature of the charge against Alcorta-Ma-rufo, we conclude that the totality of the circumstances indicate that no plain error resulted from the manner in which in the district court conducted the Rule 11 colloquy. This is not to say that district courts need not painstakingly comply with the detailed requirements of Rule 11, but only that Alcorta-Marufo has not established that he suffered any substantial prejudice to his substantial rights by the district court\u2019s failure to comply strictly with all of those requirements in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-13\">.
