R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Diana Sladek appeals from the district court\u2019s order affirming rulings of the bankruptcy court in the underlying case. She contends that the bankruptcy court erred in disallowing two exemptions from the debtors\u2019 bankruptcy estate for claims involving the probate of her father\u2019s estate in Florida. She also challenges the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling granting a motion of the trustee to reconvert the case from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7. She asserts that the district court erred in affirming these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal by virtue of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(d) and 1291. <em>See Conn. Nat\u2019l Bank v. Germain, </em>503 U.S. 249, 252, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992). Our review of the bankruptcy court\u2019s legal determinations is de novo and its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>Phillips v. White (In re White), </em>25 F.3d 931, 933 (10th Cir.1994). \u201cIt is especially important to be faithful to the clearly erroneous standard when the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings have been upheld by the district court.\u201d <em>Osborn v. Durant Bank &amp; Trust Co. (In re Osborn), </em>24 F.3d 1199, 1203 (10th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">After careful review of the parties\u2019 briefs and appendices in light of the applicable law and appellate standards, we conclude that the district court correctly decided this case. Therefore, for substantially the reasons set out in the district court\u2019s order dated October 12, 2001, the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b485-10\"> This ordej; and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
