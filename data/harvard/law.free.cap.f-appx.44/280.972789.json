Salimova has completed serving the custodial portion of her sentence. Salimova\u2019s attorney has filed a brief and a motion to withdraw as counsel of record pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Salimova has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-23\">Counsel identifies the potential issue of whether the district court\u2019s restitution order is authorized by the restitution statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A. We conclude that the district court was permitted to include losses beyond those of the offenses of conviction because Salimova was convicted of participating in a scheme to defraud banks, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>132 F.3d 1279, 1286-87 (9th Cir.1997) (stating that \u00a7 3663A(a)(2) authorizes restitution for losses beyond the offense of conviction where the offense includes an element of a scheme, conspiracy or pattern of criminal conduct). The evidence was sufficient, for purposes of sentencing, to support the district court\u2019s finding that these other losses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>were connected to the scheme in which Sahmova participated. <em>See United States v. Egge, </em>223 F.3d 1128, 1132 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cIn making factual determinations, a sentencing judge is generally not restricted to evidence that would be admissible at trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Our independent review of the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 83, 109 S.Ct. 346,102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), discloses no other issues requiring further review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b316-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
