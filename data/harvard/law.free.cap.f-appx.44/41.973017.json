We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-21\">Terrance D. LaCanne sought disability insurance benefits asserting both physical and mental impairments. An administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded LaCanne could not return to his past relevant work, but retained the residual functional capacity to perform other work at the sedentary and light exertional levels. Following the Appeals Council\u2019s denial of his request for review, LaCanne filed this action in district court. The district court determined the ALJ\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-24\">Our scope of review is narrow. \u201cWe will affirm the ALJ\u2019s findings if supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Beckley v. Apfel, </em>152 F.3d 1056, 1059 (8th Cir.1998). \u201cSubstantial evidence is less than a preponderance, but enough that a reasonable mind might accept it as adequate to support a decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We find the decision is supported by substantial evidence and affirm for the reasons given by the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-22\">. The Honorable Ann D. Montgomery, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
