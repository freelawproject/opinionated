Acting on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a prehminary injunction, the district court found a substantial likelihood of plaintiffs\u2019 success on the merits and enjoined defendants from taking certain administrative actions. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), defendants appealed the entry of that injunction, challenging various factual findings of the district court. We narrowly review for abuse of discretion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Before a preliminary injunction may be entered, plaintiffs must establish:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-8\">(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the case; (2) irreparable injury to the movant if the preliminary injunction is denied; (3) the threatened injury to the movant outweighs the injury to the other party under the preliminary injunction; and (4) the injunction is not adverse to the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"adn-dedup-0\"><em>Kikumura v. Hurley, </em>242 F.3d 950, 955 (10th Cir.2001). A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy that should not be granted unless the right to relief is \u201cclear and unequivocal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 955 (quotation omitted). \u201cBut while the standard to be applied by the district court in deciding whether a plaintiff is entitled to a preliminary injunction is stringent, the standard of appellate review is simply whether the issuance of the injunction, in the light of the applicable standard, constituted an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 931-32. Under the abuse-of-discretion standard,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"axj-dedup-0\">we give due deference to the district court\u2019s evaluation of the salience and credibility of testimony, affidavits, and other evidence. We will not challenge that evaluation unless it finds no support in the record, deviates from the appropriate legal standard, or follows from a plainly implausible, irrational, or erroneous reading of the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-11\"><em>United States v. Robinson, </em>39 F.3d 1115, 1116 (10th Cir.1994) (citation omitted). \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs when the district court bases its ruling on an erroneous conclusion of law or relies on clearly erroneous fact findings.\u201d <em>Kiowa Indian Tribe v. Hoover, </em>150 F.3d 1163, 1165 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b962-13\">Plaintiffs include SOFS, a mental health care provider that serves approximately 740 patients in southeastern Oklahoma; various SOFS patients; and Alfred M. Evans, a \u201cvocal critic of Oklahoma\u2019s current system of Medicaid funding\u201d who is a mental health care provider and contract consultant to SOFS. (1 Appellant\u2019s App. at 78 (Feb. 12, 2001 order).) They brought this suit alleging that various officers and directors of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority (\u201cHCA\u201d), a state entity responsible for disbursing Medicaid funds to state-contracted Medicaid facilities, retaliated against them because of their speech on matters of public concern in violation of the First Amendment. Plaintiffs also alleged violation of their due process rights; \u201cthe Boren Amendment guarantees of rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>sonable and adequate reimbursements under the Medicaid program\u201d; \u201cthe Boren Amendment guarantees of reasonable access to and adequate quality of Medicaid services\u201d; \u201cthe Medicaid Act\u2019s guarantee of medical services that are of sufficient amount, duration, and scope\u201d; and \u201c42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6009 guarantees of appropriate treatment, services, and habilitation for disabled persons.\u201d (1 <em>id. </em>at 79 (Feb. 12, 2001 order).)</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">In 1996, Evans formed Texoma Mental Health Services \u201cto provide mental health services in southern Oklahoma\u201d, and obtained a contract that allowed Texoma to provide such services under the state\u2019s Medicaid program. (2 <em>id. </em>at 201 (Evans\u2019s testimony).) As proprietor of this company, Evans \u201clobbied various government officials, including the Governor and various state legislators, to provide greater funding for private medical care providers in the state.\u201d (1 <em>id. </em>at 80 (Feb. 12, 2001 order).) Plaintiffs claim that defendants terminated Texoma\u2019s Medicaid contract in response to \u201cEvans\u2019s crusade for Medicaid reform.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Defendants, however, claim that Texoma\u2019s Medicaid contract was terminated because of \u201csubstantial billing irregularities that were uncovered through the HCA auditing process.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">Texoma entered Chapter 7 bankruptcy after the contract termination, and \u201c[i]n an effort to continue services, Evans started SOFS, a new non-profit mental health company. In order to keep his involvement with SOFS from the defendants, Evans is not directly affiliated with SOFS but rather works as a consultant.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Within a few months of Texoma\u2019s demise, SOFS absorbed most of Texoma\u2019s employees and clients. Currently, SOFS serves about 740 patients in a ten-county area of southeastern Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">On October 19, 2000, the HCA conducted an unannounced audit of SOFS\u2019s Hugo, Oklahoma, facility. \u201cDuring that audit, certain records were inspected and cataloged. While complete findings were not issued at that time, the auditors notified SOFS officials that various violations were taking place.\u201d (1 <em>id. </em>at 81 (Feb. 12, 2001 order).) The district court described the subsequent events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-9\">Evans continued his efforts on behalf of Medicaid reform by filing an Oklahoma Open Records Act request on November 22, 2000. In it, Evans sought detailed information on the HCA\u2019s spending and administrative practices. Two business days later, on November 28, 2000, SOFS\u2019s Ardmore facility was the subject of an audit conducted by the HCA. Once again, complete findings were not made on site, but the auditors noted various violations of HCA policy. Plaintiffs claim, however, that the exit interview with the HCA auditors was very positive and complimentary. The auditors apparently made \u201ccommendations\u201d and were very helpful in devising solutions to the apparent deficiencies. On December 4, 2000, the HCA sent a letter to Evans informing him that his Oklahoma Open Records Act request would be expensive, and that Evans would be responsible for bearing the cost. The letter also gave Evans an opportunity to withdraw his request. Evans declined and informed the HCA of his intention to proceed with the request on December 19, 2000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">\n<em>(Id.)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">On December 14 and 19, the HCA released full results of the Hugo and Ard-more audits, respectively, discussing \u201cdeficiencies in SOFS\u2019s performance\u201d and seeking recoupment of paid Medicaid funds. (1 <em>id. </em>at 81-82 (Feb. 12, 2001 order).) When, in late December, the HCA had not responded to Evans\u2019s renewed open-records request, he again sought the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>information. Evans\u2019s \u201cdiscussions with the HCA revealed an apparent mis-com-munication; Evans was informed that his renewed request had not been received but that it was now going forward.\u201d (1 <em>id. </em>at 82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">On January 8, 2001, the HCA sent a letter to SOFS stating its intention to cancel SOFS\u2019s Medicaid contracts. The letter mentioned serious deficiencies in the company\u2019s performance, but \u201cchose to terminate the contract without cause.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>In the meantime, SOFS was placed on manual-review status. \u201cThis \u2018on review\u2019 status apparently requires SOFS to submit all its billing manually rather than through the electronic system normally used.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">\u201cNegotiations between the parties continued and on January 19, 2001, after a meeting with state representative Randal Erwin, the HCA chose to temporarily suspend the termination of SOFS\u2019s Medicaid contracts. Currently, the Medicaid contracts are continuing, but SOFS is required to manually submit all of its billings.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">As an initial matter, the parties disagree as to whether the preliminary injunction entered by the district court was \u201cmandatory\u201d or \u201cprohibitory\u201d in nature. \u201cA mandatory prehminary injunction (i.e., one that directs a party to act) imposes an even heavier burden on the movant of showing that the [relevant] factors ... weigh heavily and compellingly in movant\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Power Eng\u2019g Co., </em>191 F.3d 1224, 1230 (10th Cir. 1999) (quotation omitted); <em>see also Dominion Video Satellite, Inc. v. Echostar Satellite Corp., </em>269 F.3d 1149, 1154-55 (10th Cir.2001). The heightened burden also applies to injunctions that disturb the status quo and provide the movant substantially all of the relief it seeks from a full trial on the merits. <em>Dominion Video, </em>269 F.3d at 1154-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">The district court characterized its injunction as mandatory, stating, \u201cPlaintiffs must make a heightened showing because they request the Court to command defendants to alter the status quo by returning plaintiffs to an automatic billing system.\u201d (1 Appellants\u2019 App. at 83.) It is true that the prehminary injunction in this case <em>mandates </em>defendants \u201cto return SOFS to the automated billing procedure\u201d and \u201cto hold the termination of SOFS\u2019s Medicaid contracts in abeyance pending the outcome on the merits of the present suit.\u201d (1 <em>id. </em>at 95.) Nevertheless, under our precedent, the district court\u2019s injunction is properly classified as prohibitory.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">To determine whether an injunction is mandatory or prohibitory, we look at the substance of the injunction and compare it to the status quo ante \u2014 i.e., the \u201clast uncontested period preceding the injunction.\u201d <em>Dominion Video, </em>269 F.3d at 1155. In <em>Dominion Video, </em>we held that a preliminary injunction that required defendant to take affirmative action to activate satellite TV subscribers was not mandatory. We thought it important that the injunction did \u201cnot compel [defendant] to do something it was not already doing during the last uncontested period preceding the injunction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, the last uncontested period was before the HCA notified SOFS of its termination of its Medicaid contract and before SOFS was placed on \u201con review\u201d status, which \u201crequires SOFS to submit all its billing manually rather than through the electronic system normally used.\u201d (1 Appellants\u2019 App. at 82.) As in <em>Dominion Video, </em>the preliminary injunction in this case does not require defendants to do something that they were not doing during the last uncontested period. Therefore, the heightened burden at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>tendant to mandatory injunctions need not be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">We turn to the substance of plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment claim. In <em>Board of County Commissioners v. Umbehr, </em>518 U.S. 668, 116 S.Ct. 2342, 135 L.Ed.2d 843 (1996), the Supreme Court held that the \u201cFirst Amendment\u2019s guarantee of freedom of speech protects government employees from termination <em>because of </em>their speech on matters of public concern,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 675, and that the same protection is afforded to government contractors, <em>id. </em>at 678. A government contractor\u2019s rights depend on balancing the following considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-7\">1. Whether the speech in question involves a matter of public concern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-8\">2. If so, we must weigh the employee\u2019s interest in the expression against the government employer\u2019s interest in regulating the speech of its employees so that it can carry on an efficient and effective workplace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-9\">3. Employee must show the speech was a substantial factor driving the challenged governmental action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-10\">4. If so, can the employer show that it would have taken the same employment action against the employee even in the absence of the protected speech?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-11\"><em>Kent v. Martin, </em>252 F.3d 1141, 1143 (10th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted). The first two questions are questions of law, and the latter two are questions of fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">In this interlocutory appeal, defendants focus on the likelihood-of-success prong of the preliminary-injunction standard. First, they contend that the district court erroneously found that plaintiffs would likely show that Evans\u2019s lobbying efforts were a substantial or motivating factor for the actions taken against SOFS. This is a question of fact. <em>Id. </em>We stress that we will not overturn the injunction merely because we would have come to a different conclusion than did the district court. Our review, though meaningful, is sharply circumscribed by the applicable standard of review, which requires that the district court\u2019s findings be sustained unless we are left \u201cwith the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,\u201d <em>United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-15\">The district court determined that \u201cthe evidence presented during the hearing demonstrates an uncanny correlation between Evans\u2019 exercise of free speech rights and administrative actions taken by the HCA.\u201d (1 Appellants\u2019 App. at 84.) Defendants take issue with this determination, arguing that \u201cthe district court erred ... when it found that the timing of Medicaid officials!\u2019] actions caused a likelihood of success of Evan\u2019s [sic] First Amendment claim.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 20.) Defendants point to <em>Butler v. City of Prairie Village, </em>172 F.3d 736 (10th Cir.1999), in which we held, \u201cPlaintiff has not established that the speech was a motivating factor in his termination. The mere temporal proximity of Plaintiffs protected speech to his termination is insufficient, without more, to establish retaliatory motive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-16\">In our view, the district court\u2019s finding that Evans\u2019s lobbying efforts were substantial or motivating factors passes dear-error review. As the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-17\">When Evans opposed the HCA by lobbying the legislature for additional funding, his predecessor company, Texo-ma, lost its Medicaid contract. When Evans submitted an Oklahoma Open Record Act request to the HCA, the HCA instituted an audit of SOFS\u2019s Ard-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>more facility two business days later. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-4\">To further add to the series of coincidences, the HCA contacted Evans and gave him an opportunity to withdraw his open records act request a few days after the audit. In addition, on December 19, 2000, the day Evans renewed his request for information, the HCA released the audit report that harshly criticized SOFS\u2019s Ardmore facility even though the auditors had been very complimentary during their exit interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-5\">The series of coincidences continued into January 2001. The HCA claims to have misplaced Evans\u2019 information request. Evans again renewed his request on January 3, 2001, and on January 8, 2001, SOFS received notice that the HCA was terminating all of SOFS\u2019s Medicaid contracts. This letter was followed by notice that SOFS was being put on an \u201con review\u201d status mandating manual billing procedures on January 10, 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">(1 Appellants\u2019 App. at 85.) As we held in <em>Marx v. Schnuck Markets, America, Inc., </em>an inference of retaliatory motive may be drawn from \u201cprotected conduct closely followed by adverse action\u201d combined with a pattern of actions taken by defendants. 76 F.3d 324, 329 (10th Cir.1996) (Fair Labor Standards Act case).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">Defendants also contend that the district court\u2019s finding cannot stand because there is no direct evidence that any defendants had \u201cknowledge of Mr. Evan\u2019s [sic ] lobbying efforts or his letter to the Governor,\u201d and \u201cit is difficult to understand why an agency official would retaliate when a lobbyist attempts to garner monies for an agency which Mr. Evans stated that he did.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 22.) However, there is evidence in the record that defendant Dana Brown, HCA\u2019s legislative liaison, told Evans that he \u201cneed[ed] to leave them alone, she and the Health Care Authority. She did not want to meet with [Evans] when [they] met with the representative Randall Erwin and the Health Care Authority....\u201d (2 Appellants\u2019 App. at 261 (Evans\u2019s testimony).)</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">Moreover, defendants\u2019 contention that they would have no retaliatory motive because Evans was engaged in garnering money for the HCA disregards evidence that Evans was a \u201cthorn in the side\u201d of the HCA. (2 <em>id. </em>at 204 (Evans\u2019s testimony).) Evans testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-10\">We lobbied for and actually helped the Health Care Authority receive state funds of $500,000 which are used to be matching funds from the federal government to pay private providers for the reduction in services that the Health Care Authority had implemented six to seven months prior. When that money never was applied to the private providers, then I lobbied the legislature as to why and where the money went, as Tex-oma was abruptly without any warning not awarded its contract after.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">(2 <em>id. </em>at 203.) Evans also testified that the Medicaid contracts of other lobbyists were also \u201cabruptly closed.\u201d (2 <em>id. </em>at 204N05.) Furthermore, contrary to defendants\u2019 contention that there is no evidence that they knew Evans was connected to SOFS prior to the October and November 2000 audits of SOFS\u2019s facilities, there is evidence that Brown told Evans that his \u201cassociation with Texoma had directly influenced the Health Care Authority\u2019s decision with Southeastern .... \u201c (2 <em>id. </em>at 262 (Evans\u2019s testimony).)</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">Defendants\u2019 second contention also hinges on a factual determination made by the district court. They claim that absent the protected conduct, defendants would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>have taken the same administrative actions. <em>See Kent, </em>252 F.Bd at 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">A successful defense that the government would have terminated a contract regardless of the protected conduct absolves the government officials of liability. In <em>Umbehr, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe government can' escape liability by showing that it would have taken the same action even in the absence of the protected conduct.\u201d 518 U.S. at 675. Such a defense must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Ballard v. Muskogee Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>238 F.3d 1250, 1253 (10th Cir.2001) (\u201cThe public employer\u2019s \u2018anyway1 defense \u2014 if established by a preponderance of the evidence \u2014 acts as an absolute bar to liability, not merely a factor in awarding damages.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Specifically, defendants claim that the district court \u201cignored the compelling testimony of Ms. Jana Webb.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 25.) Webb testified that she, as supervisor of the Surveillance Utilization Review Systems, \u201cmake[s] decision about what cases get reviewed.\u201d (2 Appellants\u2019 App. at 336; <em>see </em>2 <em>id. </em>at 342.) Webb further stated that she received complaints from SOFS employees regarding possibly fraudulent backdating of \u201cintakes\u201d (2 <em>id. </em>at 366, 369); \u201cbilling a service through a different provider number\u201d (2 <em>id. </em>at 371); and other questionable conduct (2 <em>id. </em>at 374-76).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">SOFS itself admitted that it had some \u201cinternal [record-keeping] problems\u201d that it had to address. (3 <em>id. </em>at 506 (Feb. 1, 2001 letter from SOFS to HCA).) Although the testimony cited by defendants certainly does not cut in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, it does not constitute conclusive proof that the HCA would have taken the same administrative actions. Probative on this issue are (1) the fact that, despite SOFS\u2019s troubles, the HCA eventually chose to \u201csuspend the termination of SOFS\u2019s Medicaid contracts\u201d (1 <em>id. </em>at 82 (Feb. 12, 2001 order)), and (2) evidence that the region served by SOFS \u201cis lacking in the necessary facilities to treat a growing population of mentally and behaviorally ill individuals\u201d (Appellees\u2019 Br. at 13).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">Defendants put forth a last set of claims, beginning with their assertion that the district court erred in concluding that \u201cplaintiffs have shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits with regard to their due process claim as well.\u201d (1 Appellants\u2019 App. at 87.) Since the injunction was issued, the district court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 due process claim, and, for purposes of this appeal, plaintiffs concede this point. Because the district court concluded that the First Amendment claim would likely prevail on the merits, however, defendants\u2019 due-process contention is a non-issue. Defendants further contend that the district court incorrectly ruled that the Oklahoma Uniform Commercial Code, Okla. Stat. tit. 12A, \u00a7 1-203, imposed upon them a duty of good faith. This conclusion, however, relates to the district court\u2019s treatment of plaintiffs\u2019 due process claim, and we thus need not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">Finally, defendants claim that the district court \u201cincorrectly concluded federal statutory claims legally supported SOFS\u2019 claims.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 27.) The district court concluded that although some of plaintiffs\u2019 statutory claims \u201cmay not be successful,\u201d plaintiffs nevertheless showed \u201ca likelihood of success on the remainder of the claims.\u201d (1 Appellants\u2019 App. at 88.) Specifically, the district court held that \u201c[t]he rights guaranteed by 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.230 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6009 appear to be infringed by defendants[\u2019] actions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>(footnote omitted).) Defendants say nothing about 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.230, and their only argument regarding 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>\u00a7 6009 is that it has been repealed. This was acknowledged by the district court, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-4\">[Title] 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6009 was repealed by Act of October 30, 2000, Pub.L. No. 106-402 \u00a7 401. However, the rights previously codified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6009 are substantially reinstated in Pub.L. No. 106-402 \u00a7 109. The Court presumes the plaintiffs wish to bring their action under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">(1 <em>id. </em>at 88 n. 4.)
