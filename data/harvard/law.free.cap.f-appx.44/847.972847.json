We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 815-16 (9th Cir.1994), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-28\">Bui contends summary judgment was improper because she did not prepare the income tax returns at issue, notwith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>standing that her name and social security number appears on each return as the paid preparer. This contention lacks merit. Bui admitted that she either voluntarily signed returns she did not personally examine and/or was aware that her name was being signed by someone else. The district court properly held that Bui\u2019s signature and social security number constituted a declaration under penalty of perjury that she personally verified that the information on the return was correct and therefore subjected her to the penalty for preparers who understate a taxpayer\u2019s liability. <em>See </em>IRS Form 1040, Declaration of Paid Preparer; <em>see also </em>I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6065 and 6694.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Bui also contends that because she did not receive any compensation for preparing the tax returns, she cannot be considered a preparer under I.R.C. \u00a7 7701(a)(36). This contention also lacks merit. The district court properly found that Bui did receive compensation for the preparation of tax returns because she was licensed by the City of Seattle as the sole proprietor of the tax preparation business which received compensation. Under Washington state community property law, she had an undivided one-half interest in the business and its revenues. <em>See Dean v. Lehman, </em>148 Wash.2d 12, 19, 18 P.3d 523 (2001) (en banc); <em>see also </em>Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 26.16.030.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Bui\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b883-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
