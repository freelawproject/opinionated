Lumpkin appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his conviction and 240-month sentence for conspiracy to distribute cocaine base and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of Lumpkin\u2019s motion to vacate, <em>see United States v. Chacon-Palomares, </em>208 F.3d 1157, 1158 (9th Cir. 2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-23\">Lumpkin argues that his counsel at trial provided ineffective assistance by failing to object, and seek severance based upon, the introduction of evidence of the confession by Lumpkin\u2019s non-testifying co-defendant, evidence which implicated Lumpkin in vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>lation of <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Lumpkin must show that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In this case, there was no clear <em>Bruton </em>violation. Moreover, the record overwhelmingly links Lumpkin to a conspiracy to distribute cocaine base and aiding and abetting. Lumpkin was not only observed by law enforcement agents assisting a drug trafficking transaction, but the testimony of a drug courier deta\u00f1ed Lumpkin\u2019s specific involvement in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Thus, regardless of whether or not the evidence of the co-defendant\u2019s confession may have violated <em>Bruton, </em>taking into consideration the rest of the evidence against Lumpkin, it is not reasonably probable that the outcome of the trial would have been different, and there was no prejudice. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Lumpkin\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b282-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
