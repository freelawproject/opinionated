Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In 1989, the Wisconsin legislature created the Special Action Release parole program (\u201cSAR\u201d) to address overcrowding in the state\u2019s prisons. <em>See </em>Wis. Stat. \u00a7 304.02 (West 1990). Through SAR, prisoners can obtain the opportunity for early release if they meet enumerated statutory criteria. <em>Id. </em>In addition, \u00a7 304.02 directs the Wisconsin Department of Corrections <em>(\u201cDOC\u201d) to </em>establish its own regulations for selecting inmates for release through an administrative procedure. The DOC obliged by drafting Wis. Admin. Code \u00a7 DOC 302.32(3)(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">In this consolidated appeal from the denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, four Wisconsin prisoners claim to be entitled to release under SAR. The petitioners admit that they do not satisfy either the statutory or DOC regulatory criteria. But, they say, the DOC\u2019s \u00a7 302.32 perverts the legislature\u2019s parole program because its criteria is more exclusionary than the legislature intended. If the DOC had promulgated appropriately broad criteria, claim the petitioners, they would have satisfied the criteria and been released. They therefore asked the district court to order the release to which \u00a7 304.02 allegedly entitled them.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The district court parsed \u00a7 304.02\u2019s language in detail and decided that the statute vested discretion in DOC officials to determine which prisoners could participate in SAR. Therefore, ruled the district court, the statute did not create a constitutionally protected right or entitlement to parole or early release. See <em>Greenholtz v. Inmates of the Neb. Penal and Corr. Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 11-12, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979) (prisoner\u2019s interest in parole has no due process protection unless state creates right or entitlement to parole, as opposed to hope or expectation). Without a constitutionally protected right, petitioners did not have a cognizable claim to habeas corpus relief. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Pursuant to Rule 4 of the Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 Petitions, the district court dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Because the court resolved this case under Rule 4, the respondent did not appear in the case below. On appeal, however, the state challenges the petitioners\u2019 standing to assert their \u00a7 2254 claim. We address this issue before turning to the merits because standing is a jurisdictional question. <em>See United States v. Hays, </em>515 U.S. 737, 742, 115 S.Ct. 2431, 132 L.Ed.2d 635 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">The respondent contends that the petitioners lack standing because they were all convicted of \u201cassaultive crimes\u201d; both the SAR statute and DOC regulations expressly exclude prisoners convicted of assaultive crimes from the SAR program. <em>See </em>Wis. Stat. \u00a7 304.02; Wis. Admin. Code \u00a7 DOC 302.32(3)(a)(4). Therefore, argues the respondent, the petitioners were never eligible for SAR and they could not be harmed by the DOC\u2019s allegedly infirm administration of it. <em>See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (standing requires plaintiff to have suffered \u201cinjury in fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">The respondent\u2019s contention misses a subtlety of the petitioners\u2019 argument. The petitioners do not claim to be entitled to release under SAR as it now stands. Rather, they claim that the Wisconsin legislature\u2019s express intent in \u00a7 304.02 requires the DOC\u2019s regulations to be rewritten so that they would be entitled to release under SAR. They challenge SAR\u2019s current parameters exactly because the program\u2019s regulations were written to exclude them, and that gives them standing. <em>See City of Chicago v. Lindley, </em>66 F.3d 819, 828 n. 11 (7th Cir.1995) (city had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>standing to challenge state agency\u2019s allegedly discriminatory implementation of federal statute because implementation caused it harm). Thus, the petitioners have standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">As to the merits of the petitioners\u2019 claims, the district court\u2019s decision was admirably reasoned and thorough. Having reviewed the record and petitioners\u2019 appellate arguments, we adopt the district court\u2019s opinion rejecting the petitioners\u2019 contention that they are entitled to participate in SAR. As the district court recognized, nothing in \u00a7 304.02 entitles the petitioners to early release or required the DOC to draft its SAR criteria so that the petitioners would be so entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
