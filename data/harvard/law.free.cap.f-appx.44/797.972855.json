We review de novo the denial of a section 2254 petition, <em>Forrest v. Vasquez, </em>75 F.3d 562, 563 (9th Cir.1996), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-23\">Davis contends that the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s denial without comment of his petition for review was a ruling on the merits, demonstrating he has exhausted his available state remedies. Having reviewed the record, we agree with the district court that circumstances indicate Davis\u2019 petition was denied on procedural grounds for failing to fairly present the issues for review and answer to the Washington Supreme Court, in accordance with Washington\u2019s Rules of Appellate Procedure. <em>See Kibler v. Walters, </em>220 F.3d 1151, 1153 (9th Cir.2000) (as amended), <em>cert, denied, </em>531 U.S. 1086, 121 S.Ct. 795, 148 L.Ed.2d 689 (2001). As a result, Davis has not provided the Washington Supreme Court an opportunity to address his claims, and accordingly has failed to ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>haust his state remedies. <em>See Forrest, </em>75 F.3d at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b833-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-24\">. Because we denied Davis' April 2, 2001 motion to expand his certificate of appealability (\"COA\u201d), we decline to address Davis' claims that fall outside the scope of the original COA issued by the district court on March 13, 2001. <em>See Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1103 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
