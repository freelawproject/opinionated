We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo, <em>see Tripati v. Henman, </em>843 F.2d 1160, 1162 (9th Cir.1988), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Ortiz-Martinez has filed three unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motions in Missouri district court. The first motion was denied on the merits, and the other two were deemed successive motions which the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to certify. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. Ortiz-Martinez then filed a \u00a7 2241 petition in California district court, the district of his incarceration, contending that Section 2255 was inadequate or ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Ortiz-Martinez essentially argues that any further Section 2255 motion would be prohibited as successive, therefore, Section 2255 is an inadequate or ineffective remedy as applied to him. However, this court has made clear that \u201c \u00a7 2241 is not available under the inadequate-or-ineffective-remedy escape hatch of \u00a7 2255 merely because the court of appeals refuses to certify a second or successive motion under the gatekeeping provisions of \u00a7 2555.\u201d <em>Lor-entsen v. Hood, </em>223 F.3d 950, 953 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Moreover, \u00a7 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective because the sentencing court denied relief on the merits. <em>See Tripati </em>843 F.2d at 1162. Ortiz-Martinez has failed to carry his burden of showing that a \u00a7 2255 motion would be inadequate or ineffective. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed his petition for habeas corpus without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b842-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
