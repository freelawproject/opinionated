Farfan Lopez, a citizen of Guatemala, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 denial of his application for asylum and withholding of deportation. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-24\">The BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum must be upheld if \u201c \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>sidered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zaca-rias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 88 (1992) (citation omitted). \u201cIt can be reversed only if the evidence presented ... was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When an alien seeks to overturn the BIA\u2019s adverse determination, \u201che must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488-84, 112 S.Ct. at 817; <em>see also Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Where an asylum claim is involved, an alien must show either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution that is \u201cboth subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc). Where the BIA determines that the alien was subjected to persecution in the past, a presumption that he has a well-founded fear of future prosecution arises. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1); <em>Borya v. INS, </em>175 F.3d 732, 737-38 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc). The presumption can be rebutted by the INS upon a showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the alien could avoid future persecution by relocating within his own country. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(B); <em>Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 991 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Borja, </em>175 F.3d at 738; <em>Cuadras v. INS, </em>910 F.2d 567, 571 n. 2 (9th Cir.1990); <em>Quintanilla-Ticas v. INS, </em>783 F.2d 955, 957 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The BIA did determine that Farfan had suffered past persecution. However, it also determined that, based upon the country report<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the other evidence of record, (such as Farfan\u2019s demonstrated ability to escape persecution by moving to live with his relatives in Guatemala City) the INS had rebutted the presumption that Farfan had a well-founded fear of future persecution. We are not able to say that the record compels a contrary conclusion. Moreover, we cannot say that the past treatment of Farfan by the guerillas \u2014 a one-time beating that did not cause any severe injuries or require hospitalization\u2014 was so atrocious that he should have been granted asylum despite his lack of a well-founded fear. <em>See Kumar v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 931, 935 (9th Cir.2000); <em>In re Chen, </em>20 I. &amp; N.
