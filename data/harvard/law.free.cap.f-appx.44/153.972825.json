Morales appeals the decision of the administrative law judge\u2019s denial of social security disability benefits and the district court\u2019s granting partial summary judgment to appellee. We have jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>tion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The ALJ rejected Morales\u2019 testimony on the degree of her impairment and limitations as not credible. The district court found that the ALJ\u2019s reasons did not specifically cite to the record, but nonetheless found that the credibility finding was supported by other evidence in the ALJ\u2019s findings. The district court upheld the ALJ\u2019s finding on Morales\u2019 lack of credibility</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">On this issue of credibility of a social security disability claimant, this court\u2019s analysis in <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821 (9th Cir.1995) is on point. In <em>Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 834, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">For the ALJ to reject the claimant\u2019s complaints, she must provide \u201cspecific, cogent reasons for the disbelief.\u201d <em>Rashad v. Sullivan, </em>903 F.2d 1229, 1231 (9th Cir.1990). Once the claimant produces medical evidence of an underlying impairment, the Commissioner may not discredit the claimant\u2019s testimony as to subjective symptoms merely because they are unsupported by objective evidence. <em>Bunnell v. Sullivan, </em>947 F.2d 341, 343 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc); <em>see also Cotton v. Bowen, </em>799 F.2d 1403, 1407 (9th Cir.1986) (\u201cit is improper as a matter of law to discredit excess pain testimony solely on the ground that it is not fully corroborated by objective medical findings\u201d). Unless there is affirmative evidence showing that the claimant is malingering, the Commissioner\u2019s reasons for rejecting the claimant\u2019s testimony must be \u201cclear and convincing.\u201d <em>Swenson v. Sullivan, </em>876 F.2d 683, 687 (9th Cir.1989). General findings are insufficient; rather, the ALJ must identify what testimony is not credible and what evidence undermines the claimant\u2019s complaints. <em>Dodrill v. Shalala, </em>12 F.3d 915, 918 (9th Cir.1993); <em>Varney v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>846 F.2d 581, 584 (9th Cir.1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">In the present case, the ALJ failed to provide the prerequisite clear and convincing findings as to why Morales\u2019 testimony should be discredited. The ALJ also failed to specifically identify what testimony is not credible and what evidence undermines Morales\u2019 complaints. When these flaws are considered along with the minimal activity level of Morales included in the record, it is clear the ALJ erred in discrediting her testimony in the manner he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">As the district court correctly recognized, the ALJ also erred in failing to fully complete the five-step sequential procedure used in evaluating disability benefit claims. <em>See Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 720 (9th Cir.1998); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. Relevant to the case at hand is the fact that step four and five require the ALJ to complete a function-by-function analysis of the claimant\u2019s work-related abilities and residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work. Social Security Ruling 96-8 and 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567. The ALJ failed to do so, and we hold that a finding of no disability is in error without this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">Therefore, this matter is remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b189-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
