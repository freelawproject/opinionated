The district court dismissed the complaint prior to service, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2), for failure to state a claim. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">For the purpose of determining whether Walton stated a claim, we assume the truth of his allegations. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989) (dismissal for failure to state claim is warranted where \u201cit is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations\u201d (internal quotation and citation omitted)). Walton is confined at Varner Super Max Unit (VSMU). In November 2000, with the help of a jailhouse lawyer several cells away, Walton filed a prior lawsuit <em>(Walton </em>I) about a severe beating he had received in August 2000. In the midst of the lawsuit, prison administrators directed officers to stop their routine practice of \u201cpassing\u201d documents from cell to cell. When Walton told a correction officer that the materials Walton wanted \u201cpassed\u201d related to legal matters, the officer responded: \u201c[T]hat is what they especially want to stop from being passed,\u201d and \u201clegal materials was [sic] emphasi[z]ed to [officers] as something not to pass.\u201d Walton thus lost assistance from a jailhouse lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">ADC does not provide attorneys to help VSMU prisoners with civil cases, and VSMU prisoners cannot personally visit the law library. VSMU prisoners may request materials from the library on a blank form, but the request must specifically identify the item requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">A magistrate judge recommended dismissal of <em>Walton I </em>as frivolous and for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Without the assistance of his jailhouse lawyer, Walton could not understand the recommendation and \u201cwithdrew\u201d his complaint. Subsequently, Walton was able to re-establish communication with his jailhouse lawyer, in violation of prison rules. He learned from the jailhouse lawyer that he had not needed to dismiss the <em>Walton I </em>complaint, but could have remedied the exhaustion problem by excising some complaint paragraphs relating to non-central claims. He thereafter refiled <em>Walton I, </em>but would not have done so properly without the illicit help. As a consequence of the delay, valuable evidence \u2014 which included VSMU video recordings and ambulance reports \u2014 was destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">We review de novo dismissals under section 1915(e)(2)(B). <em>See Moore v. Sims, </em>200 F.3d 1170, 1171 (8th Cir.2000) (per cu-riam). While an inmate does not have \u201can abstract, freestanding right to a law li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>brary or legal assistance,\u201d he must have \u201ca reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed violations of fundamental constitutional rights to the courts.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (internal quotation and citation omitted). To prevail on an access-to-courts claim, an inmate must show actual injury, that is: \u201cdemonstrate that the alleged shortcomings in the library or legal assistance program hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim\u201d; \u201cdemonstrate that a nonfrivolous legal claim had been frustrated or was being impeded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 352-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Once prison administrators implemented the ban on \u201cpassing\u201d legal documents, they limited Walton\u2019s legal resources to a library to which he had no direct access and from which he was required to request specific materials on a blank form. Walton \u2014 who was untrained and inexperienced in the law \u2014 accordingly lacked a reasonably adequate opportunity to present his claim. Specifically, his pursuit of <em>Walton I </em>was hindered in three respects. First, based on ignorance of a technical requirement he could not have known, he withdrew <em>Walton I </em>under threat of dismissal by the district court. <em>See Lewis, </em>518 U.S. at 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174 (inmate may show actual injury by showing \u201cthat a complaint he prepared was dismissed for failure to satisfy some technical requirement which, because of deficiencies in the prison\u2019s legal assistance facilities, he could not have known\u201d). Second, he could not have properly refiled without violating prison rules. Third, the delay in his ability to pursue <em>Walton I </em>allowed the destruction of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the district court for further proceedings. On remand, the district court should appoint counsel to assist Walton.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
