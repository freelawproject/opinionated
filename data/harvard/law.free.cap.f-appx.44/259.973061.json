R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b295-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-16\">Steven Seman Hattar appeals his 262-month sentence following his guilty plea to conspiracy to possess methamphetamine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Defendant\u2019s attorney has moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Hattar has not filed a supplemental pro se brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-17\">The <em>Anders </em>brief identifies and rejects three potential issues. First, counsel correctly acknowledges that there is no indication that Hattar\u2019s guilty plea was involuntary, unknowing, or incompetent. <em>See United States v. Aguilar-Muniz, </em>156 F.3d 974, 976-77 (9th Cir.1998) (discussing district court\u2019s compliance with Rule 11); <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -,---, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 1046, 1054-55, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002) (establishing defendant\u2019s burden to show plain error in light of the entire record).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-24\">Second, counsel concludes that the government complied with its obligations under the plea agreement, and the record supports this assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-25\">Third, counsel raises, and correctly rejects as an issue for appeal, the district court\u2019s denial of a downward departure based on Hattar\u2019s lack of knowledge or control of the purity of the methamphetamine. That discretionary ruling is unre-viewable. <em>See United States v. Lipman, </em>133 F.3d 726, 729 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-26\">Our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988) discloses no issues for review. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b295-27\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b295-37\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
