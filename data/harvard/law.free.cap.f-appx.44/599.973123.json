Before the trip, each student had to sign and obtain a parent\u2019s signature on an authorization form that stated, inter alia, that any student who possessed, distributed, purchased or consumed alcoholic beverages while on the trip would \u201close their privileges to participate in Commencement Exercises\u201d and possibly \u201cforfeit all rights as members of their class.\u201d The student plaintiffs here were allowed to graduate but as punishment for their alcohol consumption, were excluded from graduation exercises.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Plaintiffs, through their attorney, Samuel Malat, filed a complaint on June 15, 1998, and an amended complaint on November 23, 1998, alleging the school board and various school officials violated their constitutional rights by denying their participation in the graduation ceremony. Parent plaintiffs alleged they suffered emotional distress as a result of their inability to attend their children\u2019s high school graduation. Plaintiffs essentially alleged six causes of action: (1) an equal protection claim on behalf of the student plaintiffs; (2) a religious freedom claim on behalf of the student plaintiffs; (3) a due process claim on behalf of the student plaintiffs; (4) an emotional distress claim on behalf of student Todd Evans; (5) an emotional distress claim on behalf of parent plaintiffs; and (6) a retaliation claim on behalf of Elizabeth Carlino.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Carlino v. Gloucester City High Sch., </em>57 F.Supp.2d 1, 16 (D.N.J.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">On February 2, 1999, the District Court issued an Order to Show Cause requiring plaintiffs\u2019 counsel \u201cto show cause why ... sanctions should not be imposed against [him] pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, and the Court\u2019s inherent powers\u201d for filing frivolous claims. The District Court waited six months, until August 2, 1999, before imposing sanctions upon Malat.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The District Court found the amended complaint, signed by Malat, contained three \u201cpatently frivolous\u201d claims that were statutorily barred. The court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-11\">Mr. Malat has conducted absolutely no legal research whatsoever regarding these claims at any time before or during the pendency of this litigation. \u201cEven a casual investigation, let alone the reasonable inquiry required by Rule 11, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(b), would have revealed\u201d that the New Jersey Statutes Annotated prohibit both emotional distress claims and the CEPA [Conscientious Employee Protection Act] claim. Such a flagrant failure to conduct any legal research violates Mr. Malat\u2019s obligations under Rule 11(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">The District Court stated \u201cthe combination of a monetary and a nonmonetary sanction would best deter future similar conduct\u201d and ordered Malat to attend two continuing legal education courses within eighteen months, and pay a $500 fine. <em>Id. </em>at 39. Malat\u2019s only argument on appeal is that the District Court violated Fed. R.Civ.P. 11(c)(1)(A) by not providing a \u201csafe harbor\u201d letter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the sanctions were imposed under Rule 11(c)(1)(B), which has no safe harbor provision. Rule 11(c)(1)(B) clearly provides that \u201c[o]n its own initiative, the court may enter an order describing the specific conduct that appears to violate subdivision (b)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>recting an attorney, law firm, or party to show cause why it has not violated subdivision (b) with respect thereto.\u201d Malat erroneously relies on an inapposite provision, Rule 11(c)(1)(A) (upon motion by other party), instead of Rule 11(c)(1)(b), when the court files an order to show cause \u201con its own initiative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Additionally, the District Court\u2019s February 2, 1999 Order to Show Cause and the six months the court waited before imposing sanctions provided Malat with \u201cnotice and a reasonable opportunity to respond.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(c). The District Court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b636-21\">.

Counts seven through ten were dismissed for failure to state a claim, \u201cbecause these claims [did] not even satisfy the minimal pleading requirement set forth in Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d <em>Carli-no, </em>57 F.Supp.2d at 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\">. On the same day, August 2, 1999, the District Court filed an opinion addressing the claims. The court held that counts four, five and part of six were statutorily barred. The court disposed of counts one, three, and part of two on summary judgment. The remaining claims have since been resolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b637-14\">.
