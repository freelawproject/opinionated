INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b168-15\">In these related appeals, appellants contest the validity of their sentences. Appellant Jose Meza-Avila (\u201cMeza-Avila\u201d) challenges the district court\u2019s calculation of his base offense level. Appellants Jose Juan Cienfuegos-Bernal, aka Alfonso Morales-Moran (\u201cJose Juan\u201d), and Luis Ariel Cien-fuegos-Bernal, aka Arnulfo Payan-Perez (\u201cLuis Ariel\u201d), appeal two-level upward role adjustments. We have jurisdiction over these timely appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We VACATE the sentences imposed on Meza-Avila and Jose Juan and REMAND for resentencing. We AFFIRM the sentence imposed on Luis Ariel.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-16\">II. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-17\">Sometime in 1998, Portland, Oregon law enforcement agencies recognized a pattern among individuals arrested for drug-related crimes. Arrestees identified their city of origin as Tepic, Mexico. Many were smuggled into the United States by \u201ccoyotes.\u201d The individuals then worked as low-level distributors of heroin and cocaine and were given cars, temporary residences, pagers, cellular phones, and $200-300 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-18\">In March 1999, FBI agents in cities across the country began \u201cOperation Tar-pit,\u201d an investigation into a Mexican drug ring based in Tepic. By January 2000, Portland agencies joined the investigation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Portland officers compiled data about the structure of the distribution network in their area, performed undercover \u201cbuys,\u201d learned about the activities and roles of dealers, and identified the participants most closely associated with the upper echelons of the conspiracy. During the investigation, agents made two $100 heroin purchases from Meza-Avila.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">All three appellants were members of this drug distribution group operating out of the Portland area. Four low-level \u201crunners,\u201d including Meza-Avila, occupied the bottom rung of the conspiracy. Above the runners were \u201cmid-level\u201d and \u201cmid-to-high-level\u201d dealers who controlled the residences from which drugs were distributed and oversaw the daily flow of drugs and money. Agents considered appellants Jose Juan and Luis Ariel \u201cpeers\u201d and \u201cmid-to-high-level\u201d dealers responsible for managing at least two \u201cmid-level\u201d dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In June 2000, Portland agents executed a series of search warrants, resulting in appellants\u2019 arrests. On June 15, Meza-Avila was arrested at a Portland area home along with another \u201clow-level runner.\u201d At that location, police recovered 0.3 grams of cocaine and $409.00 in cash. That same day, Jose Juan and Luis Ariel were arrested at a different home in the Portland area along with two mid-level managers. At that location, police unearthed approximately one kilogram of heroin buried in the backyard, found a loaded handgun in the kitchen, recovered $216.00 in cash, and detected trace amounts of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Appellants were charged along with over thirty other co-defendants in a multi-count indictment. On December 14, 2000, Meza-Avila pled guilty to use of a telephone in causing or facilitating the distribution of a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). On March 27, 2001, Jose Juan and Luis Ariel pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">A. Jose Meza-Avila</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">Meza-Avila asserts that the district court applied the wrong legal standard when calculating the amount of drugs attributable to him for purposes of sentencing. We review interpretations of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Jordan, </em>256 F.3d 922, 926 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">For a defendant to be accountable for an amount of drugs, the sentencing guidelines require direct involvement or, in cases of \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity,\u201d that the amount be reasonably foreseeable and within the scope of the defendant\u2019s agreement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 app. note 2 (2000). The guidelines do not invariably hold defendants accountable for the total amount of drugs involved in a conspiracy. <em>United States v. Garcia-Sanchez, </em>189 F.3d 1143, 1147 (9th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Petty, </em>982 F.2d 1374, 1376 (9th Cir.1993); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 app. note 2 (2000) (\u201c[T]he scope of the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant ... is not necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy .... \u201d). A defendant\u2019s sentence cannot be based on the sales of other conspirators absent \u201csome interest in, agreement regarding, or involvement with\u201d those sales. <em>See Garcia-Sanchez, </em>189 F.3d at 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">Here, the district court improperly attributed the total amount of drugs connected with the conspiracy to Meza-Avila merely because the evidence showed he was a co-conspirator. At the sentencing hearing, the district court stated \u201cthat there is certainly adequate reference in the presentence report that [Meza-Avila] was part of an organization, although, like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>many and most people in an extensive and large conspiracy, had minor roles.\u201d In a Fact-Finding Order, the court \u201cfound there was enough information in the Pre-sentence Report to connect [Meza-Avila] to the drug organization.\u201d These statements show that the district court held Meza-Avila accountable for the total amount of drugs due to his involvement in the conspiracy, not because the quantity of drugs was foreseeable and within the scope of his particular agreement with co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">As these are the only reasons stated by the district court for holding Meza-Avila accountable, we conclude that it applied the wrong legal standard and erred as a matter of law. Accordingly, we VACATE Meza-Avila\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing on an open record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">B. Jose Juan Cienfuegos-Bemal</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Jose Juan contends his two-level role adjustment rests upon unreliable and conclusory statements in the PSR. We review imposition of a role adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(e) \u201cand ancillary or supportive findings of fact\u201d for clear error. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>291 F.3d 1091, 1097 (9th Cir.2002); <em>United, States v. Salcido-Corrales, </em>249 F.3d 1151, 1154 (9th Cir. 2001) <em>(citing United States v. Maldonado, </em>215 F.3d 1046, 1050 (9th Cir.2000)). The district court\u2019s determination about a PSR\u2019s reliability is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>258 F.3d 971, 976 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Marin-Cuevas, </em>147 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">1. Section 3Bl.l(c) role-adjustment</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) establishes when an \u201caggravating role\u201d warrants an upward adjustment. Id<footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>For a two-level role adjustment, the government must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant either \u201cexercised some control over others involved in the commission of the offense [or was] responsible for organizing others for the purpose of carrying out a crime.\u201d <em>Salcido-Corrales, </em>249 F.3d at 1154 (internal quotations omitted) (alterations in original) <em>(quoting United States v. Harper, </em>33 F.3d 1143, 1151 (9th Cir.1994)); <em>United States v. Syrax, </em>235 F.3d 422, 427 (9th Cir.2000). The enhancement applies if the government proves one incident where the defendant exercised authority over or directed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>actions of even one participant. <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>238 F.3d 1180, 1186-87 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Salcido-Corrales, </em>249 F.3d at 1154; <em>United States v. Maldonado, </em>215 F.3d 1046, 1050 (9th Cir.2000). Therefore, a defendant who \u201corganizes others in the commission of the criminal activity\u201d may receive a role enhancement \u201ceven though he does not retain a supervisory role over the other participants.\u201d <em>United States v. Montano, </em>250 F.3d 709, 716 (9th Cir.2001) <em>(quoting United States v. Varela, </em>993 F.2d 686, 691-92 (9th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">2. Use of a PSR</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In lieu of specific findings of fact, the district court may rely upon a PSR to support a \u00a7 3B 1.1(c) role enhancement by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>291 F.3d 1091, 1098 n. 9 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Maldonado, </em>215 F.3d at 1051. However, the PSR\u2019s statements must first have \u201csome minimal indicia of reliability\u201d supporting their probable accuracy. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>258 F.3d 971, 976 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 569 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc). Reliability depends on several factors, such as whether the source (1) had any reason to prevaricate, <em>see United States v. Marin-Cuevas, </em>147 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir.1998), (2) possessed first hand knowledge of the events, <em>see United States v. Garcia-Sanchez, </em>189 F.3d 1143, 1149 (9th Cir.1999), or (3) was subject to cross-examination, see <em>id. </em>In addition, we look for other evidence to corroborate the challenged statements. <em>See Jordan, </em>291 F.3d at 1098 n. 9; <em>United States v. Petty, 982 F.2d </em>1365, 1367 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">For example, we found unreliable a vengeful ex-wife\u2019s double hearsay statement that relayed an alleged statement by a young child. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>41 F.3d 496, 499-501 (9th Cir.1994). Neither the ex-wife\u2019s nor the child\u2019s statements were subject to cross-examination, and the district court did not know the conditions under which the statements were made. <em>Id. </em>Likewise, in a drug conspiracy case, an agent\u2019s estimation of the drugs attributable to the defendant was unreliable because he lacked first hand knowledge about the operation of the conspiracy, never explained the basis for his estimates, did not identify his hearsay sources, failed to produce contemporaneous reports, and was never subject to cross-examination. <em>Garcia-Sanchez, </em>189 F.3d at 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">District courts also may not rely upon conclusory assertions in a PSR. An assertion is conclusory if it simply proffers a conclusion without providing specific factual support, <em>see United States v. Harper, </em>33 F.3d 1143, 1151 (9th Cir.1994), <em>United States v. Gamez-Orduno, </em>235 F.3d 453, 464 (9th Cir.2000), or because it does not identify the source of its information. <em>Jordan, </em>291 F.3d at 1098 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">In <em>Harper, </em>the PSR stated that \u201cHarper, being a former employee of both Bank of America and Pedcom, organized this scheme [to commit bank robbery]. Information obtained during the FBI investigation indicated that she was instrumental in planning and organizing the robbery.\u201d 33 F.3d at 1151. We concluded there was insufficient grounds to impose a two-level role adjustment because there was no reference \u201cto any specific facts that indicated that Harper exercised control over or organized others in committing this crime.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">The PSR in <em>Jordan </em>contained greater detail, but failed to provide any \u201cbasis for [its] assertions, such as hearsay statements from other persons even outside the trial record .... \u201d 291 F.3d at 1098 n. 9. The PSR stated that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>appears to have maintained control over the residence where the lab was found. He procured and maintained the laboratory equipment. He recruited his nephew ... to serve as a look-out at the lab site .... He instructed John Rowuin to contact one of the witnesses in this ease to obtain information about the investigation thereby suggesting he exercised some influence over Rowuin.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The district court abused its discretion by imposing a role adjustment without requiring some support for these statements. <em>Id. </em>A PSR should identify some meaningful factual basis upon which the district court can rest its own findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">3. Jose Juan\u2019s PSR</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Jose Juan\u2019s PSR stated that, according to agents, the bottom of the distribution ring was occupied by four low-level runners. Two mid-level managers supervised the residences and the daily flow of drugs and money.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">Above those two were [appellant Jose Juan] and [his brother] .... [Jose Juan] spent the majority of his time in Mexico during this investigation, but came to Portland from Mexico, just before the search warrant [was executed on June 15, 2000].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">The case agent categorized [his] status as a \u2018mid-to-high level dealer\u2019 in this drug distribution network, who managed the daily flow of drugs and money .... According to the case agent, [Jose Juan] and [his brother] were peers. They were in control of the heroin seized from [his brother\u2019s] residence on June 15, 2000, and supervised its distribution by [the mid-level managers], who in turn supervised the drug activities of low-level distributors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">These statements are conclusory and unreliable. While the PSR refers to agents or case agent as the source of its information, it fails to indicate how and from whom the agents obtained such information. Nor does the PSR identify other corroborating evidence in support thereof. Without any apparent evidentiary foundation for these statements, we cannot begin to assess their probable accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">As in <em>Jordan </em>where the PSR listed facts without any basis \u201csuch as hearsay statements ... even outside the trial record[J\u201d we do not know the basis for the agents\u2019 general description of Jose Juan as a \u201cmid-to-high-level manager,\u201d who \u201csupervised [drug] distribution by\u201d other mid-level managers. We cannot fairly characterize statements by the \u201ccase agent\u201d or \u201cagents\u201d as non-conclusory because we do not know whether the agents or some unknown de-clarant ever possessed personal knowledge of the relevant events.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">Moreover, similar to <em>Harper, </em>the PSR provides little specific factual information to support the conclusion that Jose Juan \u201csupervised\u201d or \u201cmanaged\u201d other co-defendants. The PSR simply asserts that he was \u201cabove\u201d two mid-level managers and \u201csupervised [drug] distribution ....\u201d The PSR does not explain what aspects of the \u201cdaily flow of drugs and money\u201d he allegedly controlled or how he exercised authority over any member of the conspiracy. The PSR never identifies the specific facts the agents relied upon when reaching their conclusions about appellant\u2019s status and role in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">We recognize, of course, that information need not be admissible under the rules of evidence to be relied upon at sentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a). Moreover, we recognize that district courts may rely upon hearsay at sentencing. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Berry, </em>258 F.3d 971, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>976 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Ponce, </em>51 F.3d 820, 828 (9th Cir.1995). Here, the defect is not 'that the statements in the PSR are hearsay, but rather the lack of foundation as to how the probation officer and/or the case agents came to know the matters asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">We conclude the district court abused its discretion by adopting unreliable and con-elusory statements in the PSR. We therefore VACATE Jose Juan\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing on an open record. In light of our conclusion, we need not reach the other issues raised by Jose Juan on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">C. Luis Ariel Cienfuegos-Bernal</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Luis Ariel challenges his PSR as unreliabile and conclusory. According to the PSR, Luis Ariel admitted during an FBI interview \u201cthat he ... paid a \u2018coyote\u2019 $2,000 \u2018all the time\u2019 to smuggle young men across the U.S. Mexico border. Those men then work[ed] for [him] distributing drugs once they arrive[d] in Portland.\u201d Luis Ariel contends the \u201ccoyote\u201d statement is unreliable because of the ease with which it could have been fabricated. Although he concedes it is an admission, he argues that we should treat such admissions as uncorroborated hearsay statements that cannot be considered at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Ponce, </em>51 F.3d 820, 828 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cWhile hearsay statements may be considered at sentencing, due process requires that such statements be corroborated by extrinsic evidence.\u201d). Yet as Luis Ariel recognizes, the PSR refers to an admission, not a hearsay statement. Unlike hearsay statements by others, which may be difficult to challenge or rebut, this portion of the PSR recites his own statements, which he could have readily challenged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Admissions by criminal defendants contain \u201csome minimal indicia of reliability,\u201d and Luis Ariel\u2019s statements would have been admissible had he proceeded to trial. In addition, the PSR drew the admissions from \u201can FBI report of an interview ... [conducted] shortly after his arrest.\u201d The FBI report is a contemporaneous record of his statements. <em>Cf. United States v. Marin-Cuevas, </em>147 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir.1998) (noting that \u201can investigative report prepared by Secret Service agents is admissible at sentencing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Luis Ariel next claims this admission \u201cdoes not allege that he exercised control over these individuals or that he was responsible for organizing them to carry out the crime.\u201d We disagree. From this admission, the district court could find by a preponderance of the evidence that he supervised the young men \u201cin the commission of the criminal activity.\u201d After all, he was their self-proclaimed boss.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>In light of appellant\u2019s admissions, his citation to <em>United States v. Graham, </em>162 F.3d 1180 (D.C.Cir.1998), is misplaced. The government in <em>Graham </em>relied solely upon the fact that the defendant was above the lowest rung of the drug distribution chain. <em>Id. </em>at 1184-85. Of course, a defendant\u2019s \u201cjob title\u201d within an organization does not prove authority or control over others. <em>Id. </em>at 1184. Here, Luis Ariel\u2019s PSR does not simply identify his nominative status in the Portland conspiracy. It includes admissions about his authority with respect to at least some co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Furthermore, the defendant in <em>Graham </em>was a \u201cwannabe\u201d \u2014 \u201ca barnacle clinging to the outer hull of middle management.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The record only showed that he sold drugs, worked closely with other people selling drugs, and \u201cwould point customers to the people carrying drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1184-85. Here, Luis Ariel had a role in hiring a \u201ccoyote\u201d and then exercised some authority over the men subsequently smuggled into the Portland area. Unlike <em>Graham, </em>he assumed a greater degree of responsibility for the success of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Consequently, we cannot say with a firm and definite conviction that Luis Ariel\u2019s admissions could not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he exercised authority over or directed the actions of at least one participant on at least one occasion. <em>See United States v. Morgan, </em>238 F.3d 1180, 1186-87 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision to impose a two-level role adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) was not clearly erroneous and is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we hereby VACATE the sentences of Jose Meza-Avila and Jose Juan Cienfuegos-Bernal and REMAND for resentencing on an open record. Luis Ariel Cienfuegos-Ber-nal\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b168-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-20\">. The following background is taken from the presentence reports (\"PSRs\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\">. Meza-Avila requests that we vacate and remand his sentence with instructions to fix the base offense level at 12 rather than 32. When a district court errs in sentencing, we generally remand \"for resentencing on an open record \u2014 that is, without limitation on the evidence that the district court may consider.\u201d <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>278 F.3d 880, 885 (9th Cir.2002). Because the district court's error stemmed from a misinterpretation of the sentencing guidelines, it has not yet considered the sufficiency of the evidence in the PSR with respect to whether some or all of the drug transactions may properly be attributed to appellant. Though Meza-Avila requests that we determine the issue on appeal, this is a matter that should be reserved for the district court\u2019s consideration in the first instance. We find no reason to depart from our practice of remanding on an open record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b170-11\">.

Though not raised on appeal, and apparently never argued before the district court, defense counsel wrote a letter to the probation officer challenging one aspect of this admission: \"[Luis Ariel] ... admits to having, on one occasion, given $1,000 to a \u2018coyote\u2019 as he was instructed to do.\u201d However, he never contested the statement that smuggled aliens worked for him distributing drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b173-9\">. The PSR also states that Luis Ariel \"admitted to managing a \u2018cell\u2019 of drug runners in the Portland area.\u201d Liberally construed, Luis Ariel contends that this is a conclusion lacking adequate factual support because the PSR does not identify the specific statements he purportedly made during the interview. Even if true, it does not change our conclusion because his \"coyote\u201d statement is itself sufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding. Moreover, Luis Ariel argued before the district court that \"his job [was] to instruct people where to go and who to meet over the phone.\u201d This level of participation appears sufficient for a two-level role adjustment as a manager or supervisor of other criminal participants. <em>Cf. United States v. Avila, </em>95 F.3d 887, 890-91 (9th Cir.1996) (reversing four-level role adjustment when evidence only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>showed that defendant acted as \"go-between\u201d for buyer and seller).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
