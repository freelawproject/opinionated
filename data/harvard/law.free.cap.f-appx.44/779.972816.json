INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 961 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc); <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995). We may reverse the BIA only if the evidence in the record <em>compels </em>a contrary result. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). To be eligible for asylum, Hasseis must show: (1) he was persecuted in the past on account of his Palestinian identity; or (2) he has a well-founded fear of future persecution in a particular country on account of his Palestinian identity. INA \u00a7 208(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b); <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (defining \u201crefugee\u201d). To be eligible for withholding of deportation, he must meet the higher standard of showing a \u201cclear probability\u201d that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d on account of his Palestinian identity. INA \u00a7 243(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h); <em>Fisher, </em>79 F.3d at 961. If he cannot show the well-founded fear of persecution required to qualify for asylum, he necessarily cannot show the right to withholding of deportation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">The BIA\u2019s determination that Hasseis failed to show eligibility for asylum with respect to Kuwait is supported by substantial evidence. Petitioner testified that he cannot reenter Kuwait because he allowed his reentry visa to expire in 1993. His only personal effort to renew this visa was a single phone call in 1993 to an unidentified person at the Kuwaiti embassy who purportedly told him that visas were no longer issued. He cites no other fear of persecution if he were allowed to return to Kuwait, and his parents and siblings, who share his Palestinian identity, continue to reside in Kuwait. His father worked for the Kuwaiti government from the 1960s until his retirement, and his relatives remain in Kuwait without evidence of harm. The BIA took notice that Palestinians, in general, may not presently be permitted to return or remain in Kuwait having not registered as Kuwaiti citizens by June 2000. This acknowledgment does not, however, amount to a finding that Hasseis had established a well-founded fear of persecution with respect to Kuwait, especially given his modest attempts to seek a reentry visa over the past nine years.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>The BIA\u2019s decision to deport Hasseis to Jordan is also supported by substantial evidence. Hasseis never designated a country for deportation during his deportation hearings. The INA provides that if deportation to such places as the alien\u2019s country of birth or the country from which the alien last entered the United States is impracticable or inadvisable, an alien may be deported \u201cto any country which is willing to accept such alien into its territory.\u201d INA \u00a7 243(a)(7), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(a)(7). Hasseis has carried a Jordanian passport since birth and can legally enter, return to, and reside in that country. On appeal, Hasseis does not contend, and there is no evidence to suggest, that he would face persecution in Jordan on account of his Palestinian background.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b816-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-10\">.
