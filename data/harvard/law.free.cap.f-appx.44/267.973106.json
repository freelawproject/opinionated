We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-23\">Leivan\u2019s contention that the district court improperly enhanced his sentence for obstruction of justice is without merit. We review de novo whether a defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. <em>United States v. Draper, </em>996 F.2d 982, 984 (9th Cir.1993). We review the underlying factual findings for clear error. <em>Id. </em>Because Leivan willfully failed to appear at a judicial proceeding as ordered, the district court properly enhanced his offense level by two levels for obstruction of justice. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n. 4(e); <em>Draper, </em>996 F.2d at 984-86 (explaining that an obstruction of justice enhancement does not require actual obstruction and may properly be based on the mere postponing of a hearing due to failure to appear).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-24\">Leivan\u2019s contention that the district court erred in failing to reduce his offense level for acceptance of responsibility also lacks merit. We review for clear error the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>district court\u2019s determination of whether a case is an extraordinary case justifying a simultaneous adjustment for obstruction of justice and acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>80 F.3d 368, 370 (9th Cir.1996). Because defendant\u2019s obstructive conduct was inconsistent with an acceptance of responsibility, the district court did not clearly err in denying an acceptance of responsibility reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 3-4; <em>Thompson, </em>80 F.3d at 371 (explaining that timely guilty plea and apology at sentencing did not outweigh fact that defendant absconded before sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b303-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
