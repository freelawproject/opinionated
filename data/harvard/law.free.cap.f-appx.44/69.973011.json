The district court sentenced Dixon to 27 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. His counsel has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>moved to withdraw, filing a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). For reversal, counsel argues that the district court should not have given Dixon a 4-level enhancement for possessing firearms in connection with another felony offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">We conclude that the district court did not clearly err. <em>See United States v. Chavarria-Cabrera, </em>272 F.3d 1049, 1050 (8th Cir.2001) (standard of review). The undisputed evidence was that Dixon was involved in drug trafficking, items indicating drug activity were discovered at Dixon\u2019s residence, and firearms were located in the same room as drugs and drug paraphernalia. <em>See United States v. Linson, </em>276 F.3d 1017, 1018-19 (8th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Having found no nonfrivolous issues following our independent review of the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-8\">. The Honorable Harold D.
