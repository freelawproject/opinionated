NELSON, GRABER, and RAWLINSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b118-20\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-21\">We have jurisdiction over Defendants\u2019 appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b118-23\">INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b118-24\">Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are generally addressed on collateral, not on direct, appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, neither exception to this general rule applies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court expresses no view on the merits of any ineffective assistance claims presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-25\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b118-26\">CONFRONTATION CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b118-27\">Defendants raise a number of Confrontation Clause issues. Because none of these issues was raised before the trial court, we review them for plain error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, they are subject to harmless error analysis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>A. <em>Informants\u2019Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Defendants object to a number of statements made by Detective Haskins. None of the statements merits reversal. Haskins\u2019 statements regarding the unidentified informant were not introduced for their truth, but to provide background regarding the investigation. Thus, they were admissible.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The introduction of Haskins\u2019 testimony regarding the consistency of Kathy Ramirez\u2019s statements with the statements of other informants was not clear error, given the volume of Haskins\u2019 testimony and the passing nature of the reference. Moreover, in context, this passing reference was harmless. Haskins\u2019 reference to what he was told by jailhouse informants was undoubtedly hearsay. However, just as undoubtedly, it was harmless. He was explaining how he learned that defendants were <em>not </em>linked to another drug conspiracy, contrary to his earlier belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">B. <em>Foundation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The introduction of the methamphetamine found in the tire was not predicated upon hearsay. The dog handler testified to the dog\u2019s \u201calert\u201d on the tire. The handler then saw the tire after it was broken down, and saw what was in it. Officer Ericsson also saw the dog alert to the tire, saw the tire being searched, saw the methamphetamine package, and identified photographs of the drug. Haskins identified the specific exhibits as those on which he put exhibit tags in the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Any claimed time disparity in the officers\u2019 testimony regarding the finding of the drugs does not create foundational problems. Defendants were free to cite the disparity in order to undermine the officers\u2019 credibility. No foundation or hearsay problems are associated with this disparity, however. We have considered the other foundation claims asserted by Defendants and have concluded that they are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">C. <em>Disposal of Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-16\">Defendants make no showing of prejudice by stating that the evidence <em>might </em>have proved exculpatory.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nor have Defendants established bad faith.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-17\">D. <em>Co-Defendants\u2019 Confessions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-18\">The Government conceded a <em>Bruton </em>error as to defendant Fredman. Buck and Angie Jenkins\u2019 confessions should not have been introduced. Because Fredman did not raise this error before the trial court, however, we review for plain error, and the burden is on him to show prejudice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He has not done so. Overwhelming evidence tied Fredman to the conspiracy and rendered the Jenkins\u2019 references to Fredman harmless. Cynthia Herndon\u2019s testimony solidly tied Fredman to the conspiracy. While she acknowledged her earlier lies, and her memory problems, these were exhaustively explored in cross-examination. Her basic testimony was not shaken. In addition, surveillance tied Fredman to the others, as did his admission to California officials that he had \u201ccooked\u201d ten pounds of methamphetamine in Oregon in July 1996. Moreover, the fact that Herndon was in the motor home when it was stopped in California corroborated the existence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>relationship between Herndon and Fred-man.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">DUE PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">All of Defendants\u2019 due process claims are reviewed for plain error because they were not raised below.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The challenged statements of Angela and Cynthia were minor parts of their testimony. The statements did not, individually or cumulatively, render the trial unfair. No improper vouching by Haskins took place before the jury. Defense counsel elicited Mogle\u2019s allegedly improper vouching. The Government did not impliedly vouch for the remainder of Sheri Parker\u2019s testimony by pointing out flaws in her testimony. Haskins\u2019 statement as to the \u201cmostly true\u201d information he had received from other informants did not constitute vouching.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Because there was no error in any of the specific instances alleged, there was no cumulative error.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">SPOUSAL PRIVILEGE</p>\n<p id=\"ASy\">A. As <em>to Marcos Ramirez</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Kathy Ramirez claimed her spousal privilege, which made her unavailable to testify as to her husband. Although she was forced to invoke her privilege before the jury, any error was harmless in this context. In this case, unlike most, the invocation of the spousal privilege did not keep the testimony of the invoking spouse from the jury.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the danger that the jury would make negative inferences about what the spouse would have said if she had testified was not of concern. Kathy Ramirez\u2019s grand jury testimony, which was thoroughly damaging to Marcos, was available. It became admissible as to Marcos Ramirez when Kathy invoked her privilege not to testify in court against her spouse. There was no danger that the jurors would infer anything more from the invocation of the privilege than what they could properly infer from the grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-14\">B. <em>As to the Others</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-15\">The introduction of Kathy Ramirez\u2019s grand jury testimony <em>before </em>she had testified inconsistently on the stand reversed the order of proof contemplated by Rule 801. Eventually, however, Ramirez did reject substantial portions of her grand jury testimony. Thus, her grand jury testimony would have been admissible for impeachment, albeit somewhat later in trial. Given the realities of the positions of the parties, the error in the order of proof was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-16\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b120-17\">SEVERANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b120-18\">Because Marcos Ramirez did not move to sever before trial, we review his claim for plain error.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We see no error, much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-19\">As to Buck and Angie Jenkins, the district court did not abuse its discretion<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in denying their motions. It was possible to give them a fair trial in conjunction with the others. This reasoning applies to Buck Jenkins\u2019 argument that his felon-in-possession charge should have been sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>ered as well. Failing to sever the charge was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">OTHER TRIAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">We have examined the other claims of error and have determined that they are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">VH</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">SENTENCING ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">A <em>Defendant Fredman\u2019s State and Federal Sentences</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">Defendant Fredman appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his request that his federal sentence run concurrently with his state sentence. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the Section 5G1.8(b) concurrent sentence. Defendant\u2019s federal conviction did not take into account the new conspiracy in which he was participating when he left Oregon, for which he is serving his California sentence. The new conspiracy was a separate venture, for which defendant properly received a separate \u2014 and nonconcurrently running \u2014 sentence. No duplicate punishment for the same conduct is involved in defendant\u2019s federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">\n<em>B. Apprendi</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">All of the defendants\u2019 sentences exceed the statutory maximum term of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment prescribed by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) for one count. However, all of the defendants were convicted of multiple counts. We recently held that when a judge calculates drug quantity under the United States Sentencing Guidelines and when \u201cthe Guidelines calculation exceeds the statutory maximum for any count in a case involving multiple counts, then the mandatory provisions of \u00a7 5G1.2(d) come into play regarding the question of consecutive sentences.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In such a situation, \u00a7 5G1.2(d) \u201cwould require consecutive sentences to achieve the total punishment calculated by the Guidelines.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, under <em>Buckland, </em>the district court\u2019s error was harmless. Pursuant to \u00a7 5G1.2(d), the court was required to stack the sentences in order to achieve the total punishment calculated by the Guidelines \u2014 the total punishment of which the defendants currently complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b118-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-13\">. <em>United States v.
