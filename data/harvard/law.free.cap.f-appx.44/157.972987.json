The district court dismissed Sharon\u2019s pro se federal claims with prejudice, and then dismissed his state law claims for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-23\">The district court dismissed Sharon\u2019s claim under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692 <em>et seq., </em>on the ground that NMAC was not a \u201cdebt collector\u201d as defined by the statute. The dismissal was pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. However, the district court relied on material outside the scope of the complaint in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>reaching this conclusion, and thereby erred in dismissing on the pleadings. <em>Branch v. Tunnell, </em>14 F.3d 449, 453 (9th Cir.1994); <em>Garaux v. </em>Pulley, 739 F.2d 437, 439-40 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The district court dismissed Sharon\u2019s claim under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 <em>et seq., </em>on the ground that the Act only applied to credit reporting agencies. The FCRA also imposes obligations on entities that report information to credit reporting agencies. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(b). Sharon\u2019s complaint alleged that NMAC had reported incorrect information about him to credit reporting agencies. The district court therefore erred in dismissing Sharon\u2019s FCRA claim on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The district court acknowledged that Sharon\u2019s complaint stated a claim for relief under federal law, but did not inform Sharon under what federal law that claim arose. Rather, the district court simply offered Sharon leave to amend to identify the correct statute. On remand, Sharon should be permitted leave to amend his complaint to specifically cite the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The district court dismissed Sharon\u2019s state law claims without prejudice only because it believed Sharon had not stated any actionable federal claims. The district court erred in dismissing those claims because Sharon sought damages in excess of $75,000 for his state law causes of action and, therefore, met the requirements to establish the district court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction over those claims. Furthermore, since we are reversing and remanding the dismissal of Sharon\u2019s FDCPA, FCRA, and TILA claims for further proceedings, we reverse the dismissal of Sharon\u2019s state law claims on that ground as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b193-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
