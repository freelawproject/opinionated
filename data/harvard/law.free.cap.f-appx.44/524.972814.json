Velazquez, </em>246 F.3d 204 (2d Cir. 2001). On remand, Judge Mishler sentenced Regnier principally to a term of imprisonment for 324 months. Because we conclude that our earlier opinion likely misled Regnier regarding his prospects on appeal, and to avoid the serious constitutional questions that otherwise would result from that conclusion, we modify Reg-nier\u2019s sentence to reflect the original 135-month term of imprisonment, and, as modified, affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Regnier was convicted upon his guilty pleas of conspiring to violate and violating the civil rights of Thomas Pizzuto by, together with others, severely beating Pizzu-to in his cell at the Nassau County Correctional Center, where Regnier was a guard. Pizzuto subsequently died from an injury to his spleen sustained during the beating; his spleen was abnormally large because of his drug abuse. The facts of the case are set forth extensively in our opinion on Regnier\u2019s prior appeal, <em>United States v. Velazquez, </em>246 F.3d 204 (2d Cir.2001), familiarity with which is presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">A. The Prior Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">In <em>Velazquez, </em>Regnier, co-defendant Edward Velazquez, who also participated in the beating and pleaded guilty, and co-defendant Joseph Bergen, who assisted Regnier and Velazquez in covering up the crime and was convicted following a jury trial as an accessory after the fact pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3, all appealed, <em>inter alia, </em>their sentences. <em>See </em>246 F.3d at 207. The District Court had applied the guideline for voluntary manslaughter, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\">Second degree murder requires a finding that the defendant killed the victim \u201cwith malice aforethought.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111(a). Manslaughter, on the other hand, is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(a). Voluntary manslaughter is committed \u201cupon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-13\">Malice is the state of mind that would cause a person to act without regard for the life of another. I do not believe that Defendants Velazquez and Regnier acted with such intent when they entered Pizzuto\u2019s cell on January 8. The more appropriate classification for Defendants\u2019 actions is voluntary manslaughter under \u00a7 1112(a). In determining whether a defendant acted in the \u201cheat of passion\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1112(a),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-14\">\u201cthe basic inquiry is whether or not at the time of the killing, the reason and judgment of the defendant was obscured or disturbed by passion ... to such an extent as would cause an ordinarily reasonable person of average disposition to act rashly and without deliberation and from passion rather than judgment\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-15\"><em>United States v. Livoti, </em>22 F.Supp.2d 235, 243 (S.D.N.Y.1998) (citing 2 Leonard B. Sand et al., Modern Jury Instructions \u00b6 41.02 at 41-46, 47).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-16\">I find that Velazquez and Regnier acted in response to Pizzuto\u2019s refusal to obey them commands and the abusive epithets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>directed to them. I find that Velazquez and Regnier acted in the heat of passion and that Pizzuto\u2019s conduct was sufficient to arouse the passion of a reasonable man.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Accordingly, Defendants\u2019 conduct is classified as voluntary manslaughter and carries a base offense level of 25. Sentencing Memorandum dated May 26, 2000, at 5-6, <em>quoted in Velazquez, </em>246 F.3d at 210. On appeal, all parties agreed that the evidence did not support the District Court\u2019s finding that the Velazquez and Regnier acted \u201cin the heat of passion.\u201d <em>Velazquez, </em>246 F.3d at 211-212. This Court stated that the District Court\u2019s finding regarding \u201cheat of passion\u201d raised \u201cthree related questions: (1) Did Judge Mishler mean that Pizzuto\u2019s assailants lacked the mental state of malice, irrespective of whether they acted in the heat of passion, or that their mental state would have been malice had that mental state not been displaced by heat of passion? (2) Did Judge Mishler use the correct standard for determining the existence of heat of passion? (3) Did Judge Mishler use the correct standard for determining the existence of malice?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">With respect to the \u201cno malice\u201d finding, this Court stated that the District Court\u2019s finding was ambiguous, but that the District Court had probably determined that the defendants acted <em>with </em>malice, which malice was excused by \u201cheat of passion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">With respect to the \u201cheat of passion\u201d finding, this Court held that the evidence in the record likely did not support such a finding, inasmuch as (1) the abusive epithets Pizzuto directed at defendants and his refusal to obey their commands were insufficiently provocative to support a finding that they aroused a \u201cheat of passion,\u201d (2) the proper standard for evaluating whether Pizzuto\u2019s conduct was provocative enough to arouse \u201cheat of passion\u201d was whether his actions would arouse the heat of passion \u201cof a reasonable corrections officer,\u201d and not a \u201creasonable man\u201d generally; and (3) the \u201cheat of passion\u201d defense is normally unavailable after some interval of time has elapsed between the provocation and the response. <em>Id. </em>at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">With respect to the standard used to determine whether the defendants acted with \u201cmalice,\u201d this Court held that the District Court may have used an incorrect standard. The Court stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">in the context of second-degree murder in federal law, the requisite malice can in some circumstances be found when the assailant acts with awareness of \u201ca serious risk of death or serious bodily harm.\u201d An intent to cause a serious risk of a serious injury will frequently suffice to demonstrate a heightened disregard for human life, although a fact-finder might in some circumstances conclude that such intent does not indicate the malice required for second-degree murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">In particular, an inference of malice might not be appropriate where the victim is assaulted and dies substantially as a result of his unusual and unforeseeable fragility, such as a thin skull or hemophilia. ... Of course, a beating that causes the death of an especially vulnerable victim might well permit a finding of malice if the evidence shows that the extent of the beating would have posed such a serious risk of serious injury to an average person as would demonstrate the assailant\u2019s heightened disregard for human life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 214-15 (citations &amp; internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Accordingly, the Court vacated the sentences and provided the following guidance for the District Court\u2019s use on remand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AId\">In the pending case, if, on remand, voluntary manslaughter is rejected because heat of passion cannot be validly found under the applicable standard, the choice between second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter will turn on how great a risk of serious bodily injury Pizzuto\u2019s assailants could reasonably apprehend would result from their assaultive conduct and what that risk reveals about the degree of their indifference to Pizzuto\u2019s life. On this issue, if it arises, further findings will be needed. In particular, it will be necessary to determine whether there was a substantial risk that the repeated punching and kicking administered by Velazquez and Regnier would inflict serious bodily injury on an average adult, sufficient to infer an extreme indifference to human life, or whether the resulting laceration of Pizzuto\u2019s spleen occurred primarily because it was enlarged five or six times normal weight, a circumstance that was not reasonably foreseeable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Because vacating the sentences could result (if, on remand, the District Court found that the second-degree murder guideline was applicable) in a substantially higher sentence, this Court gave the defendants-appellants the opportunity to withdraw their appeals. <em>See id. </em>at 216-17. Velazquez and Bergen did so; Regnier did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">B. Re-sentencing Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">On remand, the district court found, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cVelazquez and Regnier entered Pizzuto\u2019s cell <em>with the intention of administering serious injuries,\u201d </em>Mem. Decision &amp; Order at 5 (emphasis added), which finding was consonant with its statement at the Conference earlier that day \u201cbefore they entered the cell, both Mr. Velazquez and Mr. Regnier <em>intended to beat Mr. Pizzuto mercilessly,\u201d </em>Tr. of Aug. 17, 2001, Conf. at 12 (emphasis added). Accordingly, it held that the second degree murder guideline was applicable, and sentenced Regnier principally to a term of imprisonment for 324 months. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">On appeal, Regnier principally argues that the District Court applied the wrong standard and failed to comply with this Court\u2019s instructions in determining whether Regnier acted with malice aforethought, resulting in clearly erroneous findings. He also contends that (1) the District Court erred in not permitting him to present evidence on the cause of death; (2) the District Court lacked authority to increase Regnier\u2019s sentence on remand because the Government did not cross-appeal the earlier sentence; and (3) the District Court erred in not granting a downward departure for conduct \u201coutside the heartland\u201d of the second-degree murder guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">Although the matter is not free from doubt, we believe the District Court used the standard we set forth in <em>Velazquez </em>to determine whether Regnier acted with \u201cmalice aforethought.\u201d In the August 17, 2001, Decision and Order, the District Court quoted our statement in <em>Velazquez </em>that malice aforethought may be found when a defendant acts with \u201cawareness of \u2018a serious risk of death or <em>serious bodily harm.\u2019 \u201d </em>Mem. Decision <em>&amp; </em>Order at 3. Immediately thereafter, the District Court stated its finding that \u201cVelazquez and Reg-nier entered Pizzuto\u2019s cell <em>with the intention of administering serious injuries,\u201d id. </em>at 5 (emphasis added), which finding was consonant with its statement at the Conference earlier that day \u201cbefore they en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>tered the cell, both Mr. Velazquez and Mr. Regnier <em>intended to beat Mr. Pizzuto mer</em>cilessly,\u201d Tr. of Aug. 17, 2001, Conf. at 12 (emphasis added). The District Court also quoted the standard for malice aforethought as articulated in <em>United States v. Milton, </em>27 F.3d 203, 206-07 (6th Cir.1994), which we quoted in <em>Velazquez, </em>246 F.3d at 214. Mem. Decision <em>&amp; </em>Order at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Where a district court has used the correct legal standard, we ordinarily do not disturb its factual findings on sentencing unless those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e); <em>United States v. Chalarca, </em>95 F.3d 239, 244 (2d Cir.1996). In this case, however, our analysis of whether the record supports the District Court\u2019s finding of malice has led us to the conclusion that our opinion in <em>Velazquez </em>may have unintentionally misled Regnier as to the risks and potential benefits of pursuing a challenge to his earlier sentence, which, in turn, raises not insubstantial constitutional questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In <em>Velazquez, </em>we held that the District Courts\u2019s definition of malice as \u201cthe state of mind that would cause a person to act without regard for the life of another\u201d was incomplete. 246 F.3d at 214. We then explained that in cases involving <em>reckless </em>killings, the distinction between second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter depends upon the degree of <em>recklessness </em>\u2014 i.e., whether the recklessness is so extreme that it evinces a \u201cheightened disregard for human life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 214-15. Continuing in the same vein, we instructed that \u201cif, on remand, voluntary manslaughter is rejected because heat of passion cannot be validly found under the applicable standard, the choice between second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter vrill turn on how great a risk of serious bodily injury Pizzu-to\u2019s assailants could reasonably apprehend would result from their assaultive conduct and what that risk reveals about the degree of their indifference to Pizzuto\u2019s life. On this issue, if it arises, further findings will be needed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">In discussing the \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d standard only in terms of recklessness, we may have unintentionally misled the parties (and perhaps the District Court) into considering that \u201crecklessness\u201d was the only issue. We have expressly held, however (albeit in a first-degree murder case), that \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111 may be found from the intent to commit <em>a felony. See United States v. Thomas, </em>34 F.3d 44, 48-49 (2d Cir.1994). And at least one other Circuit has expressly (and correctly, in our view) held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 llll\u2019s second-degree murder provision encompasses felony murder. <em>See United States v. Pearson, </em>159 F.3d 480, 486 (10th Cir.1998) (\u201c[Sjecond degree murder\u2019s malice aforethought element is satisfied by: (1) intent-to-kill without the added ingredients of premeditation and deliberation; (2) intent-to-do-serious-bodily-injury; (3) depraved-heart; or (4) commission of a felony when the felony in question is not one of those specified in the first degree murder paragraph of \u00a7 1111(a).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Inasmuch as Regnier caused Pizzuto\u2019s death while acting in furtherance of a felonious conspiracy, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241, it appears that he could be sentenced pursuant to the second-degree murder guideline on that basis alone, even if the District Court\u2019s findings regarding the actual assault are clearly erroneous. But neither Regnier nor his counsel likely apprehended the possibility of a finding of \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d based on the intent to commit the underlying felony when Regnier made the decision to not withdraw his appeal, as this Court had invited him to do. <em>See </em>246 F.3d at 217. Indeed, the Government conceded at oral argument that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>had never raised the issue of whether Reg-nier\u2019s intent to commit the underlying felonies, standing alone, was sufficient to support a finding of \u201cmalice aforethought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AuT\">We may also have misled the parties (and the District Court) by following the Government into an error of law. We stated that \u201c[w]ithout proof of malice, [defendants\u2019] underlying offense would be, <em>at most, </em>manslaughter (either voluntary or involuntary).\u201d <em>Velazquez, </em>246 F.3d at 214 (emphasis added). In so stating, we repeated the Government\u2019s position, which was based, in turn, on the Government\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines as requiring that Regnier be sentenced pursuant to the most \u201canalogous\u201d guideline. As articulated at oral argument, the Government\u2019s view is that only the murder or manslaughter guidelines are \u201canalagous,\u201d because the use of any other guideline would require the court to \u201coverlook\u201d Pizzuto\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In fact, however, the Government\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines is mistaken. The guideline applicable to Regnier\u2019s offenses of conviction is U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2H1.1 (\u201cOffenses Involving Individual Rights\u201d). That guideline provides, in relevant part, that the base offense level is the greatest of \u201cthe offense level from the offense guideline <em>applicable to any underlying offense\" </em>or 12, if, as here, the offense involved two or more participants. Accordingly, in determining which guideline provides the greatest offense level for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2H1.1, the District Court is not limited to the \u201cmost analogous\u201d guideline,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but must instead look at all <em>applicable </em>guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">The involuntary manslaughter guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A1.4, provides for a base offense level of 14 if the conduct was reckless or 10 if the conduct was criminally negligent. Thus, based on our original opinion, Regnier could have believed that, if he convinced the District Court that he did not act with malice aforethought, he faced <em>at worst </em>a base offense level of 12 or 14. The aggravated assault guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2, however, which is applicable to an assault with intent to commit a felony <em>or </em>to an assault resulting in serious bodily injury, provides for a base offense level of 15 plus upward adjustments for specific offense characteristics, including a 6 level increase if the degree of bodily injury is \u201cpermanent or life-threatening.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2(b)(3). If this guideline is applicable to Regnier\u2019s conduct (and we do not see why it would not be),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> then it \u2014 and not the involuntary manslaughter guideline \u2014 would be the \u201cgreatest\u201d of \u201cthe offense level from the offense guideline applicable to any underlying offense\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2H1.1 if there was no finding of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The difference between the involuntary manslaughter guideline and the aggravated assault guideline is not trivial for sentencing purposes. If the involuntary manslaughter guideline were the greatest \u201capplicable,\u201d then Regnier\u2019s base offense level would start as low as 12, which would have resulted, all other adjustments being equal, in a sentencing range of 33-41 months. If, on the other hand, the aggravated assault guideline were the greatest \u201capplicable,\u201d then the minimum applicable base offense level would be 15 plus adjustments for offense characteristics, which substantially reduces the potential \u201cbenefit\u201d of challenging the District Court\u2019s earlier application of the voluntary manslaughter guideline because Reg-nier\u2019s sentencing range could be as high as 108-135 months (and no lower than 46-57 months) using that guideline, all other adjustments being equal.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The possibly misleading nature of our opinion in <em>Velazquez </em>raises a substantial question regarding whether holding Regnier to his decision to continue to contest his earlier sentence following that opinion would violate his right to Due Process of Law guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In general, due process requires that criminal defendants\u2019 waivers of their rights be knowing and voluntary. <em>See, e.g., Henderson v. Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 645 &amp; n. 13, 96 S.Ct. 2253, 49 L.Ed.2d 108 (1976) (guilty plea must be knowing and voluntary); <em>United States v. Ready, </em>82 F.3d 551, 556 (2d Cir.1996) (waiver of right to appeal sentence); <em>United States v. Fontanez, </em>878 F.2d 33, 36 (2d Cir.1989) (waiver of right to be present at trial). Accordingly, we have not enforced waivers where the defendant may have been misled by the Court as to the nature of his rights. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Harrison, </em>241 F.3d 289, 292-94 (2d Cir.2001) (vacating guilty plea where the district court mistakenly advised the defendant that he was subject to a mandatory minimum); <em>United States v. Andrades, </em>169 F.3d 131, 135-36 (2d Cir.1999) (vacating guilty plea where district court failed to adequately inform the defendant of the elements of the offense); <em>Ready, </em>82 F.3d at 557 (declining to enforce waiver of right to appeal sentence where district court misstated the scope of the waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In this ease, the Government\u2019s failure to timely appeal Regnier\u2019s original sentence granted him the right to \u201cenjoy\u201d the \u201cbenefits\u201d of that sentence. <em>Cf. United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 136, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980) (a defendant has a constitutionally protected expectation of finality in a sentence when \u201cthe appeal is concluded <em>or the time to appeal has expired\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). For that reason, we stayed the mandate in <em>Velazquez </em>to give Regnier and his co-defendants a full and fair opportunity to consider whether to continue contesting their sentences in light of the danger that their sentences would increase on remand. <em>See Velazquez, </em>246 F.3d at 216-17. In light of the possibly misleading nature of our opinion in <em>Velazquez, </em>we have substantial doubt as to whether Regnier gave up his expectation of finality in his earlier sentence \u201cknowingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">To avoid resolving this substantial constitutional question (as well as the question we avoided in <em>Velazquez </em>of whether the government\u2019s failure to appeal the earlier sentence barred the imposition of an increased sentence on remand, <em>see id. </em>at 215-17), and because, at oral argument, the Government agreed that it was \u201csatisfied\u201d with the earlier sentence of 135 months, we find it appropriate in this high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ly unusual case to relieve Regnier of the effects of his decision to continue to contest his earlier sentence and to restore to him the \u201cbenefits\u201d of that sentence. Accordingly, we modify the judgment of conviction to reflect a sentence of 185 months, and, as modified, affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-6\">. Some guidelines instruct district courts to impose sentences based on the most \u2018\u2018anala-gous\u201d guideline. <em>See, e.g., </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1)(B) (guideline for firearms offenses, providing that \"[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with the commission or attempted commission of another offense [and] ... death resulted, [use] the most analogous offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part A, Subpart 1 (Homicide), if the resulting offense level is greater than [the otherwise-applicable offense level]\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2K1.4(c)(l) (guideline for arson, similar).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b565-10\">. The elements of assault resulting in serious bodily injury are: (1) an action constituting common-law assault (either a willful attempt to inflict injury upon the person of another, or a threat to inflict injury upon the person of another which, when coupled with an apparent'present ability, causes a reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm) that (2) results in a serious bodily injury. The government need not prove the specific intent to cause a serious bodily injury. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Loera, </em>923 F.2d 725, 727-28 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
