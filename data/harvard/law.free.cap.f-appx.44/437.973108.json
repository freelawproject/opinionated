R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-22\">Defendant Dejon Mitchell seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) from this court in order to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying the relief sought in his motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We deny Mr. Mitchell\u2019s application and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-23\">To be entitled to a COA, Mr. Mitchell must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). He can make this showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>by establishing that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). We will grant relief if we determine that \u201cthe judgment was rendered without jurisdiction, or that the sentence imposed was not authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack, or that there has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Mr. Mitchell pleaded guilty to distribution of forty grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). He was sentenced on March 30, 2000, to 108 months in prison. Judgment was entered April 10, 2000. Mr. Mitchell did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">On June 27, 2001, Mr. Mitchell filed his motion in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York. Because the motion was filed in the wrong court, it was transferred to the District of Kansas on July 24, 2001. The Kansas district court denied the motion without requesting a response from the government, finding that Mr. Mitchell was entitled to no relief. On appeal, Mr. Mitchell relies on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466,120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) to argue that (1) his conviction must be vacated because \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional and (2) his sentence must be vacated. He also contends that his attorney\u2019s failure to challenge the validity of \u00a7 841 constituted ineffective assistance of counsel; but because he did not raise this issue in district court, we do not consider it in deciding whether to issue a certificate of appealability. <em>See Rhine v. Boone, </em>182 F.3d 1153, 1154 (10th Cir.1999) (issues raised for the first time on appeal will ordinarily not be considered).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">We conclude that Mr. Mitchell cannot make the requisite showing to warrant issuance of a COA. We have held that <em>Apprendi </em>is \u201cnot retroactively applicable to initial habeas petitions.\u201d <em>United States v. Mora, </em>293 F.3d 1213, 1219 (10th Cir. 2002). Moreover, we have determined that \u201c \u00a7 841 remains constitutionally enforceable notwithstanding <em>Apprendi.\u201d United States v. Cernobyl, </em>255 F.3d 1215, 1219 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Hence, Mr. Mitchell has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Reasonable jurists could not debate whether his \u00a7 2255 \u201cpetition should have been resolved in a different manner\u201d or whether \u201cthe issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595 (internal quotation marks omitted). We deny a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
