Carr appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s denial of his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion seeking reconsideration of the district court\u2019s summary judgment in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that he was improperly detained by a police officer based on his race. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion, <em>Maraziti v. Thorpe, 52 </em>F.3d 252, 253 (9th Cir.1996), and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-22\">The newly discovered evidence submitted in support of Carr\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion did not raise any genuine issues of material fact to warrant reconsideration of the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment for Officer Sawall. <em>See Cel-A-Pak v. California Agr. Labor Relations Bd., </em>680 F.2d 664, 668-69 (9th Cir.1982); <em>cf. Washington v. Lambert, </em>98 F.3d 1181, 1185-90 (9th Cir.1996) (setting forth factors converting a lawful investigatory stop into an arrest). Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to reconsider the stipulated dismissal of defendant Chief Nichols because the affidavits did not establish any injury to Carr. <em>See Quintanilla v. City of Downey, </em>84 F.3d 353, 355-56 (9th Cir.1996) (noting that \u201can individual may recover [against a public entity] only when that individual\u2019s federal rights have been violated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-23\">We reject Carr\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b878-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-27\">. Because Carr\u2019s motion for reconsideration was filed more than ten days after entry of judgment, we do not have jurisdiction to review the grant of summary judgment. <em>Maraz-iti, 52 </em>F.3d at 253.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
