King appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denial of his motion to suppress evidence. Mr. King argues, as he did below, that there was no probable cause to stop the car in which he was a passenger. After carefully reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 arguments on appeal, we conclude, for the reasons explained by the district court, that the officer in question had probable cause under the totality of the circumstances to believe that the driver of the car had committed a traffic violation. <em>See United States v. Snook, </em>88 F.3d 605, 607 (8th Cir.1996) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-22\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-18\">.
