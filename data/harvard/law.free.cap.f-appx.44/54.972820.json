The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 70 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release, and fined him $500. On appeal, counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Defendant has filed a pro se supplemental brief, as well as a motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">We address and reject seriatim the issues noted in counsel\u2019s brief. First, based on our review of the record, we conclude that the guilty plea was valid. Second, defendant\u2019s prior offense of transporting aliens constituted an aggravated felony for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N) (defining \u201caggravated felony\u201d). Third, <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is inapplicable here. <em>See United States v. Raya-Ramirez, </em>244 F.3d 976, 977 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 223, 151 L.Ed.2d 160 (2001). Fourth, defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction with the use of his prior convictions in calculating his criminal history constituted an impermissible collateral attack. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment. (n.6); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>28 F.3d 69, 70 (8th Cir.1994) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Additionally, we are unpersuaded by the arguments presented in the pro se supplemental brief. Defendant\u2019s issues with his counsel\u2019s performance are not properly before us in this direct criminal appeal, <em>see United States v. Martin, </em>59 F.3d 767, 771 (8th Cir.1995), and defendant\u2019s belief that his sentence (at the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range) was too harsh does not per se provide a jurisdictional basis for review, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) (grounds for appeal of sentence by defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d <em>300 </em>(1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, we affirm the judgment, and we deny the motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-9\">.
