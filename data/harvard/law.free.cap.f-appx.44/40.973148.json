Galvan\u2019s counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Galvan has filed a supplemental brief, asserting that his counsel was ineffective, that the District Court should not have held the plea hearing on September 11, 2001, because the hearing resulted in a \u201ccoerced confession\u201d and the district judge\u2019s \u201cactions and statements would show his mind was on the Twin Towers and not [Galvan\u2019s] due process.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-21\">As to the issue raised by counsel, we conclude that the District Court properly sentenced Galvan in accordance with the unobjected-to drug quantities set forth in the presentence report. <em>See United States v. Beatty, </em>9 F.3d 686, 690 (8th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-22\">Galvan\u2019s pro se arguments are also unavailing. His challenge to his counsel\u2019s effectiveness should be brought in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, if at all. <em>See United States v. Clayton, </em>210 F.3d 841, 845 n. 4 (8th Cir.2000). Further, he has not explained how he was prejudiced from the Court\u2019s unobjected-to decision to proceed with the September 11, 2001 plea hearing, and the hearing transcript does not support his assertion that the Court coerced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>his guilty plea or otherwise violated his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">We have reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-16\">. The Honorable Paul A. Magnuson, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
