The district court determined that Marshall failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Because Marshall was not incarcerated or detained when he filed his complaint, we reverse and remand to the district court to consider his case on its merits. <em>See Doe v. Washington County, </em>150 F.3d 920, 924 (8th Cir.1998). We decline to affirm the judgment on a basis not considered by the district court. <em>See Cavegn v. Twin City Pipe Trades Pension Plan, </em>223 F.3d 827, 831 (8th Cir.2000). We also deny Marshall\u2019s pending motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
