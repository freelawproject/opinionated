Hardison, as a motion for leave to accept a faxed petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-36\">On January 17, 2002, the Merit Systems Petition Board denied Hardison\u2019s petition for review in her case. On March 4, 2002 and March 8, 2002, Hardison faxed petitions for review to this court. On March 21, 2002, this court rejected Hardison\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>petitions, informing Hardison that pursuant to Fed. Cir. R. 25(b)(3), \u201c[n]o document other than a motion, response to a motion, reply to a response, or letter may be filed or serv.ed by facsimile transmission.\u201d On March 26, 2002, Hardison responded by fax to this court\u2019s March 21 letter, arguing that information on this court\u2019s website allows her to file a petition via facsimile.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">The notice on the court\u2019s website states: <em>Notice: </em>Owing to difficulties with U.S. mail delivery the Court is deemed inaccessible, pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(3), until further notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">U.S. Postal Service mail delivery to the Court is still experiencing difficulties and delays. Those who have alternative methods of communicating with and shipping documents to the Court may wish to use them pending the resolution of this problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The notice does not override this court\u2019s Rules of Practice. Instead, it encourages parties to use alternative methods of communicating with and shipping documents, rather than by mail. By deeming the court \u201cinaccessible,\u201d the notice allows the court to accept for filing items that were mailed before the due date but were not received by this court by the due date. It also encourages use of commercial delivery services or personal delivery. More importantly, the methods of filing a document in a federal appellate court are governed by Fed. R.App. P. 25(a)(2)(A). That provision provides that \u201cfiling may be accomplished by mail addressed to the clerk, but filing is not timely unless the court receives the papers within the time fixed for filing.\u201d As noted earlier, Fed. Cir. R. 25(b)(3) states that \u201c[n]o document other than a motion, response to a motion, reply to a response, or letter may be filed or served by facsimile transmission.\u201d Hardi-son\u2019s petition cannot be accepted for filing. Without a properly filed petition for review, she has not timely filed in this court and her case must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">(1) Hardison\u2019s motion for leave to accept a faxed petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">(2) Hardison\u2019s petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
