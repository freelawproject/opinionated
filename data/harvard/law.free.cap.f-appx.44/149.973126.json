The Clarified Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Rule 60(a) authorizes a district court to correct a judgment if doing so reflects the court\u2019s original intentions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In determining what the court originally intended, we may look to the circumstances surrounding the original judgment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and also to the court\u2019s subsequent statements of its original intent,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> providing the record gives no reason to doubt such statements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The jury found for the Government on all the questions on the special verdict form. The original judgment acknowledged that the jury had found for the Government, and the district court had stated that it would enter judgment on that verdict. In denying the motion to amend, the court again stated that the jury had found for the Government and referred to the money \u201cto which the United States was entitled.\u201d The court relied on its authority to make corrections to reflect its \u201cactual intentions\u201d when the court clarified the original judgment. Similarly, the court expressly rejected the notion that the original judgment dismissed the Government\u2019s suit against the Guenthers. In sum, there can be little doubt that the district court originally intended to enter judgment in favor of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">Guenther\u2019s reliance on the district court\u2019s denial of the Government\u2019s motion to amend is misplaced. The court only rejected the Government\u2019s argument that the original judgment had not been a final order. In addition, the court made reference to the money to which the Government was \u201centitled by virtue of [the] verdict.\u201d Thus, the court did not address the issue of which party had prevailed under the original judgment, but it obviously assumed the Government had.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-15\">Finally, Guenther begs the question in arguing that the legal meaning of the term \u201cdismissed\u201d settles the matter. In a Rule 60(a) inquiry, the question is what the court originally intended. Therefore, the meaning of the word \u201cdismissed\u201d controls only if the court originally intended to dismiss the case. Guenther\u2019s argument overlooks this pivotal question in directing our attention to the definition of \u201cdismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-16\">II. The Motion To Vacate</p>\n<p id=\"b186-17\">The district court had jurisdiction to consider Guenther\u2019s motion to vacate, because he filed it pursuant to Rules 59 and 60, seven days after the district court en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>tered judgment and fourteen days before filing a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Generally, we may not reach the merits of a motion that the district court has not considered.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, this motion relies on the same arguments Guenther made in his substantive appeal. We may therefore reach the merits, because the motion presents a purely legal question involving no further development of the record and deciding the issue will not prejudice the Government.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny Guenther\u2019s motion for the same reasons we affirm the district court\u2019s Rule 60(a) clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, MOTION TO VACATE DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Costs to Appellee.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b186-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-10\">. <em>See Sanchez v.
