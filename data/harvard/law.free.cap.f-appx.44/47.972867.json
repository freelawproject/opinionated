The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> increased Risher\u2019s offense level by 2 levels for abuse of a position of private trust, granted her a downward departure, and sentenced her to 15 months imprisonment, 3 years supervised release, and restitution in the amount of $273,525.95. On appeal, Risher argues that the district court erred in applying the abuse-of-trust increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-24\">We conclude that the district court did not err. \u25a0 <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>200 F.3d 558, 563 (8th Cir.2000) (standard of review). The undisputed testimony of Risher\u2019s former employer at sentencing was sufficient to warrant application of the increase. <em>See United States v. Brelsford, </em>982 F.2d 269, 272 (8th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-25\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-37\">. The HONORABLE GARY A. FENNER, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
