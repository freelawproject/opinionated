On appeal, counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Cortez has filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-22\">First, counsel\u2019s argument that the district court erred in not applying the safety-valve reduction fails, because Cortez had more than 1 criminal history point and did not cooperate with the government. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(l), (a)(5). The jurisdictional argument raised by both counsel and Cortez \u2014 that the offense did not involve interstate commerce \u2014 has previously been rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>288 F.3d 359, 362 (8th Cir.2002), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>70 U.S.L.W. 3790 (U.S. June 7, 2002) (No. 01-1804). The argument that the indictment was insufficient also fails, as any nonjuris-dictional defects were waived by Cortez\u2019s guilty plea, <em>see United States v. Fitzhugh, </em>78 F.3d 1326, 1330 (8th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>519 U.S. 902, 117 S.Ct. 256, 136 L.Ed.2d 182 (1996), and the indictment on its face stated an offense, <em>see United States v. Hester, </em>140 F.3d 753, 760 (8th Cir.1998). While Cortez complains that no coconspir-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ators were identified, he admitted in his guilty-plea petition that he agreed with others to possess and distribute methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Contrary to counsel\u2019s final argument, Cortez\u2019s sentence did not violate <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), as his sentence did not exceed the applicable statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Aguayo-Delgado, </em>220 F.3d 926, 932 (8th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>531 U.S. 1026, 121 S.Ct. 600, 148 L.Ed.2d 513 (2000). Cortez\u2019s ineffective-assistance claims are not properly raised on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Cain, </em>134 F.3d 1345, 1352 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75,109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfriv-olous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-17\">. The Honorable Joseph F. Bataillon, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
