Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Earline Wilson\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Wilson opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-25\">On September 29, 2000, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals determined that Wilson had not met the requirements for recognition as the veteran\u2019s surviving spouse for purposes of an award of benefits. Wilson appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. The Secretary moved for summary affirmance. Upon review of the record in which Wilson acknowledged that she was divorced from the veteran, and the evidence showed that the veteran was married to someone else at the time of his death, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims determined that the Board\u2019s factual findings \u201cwere not clearly erroneous\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. Wilson appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court has limited jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the Court of Appeals of Veterans Claims. <em>See Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc). Wilson\u2019s appeal does not satisfy any of the grounds for invoking this court\u2019s jurisdiction. The decision from which Wilson appeals does not address or otherwise depend on any issue of validity or interpretation of any statute or regulation, nor did Wilson raise any argument concerning the validity or interpretation of any such provision. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims decision was limited \u201cto review [of] the Board\u2019s application of the law to the facts in this case.\u201d This court \u201cmay not review: (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In her informal brief, Wilson checked \u201cno\u201d when asked if the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims decision involved the validity or interpretation of a statute or regulation, or decided any constitutional issues. Instead she states only that: \u201cThe Federal Government of the Social Security office are recognizing me as [the veteran\u2019s] widow and I receive benefits\u201d and thus this court should \u201cgrant and release all of [the veteran\u2019s] benefit that is due to me as his widow.\u201d Wilson\u2019s appeal only challenges the application of law to the facts and is therefore not within this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
