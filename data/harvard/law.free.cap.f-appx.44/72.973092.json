We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-25\">Mr. Ajetunmobi argues that INA \u00a7 212(h) (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)), which prevented him from receiving a waiver of inadmissibility, violates equal protection by treating illegal aliens better than LPRs. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) (no waiver of inadmissibility shall be granted to LPR who has been convicted of aggravated felony since admission). Although 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) states that \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review a decision of the Attorney General to grant or deny a waiver [of inadmissibility],\u201d Mr. Ajetunmobi\u2019s equal-protection challenge is reviewable, <em>see Vasquez-Velezmoro v. INS, </em>281 F.3d 693, 695-96 (8th Cir.2002) (despite \u00a7 1182(h)\u2019s jurisdiction-stripping language, this court has jurisdiction to consider substantial constitutional challenges to INA). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The equal-protection challenge, however, is foreclosed. <em>See Lukowski v. INS, </em>279 F.3d 644, 647-48 (8th Cir.2002) (\u201c \u00a7 1182(h) easily passes equal protection muster\u201d; Congress does not violate equal protection merely because classifications it makes are imperfect or result in some inequality).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The other issues Mr. Ajetunmobi seeks to raise either exceed the scope of this court\u2019s jurisdiction to review directly a BIA determination, or lack merit, and some are duplicative of claims he has pending in a habeas corpus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
