The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Martinez-Guido to 188 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release on each count, to be served concurrently. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erred in applying a 2-level role-in-the-offense enhancement. In his pro se supplemental brief, Martinez-Guido argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel; that the court and defense counsel violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c); that, although Congress made methamphetamine a Schedule III controlled substance with a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment, the Attorney General changed it to a Schedule II controlled substance, in violation of the separation of powers; and that his sentence violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">We reject these arguments seriatim. The district court did not clearly err in imposing the 2-level role enhancement based on the evidence that Martinez-Guido directed at least one other person, <em>see United States v. Van Chase, </em>137 F.3d 579, 583-84 (8th Cir.1998); the ineffective-assistance claims are not properly before us, <em>see United States v. Martin, </em>59 F.3d 767, 771 (8th Cir.1995); Rule 11 is not applicable because Martinez-Guido pleaded not guilty and went to trial, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c); the separation-of-powers argument was not raised below and thus we do not address it except to say that we find no plain error, <em>see United States v. Kempis-Bonola, </em>287 F.3d 699, 701 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>No. 02-5415 (July 15, 2002); and there was no <em>Apprendi </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Following our independent review, <em>see Benson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-6\">. The HONORABLE ROBERT W. PRATT, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
