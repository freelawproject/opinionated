Millsap appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition as time-barred. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-22\">Millsap was entitled to statutory tolling while his first state habeas petition was pending. <em>See Carey v. Saffold, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 2137-41, \u2014 L.Ed.2d- (2002). Tolling also applied while his second set of petitions was pending in the state courts. <em>See Smith v. Duncan, </em>297 F.3d 809, 814-15 (9th Cir. 2002). Further, it is apparent that the approximate thirty-day delays between the trial-appellate and appellate-Supreme court filings during the second set of state habeas petitions were not unreasonable. <em>Cf. Carey, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 122 S.Ct. at 2139-42 (remanding to Ninth Circuit for consideration of whether four and one-half month delay in filing for habeas relief in the California Supreme Court was unreasonable). Because with tolling, less than one year elapsed from the date that Mill-sap\u2019s conviction became final to the date when he ultimately filed his federal habeas petition, the district court erred by dismissing it as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-28\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b911-38\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
