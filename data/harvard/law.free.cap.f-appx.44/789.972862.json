We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of Fordjour\u2019s habeas petition, <em>see Patterson v. Stewart, </em>251 F.3d 1243, 1245 (9th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 406, 151 L.Ed.2d 308 (2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-25\">Fordjour argues that he exhausted his state remedies by presenting his federal habeas claims to the Arizona Court of Appeals. <em>See Swoopes v. Sublett, </em>196 F.3d 1008, 1010 (9th Cir.1999) (ruling federal habeas petitioners with no available state remedies had exhausted their claims for purposes of federal habeas review upon presentment to the Arizona Court of Appeals). Fordjour asserts the district court erred in ruling that his \u00a7 2254 petition was premature due to his pending petition for review with the Arizona Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-26\">Section 2254 provides that a habeas petitioner \u201cshall not be deemed to have exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State ... if he has the right under the law of the State to raise, by any available procedure, the question[s] presented.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(c); <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number><em>O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 </em>U.S. 838, 844, 119 S.Ct. 1728, 144 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Unlike the appellant in <em>Swoopes, </em>Fordj-our still had state remedies available. <em>See Swoopes, </em>196 F.3d at 1009. Specifically, Fordjour\u2019s pending petition for review with the Arizona Supreme Court could have resulted in the reversal of his conviction on some other ground, thereby mooting any federal questions. <em>See Sherwood v. Tomkins, </em>716 F.2d 632, 634 (9th Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Accordingly, Fordjour\u2019s federal habeas petition was clearly premature, thus it was properly dismissed without prejudice by the district court for failure to exhaust state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b825-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b826-17\"> All outstanding motions are denied as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
