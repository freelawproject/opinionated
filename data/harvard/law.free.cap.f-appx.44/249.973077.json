We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hernandez\u2019s habeas petition, <em>see Patterson v. Stewart, </em>251 F.3d 1243, 1245 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 406, 151 L.Ed.2d 308 (2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">The district court granted a certificate of probable cause to Hernandez. However, a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) is required for habeas appeals initiated after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), even when the petition was filed in district court prior to the effective date. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 481-82, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). We must apply <em>Slack </em>here because Hernandez filed his notice of appeal (\u201cNOA\u201d) after AEDPA\u2019s effective date, and will treat it as a request for a COA. <em>See Schell v. Witek, </em>218 F.3d 1017, 1021 fn. 4 (9th Cir.2000). \u201cTo obtain a COA under [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2253(c), a habeas prisoner must make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right ...\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 483. The certificate must specify which issues satisfy that standard. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-16\">Having reviewed Hernandez\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s decision, we grant the COA only with respect to his claim alleging ineffective assistance based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission of Hernandez\u2019s confession under the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Hernandez\u2019s only other claim of error presented, another ineffective assistance claim, alleges counsel failed to object at trial to the admission of his confession based upon the violation of his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). The record shows that this claim is clearly without merit, for immediately prior to trial, Hernandez\u2019s trial counsel objected to the admission of Hernandez\u2019s confession based upon a <em>Miranda </em>violation. Accordingly, Hernandez\u2019s argument does not meet the requirements necessary to grant a COA. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-17\">Although we grant the COA for Hernandez\u2019s remaining claim of ineffective assistance, we conclude that counsel\u2019s performance does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. Under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), a petitioner must show that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Id. </em>at 687. While in custody, Hernandez did not invoke his right to counsel, repeatedly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and explicitly stated that he did not wish to speak to an attorney. Thus, there was no violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Hernandez\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel during his confession, and Hernandez\u2019s counsel was not deficient for declining to object to the confession based upon this ground. <em>See Boag v. Raines, </em>769 F.2d 1341, 1344 (9th Cir.1985) (failure to raise a meritless argument is not ineffectiveness). Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Hernandez\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b286-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
