We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim, <em>TwoRivers v. Lewis, </em>174 F.3d 987, 991 (9th Cir.1999), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-17\">The district court properly concluded that McIntyre failed to state a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim because the facts he alleged do not set forth a constitutional deprivation under any cognizable theory. <em>See Duffy v. Riveland, </em>98 F.3d 447, 456-57 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-20\">The district court properly concluded that McIntyre failed to state a claim pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, or the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, because he failed to allege facts demonstrating that he suffered from a qualifying disability, or that defendants discriminated against him on that basis. <em>See id. </em>at 453-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-21\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing McIntyre\u2019s complaint with prejudice because further amendment would have been futile. <em>See Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1130-31 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc). The district court properly dismissed McIntyre\u2019s pendent state claims without prejudice. <em>See Acri v. Varian Assocs., Inc., </em>114 F.3d 999, 1001 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b313-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
