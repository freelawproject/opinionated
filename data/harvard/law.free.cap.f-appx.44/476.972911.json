Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Cecil W. Miller, Jr.\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Miller has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-21\">Miller filed a Notice of Appeal (NOA) from a May 22, 2001 Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (BVA) decision, which the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims received more than 120 days after the BVA mailed its decision. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims dismissed Miller\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Miller had filed his NOA more than 120 days after the BVA final decision. Miller appeals that order to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-23\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court has limited jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the Veterans Court. <em>See Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (en banc). Miller\u2019s appeal does not satisfy any of the grounds for invoking this court\u2019s jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 order dismissing for lack of jurisdiction did not address or otherwise depend on any issue of validity or interpretation of any statute or regulation, nor did Miller raise any argument concerning the validity or interpretation of any such provision. <em>See Albun v. Brown, </em>9 F.3d 1528 (Fed.Cir.1993) (appeal seeking review of Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 dismissal of appeal for lack of jurisdiction based on appellant\u2019s failure to submit timely NOA did not fall within this court\u2019s jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-24\">In his response, Miller checked \u201cyes\u201d in response to the question whether the decision involved the validity or interpretation of a statute or regulation, but states only that \u201c[ijssue not timely filed\u201d and asks this court to \u201creinstate [his] case for final disposition.\u201d Miller fails to make any specific claims concerning constitutional issues or the validity or interpretation of any statutes or regulations. Miller\u2019s appeal is therefore not within this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-25\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b512-26\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b512-27\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
