We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-21\">Routine searches at the border do not require objective justification, probable cause, or a warrant. <em>United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, </em>473 U.S. 531, 538, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985). \u201cThe \u2018critical factor\u2019 in determining whether a border search is \u2018routine\u2019 is the \u2018degree of intrusiveness it poses.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Tsai, </em>282 F.3d 690, 694 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Molinar-Tarazon, </em>279 F.3d 709, 713 (9th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-22\">The parties dispute the level of suspicion required to justify the search conducted by Customs agents here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We need not reach this issue, however, because, whatever standard of suspicion is required, the search in the instant case was minimally intrusive and was based on observations by customs officers sufficient to justify the search. <em>See United States v. Duncan, </em>693 F.2d 971, 978 (9th Cir.1982) (holding that a border search was reasonable in scope and conduct because it did \u201cnot involve a serious invasion of personal privacy and dignity,\u201d where the appellant \u201cwas superficially patted down\u201d and later required to remove his sweater and undershirt); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>563 F.2d 1360, 1361 (9th Cir. 1977) (holding that \u201c[mjere suspicion is enough to justify a non-intrusive border search, such as the \u2018pat-down\u2019 that occurred here\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-23\">We do not reach the issue of whether Appellant\u2019s detainment constituted an arrest unsupported by probable cause because he did not expressly reserve the right to appeal the issue, thus waiving it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number><em>United States v. Chon, </em>210 F.3d 990, 995 (9th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>531 U.S. 910, 121 S.Ct. 259, 148 L.Ed.2d 187 (2000); <em>see United States v. Arzate-Nunez, </em>18 F.3d 730, 737 (9th Cir.1994) (stating that \u201c[a] defendant who enters a conditional guilty plea pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2) must state in writing any issues he wishes to reserve for appeal and may lose the right to appeal issues not so expressly reserved\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Appellant\u2019s facial and as-applied challenges to the constitutionality of the statute of conviction are foreclosed by our decisions in <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634 (9th Cir.2002), and <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104 (9th Cir. 2002). <em>See Carranza, </em>289 F.3d at 643 (holding that an as-applied challenge failed because the defendant was never exposed to a sentence beyond the prescribed statutory maximum); <em>Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d at 1110 (rejecting a facial challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 960). We reject Appellant\u2019s argument regarding the statutory minimum sentence because (1) his sentence was well below the statutory minimum, and (2) <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), does not apply to mandatory minimum sentences, <em>Harris v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2417-19, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002); <em>United States v. Hitchcock, </em>298 F.3d 1021 (9th Cir.2002), <em>amending </em>286 F.3d 1064 (9th Cir.2002). Appellant\u2019s arguments regarding the indictment also fail. Unlike the cases on which Appellant relies, the indictment in the instant case included every element of the offense and was not deficient; furthermore, we have held that \u201c[a] defendant charged with importing or possessing a drug is not required to know the type and amount of drug.\u201d <em>Carranza, </em>289 F.3d at 644.
