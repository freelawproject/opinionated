Turner acknowledged his right to counsel at his initial appearance, and at a pre-arraignment hearing. He also signed a statement acknowledging his right to counsel. Based on this record, we presume that Turner recalled his right to counsel at the plea colloquy. <em>See id. </em>The judge\u2019s failure to advise him of that right at the colloquy thus did not affect his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>at 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
