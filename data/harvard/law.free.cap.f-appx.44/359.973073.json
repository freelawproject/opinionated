McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">This is a pro se \u00a7 2255 prisoner appeal. Mr. Cesspooch was convicted of assault resulting in bodily injury, assault with a dangerous weapon, and aggravated sexual abuse, all while within Indian Territory. He was sentenced to 390 months\u2019 imprisonment, 60 months\u2019 supervised release, and $14,205 restitution. We affirmed his sentence and conviction on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Cesspooch, </em>No. 97-4013, 1998 WL 208874 (10th Cir. Apr. 29, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">On May 5, 1999, Appellant filed his \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court. The next docket entry after the notice of filing of the \u00a7 2255 motion is the district court\u2019s November 8, 2001, Order dismissing the case for lack of prosecution. No further filings have been made. Subsequently, Appellant applied to this court for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">In order for this court to grant a certificate of appealability, Appellant must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To do so, Appellant must demonstrate that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-16\">We have carefully reviewed Mr. Ces-spooch\u2019s brief, the district court\u2019s disposition, and the record on appeal. Nothing in the facts, the record on appeal, or Appellant\u2019s brief raises an issue which meets our standards for the grant of a certificate of appealability. We cannot say that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>We DENY Appellant\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal. Appellant\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration, \u201cSpecial Motion for Appointment of Counsel,\u201d \u201cMotion Objection of Anything Stricken from the Docket,\u201d \u201cMotion Denied Due Process of Institution,\u201d and \u201cMotion Denied of Due Process of Clerk Office\u201d are DENIED. Appellant\u2019s Motion to amend his opening brief is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
