We deny the Tiamzons\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">We review for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s denial of his claims. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995). We may reverse the BIA only if the evidence in the record <em>compels </em>a contrary result. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). An applicant for asylum or withholding of deportation bears the evidentiary burdens of proof and persuasion. <em>See id. </em>at 483-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">To be eligible for asylum, an alien must show: (1) he was persecuted in the past on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; or (2) he has a well-founded fear of future persecution in a particular country on account of any of the same grounds. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). If past persecution is established, a rebutta-ble presumption arises that the applicant also has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.13(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">The record refutes Mr. Tiamzon\u2019s contention that he has suffered, and has a well-founded fear of suffering, the same kind of persecution on account of political opinion as the petitioners in <em>Borja v. INS, </em>175 F.3d 732 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc), and <em>Briones v. INS, </em>175 F.3d 727 (9th Cir. 1999) (en bane). In <em>Borja </em>and <em>Briones, </em>both the political opinion of the petitioners and the persecution on the basis of it were identifiable. In contrast, the record before us not only fails to show a political motive on the part of Mr. Tiamzon, but also fails to suggest that the NPA considered Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Tiamzon to be opposed to their political program.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">A petitioner \u201ccannot simply prove that there exists a generalized or random possibility of persecution in his native country; he must show that he is at particular risk \u2014 that his \u2018predicament is appreciably different from the dangers faced by [his] fellow citizens.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kotasz v. INS, </em>31 F.3d 847, 852 (9th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Vides-Vides v. INS, </em>783 F.2d 1463, 1469 (9th Cir.1986)). The IJ and the BIA reviewed Mr. Tiamzon\u2019s claims in light of the State Department\u2019s 1994 Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions regarding the Philippines. The Profile notes that \u201cin most instances the NPA\u2019s objective is to take advantage of the applicant\u2019s financial resources; the NPA is not concerned by the political opinion of its intended victim but is rather interested in the victim\u2019s wealth.\u201d Here, the NPA sought to take advantage of Mr. Tiamzon\u2019s financial resources \u2014 his access to and influence over wealthy patrons of the cock pit business\u2014 and evinced no interest in his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of the Tiamzons\u2019 asylum application. Since the asylum standard of \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d is more lenient than the withholding of deportation standard of \u201cclear probability,\u201d Mr. Tiamzon\u2019s failure to establish eligibility for asylum also forecloses the Tiamzons\u2019 eligibility for withholding of deportation. <em>See Ghaly, </em>58 F.3d at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">PETITION DENIED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b268-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-9\">.
