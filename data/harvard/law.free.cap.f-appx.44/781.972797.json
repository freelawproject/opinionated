Teeters &amp; </em>Assocs., <em>Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>172 Ariz. 324, 836 P.2d 1034, 1039 (1992). Under <em>A.R. Teeters, </em>the transfer of a corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal assets\u201d is a prerequisite to successor liability. <em>Id. </em>First Commerce argues that the district court erred in not finding that Grantham transferred its goodwill to Genesis. Because First Commerce failed to ask the district court to make such a finding, the argument is waived. <em>Hollinger v. United States, </em>651 F.2d 636, 640-41 (9th Cir.1981) (citation omitted). Even if First Commerce had not waived this argument, we would conclude that the district court\u2019s finding on this issue was not clearly erroneous because Genesis did not purchase the Grantham receivables which had an esti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>mated value of $338,000. Nor did it purchase Grantham\u2019s trade name or the tools that ultimately sold at auction for over $27,000. <em>Acheson v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>523 F.2d 1327, 1329-30 (9th Cir.1975) (interpreting a nearly identical provision in California law to require the purchase of \u201call or substantially all of a corporation\u2019s assets\u201d). Since First Commerce\u2019s other successor liability arguments hinge on the \u201cprincipal assets\u201d issue, the same result obtains.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">With this amendment, the panel as constituted above has unanimously voted to deny Appellant/Cross-Appellants\u2019 petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The petition for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
