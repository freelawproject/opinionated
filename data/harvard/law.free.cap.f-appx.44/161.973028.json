FLETCHER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b198-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company (\u201cFireman\u2019s Fund\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Security National Insurance Company (\u201cSecurity National\u201d) regarding Security National\u2019s duty to indemnify Fireman\u2019s Fund. We reverse the district court and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">I. <em>Duty to Indemnify</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-14\">In the insurance context, the duty to indemnify exists if the facts of the case demonstrate a right to coverage under the insurance policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court erred when it held that, to demonstrate the right to coverage in this case, Fireman\u2019s Fund had to prove that Chambers Construction Company (\u201cChambers\u201d) was liable for its alleged negligent act. Not only does <em>Northwest Pump &amp; Equipment Co. v. American States Insurance Co.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>not mandate that conclusion, but no other jurisdiction requires such proof, and Oregon public policy is contrary to such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-15\">In <em>Northwest Pump, </em>the court held that the insurance company had to indemnify the insured for settlement costs only if the underlying event that gave rise to the original claim was covered by the policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the underlying event fell within a policy exclusion, the insurer was not obligated to indemnify the insured. The issue of coverage did not involve the insured\u2019s liability; it depended solely on the applicability of a certain policy exclusion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Northwest Pump </em>does not support the district court\u2019s conclusion that coverage under the policy depends on proof of Lability.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-16\">No other jurisdiction requires proof of liability to trigger the duty to indemnify after a settlement. As one court stated, \u201cto recover the amount of the settlement from the insurer, the insured need not establish actual Lability to the party with whom it has settled so long as ... a potential liability on the facts known to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>[insured is] shown to exist ....\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Most courts hold that the basis for the settlement determines the duty to indemnify.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And while courts may require the parties to establish facts that prove the underlying action was within the policy\u2019s coverage, no court requires the insured to establish its own liability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The district court\u2019s holding is also inconsistent with Oregon\u2019s policy of encouraging settlement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By making an insured prove its own liability, the district court negates the time and cost-saving benefits of settlement as well as the benefit of avoiding a liability declaration. The district court erred by requiring such proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The district court also erred by holding that Security National\u2019s insurance policy did not cover the underlying claim. The short form endorsement covered Chambers with respect to liability arising out of Comfort Flow Heating Company\u2019s (\u201cComfort Flow\u201d) ongoing operations performed for Chambers. The short form endorsement is distinct from the long form endorsement and provides a different definition of coverage. If Security National wanted the two endorsements to provide identical coverage, it would have used identical language. The short form endorsement covered liability stemming from Chambers\u2019 negligent act because that act arose out of Comfort Flow\u2019s HVAC installation operations performed for Chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">We reverse the district court\u2019s holding and conclude that Security National did have a duty to indemnify Fireman\u2019s Fund. We remand for the district court to determine whether the settlement amount was reasonable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\">II. <em>Oregon Revised Statute \u00a7 SO-HO</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-16\">The district court correctly held that Oregon Revised Statute \u00a7 30.140 did not apply to this case. That statutory provision voids agreements to indemnify that are found in construction contracts. It does not void agreements to purchase insurance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The construction contract in this case contained an agreement to purchase insurance. Thus, \u00a7 30.140 is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>III. <em>Lamb-Weston Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">On remand, the district court should apply the Lamb-Weston<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> rule to determine the amount of money to which Fireman\u2019s Fund is entitled. Both the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy and the Security National policy were primary insurance for Chambers because liability attached under each policy as soon as Chambers was sued for negligence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Neither policy required Chambers to have other underlying insurance that it must first exhaust. However, both policies had provisions limiting the extent of the insurer\u2019s liability if the insured had other applicable insurance. Under the <em>Lamb-Weston </em>rule, those provisions are repugnant and are disregarded.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The parties must share liability in proportion to the limits of coverage carried by each.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because the policy limits in this case are the same, each insurer is hable for one-half of the insured\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">We reverse the district court and hold that Security National had a duty to indemnify Fireman\u2019s Fund for settlement costs. We remand to the district court to determine if the settlement amount was reasonable and to apply the <em>Lamb-Weston </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b198-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-12\">. <em>Northwest Pump &amp; Equip.
