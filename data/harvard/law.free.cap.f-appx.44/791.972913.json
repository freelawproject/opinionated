We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">Montalvo-Dominguez\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 562 (9th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2314, 152 L.Ed.2d 1067 (2002). Moreover, we find no <em>Apprendi </em>error where the sentence actually imposed for each count does not exceed the statutory maximum for each of the crimes of which he was convicted. <em>See United States v. Gill, </em>280 F.3d 923, 931 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">Montalvo-Dominguez also challenges the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence for his role as a leader or organizer under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). We review for clear error. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>291 F.3d 1091, 1097 (9th Cir.2002). In determining the applicability of section 3Bl.l(a), district court should consider the following factors: (1) the exercise of decision making authority, (2) the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, (3) the recruitment of accomplices, (4) the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, (5) the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, (6) the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and (7) the degree of control and authority exercised over others. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>258 F.3d 971, 977-78 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see United States v. Barnes, </em>993 F.2d 680, 685 (9th Cir.1993). In reviewing the record, we find no error in the district court\u2019s application of the four-level upward adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b828-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
