Having carefully reviewed the record, <em>see Bryant ex rel. Bryant v. Apfel, </em>141 F.3d 1249, 1251 (8th Cir.1998) (standard of review), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-17\">In the January 1996 application, Carla alleged that Carl had been disabled since August 1990 (the month of his birth) from attention deficit disorder (ADD) and hyperactivity. After an August 1998 hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found Carl\u2019s ADD and hyperactivity, his speech/language disorders, and his possible learning disabilities severe, but not of listing-level severity either alone or in combination. The ALJ further found that Carl\u2019s impairments were not functionally equivalent to the severity of any listing.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-20\">Carla first argues that Carl met the requirements for Listing 112.11 (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, Pt. B \u00a7 112.11 (2000). Carl\u2019s school records, professional evaluations, and Carla\u2019s statements, however, reflect that when Carl was taking the medication prescribed for his ADD and hyperactivity, he did not have \u201cmarked\u201d limitations in inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity (the A criteria). <em>See id. </em>(requiring claimant to meet all three A criteria and at least two B criteria); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 112.00C (defining \u201cmarked\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 112.00F (stating that in assessing impairment severity, attention must be focused on functional limitations which persist despite medication).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-21\">Carla also generally contends that Carl\u2019s impairments were functionally equivalent to a listed impairment. We disagree. Contrary to her assertion, the ALJ thoroughly summarized the regulatory requirements for functional equivalence and then applied them to the record, citing specific evidence in support of his findings. Further, the ALJ properly determined that Carl\u2019s limitations of specific functions, such as walking or talking, were not extreme, which is consistent with the findings of the speech pathologists who evaluated Carl and with the comments of Carl\u2019s teachers. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(b)(l), (c)(3)\u00ae) (2000) (requirements and definitions). As to the other relevant method for determining functional equivalence \u2014 examining broad areas of development or functioning, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(c)(4) (2000) (categorizing such areas by specific age groups) \u2014 the ALJ properly determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>(based on the testing results and the assessments of Carl\u2019s teachers and other professionals) that Carl did not have the requisite extreme limitation in one of these areas or marked limitation in two, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(b)(2), (c)(3)\u00a9 (2000) (requirements and definitions).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Carla\u2019s remaining arguments provide no basis for reversal. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-18\">. The Honorable Robert E. Larsen, United States Magistrate Judge for the Western District of Missouri, to whom the case was referred for final disposition by consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
