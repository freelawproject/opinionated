We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-24\">(1) Verduzco-Laurel argues that there was insufficient evidence to support a two-level aggravating role enhancement under USSG \u00a7 SBl.lic),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the district court failed to make the necessary findings concerning that enhancement. We reject the former contention; there was ample evidence that he exercised authority over his two nephews, who, upon his request, delivered the drugs from a remote location. We do, however, find merit in the latter contention. Despite the fact that Verduzco-Laurel specifically disputed the Presentence Report\u2019s allegation that he had claimed that others worked for him, and despite the fact that testimony was heard from the undercover officer on the matter, the district court made no findings that resolved the dispute. That was error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>219 F.3d 863, 866 (9th Cir.2000). Therefore, the sentence must be vacated. <em>See United States v. Fernandez-Angulo, </em>897 F.2d 1514, 1516 (9th Cir.1990) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-25\">(2) Verduzco-Laurel also challenges the district court\u2019s application of a two-level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). We conclude that the district court did not commit clear error in determining that the guns found in Verduzco-Laurel\u2019s home and buried with drugs in his backyard were \u201cpossessed\u201d by him within the meaning of \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). <em>See United States v. Kyllo, </em>37 F.3d 526, 531 (9th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Pitts, </em>6 F.3d 1366, 1368, 1372-73 (9th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Gillock, </em>886 F.2d 220, 223 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">AFFIRMED in PART, VACATED in PART, AND REMANDED. The district court need not take further evidence, or consider any sentencing issues other than the finding concerning the aggravating role enhancement.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b289-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-28\">.
