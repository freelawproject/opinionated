Rich in tradition and ritual, Freemasonry\u2019s roots run deep. Born of the guild system of medieval Europe, Freemasons first shared a common craft \u2014 stone-cutters \u2014 but soon embraced members from various backgrounds who shared common ideals \u2014 fraternity, equality, peace, truth, virtue, enlightenment. Members gathered at their \u201clodges\u201d (usually taverns and alehouses) to lend mutual aid and support, first to each other, and later, to all of humanity. Lodge meetings became social rather than business occasions, and on St. John the Baptist\u2019s Day, June 24, 1717, at the Goose and Gridiron alehouse, four lodges in London joined in forming a \u201cMother Grand Lodge of the World,\u201d soon to be known as the Grand Lodge of England, and elected their first Grand Master. Norman Davies, <em>Europe: A History </em>633 (1996). This first Grand Lodge became the wellspring of Masonic organization and practice for all Masonic orders and lodges thereafter established in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Freemasonry flourished in Eighteenth Century Europe, where it enjoyed the generous patronage of many among the aristocracy and the nobility of Prussia, Austria and France, and growing popularity among intellectuals and musicians. Voltaire became a Freemason at age 83. Haydn was a Freemason, as was Mozart, whose 1791 opera <em>Die Zauberfl\u00f6te (The Magic Flute) </em>celebrates Masonic values, symbolism and imagery. <em>See </em>Jasper Ridley, <em>The Freemasons: A History of the World\u2019s Most Powerful Secret Society </em>112, 113-14 (2001); Jacques Chailley, <em>The Magic Flute Unveiled </em>(1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">The history of Freemasonry intersects the history of our own Nation as early as the colonial and revolutionary eras. Benjamin Franklin was an enthusiastic Freemason, active for many years. Other Freemasons present at the founding of the Republic included George Washington, John Hancock, Paul Revere, and John Paul Jones. Ridley, <em>supra, </em>at 108-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">Early in its history, Freemasonry laid claim to secret knowledge of great antiquity, to be shared only among its initiates. William Hutchinson, a Freemason writing in 1775, declared, \u201cThere is no doubt that our ceremonies and mysteries were derived from the rites, ceremonies, and institutions of the ancients, and some of them from the remotest ages.\u201d William Hutchinson, <em>The Spirit of Masonry </em>62 (rev. ed. George Oliver 1982). Freemasons share the Pythagoreans\u2019 affinity for triangles and geometry, <em>id. </em>at 71-79 <em>&amp; </em>n. 11,148-54; they embrace a doctrine of \u201cInner Light\u201d that some ascribe to ancient Egypt at the time of the pyramids, or civilizations even older;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> they find meaningful allegory in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the building of the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem; and they subscribe to \u201cMysteries,\u201d or bodies of esoteric knowledge,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> attributed to ancient Egypt, Greece, and Jerusalem, as well as to the tradition of the Holy Grail. <em>See generally </em>W. Kirk MacNulty, <em>Freemasonry: A Journey Through Ritual and Symbol </em>(1991); Arthur E. Waite, <em>A New Encyclopaedia of Freemasonry </em>(1970); Albert G. Mackey, <em>The Symbolism of Freemasonry </em>(1869); <em>cf. </em>Christopher Knight &amp; Robert Lomas, <em>The Hiram Key </em>(1996). They speak of \u201cgreat secret systems of the Mysteries\u201d or \u201c \u2018noble orders of architecture,\u2019 <em>ie., </em>of soul-building\u201d found in many cultures, and posit that \u201cbehind all the great moral movements and developments in the history of humanity, have stood what St. Paul called the keepers or \u2018stewards of the Mysteries,\u2019 \u201d from whom issued \u201cmodern speculative Freemasonry.\u201d Walter L. Wilm-shurst, <em>The Meaning of Masonry </em>23, 24 (5th ed.1927).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Freemasonry has often been described as \u201c \u2018a science of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Starting with the essential compass, square and volume of sacred law,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a \u201cvery rich and complex symbolic structure\u201d plays a central role in Masonic study and practice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\">[t]he Candidate for Masonry is introduced to that symbolic structure by participating in the ritual dramas, called \u201cDegrees,\u201d through which Freemasonry communicates its teaching of morality. The symbols are drawn, in part, from the practices of the medieval stone masons\u2019 guilds; and as part of the task of administering Masonic activities the Grand Lodges perform a role as the custodian of those symbols. In practice, the Grand Lodges preserve this body of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>symbolism and protect it from change;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">MacNulty, <em>supra, </em>at 6; <em>see also </em>Daniel Beresniak &amp; Laziz Hamani, <em>Symbols of Freemasonry </em>(2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The Freemasons have adopted various systems, or \u201crites,\u201d governing the personal advancement of members through the progression of hierarchical \u201cdegrees.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The popular \u201cScottish Rite,\u201d for example, delineates a progression from 4\u00b0 to 32\u00b0 based upon a member\u2019s mastery of prescribed lessons teaching Masonic values and principles, among them faith, hope, universal benevolence, trustworthiness, fidelity, integrity, religious tolerance, the dignity of labor, and duty to family, country, and God. See <em>generally </em>Albert Pike, <em>Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry </em>(1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u201cOperating in an aura of secretiveness and symbolism, the masonic lodges fostered a curious mixture of medieval mysticism and modern rationalism.\u201d Mortimer Chambers, et al., <em>The Western Experience </em>642 (3d ed.1983).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">The air of mystery surrounding freemasonry is deliberately cultivated. It is attractive to sympathizers, offensive to opponents. Non-initiates are left guessing about its rituals, its hierarchy, its pseudo-oriental jargon, its signs and symbols, and its purposes. The compass and square, the apron and gloves, and the circle on the floor are obviously designed to encourage belief in the movement\u2019s medieval guild origins.... Davies, <em>supra, </em>at 633.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">It has been observed that Freemasonry is \u201ca science \u2014 a philosophy \u2014 a system of doctrines which is taught, in a manner peculiar to itself, by allegories and symbols,\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that it is \u201cessentially an educational society, attempting to teach its members a moral philosophy of life,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that it offers a \u201cspecial way of living expressed through symbols and dramatic stories\u201d that \u201cpoints the way to self-improvement through service to others.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">American Freemasons today make up about three-fourths of the total number of all members throughout the world. As American Freemasons, all of the parties to this case share in this esoteric tradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">Co-Freemasonry &amp; the American Federation of Human Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">Many Masonic orders and lodges admit only males as members. Often, women in American Masonic families participate in the affiliate \u201cOrder of the Eastern Star,\u201d an organization well known for promoting many charitable activities, but do not become members of Masonic lodges themselves. \u201cCo-Freemasonry\u201d distinguishes itself from other Masonic traditions by its inclusion of women as well as men as members of the lodge on an equal footing.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">\n<em>The International Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b345-17\">The Order of International Co-Freemasonry Le Droit Humain (L\u2019Ordre Magon-nique Mixte International le Droit Hu-main) (\u201cthe International Order\u201d) traces its own particular origin to Nineteenth Century France:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-18\">In 1882 a woman named Marie Der-aismes was initiated into a French mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>culine Lodge called appropriately \u201cLes Libres Penseurs\u201d (The Free Thinkers). In 1893, Dr. Georges Martin, a French Senator and advocate of equal rights for women, joined Marie Deraismes and other male Masons in founding in Paris <em>La Respectable Loge, Le Droit Humain, Maconnerie Mixte </em>(Worshipful Lodge, Le Droit Humain, Co-Masonry). They initiated, passed, and raised sixteen prominent French women.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Le Droit Humain \u2014 American Federation, \u201cWhen and how did Co-Freemasonry begin?\u201d <em>at </em>http://www.comasonic.org/faqaf.html (last modified March 14, 1999); <em>see also </em>Ordre Magonnique Mixte International \u201cLe Droit Humain,\u201d <em>Rapide Historique de I\u2019Ordre International Mixte \u201cLe Droit Humain,\u201d at </em>http://www.droit-humain.org/ (April 12, 1998) (in French).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Another text recounts that the <em>Les Li-bres Penseurs </em>Lodge, \u201cbelonging to a then recognized Masonic Obedience,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">decided to initiate a woman, a certain Mdlle. Maria Deraismes, a well-known authoress and lecturer, noted for her service to humanitarian and feminist movements. They did so, in the presence of a large assembly, on January 14th, 1882. The Right Worshipful Master, Bro. Houbron, 18\u00b0, justified their experiment as having the welfare and highest interests of humanity at heart, and as being a perfectly logical application of the principle of \u2018A Free Mason in a Free Lodge.\u2019 The Lodge was of course suspended for putting the family motto into practice ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">For some time Sister Maria Der-aismes did nothing in the way of extending to others the Masonic privileges she had received. Eventually she yielded to the persuasion of friends, and notably of Dr. Georges Martin. This latter gentleman was a member of the Lodge <em>Les Libres Penseurs </em>when Mdlle. Des-raimes was initiated. He gave her his staunch support and the benefit of his wide Masonic experience throughout her Masonic career.... On March 14th, 1893, Sister Desraismes initiated a number of ladies, in the presence of Dr. Martin, and on April 4th of the same year <em>La Gmnde Loge Symbolique Ecos-saise de France, Le Droit Humain, </em>came into being....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-10\">In 1900, the new Grand Lodge, with a view to extending its ramifications into other countries, found it desirable to work the higher degrees. Aided, therefore, by Brethren in possession of the 33\u00b0 the body was raised from a Craft Grand Lodge to a Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">J.I. Wedgwood, <em>Universal Co-Freemasonry: What is it?, quoted in </em>Leadbeater, <em>supra, </em>at 192-93. In so doing, the International Order gained its independence from other Grand Lodges or Obediences, while at the same time reaffirming its commitment to preserve and maintain Masonic traditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-12\">Co-Masonry, a new Obedience independent of all others, has not created a new Rite. That which distinguishes it from other existing Obediences is that, instead of admitting men only to its ranks, it admits women on an equal footing. It proclaims equal rights for both sexes and absolute liberty of conscience; and it demands, in order to secure to everyone unlimited freedom in the search for truth, the utmost tolerance from all members. It avoids political and religious discussions wherever these cannot be carried on with the requisite tolerance and moderation; it welcomes everyone who is free and of good report, whatever may be his convictions in matters religious or philosophical.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>(\u201cForeword,\u201d in <em>Constitution By-Laws and Rules and Regulations of the American Federation of Human Rights </em>1 (5th ed.1977), Addendum vol.

The International Constitution proclaims its commitment to gender equality, establishes a Supreme Council as \u201cthe supreme governing body of all Lodges, Chapters, Areopagi, Tribunals, Consistories, Grand Councils of the 33rd degree, Jurisdictions and Federations\u201d of the International Order, and vests the Supreme Council with \u201cspecial duties and prerogatives\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">[t]o establish Lodges of all degrees; to control the principles enunciated and the rituals practiced by such Lodges; to enforce the International Constitution; to prepare and to issue International Means of Recognition and Masonic Passports; to settle in the last resort, all matters in such a way as to ensure the stability and progress of the Order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoD\">(International Constitution, Art. 18 [Ch. IV, Art. I],<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Addendum, vol. I, tab 1, at 3, App. vol. I, at 164.) Indeed, \u201cTo the Supreme Council alone is entrusted the preservation of the principles\u201d of the International Order. <em>(Id. </em>Art. 17 [Ch. Ill, Art. 3], Addendum vol. I, tab 1, at 3.) The Supreme Council may \u201ccreate and establish Lodges in countries where none exist,\u201d may \u201cestablish Federations in countries applying for them,\u201d may \u201cissue Charters of Constitution for all Lodges ...

A year later he was appointed Representative of the Supreme Council of the International Order, and a Certificate of Re Incorporation was registered by the Federation on May 26, 1909:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-12\">The particular business and objects of this society are to demand equal rights for both sexes before the law, to labor according to the Constitution and Gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>al By-Laws to be made and adopted by the society for the mutual improvement of its members by combating ignorance under all its forms, the building up of human character, the practice of solidarity, the upholding of high standards of honor, and of social justice with a kindly feeling towards all, and a ceaseless endeavor to promote the moral and material welfare of the human race, and to that end, to organize and to conduct throughout the United States of America, branches or Lodges of Co-Masonry under the authority or jurisdiction of the Supreme Council of universal Co-Masonry with headquarters in Paris, France.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">(Certificate of Re-Incorporation, dated May 18, 1909, at 1, Addendum vol.

(Addendum, tab 3, at 77.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">A tract of land located in Larkspur, Colorado was purchased in August of 1916, and soon became the site of AFHR\u2019s administrative headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Due to a lapse in filing of required reports, the 1909 corporation was no longer in good standing by 1974, when a question arose concerning whether the 1909 corporation could qualify to do business in Colorado and AFHR could thereby purchase a parcel of real property (the \u201cGrove Property\u201d) in the name of the Federation; it appears a title insurance policy could not issue to AFHR because the corporation was not in good standing. <em>{See </em>Letter from Freda M. Cadwalader, dated September 25, 1974, Addendum, vol. I, tab 5, at 83.) To correct this problem, the American Federation of Human Rights (\u201cAFHR\u201d) was again reincorporated in 1975, this time in Colorado, where AFHR\u2019s national headquarters is located. AFHR\u2019s Articles of Re-Incorporation echoed the broad corporate purposes declared in the 1909 certificate, but with some significant modifications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">Among other things, the particular business and objects of this society are to demand Equal Rights for both sexes before the law, to labor according to the Constitution and General By-Laws to be made and adopted by the society for the mutual improvement of its members by combating ignorance under all its forms, the building up of human character, the practice of solidarity, the upholding of high standards of honor, and of social justice with a kindly feeling towards all, and a ceaseless endeavor to promote the morals and material welfare of the human race, and to that end, to organize and to conduct throughout the United States of America, branches or Lodges \u201cof fraternal helpfulness through the study of ritualistic forms in groups of members, known as Lodges, with in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>come derived from fees and dues and contributions through the groups of members known as Lodges and voluntary donations by members in addition to assessments, all on a non-profit basis\u201d.

Of particular significance to the issues raised on this appeal is Article VIII, Section 1 of the AFHR By-Laws: \u201cThe Grand Council of Administration shall have exclusive control of all funds and properties of the Federation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>Art. VIII, Sec. 1, Blue Book at 23, Addendum vol.

Ms. Haack purportedly had overseen the investment of AFHR funds in \u201cjunk bonds,\u201d a dubious investment strategy that ultimately led to her resignation in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">\n<em>AFHR and the By-Laws Amendment Controversy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-17\">In the wake of the Calla Haack controversy, the Supreme Council (through its Acting Representative) invited AFHR to consider amending its By-Laws to remove its Representative from AFHR\u2019s Grand Council of Administration and to bar the Representative from simultaneously serving as AFHR President. (Ballot Packet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>dated July 30, 1992, Pltfs\u2019 Exh. 47, Addendum, vol. I, tab 23, at 111.) It was proposed to amend Article III, Section 1 of the AFHR By-Laws to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">Administrative duties and financial responsibilities, comparable to those of Trustees and Boards of Directors of similar corporations, are vested in the Grand Council of Administration, which shall consist of five elected Officers of the Federation.

It was also proposed to amend Article IV, Section 1 of the ByLaws to read: \u201cThe President, Vice President and [two] <em>three </em>Directors shall be elected by members of the Third Class in good standing every five years.

I, tab 29, at 126-27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-14\">In January 1993, the By-Law amendments were forwarded to the Supreme Council for approval. In September 1993, the Supreme Council, making a curious about-face, responded by proffering its own additional amendments, including another amendment to Article III of the ByLaws providing that \u201c[hjowever, the decisions taken by the Grand Council of Administration may be enforced only if the [Representative] do[es] not refuse them,\u201d and that AFHR board members may not serve for successive terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-15\">As the district court found, \u201cThis tortured language or translation was interpreted by Ms. Bressler ... to grant a veto power ...\u201d (FC &amp; 0 at 9, App. vol. II, at 395.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>) She urged the AFHR members to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>adopt that change under threat of revoking AFHR\u2019s status as a federation under the International Constitution, relegating AFHR to the status of a \u201cjurisdiction\u201d under the direct control of the Supreme Council:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">Minutes of the September 1993 meeting of the Supreme Council have been received ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">An excerpt from the minutes reads: \u201cshould these amendments be refused, the American Federation would be changed into a Jurisdiction with the consequences resulting from it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">We should realize that a Jurisdiction has no Constitution.

II, at 395.)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">Of course, as the district court observed, AFHR is a Colorado nonprofit corporation and is therefore a creature of Colorado law and its own organic documents \u2014 not of the International Order, its Supreme Council, or its Representative. The dire consequences threatened by Ms. Bressler and the Supreme Council \u2014 particularly those set forth above in italics \u2014 ignore both AFHR\u2019s By-Laws and the Colorado law pursuant to which they were adopted.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-14\">Interpreted as such, however, the new amendments confronted AFHR and its members with a dilemma: if they adopted the new amendments, corporate governance would ultimately vest in an individual appointed from outside AFHR \u2014 an individual that the Supreme Council had insisted at the same time should <em>not </em>sit on AFHR\u2019s board and should not be AFHR\u2019s President. On the other hand, if they declined to adopt the new amendments, the Supreme Council and its Representative, Vera Bressler, threatened the drastic consequences outlined in her letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-16\">AFHR\u2019s voting members \u2014 the Bressler Plaintiffs among them \u2014 were plainly apprised of this threat at the time that they voted on the 1993 proposed amendments. While they had supported the 1992 amendments, AFHR\u2019s incumbent directors openly opposed the Supreme Council\u2019s 1993 proposals, and those amendments were soon rejected by 68 per cent of the members who cast votes (nearly 70 per cent of the eligible members). (FC &amp; O at 9-10, App. vol. II, at 395-96.)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-17\">On January 3, 1994, when AFHR President Rosario G. Menocal announced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>results, the die was cast. (Letter of Rosario G. Menocal, dated January 3, 1994, Pltfs\u2019 Exh. 81, Addendum, vol. I, tab 49, at 169.) With nearly detached understatement, President Menocal advised the voting members: \u201cThe situation in which the members of the American Federation find themselves today, due to the letters sent to the members by The Very Ills. Bro. Bres-sler, needs to be defined.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>As the district court found,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">The President of AFHR then sent a letter to the leader of the International Order (Grand Master) explaining AFHR\u2019s status as a Colorado non-profit corporation and its need to comply with its own bylaws (requiring approval of amendments by 60% of the voting membership) and informing him that approximately two-thirds of the membership rejected the dictated changes. Ex. GG. In an effort to resolve the issues, the board obtained an audience with the Grand Master in Paris on January 20, 1994. Ex. 81 and 82. The board\u2019s entreaties were rejected by the Permanent Commission of the Supreme Council\u2014 which included Ms. Haack and Ms. Bres-sler.

II, at 397.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The meeting was to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Following the January 20, 1994, meeting, the defendant AFHR Directors conferred among themselves, and then returned to the United States, where they mailed letters to the International Order and to AFHR members expressing their intention to operate independently of the International Order. (Letter from Rosario G. Menocal, dated January 20, 1994, Addendum, vol. II, tab 51, at 172; Letter from Rosario Menocal, et al., dated January 21, 1994, Pltfs\u2019 Exh. 85, Addendum, vol. II, tab 53, at 174-75.) The AFHR board advised AFHR\u2019s membership of the board\u2019s intention to \u201cproceed as \u2018an obedience independent from Le Droit Humain, working all degrees from the 1st through the 33rd.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id.)</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As the district court found,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">The reaction of the Supreme Council was to dismiss the defendants from the International Order as a \u201cclandestine\u201d order, albeit in legal possession of the American Federation\u2019s assets.

(App. vol.

Defendants Appellees generally concur as to the substance of the issues raised, but dispute the Bressler Plaintiffs\u2019 characterizations of various factual matters \u2014 characterizations that form the core of the actual controversy in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">Colorado law governs in this diversity case, including the provisions of the former Colorado Nonprofit Corporation Act, Colo. Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 7-20-101 <em>et seq. </em>(1973) (repealed 1998), as well as authoritative precedent from the Colorado state courts. <em>See Adams-Arapahoe School District No. 28-J v. GAF Corp., </em>959 F.2d 868, 870-71 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">The Bressler Plaintiffs do not contest the district court\u2019s findings of fact. Instead, plaintiffs challenge the district court\u2019s legal conclusions, its application of law to the facts as found \u2014 conclusions which we review <em>de novo. See, e.g., Naimie v. Cytozyme Laboratories, Inc., </em>174 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>F.3d 1104, 1111 (10th Cir.1999). We likewise review <em>de novo </em>findings of \u201cultimate fact derived from applying legal principles to subsidiary facts.\u201d <em>First Natl Bank v. Comm\u2019r, </em>921 F.2d 1081, 1086 (10th Cir. 1990). \u201c \u2018On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the district court ruling and must uphold any finding that is permissible in light of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Manning v. United States, </em>146 F.3d 808, 812-13 (10th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Exxon Corp. v. Gann, </em>21 F.3d 1002, 1005 (10th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">WHETHER AFHR PROPERTY IS HELD IN TRUST FOR PLAINTIFFS</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The district court adopted the parties\u2019 assumption that AFHR \u201cis the owner of certain real and personal property valued at approximately $1,000,000,\u201d such as its headquarters property in Larkspur, Colorado. (FC <em>&amp; </em>O, App. vol. II, at 387 n. 1.) Nothing in the briefs or record excerpts submitted to this court disputes that assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Instead, the Bressler Plaintiffs assert that AFHR holds the property it owns in an express trust for the benefit of those members who remain loyal to the International Order. In the alternative, the Bres-sler Plaintiffs argue that the district court should have imposed a constructive trust upon AFHR\u2019s corporate assets in favor of those members who remain loyal to the International Order because of the defendants\u2019 inequitable conduct in \u201cseceding\u201d from the International Order in breach of their fiduciary duties to those members still loyal, and in breach of their contractual obligations to the International Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">The Bressler Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cfirst\u201d issue on appeal thus raises at least two separate issues, and we will address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"AuY7\">The Existence of an Express Trust</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">\n<em>The Parties\u2019 Theories</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">The centerpiece of the Bressler Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of this case at trial and on this appeal is a \u201cblack-letter\u201d rule of the law governing beneficial associations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-14\">When a person ceases to be a member of a voluntary beneficial association, his interest in its funds and property likewise ceases. This rule applies even where a number of members secede in a body, and although they constitute a majority and organize a new association. In such case, the remaining members, and only they, are entitled to the entire funds and property of the association, so long as they continue to keep it alive and to adhere to its purposes....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-15\">10 C.J.S. <em>Beneficial Associations </em>\u00a7 48 (1995) (footnotes omitted). At the district court, plaintiffs urged that the defendants\u2019 actions in refusing to amend AFHR\u2019s ByLaws as demanded by the Supreme Council and declaring their intention to operate apart from the International Order were the actions of disloyal members seceding from the organization and that they thereby lost any interest in or control over the organization\u2019s property, individually or as directors of AFHR. <em>(See </em>FC &amp; O at 13, App. vol. II, at 399; Opening Brief at 26; Reply Brief at 8.) Ms. Bressler and others, as former AFHR members still \u201cloyal\u201d to the International Order, insist that the above-quoted rule applies to the events of 1993-94 and that AFHR\u2019s property must therefore be held in trust for their benefit.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>They also point to <em>Bishop and Diocese of Colorado v. Mote, </em>716 P.2d 85 (Colo.), <em>cert, denied, </em>479 U.S. 826,107 S.Ct. 102, 93 L.Ed.2d 52 (1986), as authority for the proposition that Colorado law recognizes an \u201cexpress trust created by implication in fact\u201d where the property of a local church has been \u201cdedicated to the use and control\u201d of a larger church organization as evidenced by a long-term pattern of local subservience to the larger body. (Reply Brief at 6-7 (citing <em>Mote, </em>716 P.2d at 103 n. 14, 104-08).) The Bressler Plaintiffs argue that \u201cthe district court erred in projecting that the Colorado courts would not recognize the imposition of the express trust sought here by the plaintiffs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Defendants-appellees AFHR and its directors, Rosario Menocal; Yvonne Haley; Maximo Cumsille; Norbert Orszula; John Schwarz (the \u201cAFHR Directors\u201d) respond that the re-incorporation of AFHR in Colorado in 1975 yielded an autonomous corporate entity governed by its own articles, by-laws and the applicable laws of the State of Colorado, independent of the control of the International Order. \u201cFraternal matters which were ritualistic in nature\u201d were thereafter governed by an unincorporated federation of lodges under the rules and regulations adopted by the federation\u2019s North American Consistory and pursuant to the International Constitution. (Appellees\u2019 Answer Brief at 15.) In effect, according to the AFHR Directors, the International Order ratified AFHR\u2019s independence in 1979 by approving AFHR\u2019s Colorado re-incorporation\u2014 at least twenty years before the Calla Haack controversy arose, and long before AFHR\u2019s January 20, 1994 meeting with the Grand Master in Paris. They insist that the International Order in 1994 was in no position to wrest control of AFHR from AFHR\u2019s own Grand Council of Administration, or to seize control of AFHR\u2019s corporate assets through the efforts of Ms. Bressler, Mr. Voirol, or anyone else.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">The district court concluded that [i]n this instance, the Corporation was formed with the declared intent of separating its legal or secular matters from its ritual or ceremonial aspects.... If in fact the Colorado Corporation changed the legal relationship between the American federation and the International Order, that change was approved by the Order in 1979.... An independent legal entity was created, and plaintiffs cannot now transmogrify a Colorado corporation into (or back into) an obedient association in disregard of law, its articles and bylaws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">(FC &amp; O at 19-20, App. vol. II, at 405-06.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>In their Reply Brief, the Bressler Plaintiffs submit that the issue on appeal is \u201cnot whether secession occurred in 1975,\u201d but \u201cwhether the American Branch of the Order created a corporate structure in 1975 that stripped the fraternity\u2019s loyal members of their legal interest in the contributions collected, and property obtained, over its ninety-year history.\u201d (Reply Br. at 2.) They dispute the district court\u2019s conclusion that subservience to the International Order as demanded by its Supreme Council in 1993 was inimical to AFHR\u2019s corporate governance or in any way contrary to Colorado law.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\n<em>The International Order and AFHR Corporate Documents</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The Bressler Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion of an express trust in AFHR\u2019s assets would prove far easier to accept had the International Order and AFHR\u2019s incorporators availed themselves of the simple expedient of including explicit language in the International Constitution and in AFHR\u2019s Charter, Articles of Re-incorporation, or ByLaws, <em>e.g., </em>that \u201cthe property of the Federation is held in trust for the Order of International Co-Masonry Le Droit Hu-main,\u201d \u2014 if that indeed was the parties\u2019 intention at the time that AFHR was brought into corporate existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Express language was at issue in <em>Die Gross-loge Des Ordens Der Hermanns-Soehne im Staate Colorado v. Wolfer, </em>42 Colo. 398, 94 P. 329 (1908), a suit by a Grand Lodge against former officers of an incorporated local lodge of the Sons of Hermann who had dissolved the lodge and distributed the cash funds of the lodge among themselves and other members, notwithstanding express language in their Grand Lodge\u2019s constitution providing that \u201c[s]hould a lodge disband itself, the then (last) officers of the lodge shall deliver up all the property of the lodge to the Grand Lodge.\u201d Even by the local lodge\u2019s Colorado certificate of incorporation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atz\">it was and is provided that defendant lodge should be a subordinate lodge of plaintiff society and subject to [the Grand Lodgej\u2019s constitution, laws, and regulations and its own constitution as aforesaid, and the contracts and agreements thereunder arising, and defendant lodge thereupon assumed and agreed to be bound by the provisions thereof, and became and is the successor of said unincorporated lodge, and the said defendant lodge and the members thereof are, and ever since such incorporation have been, firmly bound by the contracts and agreements, constitutions, laws, and regulations herein mentioned. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>[t]he constitution and laws of the Grand Lodge provide that, when a subordinate lodge surrenders its charter or when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>such charter is revoked, all the property, both real and personal, belonging to such lodge, and all of its money, books, papers, and paraphernalia, and other possessions of value, shall be transferred to the secretary of the Grand Lodge who shall become the custodian of such surrendered property and effects,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>94 P. at 330. The Colorado Supreme Court decided <em>Wolfer </em>in one sentence: \u201cOur conclusion is that the complaint states a cause of action against the defendants, and that, under the facts averred therein, they are jointly and severally liable to the [Grand Lodge] for the funds they misappropriated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Many of the other cases cited by the Bressler Plaintiffs were also decided on explicit language found in organizational documents, be it language creating an express trust, <em>see Grand Court of Washington, Foresters of America v.

There is <em>no </em>language of express trust. There is <em>no </em>reversion or forfeiture clause providing that if AFHR\u2019s Charter is revoked by the Supreme Council, \u201cthe officers of the Federation shall deliver up all the property of the Federation to the Supreme Council for the use and benefit of members of the Order,\u201d or the like. Indeed, as Ms. Bres-sler and others concede, \u201cthe articles and by-laws are silent regarding secession\u201d (Reply Brief at 8), as they are concerning the existence of an express trust, or the effect of revocation of a charter.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The International Constitution likewise remains silent as to the International Order\u2019s interest, if any, in the property of its affiliated federations and lodges.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">The one clear, definite and unambiguous expression concerning the control of AFHR\u2019s property is found in Article VIII of the AFHR By-Laws: \u201cThe Grand Council of Administration shall have exclusive control of all funds and properties of the Federation.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>Art.

II, at 405.) \u201cThe reality\u201d as found by the district court \u201cis that the organization of the Colorado corporation did not ... create an entity that was ultimately subject to the control of the International Order.... Since all plaintiffs\u2019 claims proceed from the wrong premise that the Masonic structure controls, plaintiffs\u2019 claims should be denied.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 19, 20, App. vol.

Ellsworth, </em>78 Cal. 166, 20 P. 399 (1889) (property dispute resolved in favor of incorporated local lodge where state lodge had failed to make clear its entitlement to local lodge property in the governing organizational documents).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The <em>Mote </em>case offers specific guidance bearing upon this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">Mote <em>and the Existence of an Express Trust</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">In <em>Bishop and Diocese of Colorado v.

If, after applying neutral principles of law, such rights of ownership or control are determined to be vested in the general church, there will be no need to assess how property of the local church is controlled. If, on the other hand, such an analysis results in a deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>mination that ownership or control of the disputed property is vested in the local church, it then may be necessary to determine how control over that property is to be exercised. This is so because, as the United States Supreme Court recognized in <em>Jones v. Wolf, </em>[443 U.S. 595, 99 S.Ct. 3020, 61 L.E.2d 775 (1979)], determination of control of the local church in cases involving a dispute between contending groups within that church may be necessary to resolve internal differences concerning the use and disposition of the property of the local church.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 99-100 (footnote omitted). <em>Mote </em>\u201cdecline[d] to adopt a presumptive rule of majority representation, or any other artificial presumption or rule, that must be applied in every case in which determination of control over property of a local church becomes necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100. Instead, <em>Mote </em>looked for guidance to \u201cwell established principles of statutory and common law traditionally applied to determine who has legal control over any particular corporation or voluntary association and how freely or extensively that control can be exercised.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Applying its analysis to the facts then before it, the <em>Mote </em>court held in favor of the national church in a dispute over ownership and control of the property of a local parish, a majority of whose members had voted to secede from the national church over doctrinal differences. There was \u201cno doubt that legal title to the disputed real property is held by St. Mary\u2019s Church, the nonprofit corporation created by the membership in 1934.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104. Nevertheless, the <em>Mote </em>court concluded that \u201can intent on the part of the local church corporation to dedicate its property irrevocably to the purposes of\u2019 the national church body was \u201cexpressed unambiguously in the combination of the 1955 articles of incorporation, the local church bylaws, and the canons of the general church, to which the local church acceded at the time this dispute arose in 1976.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Here, the Bressler Plaintiffs contend that the district court erred \u201cin not recognizing the same kind of express or implied trust on the organization\u2019s property as that recognized by the Colorado Supreme Court ... in <em>Mote </em>.... \u201d (Opening Brief at 35.)<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">The district court did not make detailed findings of fact concerning the utter silence of both AFHR\u2019s organic documents and the International Order\u2019s Constitution concerning the property of AFHR or its lodges <em>in relation to the International Order. </em>Absent \u201ca trust, a reverter clause, or some other basis\u201d that \u201cestablish[es] that the general [Order] has rights of ownership or control\u201d over AFHR\u2019s property, <em>Mote, </em>716 P.2d at 99, there was very little to find. As quoted above, Article VIII, Section 1 of the AFHR By-Laws speaks in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>clear, concise, explicit, unequivocal and unambiguous language: \u201cThe Grand Council of Administration shall have exclusive control of all funds and properties of the Federation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>Art.

Other provisions, such as Article III, Section 1 of AFHR\u2019s By-Laws, which vests \u201c[administrative duties and financial responsibilities\u201d in AFHR\u2019s own Grand Council of Administration, or Article 45 of the International Constitution, under which the \u201cSupreme Council guarantees to Lodges, Jurisdictions and Federations a liberal form of government and <em>absolute freedom in the transaction of their internal affairs, </em>provided they do not act in any way contrary to the International Constitution and to the principles of the Order,\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> seem wholly consistent with Article VIII, Section 1, and offer little footing for the existence of an express trust, even by implication. <em>See Mote, </em>716 P.2d at 100 (\u201csuch an inference is not to come easily\u2014 \u2018[c]lear, explicit, definite, unequivocal and unambiguous language or conduct\u2019 establishing the intent to create a trust is required\u201d (quoting <em>Morgan v.

None of AFHR\u2019s organic documents restrict the encumbrance, alienation, disposition or use of AFHR property according to the dictates of the International Order.

The Bressler Plaintiffs did their best to paint the defendants as disloyal \u201csecessionists,\u201d but they offered little or no evidence to show that consistent with <em>Mote, </em>\u201ceffective control over these properties is not reposed in the legal title holder, but rather that [AFHR\u2019s] property has been dedicated to the use and control of\u2019 the International Order. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">The Bressler Plaintiffs had submitted a proposed finding of fact bearing upon this question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-12\">47.

Instead, they point to the law governing church property disputes as a useful analogy<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and argue that if that law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>is extended to apply to the facts in this case, then the district court erred in concluding that no express trust exists. (Opening Brief at 35.)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In denying the Bressler Plaintiffs\u2019 claim of express trust, however, the district court correctly concluded that the plaintiffs had <em>not </em>met their burden of presenting other evidence to establish that effective control over AFHR\u2019s properties is not reposed in AFHR pursuant to Article VIII, Section 1 of the By Laws and as the legal title holder, but rather that the corporation\u2019s property has been dedicated to the use and control of the International Order.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">This is not to say that Co-Masonry has no genuine hierarchy.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The Bressler Plaintiffs point to a series of oaths taken by members calling for fidelity and obedience to the International Constitution, as well as provisions of the International Constitution and AFHR\u2019s Rules and Regulations establishing a hierarchical structure headed by the Supreme Council of the International Order. Yet these oaths and constitutional provisions operate primarily to preserve the integrity of Masonic ritual, tradition and symbolism, and devote far less attention to more mundane matters such as property management. \u201cTo the Supreme Council alone is entrusted the preservation of the principles of the Order.... \u201d (International Constitution, Art.17 [Ch. III, Art. 3], Addendum, vol. I, tab 1, at 3.) The \u201cprinciples and methods of work adopted by the Order\u201d include \u201cthe Scottish Grand Constitutions of 1786 E.V.,\u201d which establish the Masonic system of individual advancement through 33\u00b0 now known as the \u201cScottish Rite.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>Art. 6 [Ch.

They also assert that the defendant AFHR Directors breached the contracts embodied in their individual oaths of loyalty to the International Order, warranting the same relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Imposition of a Constructive Trust</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">In their Fourth Amended Complaint, plaintiffs alleged that the defendant AFHR Directors had \u201cviolated their fiduciary duties of good faith, candor, due care, and loyalty,\u201d and that their conduct was \u201cwillful, reckless and/or in bad faith.\u201d (Fourth Amended Complaint at 14 UH 60-61, App. vol. I, at 319.) According to the plaintiffs, the defendant AFHR Directors breached their fiduciary duties to AFHR and to those members still loyal to the International Order when \u201cthey, having renounced their oaths of obligation to International Co-Masonry, nevertheless used their office and fiduciary position as directors of AFHR to purport to sever unilaterally the AFHR from the International Order\u201d in 1994, following the membership\u2019s rejection of the 1993 by-law amendments demanded by the Supreme Council. (\u2019\u2019[Plaintiffs\u2019 Recommended] Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment, dated April 7,1997, at 21 If 48, App. vol. I, at 344.) They complain that by \u201cseceding\u201d from the International Order, the AFHR Directors stripped AFHR\u2019s loyal members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>of their legal interest in the contributions collected, and property obtained, over AFHR\u2019s ninety-year history. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">As it did with respect to the claim of express trust, the district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of breach of fiduciary duty and constructive trust. The district court concluded that Colorado law would hold that \u201conce organized under the law of the state, the corporate actions are determined by the law of that state and not by the supposed hierarchical power over the subordinate lodge.\u201d (FC &amp; 0 at 15, App. vol. II, at 401.) Evaluating the conduct of the defendant AFHR Directors in light of state corporate law rather than the theory of Co-Masonic hierarchy urged by the plaintiffs, the district court found no breach of fiduciary duty and no basis for imposing such a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Among other authorities, the district court relied upon <em>Horst v. Traudt, </em>43 Colo. 445, 96 P. 259 (1908), as analogous support for this view, stating that \u201cthe Colorado Supreme Court was unequivocal that, once incorporated, a society is governed by the civil law of Colorado and not some higher authority.\u201d (FC &amp; 0 at 15, App. vol.

Appellants seek to discredit <em>Horst, </em>arguing that <em>Mote </em>\u201cspecifically cited and distinguished the <em>Horst </em>case, (Reply Brief at 5), and \u201cexplicitly rejected\u201d a narrower approach to resolving property disputes arising out of a disaffiliation based upon corporate laws and procedures as \u201c \u2018unduly restricted in scope and therefore fundamentally flawed.\u2019 \u201d (Opening Brief at 35 (quoting <em>Mote, </em>716 P.2d at 102).)<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> <em>Horst, </em>after all, \u201cdid not involve property issues arising out of a disaffiliation.\u201d (Reply Brief at 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Contrary to appellants\u2019 assertion, however, <em>Horst </em>continues to provide meaningful guidance in resolving church property disputes under Colorado law, even after <em>Mote:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">Even though <em>Mote </em>involved a church property dispute, we noted that during the turn of the century this court had held that religious corporations, \u201care subject to the principles of the common law and the practice and procedure applicable to corporations under the general incorporation laws, so far as the same are pertinent.\u201d <em>Mote, </em>716 P.2d at 98 (quoting <em>Horst v.

Yet the AFHR Directors\u2019 January 1994 declaration appears direct and forthright as to their own intentions, and effectively communicated those intentions to Ms. Bressler, the Consistory and the balance of AFHR\u2019s membership as soon as was practicable following the January 20 audience in Paris.

Next are the bylaws which, in turn, must comport not only with the statutes but also the articles of incorporation. Finally, various policies, rules or regulations may be adopted from time to time. These cannot contradict Colorado law, the articles of incorporation or the bylaws....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-10\">Plaintiffs would stand this legal hierarchy on its head....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">(FC &amp; O at 17-18, App. vol.

For purposes of corporate governance, it had already been decided by the vote of the AFHR membership rejecting the proposed amendments in late 1993. Under Article XII of AFHR\u2019s By-Laws as well as provisions of the Colorado statute, the members acted well within their rights in voting down the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Resolution of the conflict proved unattainable in January 1994 given the Supreme Council\u2019s unyielding insistence that the AFHR Directors acquiesce in what amounted to an <em>ultra vires </em>act under Colorado law, that is, the surrender of corporate governance to persons outside of AFHR\u2019s board, contrary to its own ByLaws and the members\u2019 majority vote soundly rejecting that change.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Any acquiescence by the AFHR Directors in the Supreme Council\u2019s demands in January 1994 would have had no legal effect under Colorado law. <em>See Woodmen of the World v. McCue, </em>88 Colo. 209, 294 P. 947, 954 (1930) (amendment to constitution of fraternal benefit society not shown to have been adopted by two-thirds of votes entitled to be cast as required by society\u2019s constitution, held not legally adopted); 10 C.J.S. <em>Beneficial Ass'ns </em>\u00a7 25 (1995). Without an approving vote by the membership, the AFHR Directors simply could not accomplish what the Supreme Council demanded of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The Bressler Plaintiffs contend that the AFHR Directors acted beyond their authority under AFHR\u2019s By-Laws, pointing to the January 21, 1994 letter to all members detailing the intended transition from federation to Grand Lodge,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and board minutes of the same date purporting to amend the AFHR By-Laws concerning membership in the corporation.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Indeed, under AFHR\u2019s existing ByLaws, the directors\u2019 January 1994 declaration, by itself, was at most an inchoate act. Actual secession would require the amendment of provisions of AFHR\u2019s Rules and Regulations by AFHR\u2019s North American Consistory to remove requirements for action by the Representative of the Supreme Council or the Supreme Council itself, such as issuing certificates of initiation to new members or diplomas to members becoming Master Masons. (Rules and Regulations, Art. 7, Addendum vol. I, tab 2, at 37-38, App. vol. I, at 100-01.) Changing the By-Laws\u2019 membership requirements would require compliance with the prescribed amendment process, including ratification by the voting members. To recast AFHR as a \u201cGrand Lodge\u201d with its own \u201cSupreme Council\u201d as the AFHR Directors had announced, amendment of AFHR\u2019s By-Laws \u2014 would likewise be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>The January 21, 1994 letter accomplished none of these things.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The AFHR Directors\u2019 January 21, 1994 \u201csecession\u201d was declaratory of the board\u2019s present intentions, but had no immediate operative effect upon the governance or membership of AFHR. The status of AFHR members \u2014 including Ms. Bressler and the other plaintiffs \u2014 under AFHR\u2019s Articles and By-Laws was no different after January 21, 1994 than it was before that date and could not be altered absent lawful amendment of the AFHR By-Laws. The AFHR Directors\u2019 declaratory act could not and did not divest AFHR members \u2014 loyal or otherwise \u2014 of any legal interest in AFHR\u2019s property or funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The district court correctly concluded that the Bressler Plaintiffs failed to establish their claim of breach of fiduciary duty, or prove wrongful conduct on the part of the defendants-appellees warranting the imposition of a constructive trust on AFHR\u2019s property and funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Breach of Contract and Imposition of a Constructive Trust</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Besides breach of fiduciary duty, the Bressler Plaintiffs asserted that the defendant AFHR Directors breached the contract with the International Order represented by their membership and individual oaths of loyalty to the International Order, citing cases such as <em>National Grange of Order of Patrons of Husbandry v. O\u2019Sullivan Grange, 35 </em>Wash.App. 444, 667 P.2d 1105 (1988), and <em>Di Silvestro v.

I, at 342.)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">Generally, \u201cThe constitution and bylaws of the central governing body of a fraternal benefit society, together with the charter of the subordinate body, constitutes a contract between the subordinate and parent organizations.... \u201d (36 Am. Jur.2d <em>Fraternal Orders </em>\u00a7 30, at 682 (2001) (footnote omitted).) In <em>O\u2019Sullivan Grange, </em>the constitution, bylaws and other rules and decisions adopted by National Grange to govern the Order, were contained in the \u201cDigest of the Patrons of Husbandry.\u201d Among other restrictions, the Digest prohibited a subordinate grange \u201cfrom transferring real property, except after (1) proper notice to the membership and resolution approved by a two-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>thirds vote of the grange, and (2) approval of the executive committee or master of the state grange\u201d; it required a subordinate grange \u201cthat is authorized to sell its real property to \u2018account for all monies received in the transaction and ... remit all but the sum of $1,000 of such proceeds to the State Grange\u2019 \u201d; and provided that the property of a dissolved local grange reverts to the state grange after seven years unless the local grange reorganizes within that time. <em>Id. </em>667 P.2d at 1107-08. The members of O\u2019Sullivan Grange, an incorporated local grange chartered by the National Grange, opted to dissolve and transfer its property to a new corporation, at the same time removing from O\u2019Sullivan Grange\u2019s by-laws any requirement that it comply with the Digest, particularly its reverter clause. Noting that it \u201c[i]t has long been established the constitution and bylaws of the national or governing body of a beneficial association or fraternal order are binding upon the subordinate organizations,\u201d and that it was \u201cundisputed that their intention was to avoid reversion of O\u2019Sullivan Grange property to the State Grange,\u201d the court concluded that the O\u2019Sullivan Grange was bound to comply with the Digest and could not alter this by incorporating and later amending out language requiring compliance with Digest. \u201cO\u2019Sullivan\u2019s effort to amend its corporate bylaws by deleting the provision requiring it to comply with section 15 of the Digest could not change its contract with the Order. To the contrary, incorporation of a subordinate organization does not change its purpose or status as an extension of the supreme body. Nor does it affect the charter and oath to obey the constitution and bylaws of the Order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1109. Acting unilaterally, then, the local grange \u201ccould not amend its bylaws to change its contractual obligations with the National and State Granges\u201d concerning local grange property. <em>Id. </em>at 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Other cases cited by the Bressler Plaintiffs also involved enforcement of express trust language or conveyance restrictions set forth in organizational documents. <em>See Hermione Lodge No. 16, Knights of Pythias, of Decatur v. Grand Lodge, Knights of Pythias of Alabama, </em>248 Ala. 473, 476, 28 So.2d 166, 169, 168 A.L.R. 948 (Ala. 1946);<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> <em>Grand Lodge of Iowa of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows v.

The 1975 Articles and By-Laws thereby became part of the existing contractual agreement between AFHR, its members, and the International Order,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> and if that changed the relationship between AFHR and the International Order, \u201cthat change was approved by the Order in 1979\u201d and \u201c[a]n independent legal entity was created\u201d that was not \u201cultimately subject to the control of the International Order.\u201d (FC &amp; 0, at 19, App. vol. II, at 405.)<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In contrast to cases such as <em>O\u2019Sullivan Grange, </em>AFHR\u2019s exclusive control over its own corporate property was already part of the \u201ccontract\u201d with the International Order. As explained above, the declaratory \u201csecession\u201d by the AFHR Directors in January 1994 worked no change in the substantive rights of AFHR and by itself could not \u201cremov[e] from the legal possession and control of the loyal members of AFHR the assets acquired in the name of AFHR over a 90-year history of affiliation with International Co-Masonry,\u201d as the Bressler Plaintiffs argue.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">The AFHR Directors\u2019 declaration, by itself, also proved ineffective to disaffiliate AFHR and its members from the International Order, or to \u201cestablish a wholly independent and different Order from that to which the members, including defendants, had sworn obedience,\u201d as the Bres-sler Plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">In <em>Di Silvestro v. Sons of Italy Grand Lodge, </em>129 Misc. 521, 532, 222 N.Y.S. 203 (1927), a case cited by the Bressler Plaintiffs, the court concluded that as to the Sons of Italy, any attempted secession of a subordinate body or order from the national fraternal order, unless through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>unanimous action of all its members, was ineffective as to <em>all </em>members:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">Each member of a district lodge became on admission a member of the parent order, as well as a member of the district and Grand Lodge. The practical effect of a severance of affiliation to the parent order would be to sever the relation of the district lodges and their members from the General Order. It deprives them of representation in the General Order through the district lodges and the Grand Lodge as contemplated by the constitution and by-laws of the order. It puts the control and management of the property and affairs of the Grand Lodge into the hands of officials and a board, freed from the general supervision and of the Supreme Lodge. In short, it would establish a wholly independent and different order than that which members within the state joined, and to which they promised allegiance. It cannot, we think, be claimed but that such a disaffiliation would operate to destroy the contractual relations of members with the General Order and the benefits derived therefrom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">129 Misc. at 532, 222 N.Y.S. at 214. Applying this reasoning, the AFHR Directors\u2019 January 1994 declaration by itself could not and did not sever AFHR from the International Order; nor did it disenfranchise Ms. Bressler, Mr. Voirol, or any other AFHR members who did not agree with the board\u2019s intended change of course. <em>Cf. Sabourin v. Lippe, </em>195 Mass. 470, 81 N.E. 282, 283 (1907) (\u201cIf it had been in the power of [the Court Samuel de Champlain, No. 49, of the Order of Foresters] to amend its laws in such a way as to legally sever its connection with the Order of Foresters, it could not do it without previous notice to the members that such a proposal was to be acted upon.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">As members of AFHR, Ms. Bressler and others retained the right under the ByLaws to call for a referendum on the board\u2019s action under Article XI, or even to seek the recall of the directors pursuant to Article X. (AFHR By-Laws, Arts. X, XI, Addendum vol. I, tab 2, at 34.) They could likewise propose amendments to the By-Laws under Article XII, presumably even an amendment making explicit the hierarchical relationship between AFHR and the International Order that they believed to exist. <em>(Id. </em>Art. XII, Addendum vol. I, tab 2, at 85; <em>see </em>note 15, <em>supra.) </em>All that would be required was the support of their fellow AFHR voting members, many of whom, the Bressler Plaintiffs insist, agreed with Ms. Bressler.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">In any event, the question of \u201csecession\u201d by the AFHR directors was rendered moot by the Supreme Council\u2019s pre-emptive exercise of its power to disaffiliate AFHR as a Federation of the International Order by revoking its Charter and the charters of its Lodges, presumably exercising the power granted it by Article 23 of the International Constitution.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> As described above, the district court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">The Supreme Council withdrew the charters of all lodges and \u201chigher bodies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>in the Federation\u201d until certain conditions were met, including a pledge not to belong to the \u201cclandestine order at Larkspur\u201d and the signing of a \u201creaffirmation of loyalty\u201d which pledged the individual member \u201cto support, maintain, respect and obey the International Constitution of the Order and the rules and decisions of the Supreme Council and its Representative.\u201d Ex. JJ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">(FC &amp; 0 at 11, App. vol. II, at 397.) The Supreme Council thus carried out its threat to disaffiliate AFHR for not adopting the 1993 amendments' \u2014 the amendments rejected by a substantial majority of AFHR\u2019s voting members.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">It was only after revocation of AFHR\u2019s Charter pursuant to the International Constitution that the Bressler Plaintiffs and other AFHR members found themselves in \u201ca wholly independent and different Order from that which members ... joined, and to which they promised allegiance,\u201d <em>Di Silvestro, </em>129 Misc. at 532, 222 N.Y.S. at 214, and then only because the Supreme Council of the International Order had ended its relationship with AFHR by its own hand, exercising the power granted it under the International Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">However, even the Supreme Council\u2019s revocation of AFHR\u2019s charter did not alter the relationship of AFHR to its own members, or result in any forfeiture of AFHR\u2019s assets. The rights AFHR members to participate in AFHR and their interest in AFHR\u2019s property remained unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac7\">The Supreme Council\u2019s Revocation of AFHR\u2019s Charter</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">The revocation of AFHR\u2019s Charter did not operate to divest AFHR of the property that all parties concede it legally owns, and over which AFHR\u2019s By-Laws grant exclusive control to AFHR\u2019s Grand Council of Administration. While the International Constitution empowers the Supreme Council to grant and revoke charters of federations and lodges, nothing in that document provides that revocation of a federation\u2019s charter works a forfeiture of that federation\u2019s property to the International Order. Nor does such a forfeiture necessarily result from the revocation of a charter. <em>Vicksburg Lodge, No. 26 v. Grand Lodge of Free And Accepted Masons of Mississippi, </em>116 Miss. 214, 76 So. 572 (1917), cited by the district court, speaks to this question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">[The Grand Lodge] had the right, if it pursued it in the proper way and according to its rules and regulations, to sever the relations between it and the subordinate lodge and to cancel such rights it had conferred by virtue of the charter granted by it and by its rules and regulations. But it did not have the rights and power to take from the corporation created under the laws of the state its property without due process of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq4\">76 So. at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">In general, \u201cIf a subordinate lodge is incorporated, its legal existence is not affected by the fact that the supreme authority suspends or dissolves it or declares its charter forfeited, and in such case it is entitled to retain its funds and property as against the supreme body.\u201d 10 C.J.S. <em>Beneficial Associations </em>\u00a7 58, at 56 (1995) (footnote omitted; citing <em>Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, Loyal Orange Inst. v. Snow, </em>266 Mass. 483, 165 N.E. 479 (1929)). In <em>Merrill Lodge, No. 299, I.O.G.T., v. Ellsworth, </em>78 Cal. 166, 20 P. 399 (1889), the Grand Lodge of the Independent Order of Good Templars suspended the charter of the Merrill Lodge, No. 299, a subordinate lodge incorporated under the laws of California, and appointed a deputy to \u201ctake possession of the books, papers, and the other property of said Merrill Lodge, and hold the same subject to and until the further order of said Grand Lodge,\u201d which he did. The subordinate lodge sought and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>was granted injunctive relief against the Grand Lodge and its deputy. The Supreme Court of California affirmed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">The question presented is one of property merely; and in relation to this two controlling facts appear from the record, <em>viz.: </em>that the plaintiff is a corporation duly organized under the laws of the state of California, and that it is the owner of the property in question, in which the defendants have no right, title, or interest. It follows from these facts that the plaintiff is entitled to be protected against the acts of the defendants. The ownership of the property draws to itself the right of possession and control. And since the plaintiff is a corporation it can only be dissolved in the manner prescribed by the laws of California. The provision of the constitution of the grand lodge that in certain contingencies the subordinate lodge \u2018shall be deemed an extinct lodge, and its charter shall be forfeited,\u2019 and the \u2018suspension\u2019 by the grand lodge, and the action taken by the grand chief templar, have not the slightest effect upon the legal existence of the corporation; and as long as it exists its affairs must be managed by its duly-elected officers, as provided by law. If they misconduct themselves, appropriate proceedings to remove them must be resorted to.... 78 Cal. at 168, 20 P. at 400.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">To conclude otherwise, the \u201ccontract\u201d between the supreme order and the local lodge must authorize the forfeiture of the funds of the subordinate body, an example of \u201cthe well-known principle that forfeitures are not favored, and that, when the right of forfeiture is claimed under contract, the condition involving the forfeiture must be strictly interpreted against the party for whose benefit it is created,\u201d the supreme order. <em>Scott v. Donahue, </em>93 Cal. App. 126, 269 P. 455, 457 (1928). Here, no such forfeiture provision is found within the four corners of the International Constitution, the AFHR Articles or By-Laws that would entitle the International Order or its \u201cloyal\u201d adherents to take possession of AFHR\u2019s corporate property, even assuming that the Supreme Council lawfully exercised its power to revoke AFHR\u2019s Charter pursuant to Article 23 of the International Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The district court found that AFHR \u201cwas formed with the declared intent of separating its legal or secular matters from its ritual or ceremonial aspects,\u201d and concluded that as to matters of corporate governance, the Bressler Plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201cproceed from the wrong premise that the Masonic structure controls.... \u201d (FC &amp; O at 19, App. vol. II, at 405, 406 (citing Exh. F, Minutes of First Meeting, dated August 10, 1975, Addendum vol. II, tab 70).<footnotemark>53</footnotemark>) Recognizing, as did the district court, that AFHR\u2019s \u201carticles and bylaws form the contract of membership,\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 16, App. vol. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>II, at 402), the contract in this case contemplates that AFHR owns and exercises exclusive control over AFHR property and finances, without direct control or supervision by the International Order, and this remains so even after the Supreme Council\u2019s revocation of AFHR\u2019s Charter in early 1994. As the district court concluded, the sequence of events recounted in detail during five days of bench trial left AFHR in essentially the same place after 1994 that it was in prior to 1994: in lawful and exclusive possession and control of its corporate property and funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The Bressler Plaintiffs\u2019 Withdrawal from AFHR</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">At trial \u2014 and again in briefing this appeal \u2014 the Bressler Plaintiffs have exhaustively detailed the sequence of meetings, events, and correspondence among the AFHR Directors and AFHR members both preceding and following the fateful January 20, 1994 meeting in Paris, leading to the \u201csecession\u201d of AFHR from the International Order. They \u201curge that defendants\u2019 actions of refusing to amend its bylaws as dictated by the Council and disassociating AFHR from the International Order are, in effect, actions of disloyal members seceding from the organization and that such secessionists lose any interest in the property of the society.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 13, App. vol. II, at 399 (citations omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">For their part, however, the Bressler Plaintiffs pursued none of the options available to them under the AFHR ByLaws to challenge or override the AFHR Directors\u2019 stated intentions or to remove the existing directors from office. Instead, they opted to withdraw from AFHR and form their own federation, incorporated in Delaware in December of 1994 as the \u201cOrder of International Co-Free-Masonry Le Droit Humain American Federation,\u201d and to seek to obtain control of AFHR\u2019s property simply by asking for it, all with the approval of the International Order\u2019s Supreme Council. <em>(See </em>Letter of Vera Bres-sler, dated January 31,1994, Dfts\u2019 Exh.

As the Supreme Council\u2019s Representative, Ms. Bres-sler decreed that \u201c[a] member may not belong to Le Droit Humain and at the same time be a member of the Clandestine Order at Larkspur,\u201d and required that members \u201csign the enclosed Obligation of reaffirmation of Allegiance to the Supreme Council of International Co-Masonry, Le Droit Humain,\u201d and return it to her \u201cby March 6, 1994, [or they] will be automatically out of the Order.\u201d (Letter of Vera Bressler, dated January 31, 1994, Dfts\u2019 Exh. JJ, Addendum vol. II, tab 83, at 316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">In effect, then, Ms. Bressler called upon AFHR members loyal to the Supreme Council to leave AFHR \u2014 the \u201cClandestine Order\u201d \u2014 and reaffirm their affiliation with the International Order through herself and an \u201cAdministrative Committee\u201d headed by plaintiff-appellant Voirol. <em>(Id.) </em>The \u201cloyalist\u201d members did as they were asked, and withdrew from participation in AFHR in favor of the Bressler Plaintiffs\u2019 new federation, the \u201cOrder of International Co-Free-Masonry Le Droit Humain \u2014 American Federation,\u201d which was soon recognized by the Supreme Council as the only American association with whom the International Order had any relationship. (App. vol. I, at 205, 206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">The revocation of AFHR\u2019s charter by the Supreme Council did not result in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>forfeiture of AFHR\u2019s property to the International Order, or to its loyal members or representatives. AFHR remained in existence as a Colorado non-profit corporation in lawful possession of its assets. Having withdrawn from membership in AFHR, the Bressler plaintiffs lost any interest they had in AFHR\u2019s property, and could not unilaterally transfer AFHR\u2019s property to their new Delaware corporation, be they \u201cloyal\u201d to the International Order or not. <em>See, e.g., Supreme Lodge of The World, Loyal Order of Moose v.

Bressler and Voirol challenge that award as having been made without requisite proof of actual damage as required by Colorado law.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Defendants-appellees respond that the district court was correct in concluding that \u201c[e]very element of interference with prospective business advantage and contract were established,\u201d and further, that the district court found actual damage resulting from Voirol\u2019s collection of an estimated $5,000 in AFHR membership dues. (Answer Brief at 29 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Appellants reply that the district court found that \u201cthere was no evidence to show that any defendant suffered any damage as a result of Voirol\u2019s actions,\u201d and that the alleged $5,000 diversion was insufficiently proven, and therefore speculative. (Reply Brief at 20) (quoting FC &amp; O at 20, App. vol. II, at 406.)<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Appellants reiterated them contention that proof of actual damage was a required element of a civil conspiracy counterclaim, citing <em>More v. Johnson, </em>193 Colo. 489, 568 P.2d 437 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">The district court reasoned that \u201cproof of actual damages is not necessary\u201d to liability for intentional interference with contractual relations, here Voirol\u2019s attempt (with Bressler\u2019s knowledge) to obtain control of AFHR\u2019s account at Dean Witter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>without lawful authority.

Bockhaus, </em>129 Colo. 339, 270 P.2d 193 (1954), five elements were stated to be essential to a civil conspiracy claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">To constitute a civil conspiracy there must be: (1) two or more persons, and for this purpose a corporation is a person; (2) an object to be accomplished; (3) a meeting of minds on the object or course of action; (4) one or more unlawful overt acts; and (5) damages as the proximate result thereof. The burden of proving these essentials by a preponderance of the evidence is upon him who asserts the claim under such circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-7\"><em>Id., </em>270 P.2d at 196. \u201cIn a civil conspiracy action, the conspiracy is not actionable per se. Actual damages must be proved.\u201d <em>More v. Johnson, </em>193 Colo. 489, 568 P.2d 437, 440 (1977) (citing <em>Morrison v. Goodspeed, </em>100 Colo. 470, 68 P.2d 458 (1937)). <em>Accord Jet Courier Service, Inc. v. Mulei, </em>771 P.2d 486, 502 (Colo.1989) (\u201cThe essence of a civil conspiracy claim is not the conspiracy itself, but the actual damages resulting from it.\u201d (citing More)).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">According to <em>Swartz v. Bianco Family Trust, </em>874 P.2d 430, 434 (Colo.App.1993), \u201cThe elements which must be established to recover damages for intentional interference with contract are contained in Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766 (1977). <em>Memorial Gardens, Inc. v. Olympian Sales &amp; Management Consultants, Inc., </em>690 P.2d 207 (Colo.1984).\u201d Section 766, in turn, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">One who intentionally and improperly interferes with the performance of a contract (except a contract to marry) between another and a third person by inducing or otherwise causing the third person not to perform the contract, is subject to liability to the other for the pecuniary loss resulting to the other from the failure of the third person to perform the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">Comment t to Section 766 states: \u201cThe cause of action is for pecuniary loss resulting from the interference. Recovery may be had also for consequential harms for which the interference was a legal cause. (See s 774A).\u201d This would suggest that actual damage \u2014 \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d \u2014 is intrinsic to the cause of action. Moreover, the model jury instruction cited by the district court itself appears to treat actual damage as the fifth required element of an interference with contract claim: the jury \u201cmust find\u201d to \u201chave been proved by a preponderance of the evidence: ... \u201c5. The defendant\u2019s interference with the contract caused the plaintiff (damages) (losses).\u201d <em>Colorado Jury Instructions, </em>4th\u2014 <em>Civil </em>\u00a7 24:6.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">Particularly in the context of a civil conspiracy claim, it appears that actual damage is an essential element, and the district court erred in concluding that liability for a civil conspiracy to interfere with contract may be imposed notwithstanding a failure of proof as to actual damage. Nominal damages thus appear to be unavailable in a claim for civil conspiracy under Colorado law absent proof of <em>some </em>actual damage to the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">Here, the district court found that there was \u201cno evidence to show that any defendant suffered any damage as a result of\u2019 appellants\u2019 actions. (FC &amp; O at 20, App. vol. II, at 406.) The judgment against appellants Bressler and Voirol for nominal damages must, therefore, be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">DISMISSAL OF PLAINTIFF CORPORATION FOR LACK OF STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">Prior to trial, the district court entered an order dismissing plaintiff \u201cOrder of International Co-Freemasonry Le <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Droit Humain, American Federation,\u201d a Delaware corporation formed by Ms. Bressler and others in December of 1994,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> for lack of standing. <em>{See </em>Memorandum Opinion and Order, filed April 10, 1997, <em>Voirol v.

Relying on the \u201cconstitutional minimum\u201d for standing, that is, \u201c(1) an injury-in-fact; (2) which is traceable to the allegedly unlawful conduct; and (3) which will likely be redressed by a favorable decision,\u201d the district court concluded that because the new corporation \u201cwas not in existence in January 1994,\u201d it \u201csuffered no cognizable injury itself and will not be permitted to play the paladin.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>959 F.Supp. at 1338 (citing <em>Clajon Production Corp. v. Petera, </em>70 F.3d 1566, 1572 (10th Cir.1995)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Appellants, who were added as individual plaintiffs before the district court ruled on the standing issue, <em>{id. </em>at 1336 n. 2), contend the district court erred in dismissing the new corporation. They argue that under the law governing the standing of associations, the new corporation could indeed \u201cplay the paladin\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and assert the claims of its members who are former members of AFHR still loyal to the International Order. (Opening Brief at 43-46; Reply Brief at 20-23.) They point to cases such as <em>Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm\u2019n, </em>432 U.S. 333, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977), as authority for the proposition that \u201can organizational plaintiff may proceed on behalf of its members even if the organization itself lacked standing to proceed as an organization,\u201d and <em>New York State Club Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. City of New York, </em>487 U.S. 1, 108 S.Ct. 2225,101 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988), for the proposition that a non-profit corporation is an organization capable of suing on behalf of its members. (Opening Brief at 43-44.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">Defendants-Appellees respond that plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 claims pleaded in the Fourth Amended Complaint are essentially derivative in nature and are therefore governed by Fed.R.Civ.P. 23.1.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> As to the standing of the new corporation, they argue that \u201c[tjhere is no attempt to comply with F.R.C.P. 23.1\u201d because the new corporation was never a member of AFHR and was therefore ineligible to be a derivative plaintiff. (Answer Brief at 34.)</p>\n<p id=\"AIu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Plaintiffs-Appellants\u2019 reply that they do not assert derivative claims, and that \u201c[d]irect actions may be brought by shareholders where, as here, the injury is to a defined subclass of shareholder/members\u201d or \u201cwhere ... there is a threatened diversion of corporate assets.\u201d (Reply Brief at 22-23 (citing <em>Security Natl.

InterNorth, Inc., </em>518 F.Supp. 390 (N.D.N.Y.1980)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\"><em>Hunt </em>outlines a three-part test for deciding whether an association has standing to sue on behalf of its members. An association has standing when \u201c(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization\u2019s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\u201d 423 U.S. at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The first prong of the <em>Hunt </em>test is satisfied, plaintiffs-appellants argue, because the members of the new corporation, \u201cas individuals, could have brought the suit in their name,\u201d (Opening Brief at 44), as in fact they did. As to the second and third prongs of the <em>Hunt </em>test, plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 briefs say nothing. At the district court, plaintiffs addressed the second prong rather obliquely, explaining that the new corporation was formed \u201csolely to enable the loyal members to continue to administer financial affairs, and otherwise perpetuate the American branch International Co-Masonry.\u201d (\u201cPlaintiffs Memorandum Opposing Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment on Standing,\u201d filed December 4,1995, at 15, App. vol. I, at 72 (citing Bressler Affidavit, 111\u00cd 25-28)<footnotemark>59</footnotemark>.) However, as to the third prong of Hunt\u2014 that neither the claim nor the remedy sought \u201crequires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit\u201d \u2014 plaintiffs offered no argument to the district court, just as they have offered none here.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">In this instance, we are not inclined to make the appellants\u2019 argument for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">The joinder of Ms. Bressler and others as individual plaintiffs asserting claims for themselves and on behalf of others effectively rendered the new corporation\u2019s presence redundant. Even if the \u201cOrder of International Co-Freemasonry Le Droit Humain, American Federation\u201d could properly sue on their behalf, the individual plaintiffs\u2019 presence in the case \u201cas rightful directors and members of AFHR and on behalf of the other American Federation members who have not seceded from International Co-Masonry,\u201d (Fourth Amended Complaint, filed April 7, 1997, at 2-3 II4, App. vol. I, at 307-08), effectively moots that question because their presence left the new corporation with no additional claim to assert or further relief to obtain.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Thus, even if the district court erred by not explicitly applying the three-prong <em>Hunt </em>test as the proper measure of the new corporation\u2019s standing to represent Ms. Bressler and others, that error proves to be harmless in the context of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Plaintiffs had their day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"AUr\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The district court correctly concluded that both before and after January 20, 1994, the American Federation of Human Rights, a Colorado nonprofit corporation, held lawful possession and exclusive control over its corporate property and funds, and that the plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden to prove that the corporate property was subject to an express trust for the benefit of the International Order of Co-Freemasonry or AFHR members who remained loyal to the International Order after the two entities parted ways. The district court likewise was correct in concluding that plaintiffs failed to prove that the defendant AFHR directors breached their fiduciary duties by giving effect to a vote of AFHR\u2019s eligible members rejecting amendments to AFHR\u2019s own By-Laws that the International Order insisted that AFHR adopt, and by declaring their intent to operate independently of the International Order in the face of a threat by the International Order to disaffiliate AFHR as a Co-Masonic federation for refusing to make those amendments. The defendants\u2019 statements in that regard in January 1994 were declaratory in effect, and did not operate to alter the relationship of plaintiffs as members of AFHR or diminish their lawful rights as members under AFHR\u2019s Articles and By-Laws to participate in corporate democracy. Concerning severance, the Supreme Council of the International Order revoked the charters of AFHR and its lodges \u2014 the operative event effectively disaffiliating AFHR from the International Order. But disaffiliation did not dissolve AFHR or result in the forfeiture of its property to the International Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">For their part, the Bressler Plaintiffs opted to withdraw from AFHR and form a new corporate federation- \u2014 with the blessings of the International Order \u2014 rather than pursuing any of their remedies under the AFHR By-Laws to revisit the statements or actions of the directors to which they objected. Though the Bressler Plaintiffs did their best to paint AFHR and its directors as disloyal \u201csecessionists,\u201d AFHR\u2019s corporate existence survived AFHR\u2019s disaffiliation from the International Order, and AFHR retains lawful possession and exclusive control of its own property, free of any trust or other interest in favor of the International Order or its \u201cloyal\u201d members who have left AFHR and are no longer its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">The district court judgment dismissing plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 claims of express and constructive trust, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract is AFFIRMED. The district court\u2019s order dismissing plaintiff \u201cOrder of International Co-Freemasonry Le Droit Humain, American Federation,\u201d a Delaware corporation, is also AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">The district court erred in its application of the Colorado law of civil conspiracy, and its award of nominal damages against Vera <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Bressler and James Voirol is REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Judge McWILLIAMS concurs in the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b342-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of res judi-cata, collateral estoppel, and law of the case.
