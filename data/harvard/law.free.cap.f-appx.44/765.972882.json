(\u201cCNF\u201d), its employees, and its insurer violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-64, in their handling of Marsha\u2019s workers\u2019 compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>tion claim. The Westenbergs further appeal the district court\u2019s orders denying reconsideration pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">We review de novo dismissals under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and motions pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4) to set aside a judgment as void. <em>Steckman v. Hart Brewing, Inc., </em>143 F.3d 1293, 1295 (9th Cir.1998) (Rule 12(b)(6)); <em>Exp. Group v. Reef Indus., Inc., </em>54 F.3d 1466, 1469 (9th Cir.1995) (Rule 60(b)(4)). We may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>Steckman, </em>143 F.3d at 1295.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The district court correctly concluded that Sarah was not a proper RICO plaintiff because her claims are derivative of her mother\u2019s and allege only indirect harm to her business or property interests. <em>See Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp., </em>503 U.S. 258, 268-69, 112 S.Ct. 1311, 117 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992). Therefore, the district court properly determined that amendment would be futile and did not abuse its discretion by dismissing these claims with prejudice. <em>See Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1130 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The RICO allegations in counts 8-11 and 17-23 of the complaint arise out of the litigation resulting from Marsha\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation and sexual harassment claims. That appellees defended these actions by use of the mail, telephone, and judicial process fails to state a claim under RICO. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1) (defining \u201cracketeering activity\u201d); <em>Howard v. America Online, Inc., </em>208 F.3d 741, 748 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cCiting acts as a part of a RICO pattern, without proving that they are indictable, is not sufficient [to state a claim].\u201d). Moreover, the preclusive effect of the 1993 settlement and subsequent decisions of the Oregon state courts referenced in the instant complaint bars their use as predicate acts under RICO. <em>See id. </em>at 747-48; <em>see also Monterey Plaza Hotel Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Local 483 of the Hotel Employees and Rest. Employees Union, </em>215 F.3d 923, 927-28 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that because predicate acts must constitute single course of conduct, res judicata barred RICO plaintiff from relying on facts previously adjudicated by state court). The district court properly dismissed these claims with prejudice. <em>See Lopez, </em>203 F.3d at 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">The district court properly denied the motions for reconsideration because the Westenbergs failed to present adequate grounds for relief under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4). <em>See United States v. Berke, </em>170 F.3d 882, 883 (9th Cir.1999) (stating judgment void under Rule 60(b)(4) only if court lacked jurisdiction or denied parties due process). Contrary to the Westenbergs\u2019 contention, due process was not implicated by the district court\u2019s ministerial reassignment of the case to a different district judge. <em>See Badea v. Cox, </em>931 F.2d 573, 575 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201cDistrict court judges have \u2018broad discretion\u2019 regarding the assignment or reassignment of cases.\u201d). Nor did the Westenbergs point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>to any specific judicial bias affecting the judgment in their case. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144; <em>Liteky v. U.S., </em>510 U.S. 540, 554-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">We have considered the Westenbergs\u2019 remaining contentions and reject them as lacking merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">All pending motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b801-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-7\">. We note that the Westenbergs have not appealed the district court\u2019s denial of their motions for reconsideration brought under Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e), nor has Marsha challenged the judgment entered against her on CNF\u2019s counterclaim. In their supplemental reply brief, the Westenbergs clarify that their appeal is limited to counts 8-11 and 17-23 of the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-11\">. We note that the Westenbergs\u2019 appeal is now properly before this court because the district court entered final judgment on June 1, 2001, following our limited remand order of March 22, 2001 and the district court's subsequent decision on CNF\u2019s counterclaim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
