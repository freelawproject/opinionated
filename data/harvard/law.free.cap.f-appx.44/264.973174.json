Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b300-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-16\">Miguel Angel Zacarias-Ortiz appeals the judgment and sentence for one count of conspiring to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1). We have jurisdiction and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-17\">Zacarias-Ortiz\u2019s waiver of a jury trial was knowing and voluntary. He did not have to be advised that the jury would come from the community or that he could participate in its selection. Zacarias-Ortiz and counsel signed a written waiver, and the oral colloquy was adequate to ensure Zacarias-Ortiz\u2019s understanding of the waiver. <em>See United States v. Duarte-Hi-gareda, </em>113 F.3d 1000, 1003 (9th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Cochran, </em>770 F.2d 850, 851 (9th Cir.1985). The record reflects that an interpreter was present and assisted him. Nor is the waiver invalid in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>Apprendi </em>has nothing to do with whether the case will be tried to a jury or to the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-22\">Zacarias-Ortiz\u2019s argument that <em>Apprendi </em>renders 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1) facially unconstitutional is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 563-68 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc). His claim that the government was required to prove that he knew the quantity and type of the drugs involved in his offenses is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 644 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-23\">Zacarias-Ortiz\u2019s as-applied challenge to his sentence under <em>Apprendi </em>also fails; he was not prejudiced by any <em>Apprendi </em>error because he was sentenced below the lowest applicable statutory maximum for methamphetamine. <em>See United States v. Scheele, </em>231 F.3d 492, 497 n. 2 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-24\">There was no plain error in the district court\u2019s failure to apply a clear-and-eonvinc-ing standard in determining Zacarias-Or-tiz\u2019s base offense level on the basis of drug quantity. \u201c[D]ue process does not require the application of the clear and convincing standard when \u2018the extent of the conspiracy caused the tremendous increase in sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Johansson, </em>249 F.3d 848, 855 (9th Cir.2001) <em>quoting United States v. Harrison-Philpot, </em>978 F.2d 1520, 1522 (9th Cir.1992). The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>court\u2019s determination of drug quantity relied on the scope of the conspiracy beyond Zacarias-Ortiz\u2019s own involvement, based on its finding that he supported and assisted in the entire scheme in order to benefit himself. That finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Finally, we have reviewed the government\u2019s in camera submission, and see no error in the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b300-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
