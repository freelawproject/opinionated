We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 815 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">Flourney alleged that Littlejohn and Da-cus placed him in serious risk of injury and failed to protect him from attack by a violent cell mate. The district court properly granted summary judgment for defendant Littlejohn because Flournoy put forth no evidence to show that Littlejohn was made aware of or disregarded threats to Flournoy\u2019s safety prior to the attack. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837,114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (holding that prisoner must show that \u201cthe official [knew] of and disregarded] an excessive risk to inmate ... safety\u201d). Moreover, summary judgment for defendant Dacus was proper because Flournoy did not put forth any evidence to dispute that Dacus responded reasonably to the alleged risk of harm subsequent to the attack. <em>See id. </em>at 844-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">Flournoy was given fair notice of his obligations under the summary judgment rule. <em>See Rand v. Rowland, </em>154 F.3d 952, 957-58 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Flournoy\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel because Flournoy did not show exceptional circumstances. <em>See Terrell v. Brewer, </em>935 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-14\">Flournoy\u2019s other contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b880-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
