FLETCHER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b188-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">We reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to remand to the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) for an award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">The vocational expert (VE) testified that each of the three jobs was semi-skilled and had a Specific Vocational Preparation level of three (SVP-3). Under Social Security Administration (SSA) rulings and regulations, an applicant must possess transferable skills from previous work in order to perform SVP-3 jobs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ found, however, that Steward had no transferable skills. Thus, Steward was not capable of performing the jobs as a matter of SSA regulations, even if persuasive evidence supported the VE\u2019s deviation from the skill levels in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles [DOT].<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">The VE\u2019s subsequent testimony that Steward could in fact perform the jobs because they were entry-level and required no transferable skills was inconsistent with the regulatory definitions of \u201cSVP-3\u201d and \u201csemi-skilled.\u201d The ALJ was not entitled to rely on this portion of the VE\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree with the Commissioner\u2019s characterization of this issue as an evidentiary conflict between the VE and the DOT. The issue is a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>conflict between the VE and the SSA over the definition of a regulatory term, and the VE\u2019s testimony cannot prevail.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Because the VE\u2019s testimony was the only step-five evidence that Steward could do other work, the Commissioner failed to carry her step-five burden.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, Steward is \u201cdisabled\u201d and entitled to benefits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The Commissioner argues that we should remand for a determination as to whether there were yet other jobs Steward could perform. However, the record is fully developed and can only support a conclusion that Steward is disabled. Under such circumstances, a remand for further proceedings is unnecessary<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and would only amount to an opportunity for the ALJ to make \u201cspecific findings\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to rescue a decision otherwise unsupported by substantial evidence. We therefore remand for an award of benefits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE FOR AN AWARD OF BENEFITS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b188-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-10\">.
