He argues that the district court clearly erred in denying his request for a minor role reduction pursuant to \u00a7 8B1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Padilla also argues that because the drug quantity was not submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, his sentence was imposed in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Padilla further claims that the district court\u2019s finding of drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence violated the constitutional rule announced in <em>Apprendi </em>because it resulted in an increase in the statutory minimum sentence to which Padilla was subject. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><em>Role Reduction Claim </em>Padilla cites to cases that have rejected a minor role reduction, claiming that because \u201c[h]is participation fails to approach the degree of involvement\u201d in those cases, he should prevail. The cases Padilla cites do not, however, stand for the proposition that a minor role reduction is appropriate if the defendant does not participate in the initial drug sale negotiations, but merely that in cases where the defendant is involved in all aspects of the negotiations, a minor role reduction is <em>not </em>appropriate. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Williams, </em>185 F.3d 945, 946 (9th Cir.l999)(per curiam) (holding that no minor role reduction was appropriate where the defendant had conducted cocaine sales on his own as well as with the other defendant and had offered his own pager number for subsequent transactions); <em>United States v. Martinez-Villegas, </em>993 F.Supp. 766, 780-81 (CD.Cal. 1998) (finding that no minor role reduction was appropriate where the defendant was present during the negotiations over transportation of the cocaine and was in charge of picking up and transporting the cocaine).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Although it was Hector Renteria, and not Padilla, who made the initial arrangements for the drug sale with the confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d), Padilla was actively involved in the transaction at the house. In addition to retrieving the fourth kilogram of cocaine from another room, Padilla participated in the conversation about the quality of the cocaine, asked the Cl about the purchase money for the drugs, and participated in the negotiations with the Cl about how they would get the money. Thus, the conclusion that \u201ceach defendant played a mutually supportive role, and each defendant\u2019s participation was integral to the completion of the offense\u201d was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\n<em>Apprendi Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Padilla did not object to the district court\u2019s finding of drug quantity at sentencing. Therefore, we will not grant relief unless the <em>Apprendi </em>error was \u201cplain.\u201d <em>United States v. Nordby, </em>225 F.3d 1053, 1059-60 (9th Cir.2000), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 567-68 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc). In order to demonstrate plain error, an appellant must show that: (1) there was \u201cerror\u201d; (2) the error was \u201cplain\u201d; and (3) the error affected \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563. If these conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to notice the forfeited error only if the error (4) \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">We have repeatedly held that no plain error under <em>Apprendi </em>exists where the defendant\u2019s actual sentence is below the statutory maximum authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Antonak-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>eas, </em>255 F.3d 714, 728 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Saya, </em>247 F.3d 929, 942 (9th Cir.)(as amended), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 493, 151 L.Ed.2d 404 (2001); <em>United States v. Scheele, </em>231 F.3d 492, 497 n. 2 (9th Cir.2000). In this case, Padilla\u2019s sentence of 97 months in prison and four years of supervised release was well below the statutory maximum authorized under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (authorizing a maximum prison term of 20 years and a \u201cterm of supervised release of <em>at least </em>6 years in addition to such term of imprisonment\u201d for an undetermined amount of cocaine (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">That the district court\u2019s drug quantity determination also increased Padilla\u2019s statutory minimum sentence does not alter this result. We have held that \u201cmandatory m\u00ednimums do not implicate <em>Apprendi.\u201d United States v. Hitchcock, </em>286 F.3d 1064, 1073, as amended 298 F.3d 1021, at 1021 (9th Cir.2002)(eiting <em>United States v. Harris, </em>- U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts in this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
