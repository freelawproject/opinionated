Because we agree with the district court that plaintiffs are not \u201cprevailing parties\u201d under the EAJA, they are not entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">In order to be a \u201cprevailing party\u201d within the meaning of the EAJA, the plaintiff must \u201center[] into a legally enforceable settlement agreement against the defendant\u201d in which the \u201cactual relief [obtained] on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant\u2019s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Barrios v. Cal. Interscholastic Fed\u2019n, </em>277 F.3d 1128, 1134 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Farrar v. Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103, 111-12, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992)). Here, there was no material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties achieved by any such agreement or order because it was the INS\u2019s independent decision to approve the second 1-140 petition that precipitated the stipulated dismissal and resulting Ninth Circuit order, and neither the dismissal nor the order incorporated its terms or compelled compliance with them. This case is similar to <em>Perez-Arellano v. Smith, </em>279 F.3d 791, 795 (9th Cir.2002), in which we held that the plaintiff was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the EAJA, because his success resulted from the INS\u2019s voluntary decision to grant his second application for naturalization rather than from any legally enforceable decision. <em>See also Maduka v. Meissner, </em>114 F.3d 1240, 1241^42 (D.C.Cir.1997) (per curiam) (holding that an alien was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in a case in which he unsuccessfully petitioned for a visa, then filed an action in district court, and his petition was approved by the INS before the district court had issued a decision, because \u201cthe lawsuit was not a necessary or substantial factor in obtaining that result\u201d). For substantially the same reasons, we hold that the plaintiffs in this case are not prevailing parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 argument that they are entitled to prevailing party status under a \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d has been foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buck-hannon Board &amp; Care Home v. West Virginia Department of Health &amp; Human Resources, </em>532 U.S. 598, 604-05, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001). <em>See also Perez-Arellano, </em>279 F.3d at 794 (holding that <em>Buckhannon </em>applies to a motion for attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA); <em>Barrios, </em>277 F.3d at 1134 n. 5 (noting that, \u201c[i]n light of <em>Buckhannon, </em>this court too has rejected the \u2018catalyst theory\u2019 \u201d); <em>Bennett v. Yoshina, </em>259 F.3d 1097, 1099 (9th Cir. 2001) (same). Because plaintiffs are not entitled to \u201cprevailing party\u201d status, they may not recover attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1242(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b824-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
