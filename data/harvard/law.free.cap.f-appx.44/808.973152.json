Singh\u2019s sole contention is that the Board abused its discretion and denied him due process by refusing to accept a one-day late brief in support of his appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), as amended by IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Avetova-Elisseva v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1192, 1195 n. 4 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Singh does not dispute that his brief was filed late. It is within the Board\u2019s discretion whether to accept a late brief. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.3(c)(1) (2002). The Board did not abuse its discretion in refusing to accept the brief when Singh never sought an extension of the filing deadline and offered a curt, one-sentence explanation for his dilatoriness: \u201cThe petitioner was sick and could not file the brief in time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">We review de novo whether the Board\u2019s refusal to accept the brief violated Singh\u2019s due process rights. <em>Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518, 523 (9th Cir.2000). To prevail on his due process claim, Singh must demonstrate \u201cerror and substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision rested on an adverse credibility determination supported by several specific findings of discrepancies in Singh\u2019s testimony. The Board similarly found that Singh was not credible, relying on discrepancies it observed as well as those the IJ discovered. Singh does not argue, much less demonstrate, that his brief would have cured the discrepancies relied upon by the Board. He fails to demonstrate prejudice and thereby fails to prove a due process violation. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cA showing of prejudice is essentially a demonstration that the alleged violation affected the outcome of the proceedings ----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b844-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-8\">. We apply the IIRIRA transitional rules because Singh\u2019s deportation was commenced prior to April I, 1997 and the BIA\u2019s final order of deportation issued on or after October 31, 1996. <em>Avetova-Elisseva, </em>213 F.3d at 1195 n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
