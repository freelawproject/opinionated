Parsky\u2019s appeal as premature. Parsky responds. The United States replies.</p>\n<p id=\"Aty\">Parsky filed a complaint in the Court of Federal Claims asserting Wmstar-related claims regarding, inter aha, Southern California Federal Savings and Loan Association (SoCal). The claims regarding SoCal were consolidated with other plaintiffs claims regarding SoCal, and Parsky\u2019s claims regarding other institutions were consolidated with other plaintiffs\u2019 claims regarding those institutions. On December 12, 2001, the Court of Federal Claims issued an order determining that his claims against SoCal were untimely. On December 14, 2001, the Court of Federal Claims directed the clerk to enter judgment, apparently to dismiss Parsky\u2019s claims against SoCal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The United States argues that, absent a certification pursuant to RCFC 54(b), Par-sky\u2019s appeal is premature because the other plaintiffs\u2019 claims remain to be adjudicated. We agree. In <em>Spraytex, Inc. v. DJS&amp;T, </em>96 F.3d 1377,1382 (Fed.Cir.1996), we held that a Rule 54(b) certification, stating that there is no just reason for delay and directing entry of judgment, is required to permit an appeal of a disposition of one claim or case in a consolidated action. Parsky does not strongly disagree that <em>Spraytex </em>governs the filing of his appeal. Instead, Parsky states that the appeal was filed as a precautionary matter and requests guidance concerning when an appeal would be timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">As we stated in <em>Spraytex, </em>absent a certification pursuant to Rule 54(b), an appeal \u201cis not proper until there is a final judgment disposing of all aspects of the consolidated case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1382. Thus, when a Rule 54(b) judgment is entered or a final judgment is entered that disposes of all aspects of the consolidated case, an appeal may be timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">(1) The United States\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\"> The United States states that Parsky's claims against another entity, Honolulu Federal Savings and Loan Association, remain pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
