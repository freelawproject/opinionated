We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-23\">The BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum must be upheld if it is \u201c \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zaca-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number><em>Has, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (citation omitted). \u201cIt can be reversed only if the evidence presented ... was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When an alien seeks to overturn the BIA\u2019s adverse determination, \u201che must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483-84; <em>see also Cordon-Garcia v.

INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc). Additionally, the claimed persecution must be on account of one of the grounds set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). <em>See id. </em>at 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">\u201c[W]e treat the IJ\u2019s statement of reasons as the BIA\u2019s and review the IJ\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion,\u201d because the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cmakes it clear\u201d that it is incorporating the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Alaelua v.

While Velasco-Estrada may have shown that the guerrillas used violence and threats in attempting to forcibly recruit him, the evidence does not compel the conclusion that he was persecuted on account of his political opinion, if any. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 482-83; <em>Molina-Morales v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1048, 1051-52 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Cruz-Navarro v.
