California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has moved to withdraw as counsel of record. Nunez-Carranza has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The only issue identified by counsel was whether the district court abused its discretion by denying Nunez-Carranza\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Counsel correctly rejected this issue because statements made during the plea hearing carry a strong presumption of veracity. <em>See United States v. Rubalcaba, </em>811 F.2d 491, 494 (9th Cir.1987). As such, the district court did not abuse its discretion, and Nunez-Carranza\u2019s plea was voluntarily and knowingly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Moreover, our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 82-83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988) indicates the plea agreement was entered knowingly and voluntarily. <em>See United States v. Aguilar-Muniz, </em>156 F.3d 974, 976 (9th Cir.1998) (holding waiver of right to appeal is valid if knowing and voluntary). Accordingly, we affirm the conviction, and GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"aud-dedup-0\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
