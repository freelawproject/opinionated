We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-17\">Villareal-Rodriguez\u2019s contention based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), lacks merit because his sentence of 120 months imprisonment is below the 30 year statutory maximum he would have faced pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), for his stipulation to 91 kilograms of marijuana. <em>See United States v. Mendozar-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1110-11 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that since drug quantity did not increase the penalty beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, <em>Apprendi </em>did not require this fact to be determined by the jury)-</p>\n<p id=\"b279-19\">Next, Villareal-Rodriguez contends that the district court failed, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b), to ask him whether he affirmed or denied his prior conviction, and failed to advise him that any challenge to the prior conviction must be brought before sentence was imposed. However, since Villareal-Rodriguez was barred, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(e), from challenging a prior conviction that was more than five years old, <em>see United States v. Hous-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number><em>ley, </em>907 F.2d 920, 921-22 (9th Cir.1990), the district court\u2019s error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s finding that Villareal-Rodriguez was a manger or supervisor under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(b), <em>see United States v. Ponce, </em>51 F.3d 820, 826 (9th Cir.1995). At sentencing, the district court found that Villareal-Rodriguez was entrusted to stash marijuana, hire drivers, arrange deliveries, and ensure that proceeds from the sale of marijuana returned to Mexico. The district court also found that the criminal activity involved five or more participants. Accordingly, the three-level role enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) was not clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Villareal-Rodriguez further contends that he should have received a two-level downward adjustment to his base offense level for acceptance of responsibility. Because this contention is raised for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. MarinCuevas, </em>147 F.3d 889, 892-93 (9th Cir. 1998). Villareal-Rodriguez points to no evidence in the record showing genuine contriteness that would entitle him to a two point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Ochoa-Gaytan, </em>265 F.3d 837, 843 (9th Cir.2001) (stating that it is defendant\u2019s burden to demonstrate acceptance of responsibility); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>15 F.3d 849, 853 (9th Cir.1994) (concluding that the primary goal of the acceptance of responsibility reduction is to reward defendants who are genuinely contrite). Accordingly, the district court did not err by declining to grant Villareal-Rodriguez a two-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Lastly, Villareal-Rodriguez\u2019s contention that he should have received a four-level downward departure for a combination of factors fails because the district court lacked discretion to depart from the 10-year statutory minimum sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. VanDoren, </em>182 F.3d 1077, 1083 (9th Cir.1999) (a district court does not have the discretion to apply downward departures below the minimum mandated by Congress).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b279-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
