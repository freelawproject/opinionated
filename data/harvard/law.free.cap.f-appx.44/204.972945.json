Reyes was sentenced to 85 months imprisonment, four years of supervised release, and a special assessment of $200. The facts and prior proceedings are known to the parties; they are not recited in our disposition, except as necessary. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Reyes\u2019 argument that the penalty provisions in the drug statute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b), are facially unconstitutional in light of the constitutional rule recognized in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), was recently rejected by this court. <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc). Accordingly, this argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Reyes\u2019 further argument that, if \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional, so also must be his 85-month guideline sentence, is similarly unavailing. Reyes argues that his sentence was somehow \u201cdriven by\u201d the five-year mandatory minimum sentence in the allegedly unconstitutional statute. The Supreme Court recently held, however, that <em>Apprendi </em>did not render mandatory minimum sentences unconstitutional. <em>See Harris v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002). Moreover, even if there were any <em>Apprendi </em>error in Reyes\u2019 sentence, the error would be harmless because the sentence is below the statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Sanchez, </em>238 F.3d 1200, 1201 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b241-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Cir.
