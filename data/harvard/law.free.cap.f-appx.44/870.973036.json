We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s dismissal, <em>Ghazali v. Moran, </em>46 F.3d 52, 53 (9th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (dismissal for violation of local rule), and the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for appointment of counsel, <em>Wilborn v. Escalderon, </em>789 F.2d 1328, 1331 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-22\">The district court determined that Lopez\u2019s first amended complaint stated a claim. Lopez later moved for leave to amend to add new defendants and claims. The district court granted Lopez leave to amend, cautioning that the claims in his second amended complaint should relate to the claims in his first amended complaint. In the same order, the district court dismissed Lopez\u2019s first amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-23\">The district court erred by dismissing Lopez\u2019s first amended complaint, after expressly holding that it stated a claim. <em>See Ghazali, </em>46 F.3d at 53. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal and remand for reinstatement of the first amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-24\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Lopez\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel because he failed to show exceptional circumstances. <em>See Wilborn, </em>789 F.2d at 1331,</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>In light of our ruling, we need not reach any other issues raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj5K\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b906-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
