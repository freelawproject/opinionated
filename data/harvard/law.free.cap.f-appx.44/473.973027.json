APM opposes. Shanklin replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">APM filed an appeal from an order of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in which that court found infringement of claims 1-9 of Shanklin\u2019s patent. In the order, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">In sum, plaintiffs motion for summary judgment is granted, and defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion is denied. It would appear that our finding of infringement would also doom the defendants\u2019 counterclaim for tortious interference with contract, as it is based on the allegation that plaintiff was unjustified in interfering with the Rank Video/Rally contract. However, because neither side specifically discussed how a finding of infringement would effect [sic] the counterclaim, we will deny the defendants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment on the counterclaim without prejudice at this time and will not further analyze plaintiffs other defenses to that claim. The parties are directed to appear at a status hearing ... to discuss the remaining issues in this case, including how to proceed with damages portion of this case, whether plaintiff still intends to proceed with regard to claims 10 and 11, and the effect this ruling has on the viability of defendants\u2019 counterclaim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">It is clear that this case is not final except for an accounting, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(c)(2),'because the district court has not expressly decided all matters except for the accounting. APM argues that because infringement has been found, that \u201cwould require the dismissal of the Appellants\u2019 counterclaim.\u201d However, the district court has not so held. Also, the parties do not discuss whether infringement of claims 10 and 11 remains to be litigated and whether other issues remain.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In any event, it is clear from the district court\u2019s order regarding summary judgment of infringement that the case is not final except for an accounting. Thus, the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">(1) Shanklin\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b510-9\"> In a different order, the district court noted that Shanklin\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction remains pending. This also indicates that not all issues or claims, other than the accounting, have been decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
