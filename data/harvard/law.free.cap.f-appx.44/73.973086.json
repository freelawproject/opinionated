After granting the government\u2019s substantial-assistance departure motion, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 21 months imprisonment and 1 year supervised release. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the district court erred by failing to state the reasons for Cory\u2019s sentence, thereby precluding meaningful appellate review of the extent of the downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-24\">We conclude that Cory waived this argument because he did not raise it below. <em>See United, States v. McCabe, </em>270 F.3d 588, 590 (8th Cir.2001), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 1588, 152 L.Ed.2d 506 (2002). Further, any error did not affect Cory\u2019s substantial rights and therefore is harmless, because the extent of the downward departure is unreviewable. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(a); <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>147 F.3d 765, 772 (8th Cir.1998). Finally, following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75,109 S.Ct. 346,102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-27\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-19\">.
