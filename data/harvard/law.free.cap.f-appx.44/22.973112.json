Griffin was convicted after a jury trial for the unauthorized transfer of food stamps in violation of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2024(b). Griffin admitted he sold food stamps to Jacqueline Murphy for ninety-five percent of their face value. But he claimed Murphy was his employer and he thought it was appropriate to redeem food stamps in this manner. Murphy had been a participant in more widespread food stamp fraud. When caught, she cooperated and testified for the government, repeatedly denying that Griffin was her employee. Additional background facts are set forth in our opinion affirming the conviction on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Griffin, </em>215 F.3d 866 (8th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-20\">After Griffin was sentenced to nine months in prison, but before he commenced serving this sentence, he discovered in the files of the Country Fed Meat Company a copy of a letter dated April 3, 1997, addressed to \u201cU.S.D.A. Food and Nutrition\u201d and appearing to bear Jacqueline Murphy\u2019s signature. The letter declared that Murphy was licensed to redeem food stamps, that she was \u201cdisassociating\u201d from Country Fed Meat Company, and that she would be operating as Jacque\u2019s Meat Company with William Griffin as one of her two \u201csales agents.\u201d Griffin then filed this \u00a7 2255 motion, claiming the letter is newly discovered evidence establishing that he was Murphy\u2019s employee and impeaching Mur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ph/s contrary trial testimony. Griffin accompanied his \u00a7 2255 motion with a request that the Department of Agriculture produce this letter and other documents, and a Motion for Leave To Conduct Discovery \u201cto discover whether Jacqueline Murphy will admit that she authored\u201d the letter. The government responded with an affidavit declaring that U.S.D.A.\u2019s file relating to Jacque\u2019s Meat Company was introduced at trial, the letter was not in that file, and a further careful review of Food and Nutrition Service records failed to uncover the original or a copy of the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The district court denied Griffin\u2019s request for discovery and his \u00a7 2255 motion, concluding he had failed to satisfy the stringent standards for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence \u2014 that a reasonably diligent effort would not have uncovered the letter prior to trial, and that this new evidence would probably result in acquittal. On appeal, Griffin argues the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 2255 motion without granting the requested discovery. We disagree. Griffin strives to fit his claim under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), but he has no evidence refuting the government\u2019s sworn statement that the Murphy letter was never in U.S.D.A. files and thus was not withheld from the defense prior to or at the trial. As for Griffin\u2019s claim based upon newly discovered evidence, we agree with the district court that he failed to make the requisite showing that he was sufficiently diligent in searching for this evidence before trial, and that the new evidence \u201cis material, more than merely cumulative or impeaching, and likely to produce an acquittal if a new trial is granted.\u201d <em>United States v. Dogskin, </em>265 F.3d 682, 685 (8th Cir.2001). The discovery Griffin requested would not have overcome these deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The orders of the district court dated May 8, 2001, are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
