We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-23\">Martinez-Ruiz contends that the district court erred in several respects at sentencing by applying a two-level upward adjustment to his base offense level for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Because he raises these contentions for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Antonakeas, </em>255 F.3d 714, 727 (9th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-24\">Martinez-Ruiz firsts contends that he did not have notice of the district court\u2019s intent to apply the enhancement. However, even if there was error, we conclude that Martinez-Ruiz\u2019s sentence should not be reversed because he has failed to demonstrate that any lack of notice affected his substantial rights. <em>See Antonakeas </em>at 728 (stating that sentencing error is not \u201cplain\u201d where it has no affect on the actual sentence); <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 98, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993) (concluding that enhancement is mandatory upon a determination of perjury).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-25\">Martinez-Ruiz next contends that the district court made insufficient findings to support its application of the enhancement. We conclude that the district court made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>adequate findings because it found by clear and convincing evidence that Martinez-Ruiz had willfully testified falsely at trial on a material matter. <em>See Dunnigan </em>at 95 (concluding that district court\u2019s finding of obstruction of justice is sufficient if it encompasses all of the factual predicates of perjury).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Finally, Martinez-Ruiz contends that the district court erred when it found that he committed perjury. We disagree. <em>See United States v. Ancheta, </em>38 F.3d 1114, 1117 (9th Cir.1994); <em>cf., United States v. Garcia, </em>135 F.3d 667, 671 (9th Cir.1998) (noting that the factfinder\u2019s choice between two permissible views of the evidence cannot be clearly erroneous). Accordingly, the district court did not -err in its application of the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">We decline to consider Martinez-Ruiz\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim because it is more appropriately raised in a habeas corpus proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Reyes-Platero, </em>224 F.3d 1112, 1116 (9th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b837-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-8\">.
