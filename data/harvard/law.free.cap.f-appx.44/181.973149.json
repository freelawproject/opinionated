The BIA denied Nijjar\u2019s application because his account was not credible and, even if events had transpired as he claimed, he would be unable to show that he was persecuted \u201con account of\u2019 a protected ground. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-26\">The BIA \u201c \u2018must have a legitimate artic-ulable basis to question the petitioner\u2019s credibility, and must offer a specific, cogent reason for any stated disbelief, and any such reasons must be substantial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Singh v. INS, </em>292 F.3d 1017, 1020 (9th Cir.2002). Nijjar\u2019s account was detailed, internally consistent and consistent with the story he told upon entering the country. The BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence. Nijjar\u2019s account was not contradicted by any aspect of the State Department Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor report. Nor did Nijjar\u2019s passport undermine his credibility \u2014 the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) did not ultimately dispute Nijjar\u2019s identity and so any questions about why Nijjar provided a photocopy rather than an original and why Nijjar\u2019s occupation was listed as \u201cstudent\u201d do not bear on the heart of his asylum claim. Finally, even assuming that Nijjar\u2019s testimony that he did not seek medical attention casts some doubt on his testimony that he was beaten, this finding alone cannot support a finding that Nijjar\u2019s testimony is generally not credible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the BIA erred in discrediting Nijjar and requiring him to corroborate his version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The BIA also erred in concluding that Nijjar was not persecuted within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158. Nijjar\u2019s credible testimony establishes that he was detained and beaten by the Indian police. Contrary to the INS\u2019 assertion, this conduct constitutes \u201cpersecution.\u201d <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339 (9th Cir.1995). Further, the evidence compels the conclusion that Nijjar was persecuted, <em>\u201cat least in part, </em>on account of\u2019 his imputed political opinion. <em>Borja v. INS, </em>175 F.3d 732, 736 (9th Cir.1999) (emphasis added); <em>see also Ratnam v. INS, </em>154 F.3d 990 (9th Cir.1998); <em>Singh v. Ilchert, </em>63 F.3d 1501 (9th Cir.1995). Because Nijjar has demonstrated past persecution, we presume that he is eligible for both asylum and withholding of deportation. <em>See Salazar-Paucar v. INS, </em>281 F.3d 1069, 1074, <em>amended, by </em>290 F.3d 964 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1169 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Moreover, nothing in this record will permit the INS to rebut that presumption, and the INS does not present any authority that it would be entitled to supplement the record on remand. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for the Attorney General to decide whether he will grant asylum and withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b217-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-5\">. The BIA did not rely on the IJ's finding that Nijjar was nervous. If it had done so, we would still reverse, because nervousness alone does not call into doubt the veracity of a young man who is testifying before a foreign government official in order to avoid being returned to the country where he suffered persecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
