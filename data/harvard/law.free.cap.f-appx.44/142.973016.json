Halverson now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cEAJA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412. We reverse on the question of attorneys\u2019 fees and remand on the question of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The parties are familiar with the facts and the medical evidence in the underlying record, so we proceed to the discussion of attorneys\u2019 fees. A party that prevails against the United States in a civil action is entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under the EAJA \u201cunless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). The EAJA creates a presumption that fees will be awarded to prevailing parties. <em>See Thomas v. Peterson, </em>841 F.2d 332, 335 (9th Cir.1988). Therefore, it is the government\u2019s burden to show that its position was substantially justified. <em>See Gutierrez v. Barnhart, </em>274 F.3d 1255, 1258 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">A substantially justified position must have a reasonable basis both in law and fact. <em>See id.; Flores v. Shalala, </em>49 F.3d 562, 569 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cIn this circuit, we apply a reasonableness standard in determining whether the government\u2019s position was substantially justified for purposes of the EAJA.\u201d). The EAJA provides that the \u201c \u2018position of the United States\u2019 means, in addition to the position taken by the United States in the civil action, the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civil action is based.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Once a claimant shows that she cannot return to her previous job, the burden of proof shifts to the Commissioner to show that she can do other types of work. <em>See Embrey v. Bowen, </em>849 F.2d 418, 422 (9th Cir.1988). The Commissioner must ordinarily use a vocational expert to meet that burden. <em>See id. </em>\u201cHypothetical questions posed to the vocational expert must set out all the limitations and restrictions of the particular claimant .... If the assumptions in the hypothetical are not supported by the record, the opinion of the vocational expert that claimant has a residual working capacity has <em>no evidentiary value.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). In <em>Flores, </em>we held that the Secretary\u2019s decision to defend an ALJ ruling in which the ALJ had relied on a vocational expert\u2019s testimony was not substantially justified because the ALJ failed to consider a relevant report in posing the hypothetical. 49 F.3d at 570-71. Relying on this authority, Halverson argues that because the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical omitted relevant limitations clearly evidenced in the medical reports, the vocational expert\u2019s opinion had no evidentiary value. Consequently, she argues, the ALJ\u2019s reliance on that opinion and the Commissioner\u2019s defense of the ALJ\u2019s ruling were not substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">We agree. Although it is a close question, we find insufficient support in the record for the ALJ\u2019s omission from its vocational hypothetical of all limitations from migraines in the absence of strong odors. We previously held that the ALJ\u2019s determination lacked substantial evidence because, even though Halverson\u2019s testimony about the frequency of episodes was properly discredited and her treating physician indicated that her condition had improved, the medical record showed that she continued to suffer two attacks per month. <em>Halverson v. Apfel, </em>No. 99-35680, 2000 WL 1763215 (9th Cir. Nov.17, 2000) (unpub.disp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">The ALJ\u2019s failure to incorporate into the vocational hypothetical such findings from the later medical reports was unreasonable. First, the ALJ did not point to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>evidence supporting complete relief from migraines by late 1996, but simply declared that all the doctors\u2019 findings after April 1995 were not supported by \u201cobjective evidence.\u201d This is insufficient under <em>Embrey. See </em>849 F.2d at 422-23 (\u201cTo say that medical opinions are not supported by sufficient objective findings ... does not achieve the level of specificity that our prior cases have required____[T]he ALJ\u2019s analysis does not give proper weight to the subjective elements of the doctors\u2019 diagnoses.\u201d). Second, the ALJ never addressed the significant time gap between Dr. Mallory\u2019s last report (April 1995) upon which the ALJ relies and the time of the hearing in which the ALJ formulated the vocational hypothetical (August 1996) or issued its decision (January 1997). The only medical evidence after April 1995 appears to be from Dr. Melson, Dr. Brum-mer, Dr. Pearson, and Dr. Bieraugel, all of whose opinions the ALJ disregarded in devising the vocational hypothetical limitations. It is unreasonable for the ALJ not to have considered any medical evidence of Halverson\u2019s condition more timely than April 1995 in evaluating Halverson\u2019s current condition at the time of the ALJ opinion (January 1997). Third, the more recent medical reports did not materially conflict with each other (except as to frequency of migraines) or with any other opinions, including that of Dr. Mallory. Although Dr. Mallory had found that Hal-verson\u2019s condition was improving due to her avoidance of trigger factors, that assessment appears to be more than 18 months before the more recent reports. Further, even Dr. Mallory noted that Hal-verson had suffered a migraine absent trigger factors in his March 24, 1995 report. Given that fact, even if the later medical reports were \u201cless persuasive,\u201d it was unreasonable to ignore completely the evidence of Halverson\u2019s continuing migraines. There was no countervailing evidence from which the ALJ could have reasonably concluded that Halverson was no longer suffering <em>any </em>debilitating effects from migraines.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Based on these factors, the ALJ did not have a reasonable basis to omit from the vocational hypothetical all limitations from migraines in the absence of strong odor triggers. Thus, the Commissioner was not substantially justified in defending the ALJ\u2019s decision based on the vocational expert\u2019s opinion, and we reverse the district court\u2019s denial of attorneys fees under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">We also remand so that the district court can exercise its discretion whether to award costs (in addition to attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses) to Halverson under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b178-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
