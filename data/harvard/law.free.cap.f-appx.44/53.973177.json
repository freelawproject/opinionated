In accordance with Frowner\u2019s plea agreement, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 160 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release. The court also ordered him to pay $145,632.16 in restitution. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erred in finding that Frowner was a career offender. In his pro se supplemental brief, Frowner argues that the career-offender enhancement violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and that the district court plainly erred in not addressing each of his objections to the presentence report (PSR).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The district court did not err in imposing the 160-month sentence to which Frowner had agreed. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995). Moreover, (1) Frowner did not object to the paragraphs of the PSR describing the prior robbery and drug offenses that made the career-offender enhancement applicable, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1, 4B1.2 comment. (n.l); <em>United States v. Montanye, </em>996 F.2d 190, 192-93 (8th Cir.1993) (en banc); (2) <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply because Frowner was sentenced to less than the statutory maximum of 25 years, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>295 F.3d 824, 827-28 (8th Cir.2002); and (3) any failure of the district court to address each of Frowner\u2019s objections was harmless, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a). Following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivo-lous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-9\">. The HONORABLE ROBERT W. PRATT, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
