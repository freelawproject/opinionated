The Honorable Raner C. Collins, United States District Judge for Arizona, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b211-9\">MEMORANDUM</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">We review <em>de </em>novo<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2) of Tosvar Aerosol and its owner, Paolo Gioia, from Sebastian International\u2019s lawsuit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-11\">Where, as here, the district court receives only written submissions, the plaintiff need only make a prima facie case showing of jurisdiction to avoid the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. In determining whether [plaintiff] has met this burden, uncontroverted allegations in [plaintiffs] complaint must be taken as true, and conflicts between the facts eon-tained in the parties\u2019 affidavits must be resolved in [plaintiffs] favor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-15\">We apply this standard on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-16\">Sebastian did not meet its burden<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of making \u201ca prima facie showing of facts supporting jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sebastian\u2019s allegations and declarations do not reasonably support the inference that Tosvar knew or reasonably should have known the counterfeits would be shipped to California. Tosvar filled cans in Italy manufactured by an Italian company, for an Italian company, and delivered the filled cans to an Italian transportation company for transport to an Italian port. The cryptic reference to \u201cMiami\u201d on the Italian transportation company\u2019s (not Sebastian\u2019s) shipping documents and to \u201cthe Americans\u201d in the fax, the still more cryptic BATF license number on the cans, and the presence of Sebastian\u2019s California address and a \u201cMade in the U.S.A.\u201d label on the cans do not adequately support the inference of knowledge that the cans would be sold into the California market. Because Sebastian has not established, even under a permissive standard, that Tosvar knew that the cans were shipped to the United States, it has not made a prima facie showing that Tosvars\u2019 acts were \u201cexpressly aimed at the forum.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-17\">We reject Sebastian\u2019s remaining contention, that the district court should have ordered additional discovery before dismissing Tosvar, because Sebastian has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>not made \u201cthe clearest showing that denial of discovery resulted] in actual and substantial prejudice to the complaining litigant.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Sebastian\u2019s appeal against Nortex, case number 01-55484, is severed and STAYED. As to Sebastian\u2019s appeal against Tosvar Aerosol and Gioia, case number 01-55488, the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-13\">. <em>Glencore Grain Rotterdam B.V. v.

However, I respectfully dissent with respect to personal jurisdiction over Tosvar.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Taking all inferences in the plaintiffs favor, as we must, Tosvar knew it was part of a counterfeiting conspiracy whose actions necessarily had a significant effect in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">1. A reasonable inference from the FAX from Dollars Spray is that the counterfeit products were headed for the United States: \u201c \u2018The Americans\u2019 will leave on Thursday, 30 September 1999.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Sebastian concedes that its appeal against Nortex Drug Distributors is stayed by that defendant\u2019s bankruptcy filing in the Northern District of Texas.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although Nortex has not informed this Court of its bankruptcy filing, the \u201cstay is self-executing, effective upon the filing of the bankruptcy petition.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">2. Counterfeit cans were marked, falsely, \u201cMade in the USA\u201d and marked with Sebastian\u2019s Woodland Hills, California, address.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">3. The products intentionally were shipped to and distributed throughout the United States, including California, and Tosvar knew that Sebastian\u2019s headquarters was in California. Tosvar thus knew that trademark infringement had its greatest effect in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">4. The cans showed a California license number and a California manufacturing plant number, which plainly were false, because Tosvar did not operate under a California license and did not have a manufacturing plant in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-16\">Accordingly, I would hold that the district court had jurisdiction, and I would reverse as to Tosvar for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b212-11\">. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. 362(a); <em>Parker v.
