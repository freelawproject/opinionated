Co. vs. State, page 101, pamphlet edition, January, 1875.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A25\">The plain.and unmistakable language used by the Legisla- . ture in the'passage of the- act. of 1859 and the Act of 14th. December, T866, clearly shows:the intention of the Legisla--v. tur\u00e9 to.be such, as is here-urged:- The language is-as fol-C lows in each case : NvfY:</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-9\">\u201cAil aCtto amend <em>the act </em>entitled \u2019an;'act.to:incorporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>the Pensacola and Georgia Railroad Company.\u201d Acts of December 1859, 1866.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-5\">The rule laid down by this court and cited in Harroll against Harroll (8 Fla.) applies with peculiar force in the case at bar. Where the statute-is an act of incorporation conferring a charter, and delegating, limiting, and specifying powers therein, the act becomes the constitution of the company incorporated, and like any other constitution when amended must be construed with the amendments as one entire instrument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-6\">III. Having, as we think, shown that the act incorporating the Pensacola and Georgia Railroad Company, and the amendments thereof passed in 1859 and 1866, are to be taken as one act, we now proceed to show that there was a <em>contract </em>therein in regard to taxation, the obligations of which are violated by the revenue act of February 17,1874.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-7\">The 16th section of the act of incorporation stipulates that the \u201c Pensacola and Georgia Railroad and its <em>appurtenances, </em>and .all property connected therewith, shall <em>not </em>be taxed <em>higher </em>than one-half of one per cent, on its annual net income.\u201d Pamphlet Act 1853, Section 16, p. 48.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-8\">The act of 17th February, 1874, under which appellants' road is attempted to be taxed in this case, levies - a higher tax than one-half of one per eent.'on its annual net income, and is a tax upon the' entire property owned by'app\u00e9llants in the road.: Act of 17th February, 1874, Section 47, \u00e9tc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-9\">IY. Appellants further insist that .the act of 17th February, 1874, violates the obligation of the <em>contract </em>under the provisions of the act of 1855, commonly-called' the Internal Improvement Act, which; enters intot and forms part of the contract made with appellants through their g'rautors:: and subsequently <em>ratified </em>by the State-of Florida, 14th-De-\u00abjeipber, 1866-- Bush\u2019s Digest; p. 370, Sections 18-24'; Act 1853, Section .4, p. 44'; Act 14th1 December;\" 1866, p. 45. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-10\">Y. Appellants hold that the- contract embraced in the act-of incorporation and the amendm\u00e9nts thereofpand in.the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Internal Improvement Act, is protected by the Constitution of the United States, where the contract is based upon a consideration received or supposed to be received,1 and that this has been so often decided that the consideration can no. longer be considered an open one.' Cooly\u2019s Con. Lim.,.side p. 281, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-5\">The Supreme Court of the United States says that.these . principles have so often been set forth that it is a work of.-, supererogation to enunciate them again. 13 Wallace, 646, 264.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-6\">The following rules for the construction of the contract are respectfully submitted:</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-7\">I. The <em>intention </em>of the contracting parties at the time the agreement or contract was'made,, must control the eonstruction of the contract.

That the intention is to be found in the words taken in their natural sense, and the words used in. this contract are, \u201c <em>shall not Toe taxed higher than one-half of one per cent, on the a/nnual net </em>income.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-11\">III. The intention is to be found by acts of the .same,, character, passed at or about the same time, on tlie same subject-matter Acts 1853 chartering various.railroads, and- i the spirit of the Internal Improvement Act. \u25a0 . &lt;</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-13\">IY. The intention .may be inferred from all subsequent;,; legislation up -to'18.69, on the subject of railroads, by which;,' it will be seen that they were held exempt from 'taxation as now exempted. . - . . \\ . i:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-14\">V. The intention of the-contracting parties is. unmis-i takably shown by the subsequent conduct in dealing with;.; this, question, for from 1853 to the date of the levy made byio the Collector \u00f3f Suwannee county'in this cape, no .effort has\u00ab been made to enforce the \u25a0 collection of the! tax' otherwise.;.-, than as in. accordance..with the act of incorporation. 1 Cranch., 299; 1 Wheat., 3, 4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-15\">YI.\u201e Appellants insist .that-if .it should .be. held; that .their, <em>n </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>road is an independent branch road,- yet that the same was built under and by virtue of and in accordance with the provisions of the act incorporating the Pensacola' and Georgia Railroad Company and amendments, and being completed according to the charter, the <em>contract </em>as to it became an executed contract, which differs in nothing from a grant. 1</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-5\">A grant amounts in its own nature to the extinguishment of the right of the grantor, and that a party is, therefore, estopped by his own grant. 6 Cranch., 183; Cooley\u2019s Con. Lim., side p. 274.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-6\">VII. Appellants further insist that the State of Florida is estopped from attempting to collect the tax as proposed by the act of 1874, because <em>\u201c </em>the rule of law is clear that when one, by his words or conduct, wilfully causes another to b\u00e9lieve the existence of a certain state of things, and induces him to act on the belief so as to alter-or ehange his previous condition, the former is precluded from averring\" a different state- of things existing against the latter at the same time.\u201d Bigelow on Estoppel, 475.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-7\">Appellants\u2019 bill alleges that they were moved to make the investment in this branch road by the faith imposed in the guarantees and assurances contained in the acts of 1866, and prior acts. The demurrer of defendant admits this to be true.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-8\">Appellaiits further insist that the State is estopped from enforcing the collection of said tax, because <em>\u201c </em>a party who negligently or culpably stands by and allows another to contract on- the faith and understanding of a fact which he can contradict, cannot afterwards dispute that fact in an action against that person.\u201d Bigelow on Estoppel, 500; Act 14th December, 1866, page 45 ; 2 Curtis, 379.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-9\">But it is insisted-that we have forfeited our charter and rights because of non-compliance with Section 17 of the act of incorporation.

And the court is referred to my. brief in this case, Maintaining the right of taxation to the P. <em>&amp;' </em>G.

If the roads of the State of Florida are exempt from taxation by charter, it does not follow that the A. &amp; G.

Under Section 17, Chapter 1976, of Laws of Florida, a tax has been levied, and while the appellee and defendant was attempting to collect it, the appellant and complainant filed his bill, and a rule to show cause why an injunction should not be granted as prayed, was made.- The defendant demurred to the bill, and the eause comes here upon an appeal from the Circuit Court\u2019s order sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>There is an agreement in the record made by counsel waiving the question of the equitable jurisdiction to enforce the collection of a tax.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-5\">The appellant claims that the property sought to be taxed is exempt from taxation-; that it was exempt at the time the act- of 1866 was passed, under which , act, (Chapter 1573, Acts 1866, page 45), appellant acquired it, and that this exemption,' whether total or partial, passed with the property to appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-6\">\"We consider that, practically, the sole questions for argument here, as the allegations of the bill are admitted by the demurrer, are:</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-7\">1st. Was this property exempt from taxation at the time the Pensacola and Georgia Railroad Company sold and conveyed it to appellant, and if so,\" what Was the character of the exemption <em>%</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-8\">2d. If it was either entirely exempt from taxation, or only subject to a limited tax, is the State precluded by the act of 1866 (Chapter 1573) and its contract thereunder with appellant, as alleged in the bill, from taxing it otherwise, or in any greater amount than it was taxable at the time we purchased it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-9\">The Act of 1853, Chapter 484, incorporating the Pensacola and Georgia Railroad Company, by Section 3 fixed the termini of the Pensacola and- Georgia railroad at a point on the waters of Pensacola Bay and some point on the Georgia and Elorida boundary line, to be determined by a Board of Directors. Section 2 of the act fixed the capital stock at $1,500,000, with privilege of increasing it if necessary to $3,500,000. Section 16 provided <em>\u201c </em>that the said railroad and its appurtenances, and all property therewith connected, shall not be taxed higher than one-half of one per cent, upon its annual net income.\u201d \u25a0 This act was approved January 8,1853.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-10\">December 22d, 185.9, the Pensacola and Georgia Railroad Company by an amendment to its charter was- empowered. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>to- build this <em>\u201c </em>branch road.\u201d (Chapter 1021, page 36, Acts 1859.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b672-5\">Prior to this time the company had accepted the provisions of the Internal Improvement law, and under that law and its original charter had constructed its road to a point east of thq branch road. Having accepted the provisions of the Internal Improvement law, it became entitled to, and at the time of the purchase of the branch road by the appellant, was enjoying, the privileges offered or guaranteed thereby.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b672-6\">The 18th Section of the Internal Impx-ovement law provides that the capital stock of any railroad company accepting the provisions of the act shall be forever exempt from taxation, and the roads, theii; fixtures and appurtenances, including work-shops and ware-houses, vehicles and property of every description needed for the purpose of transportation of freight and passengers, or for the repair and maintenance of the roads, shall be exempt from taxation while the roads are under construction, and for thirty-five years from their completion, and all the officers of the companies and servants and persons in the actual employment of the companies be exempt from performing ordinary patrol, jury, militia and road duty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b672-7\">This section, it will be perceived, offered these benefits, and the companies accepting the provisions of the act became entitled to them. The only forfeiture clause in the act is in Section 30, which provides that no bonds shall be issued to the companies in any part of their roads not completed at the end of eight years from the passage of the act; and any company failing to grade twenty miles of road within four years from filing notice of the acceptance of the terms of the act, shall forfeit all right \u2022 to its benefits. \"Within this clause it is apparent the Pensacola and Georgia Company never came, and if a sale under the third section of the act placed the company outside of the benefits of the act after the sale, this sale did not take place till after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Atlantic and Gulf railroad had acquired the property under the Act of 1866.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b673-5\">Under the above facts we claim that the branch road was at the time of the purchase by appellants\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b673-6\">1st.

The court held as follows: \u201c The property of a railroad company, within the city of Rome, held to be a part of its capital stock, and not liable to taxation by that city as property.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b674-5\">So then it is clear that an exemption of the capital stock of a company exempts its property, and as there was nothing in the amendatory act of 1859, which said that the exemption of the capital stock of the Pensacola and Georgia Railroad Company should not apply to or cover the branch road when built, there is no reason that we can see why the branch road is not as much exempt as any other property of the company. All of the stock of the company Was exempt, whether the original $1,500,000, or any increase thereof that may have been made under Section 2 of the Aet of 1853, and consequently all the property it may have represented, or that may have been held under it. Hie case of the State vs. the Norwich Railroad Company, ,30th Conn., cited on pages 816-7 of Abbott\u2019s Digest of Corporations, where the head note is given in full, shows that an exemption of capital stock applies to new as well as old stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b674-6\">The thirty-five year clause of Section 18 of the Internal Improvement law, it is clear, applies only to \u201c the roads,\u201d \u2022&amp;c., within the line of the Internal Improvement law. This is apparent from a careful consideration of Sections 2, 3, 18, 1, 11, 12,13, 8 and 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b674-7\">It will be seen that the bonds were to be a lien upon this line. That the granting an exemption merely of the \u25a0capital stock of a company accepting the provisions of the act, or building a particular section of the road, would have been of no benefit to the bondholder in case of a dissolution of the company from any cause. The exemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>would then have been dependent upon the continuation or existence of the stock, and in case it eeased to exist at any time prior to the maturing of the bonds, the bondholders\u2019 security would have been so much impaired, and could have been defeated by sale for nonpayment of taxes, the payment of which, whether it was made by the owner of the property or the lien-holder, was a burden upon and disadvantage to the security. Hence, to make the security better, the express limitation of thirty-five years, the period for which the bonds were to run, was declared. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b675-5\">The limitation in Section 15 of the original charter is an answer to apy argument against the exemption based upon the idea of \u201c monopoly,\u201d or \u201c railroad rule,\u201d or <em>\u201c </em>imposition.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b675-6\"><em>2. </em>But if this position is not sustained by the court, we submit that the rate and kind of taxation prescribed in Section 16 of original charter was the only taxation this property was liable to, and if this view is the correct one, we would remark that there is no law imposing a tax of this kind The tax imposed by the act of 1874 is an <em>ad valorem </em>tax upon the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b675-7\">The .amendment of 1859 merely gives the authority to build the road. But to whom does it give it ? It is to the Pensacola and Georgia Railroad Company as it stood under, its statutory creation. If the exemption of the capital stock by the internal improvement law is to be construed as above contended, then the Pensacola and Georgia Railroad Company stood at the passage of the amendatory act, and of the act of 1866 authorizing the sale, and afterwards, at least up to 1869, when the trustees sold out the road from Quincy to Lake City, with this feature of exemption applying to and affecting any amendatory act, not expressly or necessarily contravening it. If such is not the construction of the law upon an exemption of the capital stock of a company, then whatever the effect was, it stood with such effect as the law gives it as a part of the charter just as much as if ineorpoarted in the original act of 1853. If it did not have the ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>fect contended, it eertainly had not the effect to repeal the-exemption clause of the 16th section of the original charter.. So, assuming that it had no such effect as to exempt all the property as contended for, the Pensacola and Georgia Company, as it stood with this 16th section, was the company.. The Legislature was dealing with it as it had created it, and the amendatory statute should be taken as a part of the original, and the whole construed together as one act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b676-5\">Applying this rule as laid down in Harrell vs. Harrell, 8 Fla., 46, Sedgwick on Statutory Limitations, pp. 68,209-10,. and 1 Burroughs, 447, the 16th section should be held as applicable to both the original and amendatory acts. Tax cases, 12 Gil. and Johnson.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b676-6\">Assuming, then, that this branch road was either entirely exempt from taxation at the time the appellant purchased it, or subject merely to the half of one per cent, taxation, we maintain that it is impossible for the State of Florida, under any guise, however ingenious, to impose any tax upon it,, unless it is a tax of one-half of one per cent, upon the annual net income from the property, and not even this, if the property was entirely exempt at the purchase. This we maintain on the ground that a purchase by the appellant,, under the act of 1866, created a contract that the appellant should enjoy the same exemption from taxation, and that the contract is inviolable. 4 Wallace, 143 ; 13 Wallace, 264; 13 Wallace, 269; 16 Wallace, 244; 2 Wallace, 36; 18 Howard, 331.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b676-7\">WESTCOTT, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQY\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The 47th Section of Chapter 1976 of the Laws of Florida, (acts 7th sess., 1874, page 21,) provides \u201cthat the president and secretary or superintendent of every railroad company, whose track or road-bed, or any part thereof, is in this State,, shall annually, on or before the second Monday in June, return to the Comptroller of the State, under their oath, the total length of such railroads, the total length and value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>of such roads, including rights of way, road-bed, side track and main track in the State, and the total length and value thereof in each -county, city and incorporated town in this State.

The bill prayed an order enjoining the sale threatened, for a perpetual injunction at the hearing, and for a decree declaring the act authorizing the tax unconstitutional and void. Upon the agreement of parties the sale was postponed. Subsequently the defendant interposed, a demurrer to the bill. The ground of demurrer was want of.equity in the bill. Any question <em>as to the jurisdiction </em>of the court to enjoin the collection of taxes, was waived by the parties. Upon the hearing of this demurrer, the court sustained the same and dismissed the bill. From this decree this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The general question here involved is, whether, at the time the constitutional provision and the legislation above quoted authorizing this <em>ad valorem </em>tax were passed, this property was exempt from such taxation by virtue of a contract between the State of Florida and the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad Company. If such a contract existed, then it was beyond the power of both the convention and the Legislature thus to destroy it. The power of the State is limited in this respect by the Constitution of the United States, and this limitation extends as well to a convention of the people of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>a State as to the general legislative power appertaining to a State government.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">This brings us to inquire how and in what manner this property was acquired by the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad Company, and whether it is, in its hands, exempt from this <em>ad valorem </em>tax. The bill alleges that it acquired this property from the Pensacola and Georgia Railroad Company, that by virtue of a contract with said Pensacola and Georgia Railroad Company \u201c it became seized and possessed, in its own right, of the said road,\u201d and by virtue of the legislation of this State, it beeame entitled to all of the rights appertaining to said property in the hands of the Pensacola and Georgia Railroad Company, one of which, it claims, was exemption from such taxation as is here levied.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The act of the Legislature under which this property was acquired provides <em>\u201c </em>that the P. <em>&amp; </em>G. Railroad Company be and it is hereby authorized to sell and convey to the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad Company, of Georgia, the branch of their road commencing at Live Oak and running to the Georgia line, connecting with the branch of the road of the said Atlantic and Gulf Railroad Company, beginning at Lawton, on the said Atlantic and Gulf Railroad, in Georgia, and running to the Florida line, and all the rights, franchises and privileges of the said Pensacola and Georgia Railroad Company applicable to and connected with said branch road, in all respects as the same are and have been by law vested in said Pensacola and Georgia. Railroad Company.\u201d (Chap. 1573, Section 1, Laws of Fla.) There is no room for doubt as to the effect of this legislation. It is plain and direct. It is as positive and definite as it could be made. The sale of the road to the Atlantic and Gulf Company under this act is to pass all the <em>rights, franchises cmd privileges of the Pensacola a/nd Georgia Compcmy i/n all respects </em>as the same were, by law, vested in the Pensacola and Georgia Company. The object, purpose and effect of the law is upon the' sale to vest the Atlantic and Gulf Company with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>same rights as were in the Pensacola and Georgia Company. A right of exemption from taxation can be passed under the general language of \u201c all the rights \u201d as well as any other right. We can see no difference. In all cases the language must be clear to create such an exemption as is here claimed, but it is going too far to hold that <em>each right </em>must be enumerated in order to pass it. The term \u201c all rights \u201d embrace eaeh right, and there is no room for the least doubt on the subject. The case of Trask vs. Maguire, 18 Wall., 405, covers the point here suggested, if, indeed, so plain a proposition needs any authority to sustain it. There was a sale in that case authorized by an act of the Legislature. \u201c The act, under which the sale was made, provided that the purchasers should have all the rights, franchises, privileges and immunities, which were enjoyed by the defaulting company under its charter and laws amendatory thereof.\u201d Say the Supreme Court of the United States : \u201c The new company thus acquired all the immunity from taxation which the original company possessed.\u201d The only difference between the act in the case before the Supreme Court of the United States and the act here, is, that in Trask vs. Maguire, it gave the purchasing company the rights and privileges which the old company had \u201c under its charter and laws amendatory thereof,\u201d while here, the act gives the purchasing company all the rights which \u201c are and have been by law vested \u201d in the vendor company. The effect of the language is the same ; one is equally as explicit as the other. Rights which vest under a charter and its amendments, and rights vested by law, are terms signifying the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">In Humphrey vs. Peques, 16 Wall., 248, the act of the Legislature, construed by the court, provided \u201c that all the powers, rights and privileges granted by the charter of the Northeastern Railroad Company are hereby granted to the Oheraw and Darlington Railroad Company, and subject to the conditions therein contained.\u201d Under the orginal act <em>to </em>incorporate the Northeastern Railroad Company, no exemp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>tion from taxation was made ; under an amendment it was exempted. The Supreme Court held that after the passage of the amended act, <em>\u201c </em>the Northeastern Eailroad Company was, in law, as if it had originally been chartered\u201d with all the rights conferred by the amended act, and that under the ' general language, granting <em>\u201c </em>all the powers and rights \u201d vested in the Northeastern Eailroad Company, the right-of exemption conferred by the amended charter passed to the Cheraw and Darlington Eailroad Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The next question is, was this line of railway in Suwannee county, and its appurtenances, and all property therewith \u00a9onnected, exempt from the tax here levied in the hands- of the P. <em>&amp; </em>G. Eailroad Company at the time of the sale to the Atlantic &amp; Gulf Company ? If it was, then ' such right passed to the A. &amp; G. Company. This question has been discussed in two aspects. It is claimed that this line of road was exempt from all taxation by virtue of the provisions of the 18th section of an act entitled <em>\u201c </em>An Act to Provide for and Encourage a Liberal System of Internal Improvements in this State,\u201d approved January 6th, 1855, (Chap. 610, Laws of Florida.) It is also claimed that the line of road was exempt from the tax here levied by virtue of the 16th section of the act incorporating the P. <em>&amp; </em>G. Eailroad Company, approved January 8th, 1853, Chapter 484, and the amendment thereof, approved January 15, 1859, Chap. 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The P. <em>&amp; G. </em>Eailroad Company was one of the companies accepting the provisions of the Act of January 6th, 1855 ; and the 18th section of that act provided, \u201c That 'the capital stock of any railroad company accepting the provisions of this act shall be forever exempt from taxation, and the roads, their fixtures, and appurtenances * * * * * shall be exempt from taxation while the roads are under construction, and for the period of thirty-five years from their com. pletion.\u201d It is contended that an exemption of the capital stock of the P. <em>&amp; </em>G. Company from taxation was an ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>eruption of all of the property in connection with which the stock existed. As a general proposition it is true that the exemption of the capital stock of a company from taxation exempts the property in reference to which that stock exists, for the plain and simple reason that the stock, when considered independent of that property, is nothing more than a valueless piece of paper. The property is the representative of the stock, the stock the representative of the property, and as things of value and interest they are the same. Hence, it must be true that an exemption of one is the exemption of the other, for they are for the purposes of taxation the same thing. When, therefore,' there is a plain and simple declaration by the Legislature that the capital stock of a company shall be exempt, and nothing-more is said, that is an end of the cpiestion. Here, however, the general rule cannot operate, because the Legislature has plainly declared otherwise. It has said that while the capital stock shall <em>be forever </em>\u2018exempt, yet, that all the property of the road shall be exempt for thirty-five years after completion. The necessary inference from this isj that after thirty-five years have expired this property may be taxed. The exemption, then, ceases under the letter of the law. This section must be given a consistent construction. It is contrary to the elementary rules controlling statutory construction to give one clause of a section a construction not consistent with the clearly expressed meaning of another, when the first can be construed in harmony with the last. The Legislature here was prescribing a rule of taxation and not its rate. The effect of the section is to prohibit taxation of the stock as stock of the company; to forever prohibit the application of such a rule; but after the expiration of thirty-five years the property might be taxed by some other rule than by taxing its stock as stock. Besides it is far from clear that because this property of the P. &amp; G-. Railroad Company is exempt on account of a stock exemption of that company, that an exemption incident to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the stock of the P. &amp; G. Company would enure to the benefit of the A. <em>&amp; </em>G. Company, because the property it acquired was exempt, not as property of the P. &amp; G. Company strictly, but because its stock was not taxed. This exemption was incident to this property only, because the stock of the P. <em>&amp; </em>G. Company was not taxed. It was a special privilege attached to the stock of that corporation. The exemption was an incident of the stock interest of that particular company in that precise property, and because, in point of fact and law, this property appertained to stock in that particular company. It would seem, therefore, that wherever you- could tax this property without taxing the stock of the P. &amp; G. Company, it might be done. But however this may be, it is apparent that it was not the purpose to exempt the property owned by this company forever, when it declared its stock exempt for that time, but that the purpose was to require the Legislature to adopt some other rule of taxation. The term \u201c roads \u201d in this section refers strictly to the lines of road for the construction of which the internal improvement fund was created, and this line of road, a branch road from Live Oak to Lawton, was not embraced therein. To extend the exemption to other roads would be clearly inconsistent with the general purpose of the act, which was to encourage the system created by it, in which system the branch road was not embraced.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">This disposes of the first aspect in which this question has been (discussed, and we now reach the second view presented of it. It is claimed that this line of road was exempt from the tax here levied by virtue of the 16th section of the act incorporating the P. <em>&amp; </em>G. Eailroad Company; that under this section this road was exempt from such taxation when sold by the P. <em>&amp; </em>G. Company to the A. &amp; G. Company. If such was the case, then it is still exempt, if the original exemption was a contract beyond the control of subsequent aetion by the Convention and Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The 16th section of the act incorporating the P. &amp; G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Railroad Company provided \u201c that the said railroad and its appurtenances and all property therewith connected, shall not be taxed higher than one-half of one per cent, upon its annual net income.\u201d Whether the original charter authorized the construction of this branch road, we deem it entirely immaterial to inquire, as the act approved January 15, 1859, amending the charter of the Pensacola and Georgia Company, gave this express authority, and it is sufficient for the purposes of this case to say that this amendment did authorize the construction of this road. Upon the adoption of this amendment, the road thereby authorized to be constructed became subject to the provisions of the original charter as to its management, control, operation and everything else. The. original charter, as amended by this act, became the measure and source of the legal rights of this corporation, and this new road thus authorized to be constructed became its property, equally exempt from taxation as any other property acquired and owned before the amendment became operative. The highest tax, therefore, which can be levied, as to this road, in the hands of the Atlantic and Gulf Company, is a tax of one-half of one per cent, upon the annual net income derived therefrom. The tax here levied and proposed to be collected is an <em>ad valorem </em>tax upon the entire property, and, <em>if it is higher </em>than one-half of one .per cent, upon the anhual net income derived from the property, it is unauthorized, unless this original exemption in the charter was a privilege granted, which could be withdrawn, instead of a contract of effective obligation upon the State. In Wilmington Railroad vs. Reed, 13 Wall., 264, it is held by the Supreme Court of the United States that a charter to a railroad company, containing such an exemption as is here expressed, is a contract, and a law subsequently passed, laying a tax inconsistent with the exemption, violates the obligation of the contract, and is void. The same rule applies' to the act of a constitutional convention impairing the obligation of a contract. Such.action is void. Whatever doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>may have once existed on this question, it is now settled by the repeated decision of the Supreme Court of the United States to the effect stated, and it would be a useless expenditure of words to discuss the matter here. \"We think this case comes clearly within the decision in 13 Wall., 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">I will, however, say for myself, that as an original' proposition, I would not hesitate to decide that the right to tax any particular piece of property eannot be made the subject of a perpetual exemption, binding as a contract, by one Legislature as against the power of a subsequent one. There are, in my judgment, many entirely satisfactory reasons why it cannot be. The essential elements of sovereignty necessary to the perpetuation of government cannot be made the subject of a permanent grant by the Legislature. If there is power to. exempt one piece of property from taxation forever, there is power to exempt all, and the existence of this power to this extent involves the destruction of the State. If there is any limitation upon the power, it must be an entire limitation resulting from the nature of the subject. This matter is, however, no longer an open question.- Judicial officers of a State must follow the repeated expression of opinion by the Supreme Court of the United States as to what is the obligation of a contract and what constitutes a contract within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The position was taken in argument, that the grant of the franchises and rights to the Pensacola and Georgia Eailroad Company, made by the Legislature, was in conflict with the Constitution operative at that time, (1853,) and hence that no right passed to the Atlantic and Gulf Eailroad Company. That Constitution provided that no act of incorporation granting exclusive privileges should be granted for a longer period than twenty years. Even\u2019 admitting that the act incorporating the Pensacola and Georgia Eailroad Company was an- act granting exclusive privileges within the meatiing of -this clause, (a question which we do not decide,) we can-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>pot see how this clause of that Constittution is a limitation upon the power of the Legislature of 1866, which granted these rights to the Atlantic and Gulf Eailroad Company. In 1866, another and different Constitution limited the power of the Legislature.. At that date, (1866,) the twenty years during which the Pensacola and Georgia Eailroad Company were to possess these rights had not expired. The right of exemption was then existing in the Pensacola and Georgia Eailroad Company. In that year, the Legislature authorized the sale of this property to the Atlantic and Gulf Company, with the then existing rights of the Pensacola and Georgia Eailroad Company ; and, for the purpose of operating this road, the act made that company a body politic and corporate in this State. The existence of the right of exemption in this, company is co-existent with its right to exercise corporate powers, and it cannot be claimed that this right has expired by virtue of any. limitation in the Constitution operative in 1866; as the limitation therein contained was twenty years. The Atlantic and Gulf Company did not derive its right to exercise corporate powers as to this road through the Pensacola and Georgia Eailroad Company. That right is the result of an express grant by the sovereign to it. The nature and kind of rights other than the right to be a corporation, which it acquired by the purchase, were to be ascertained by reference to the rights then existing in the Pensacola and Georgia Eailroad Company, but the limit in time, as to their exercise, must be found in the charter of the Atlantic and Gulf Company, or in the Constitution then operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">We havethus disposed of the questions in this case, so far as they involve the essential merits of this controversy. Our conclusion is,'.that any tax higher than one-h\u00e1lf of one per cent, upon the annual net income derived from this property cannot be sanctioned. This conclusion, however, does not authorize an entire reversal of the judgment of the Circuit Court upon this demurrer. The plaintiff nowhere alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>in its bill that the tax here levied <em>is more than one-half of one per cent, upon the annual net income derived as stated. </em>If the tax here levied <em>is not higher than this </em>sum, then it is authorized, and neither the Circuit Court nor this court can presume the existence of a fact not alleged in the bill. No-perpetual injunction should be awarded except upon full proof that the tax levied is in excess of the limitation fixed by law, and the burden of proof, as to this fact, is upon the-company, it being a fact peculiarly within its knowledge. In addition to this, if the proofs disclose any tax as due, it. will be a question whether the court should award a perpetual injunction as to the whole, or only as to the excess, or whether it will require the road to do equity before the equity which it asks will be granted.' This question, however, is not involved upon this demurrer, and upon it we express no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The judgment upon the demurrer is affirmed, in so far as the demurrer is sustained, and it-is reversed, in so far as it directs the bill to be dismissed. The case will be remanded, with directions to enter judgment sustaining the demurrer, with leave to amend upon the payment of all costs in the Circuit Court up to the date of the motion to amend; and there .will be judgment in this court against the appellant ior all costs of this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
