Where, pursuant to an understanding between the parlies, the appointment of one guardian is revoked and the appointment of another made, such proceeding cannot be called .in question collaterally. The court having jurisdiction of the subject matter, both the revocation and the appointment are valid ; nor^is it necessary in such proceedings to give the infant notice, the matter of guardianship being under the exclusive control of the court, the guardian being its officer, and the infant Staving no right to any particular guardian.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b31-12\">4.

The complaint alleged that Charles. Winters died on the first of October, A. D. 1858, leaving considerable estate and three children \u2014 Eme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>lia J., who was then three years old, Erie, who was two, and Bichard 0., who was eight months. That he left no widow. That Lawrence E. Bronnum administered on the estate, and upon a final settlement on November 1, 1855, there were assets amounting to $6,804.33, subject to distribution. That on the 23d of October, A. D. 1854, Simpson, the defendant, was appointed by the Probate Court of Escambia county guardian of the persons and estate of the plaintiffs, and on the first day of November, A. D. 1855, he received, as guardian, from Bronnum, as administrator, assets to the amount of $6,804.33. That, as such guardian, he obtained a decree in June, A. JO. 1855, authorizing the sale of the real estate of Ms wards. That such sale was had, and the sum of two thousand four hundred and fifty dollars was realized therefrom. u That on or about the first day of January, A. D. 1856, pursuant to an understanding between the defendant and Bronnum, the defendant applied for and obtained an order from the Probate Court of said county discharging him from his said guardianship, and the said Bronnum applied for and obtained an order appointing him guardian of the persons and estates of tlie said Emelia J.; Eric and Bicbard C., and thereupon the defendant turned over to the said Bronnum all the assets in his possession, or under liis control, belonging to Ms said wards, including tlie proceeds of tbeir real estate, which the defendant had converted into money, as aforesaid, amounting in the aggregate to $9,-424.87.\u201d That said Bronnum is a non-resident of this State. That he has utterly wasted and spent the entire estate of his said wards. That the sureties on Ms bond as guardian, which he executed when lie 'was substituted for the defendant, are, as well as the said Bronnum, insolvent; and that the defendant, Simpson, of all the parties connected with the substitution of the said Bronnum, is tlie only solvent and responsible party. That the income of their estate was sufficient to maintain them until they were sixteen years of age, after which they maintained themselves. That Emelia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>J. intermarried with Blake J. P. Gonzalez, and that he wapappointed guardian <em>ad litem </em>in this action of Eric and Richard C. Winters. That they were ignorant of their rights in the\u2019premises until after the close of the war, the records of the court having been buried during that time. That they have frequently applied to defendant to render an account of the assets, and to. pay the said Emelia J. her portion, which defendant has refused to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-5\">Plaintiffs pray a reference, and that defendant give au account of his guardianship ; that the income of the estate of the infants may be deemed an offset to their maintenance to the time they attained the age of sixteen. . That from that period an interest account may be made up, that defendant be adjudged to pay to Emelia the amount found to be due her, and to pay to a guardian of Eric and Richard C., to be aupointed by the court, the sums due them respectively.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-6\">To this complaint the defendant interposed a demurrer.

Court nor its Judge has supervisory jurisdiction in matters pertaining to the Probate Court, except on appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-7\">If the Circuit Court, by virtue of its equity powers, can exercise an assisting jurisdiction when properly invoked, in this complaint there is no equity-not properly cognizable by the Probate Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-8\">Is this \u201c a matter concerning orphans and their estate I\u201d Is Simpson, as respondents seem to claim, still their guardian, or are they without a guardian, and is it necessary and proper a guardian should be appointed, as they ask ? Do they, as wards, complain against- their guardian ? Is an ac- \u25a0 count required ? We see that the Probate Court which has taken jurisdiction over these matters \u201chas power to take cognizance of all matters concerning .orphans and their estates, to appoint guardians in cases where it appears necessary and proper, and to hear and determine all complaints of wards against guardians, and require of them, from time to time, an account of the profits and disbursements of the estates,\u201d &amp;c. Bush\u2019s Digest, 354. The Circuit Court cannot then entertain jurisdiction as a \u201c suit in equity,\u201d for there is complete remedy in Probate Court; nor as a court of concurrent-jurisdiction can it wrest the jurisdiction from the Probate Court. Story\u2019s Eq. PL, \u00a7 490.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-9\">But does the Circuit Court, under our constitution and laws, share with the County Court as a Court of Surrogate, Ordinary, Probate and Orphan\u2019s Court, the powers expressly and fully granted the latter ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-10\">Our constitution gives it full surrogate and probate powers, only subject to appeal; and Sec. 2, Art. 15, of the constitution, and tli'e 16th Sec. of Act of 1868, give it all the powers that were prescribed by law as the powers of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>J udges of Probate, and imposed upon it all the duties, <em>except </em>where, <em>by the constiticUon, imposed upon other officers.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-5\">Then the laws in force at the adoption of the constitution define the powers and duties of that court, and it certainly <em>xhares </em>none of them with the Circuit Court or its Judge, for such of them, if any, as by the constitution are imposed upon that officer, are, by the act of the Legislature, excepted and taken from that court. Such powers and duties as are left to it would seem then to belong to it exclusive of all other officers or courts, subject only to appeal. So grant of \u201coriginal jurisdiction in all cases in equity\u201d cannot give concurrent powers \u2014 if it gives to one it takes from the other. That, at most, gives chancery powers, and however any of these powers may have been considered in the practice of tlie English courts, in this State they had become statute powers and could not be embraced in general grant of equity powers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-6\">It may be well to note, that even in England guardianship was not embraced in general equity jurisdiction, but was limited to the Chancellor sitting in chancery. 2 Story\u2019s Eq., \u00a7 1330. As by our laws it seems to be limited to the Judge of County Court sitting as Probate Judge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-7\">In the absence of any adjudication by this court upon the \u2022character of the jurisdiction of the two courts, we may look to the adjudications in other States having courts organized like ours, and with constitutions and laws not greatly dissimilar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-8\">Thus in Mississippi the Supreme Court hold: \u201c Our Probate Courts are established and regulated by our constitution and laws, and their jurisdiction is to be determined by these and not by the practice of the English courts. That jurisdiction was intended by our constitution to be full and ample, and has uniformly been held by this court to be in the main exclusive.\u201d 35 Miss., (6 George,) 428.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-9\">So in Oregon. The Supreme Court say, <em>\u201c </em>The County Court of Oregon is to be regarded in probate proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>as of superior jurisdiction, it being a court of record, deriving its power as a Probate Court from the constitution.\u201d 3 Oregon., 380. And \u201cthe burden of showing that the court has not acquired jurisdiction is on the party who disputes it.\u201d . Ib.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-5\">\u201c The Probate Courts of North Carolina have <em>exclusive original jurisdiction of a proceeding Toy a ward against his guardian for a settlement of the latter\u2019s accounts. </em>But they have no jurisdiction of a suit on a guardianship bond.\u201d 65 N. C., 110; ib. 186.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-6\">So in Pennsylvania. \u201c Under the act prescribing the powers and jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court, that court alone has jurisdiction to settle the accounts of guardians <em>as Toe-tween them and their wards.\u201d </em>62 Pa. St., 436; ib. 166.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-7\">The Supreme Court of New Jersey hold: \u201c This court has no power to remove an executor; that power belongs exclusively to the orphans\u2019 court.\u201d 4 Green, (N. J.,) 159.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-8\">So in Michigan. \u201c The Court of Chancery in Michigan has no power to remove an administrator, the Probate Court having exclusive jurisdiction of the matter.\u201d 22 Mich., 288.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-9\">In Texas, where a guardian\u2019s sale of two slaves was reported to and confirmed by the County Court, and 'the' wards instituted against a subsequent purchaser a suit in the district court alleging ownership, wrongful detention, &amp;c., without making the guardian a party, pending which he settled his account and was discharged, it -was <em>held </em>that the plaintiff\u2019s remedy was in the County Court. 25 Texas, 783.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-10\">So in Arkansas. \u201c The Circuit Court, sitting in chancery, has no right to -take- from the Probate Court the determination of an administrator\u2019s responsibility upon the assets of the estateand its decree was reversed for want of jurisdiction. 23 Ark., 93.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-11\">In South Carolina, \u201c equity has no jurisdiction in case of the fraudulent destruction of a will, whether of real or personal estate; the parties interested under it must seek relief in a Court of-Probate.\u201d 12 Rich. (S. C.) Eq., 196.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>.In Rhode Island, \u201c the Supreme Court will not appoint a guardian after reversing a decree of the Court of Probate dismissing an application for the appointment of guardian, but will remand the case- to the Court of Probate for that purpose.\u201d 2 R. I., 153.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-5\">In Yermont, \u201cthe Probate Court has exclusive jurisdiction, in the first instance, of the settlement of guardians\u2019 accounts.\u201d 23 Vt., (8 Wash.) 306.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-6\">And \u201c entire and exclusive jurisdiction of the settlement of estates, to the same extent that jurisdiction of matters of contract or tort, is given to the common law courts. The court of chancery has not concurrent jurisdiction in this respect with the probate court, and will not interfere in the settlement of estates except to aid the jurisdiction of the probate court in those points only wherein its functions and powers are inadequate to the purposes of perfect justice, and then in the same degree and for the same reason that it interferes in other cases where the principal jurisdiction is in the courts of common law.\u201d 22 Vt., (7 Wash.) 50.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-7\">\u201c Claims against an administrator, for money and property of the estate which have come into his hands during the administration, are exclusively within the jurisdiction \u25a0of the probate court.\u201d Ib.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-8\">\u2022In some of the States concurrent jurisdiction in the matters usually pertaining to probate courts is expressly given to other courts, more commonly in those States yrhere there are separate courts of equity, possessing, in addition to general equity jurisdiction, powers specially defined by statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-9\">Thus in Wisconsin, by statute, there exists concurrent jurisdiction ; so in some matters in Alabama ; while in New York the Chancellor, seemed, under the statutes of that State, to have not merely concurrent but supervisory jurisdiction. That Chancellors Kent and Walworth, in their decisions in the cases of Andrews, 1 John. Ch., 99 ; in Matter of .Nicoll, ib., 25 ; ex parte Crumb, 2 ib., 139, and the case of Dyer, 5-Paige, 531, did not base their claim to such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>superintending power upon their general equity jurisdiction alone, but upon the peculiar statutes of the State, appears from their reference to the statutes. See notes a, <em>b, </em>2 Kent\u2019s Com.,-227.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-5\">The New York decisions seem the foundation of the doctrine so far as it has prevailed in this country of the supervising power of the Chancellor in matters of guardianship. Most of the States have limited that supervision to cases of appeal; so, I submit, has our own State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-6\">Grant the Circuit Court\u2019s jurisdiction ; admit as well the law as the facts asserted in the complaint; let plaintiffs have <em>all </em>they pray for, and to what an absurdity, to'say nothing of conflict, it would lead! Bronnum would be guardian by virtue of his letters of guardianship from the Probate Court; Simpson would be guardian by election of the plaintiffs, and there would be a third appointed by the Circuit Court. Such would be the result of allowing the Circuit Court any other than appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-7\">2. The Code (Sec. 201) prescribes that <em>an issue of law must be tried by the </em>court, unless it be referred. See Blackstone\u2019s and Bouvier\u2019s definition of court. Sec. 202 prescribes how other issues than those named in Sec. 201 may be tried.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-8\">Even if this is one of those cases in which, prior to the Code, the Judge, sitting as chancellor, might have passed final decree in vacation, the amendment, Chap. 1,832, Sec. 7, Acts of 1871, is an amendment of Sec. 202, and must be confined to other issues than those enumerated in Sec. 201, and could only apply to issues in this action other than an issue of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-9\">3. 'Granting that the Circuit Court had jurisdiction, and the issue of law was properly tried by a Judge at Chambers, the demurrer should have been sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-10\">If the orders of the Probate Court can be avoided, the complaint shows no right of action against defendant. It does not surcharge and falsify his accounts, but, on the contrary, shows he \u201c paid, over all the assets in his possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>or under his control,\u201d as by the court he was ordered to do, for \u201c an order of court removing a guardian and appointing a successor is equivalent to an order to pay over the money in his hands to his successor,\u201d (9 Miss., 227,) shows he paid to the party authorized to receive, viz: the party holding grant of guardianship from the Probate Court of the county in which were the estate and persons of the plaintiffs, then\u2019 not of age to choose a guardian, which payment, and the receipt of it by plaintiffs\u2019 guardian, (and not the order of court discharging him from the guardianship,) discharged defendant from liability. Thomp. Dig., 201, \u00a7 6. Even if plaintiffs can, after seventeen years living under their guardian, and acquiescing in all his acts, elect to avoid orders of a court, \u201c entered of record, and not subsequently reveised or set aside,\u201d and that too while the}7 are still minors. For as held by Holt, C. J., in Blackborough vs. Davis, 1 P. Wms., 43, \u201c the grant, though made contrary to the statute, is not void but voidable, and acts done under it before it is actually avoided will be valid.\u201d So also in Hovenden on Fraud, 466 : <em>\u201c </em>If the grant has been made irregularly or obtained by fraud or surprise.\u201d In LeBaron <em>&amp; </em>Colquitt vs. Fauntleroy, 2 Fla., 298, this court, in a case analogous to this, adopted the following language of Ashurst, J.: \u201cI am of opinion that the plaintiff has no right to call on the defendant to pay this money a second time, which was paid to a person who liad at that time a legal authority to receive it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-5\">4. But the orders of the Probate Court can neither be avoided nor inquired into in this collateral proceeding. That can only be done by the court that rendered them, or by appeal therefrom. 2 Wallace, S. C., 210; 3 Wallace, S. C., 396; 2 Howard, 319; 2 Peters, S. C., 157, 165, 169 ; 3 Peters, 193, 202, 207; 2 Green, on Ev., Redfield\u2019s Ed., note to \u00a7 339; 4 McLean, 442; 13 Fla., 309; 14 Fla., 162-174; 11 Ala., 461-465 ; 11 Ill., 625-633.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-6\">It is seen this court\u2019s decision in Hart vs. Bostwick is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\u25a0sustained by all the authorities, and is conclusive of the whole ease, and upon that appellant might safely rest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-5\">5. If the orders of the Probate Court can be inquired into in this proceeding, the complaint does not state facts sufficient to show them invalid. Authorities above cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-6\">It does, however, state facts sufficient to show the jurisdiction of the Probate Court over the subject matter, the guardianship, and the person removed, and that the court had been called upon to exercise its jurisdiction. 2 Howard, 533; 2 Wallace, 216 ; 7 Ala., 864, and other cases cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-7\">It does noPshow that defendant\u2019s appointment, being a temporary one to represent the estate in the settlement of administrator\u2019s accounts, had not expired by limitation at the time of, his discharge.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-8\">It does not sliow that the removal of one and appointment of another guardian was not for the best interest of the infants ; that Bronnum was not, as their nearest relative, entitled to the office rather than Simpson, a stranger.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-9\">But consider these orders upon respondents own grounds. In the trial below they rested their case upon two main propositions:</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-10\">1.

Dig., 225, \u00a7 2,) and to have wrongly construed; Properly construed, it is another statute, giving power to \"displace, as the court displaced defendant. It requires the Judge of Probate, 1st, to hear and determine all complaints of wards against guardians ; 2d, to require of them counter security, <em>when necessary, </em>(not when the wards complain;) 3d, displace them (not upon complaint of wards,) but when <em>to them </em>it may seem equitable and right. This statute, instead of restricting, power, places the whole subject matter of guardianship within the discretion of the Court of Probate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-8\">Indeed it would seein self-evident that court\u2019s power to displace a guardian against his will, included power to do so with-his assent.

So if court\u2019s power is shown, it is conclusive, for \u201c whether its decision be correct or otherwise, its judgment, until re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>versed, is binding on every other court.\u201d 2 How., 343, and authorities cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-5\">But plaintiffs objected to the validity of these orders, because the infants were not served with process and represented by guardian <em>ad litem. </em>This objection, as indeed are all the others, as well as the argument and authorities presented in behalf of plaintiffs, is predicated upon the hypothesis that the infants were necessary parties to these orders, to the determination by the court as to who should and who should not be guardian. The complaint does not show that. It shows they were respectively five, four and three years old, and could neither by themselves, nor by others, have any voice in the determination of a matter that was absolutely and exclusively within the discretion of the Judge of Probate. 33 Ala., 214 ; 1 Haywood, N. C., 303 ; 2 ib., 336 ; 1 Murphy, 38, 227, 231; 2 ib., 122; 11 Iredell L., 36; 22 Barb., N.

To this office, it does not appear these plaintiffs had the shadow of a claim. The complaint shows no parties claiming a right to the office \"other than Simpson and Bronnum ; Simpson, by reason of an appointment, (which may have been an \u201cimprovident one,\u201d and thus revocable by the Judge of Probate, without statute power \u2014 1 ^Villiams on Exec., 484, note 2) \u2014 and Bronnum by reason of his being the nearest relative of the infants; which fact, though it does not affirmatively appear from the pleadings, the court may infer,-from his having ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>tained the grant of administration. (2 Phil. on Ev. 85.) If, then, we apply the principles applicable to proceedings <em>in personam </em>to these orders, and adopt Bouvier\u2019s definition of parties, and Story\u2019s doctrine as to necessary parties, there were before the court all the \u201c parties directly interested in the subject of the suit,\u201d viz: the office of guardian. A creditor or a debtor of the estate has, in proportion to his credit or debt, as much interest in the estate, and is as necessary a party to, and might as reasonably be permitted to impeach these orders, as the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-5\">But the courts of England and America, and a long and uniform practice, have established a' different principle, as applicable to sentences or decrees of Ecclesiastical Courts in. England, and of courts coming in place of them in this country, whether called Court of Surrogate, Judge of Probate, Orphans\u2019 Court or Ordinary. And it is this : When those sentences or decrees are upon, a subject matter within their jurisdiction, and confer .upon or deprive a person of a <em>status </em>or legal character, they are in the nature of proceedings <em>in rem, </em>and have a conclusive .effect even with respect to persons who are not parties to the proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-6\">2 Phil. on Ev., 4 Amer.

Ilis Lordship said : \u201cNow, if this agreement had been intended to bind-the rights'of the legatees, they ought to have been parties to it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-7\">That the understanding in Dojde vs. Blake was evidenced by deed, and here by the admission of the party, makes no difference.

On the 1st November, 1855, appellant received the personal estate from Bronnum ; on the 27th December, 1855, he converted the realty into money ; on or about the 1st January, 1856, lie resigned the guardianship; about the same time Bronnum was appointed guardian ; and thereupon appellant returned to Bronnum not only what he had received from him on 1st November, but also the proceeds of the realty which he had converted into money on the 27th of December.</p>\n<p data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-9\">Sixth.

Appellant not only formally accepted the office of guardian, but also took possession of the whole estate and converted the realty into money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-6\">The executors had an agreement with Horan that they were to renounce, and he was to be appointed administrator. Appellant had an understanding with Bronnum that the one was to resign and the other was to procure the appointment of guardian.</p>\n<p data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-7\">The executors did renounce, and Horan was duly appointed administrator <em>own test. cm. </em>by the prerogative court. Appellant resigned and Bronnum was appointed guardian b}' the Probate Judge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-8\">The executors put Horan in the possession of the estate.

Appellant had no such indication of confidence on the part of the father of the appellees in Bronnum to plead for his own confidence, if any he had.</p>\n<p data-order=\"178\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-11\">The executors pressed the consideration that they had intermeddled with the estate so far only as in their judgment was necessary to protect that part of the testator\u2019s family \u201c which appeared to be most unprotected.\u201d In this case no one\u2019s interest except appellant\u2019s and Bronnum\u2019s seems to have been considered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Horan wasted the estate and. became insolvent, and so did Bronnum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-5\">The legatees would have lost tlieir legacies had they, been, confined to their remedy against Horan; and so will 'theappellees lose their estate if it must be recovered, if at all, from Bronnum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"181\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-6\">This case involves a breach of trust, and therefore it falls within the original equity jurisdiction bestowed on the Circuit Court by the Constitutions of 1845-68.</p>\n<p data-order=\"182\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-7\">A Court of Chancery will interfere for the protection of the rights of infants against the acts of their guardians as trustees. 1 P.

The estate of three infants-is illegally placed by their guardian in the hands of a man who wastes it; they are in consequence compelled to rely on their own labor for support at the age of sixteen; they are kept in ignorance of their rights until after one is married and the others are on the verge of manhood; they learn their rights at last, not from their guardian, but from mouldy records that had been buried for four long years; when they call on their guardian for an account of his long-concealed trust, he bids them to seek redress against the faithless bankrupt in whose hands he had placed their estate; when the law calls the guardian to account, he does not deign to explain any one of the remarkable facts that require explanation; the receipt by the guardian of the personal estate from Bronnum, and its return to him in sixty days, the conversion of the real estate into money by the guardian at a time when he must have already formed the design of resigning his trust, the payment over of the purchase money to Bronnum only a few days after it was received by the guardian, the ignorance in which the guardian permitted the wards to remain of their rights. But admitting all the facts, with all the inferences fairly deducible from them, with all the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>suspicions they may excite, he relies exclusively for his defence on the <em>ex parte </em>orders obtained from the Probate Judge, when the infants were in their swaddlings, one by himself and the other by his agent, with his concurrence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"184\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-5\">As Lord Eldon said in Conyngham vs. Conyngham, 1 Ves., 322, \u201cA court of justice must wink extremely hard nqt to see the plaintiff\u2019s clear right.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"185\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-6\">To the objection made by the amended demurrer, that Bronnum is not a party to the action, the answer is obvious. If it be true, that the orders of th\u00e9 county court discharging appellant and appointing Bronnum were void, it follows logically that appellant\u2019s guardianship has been uninterrupted ; that Bronnum has never stood in the relation of guardian to the appellees; that appellants most account with them for what he received as their guardian, and that'Bronnum is accountable to appellant; but appellant cannot require the appellees to make this action a means of enforcing his rights against Bronnum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"186\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-7\">Again; although the complaint shows that Bronnum is a non-resident, it fails to state- any of the other circumstances required to bring the case within some one of the five classes of cases in which a party can be made by publication.

Under the Code a complaint is the means through which both the common law and chancery powers of the Circuit Court may be invoked, and the Circuit Court is- a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>having general original jurisdiction in both common law and equity causes.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai-\">In this case Simpson, as guardian of these infants, had in his control nine thousand four hundred and seventy-four dollars. Pursuant to an understanding between Bronnurn and himself, he applied for and obtained an order discharging him from his guardianship, and Bronnurn applied for and obtained an order appointing him guardian, and thereupon Simpson turned over to him the amount above named. Bronnurn subsequently wasted the estate. Plaintiffs now seek to recover this sum of Simpson, upon the ground that these proceedings of the probate court are void; that it was not in the power of the probate court to. discharge Simpson; and that if it was within its power to discharge him as guardian, its action was void as to them, they having been given no notice of the application for discharge. It is thus-seen that the general question arising upon this demurrer is whether Simpson was, either in law or equity, liable for this sum; and if he was so liable, plaintiffs sought a judgment for that sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Is the jurisdiction of the county court adequate, to the granting of such a judgment and its enforcement? The county court lias no such power. Its jurisdiction, in strictly common law cases, is limited to \u201ccases where the amount in controversy does not exceed three hundred dollars.\u201d It cannot hear and determine a suit arising out of the relation of guardian and ward, and enter a judgment or decree for the sum claimed in this action. The county court has full power to call a guardian to an account, and to exercise other powers, either surrogate or probate in their character, appertaining to the infant and his person and estate. These powers, however, do not extend to jurisdiction in an action upon a guardian\u2019s bond for a sum over three hundred dollars; nor would it have jurisdiction to en,ter a decree for the sum claimed in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The case presented is nothing more than a matter of ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>counting between guardian and ward, in which the sum claimed is in excess of the ordinary civil jurisdiction of the county court, and to the recovery of which the jurisdiction of a court of equity or common law is appropriate, according to the peculiar nature of the facts, that is, whether they are legal or equitable, which .constitute the basis of the claim. The Circuit Court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action. -</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The second error assigned is that the judge could not en,ter this order in vacation. This being one of those cases in which, prior to the Code, the Judge of the Circuit Court could have acted in vacation, he is, by the amendments of the Code, now authorized to act: out of term. There is an apparent conflict between the provisions of Section 201 of the Code and Section 202, as amended, (Chap. 1,832, Sec. <em>1,) </em>but this was the evident intention of the Legislature, and if any effect is given to the amendment, it must go to this extent, or have no operation at law' to accomplish the effect desired by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Thus disposing of these preliminary questions which relate to general jurisdiction over the subject of the action, and the regularity of its exercise as to method, we reach the merits of this controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Their consideration is involved in the determination of the third error assigned, which is that the judgment upon the demurrer should have been for the defendant, for the reason that the complaint does not set forth facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Appellant insists, that after the appointment of Bronnum as guardian, his receipt was a discharge of Simpson\u2019s liability, while appellees maintain that the Judge of Probate could not, under the Constitution then in force, make the order removing Simpson from the guardianship; that the constitutional direction to the Legislature conferred no, power upon the Legislature to vest such jurisdiction in the Judge of Probate; that no such jurisdiction was conferred by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Legislature; 'that if it was, such jurisdiction was in this case exercised without notice to these infants, and is for that reason void as to them, and that the facts' attending the attempted removal of the one and appointment- of the other are such as render Simpson still liable for these funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">These proceedings in the probate court were had under the Constitution of 1839, and the legislation thereunder, and it is to these we must'look to determine their validity. The argument is, that the power to remove a guardian was under this Constitution an exclusive power of the court of chancery; that such was the case in England, and that such was the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Under this Constitution it was provided that u the judicial power of this State, both as to matters of law and equity, shall be vested in a Supreme Court, Courts of Chancery, Circuit Courts, and Justices of the Peace,\u201d and until a separate court of chancery was orgagized, the Judges of the Circuit Courts were to exercise such chancery jurisdiction. Eollowing the general distribution of judicial power, Section 9 of the same article directed that \u201c the General Assembly shall provide by law for the appointment in each county of an officer to'take probate of wills, to grant letters testamentary, of administration and guardianship, to attend to the settlement of estates of decedents and of minors, and to discharge the duties usually appertaining to courts of ordinary, subject to the direction and supervision of the courts of chancery as may be provided by law.\u201d These clauses must be construed together, with reference to the manifest purpose of the Legislature, and that purpose must be determined by the nature of the changes which they worked in the antecedent system, and the- objects which they intended to accomplish. We cannot accept the argument that because the power to remove was an exclusive chancery power in England, that such was the case here under the American system, a system in which many of the powers belonging exclusively to courts of chancery in England are here oonfi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>ded to other courts*. The constitution in express terms directs that this officer shall have jurisdiction in the matter of appointing guardians and the settlement of the estates of minors. Under the English system, the settlement of the estate, as far as its management was concerned, and the appointment of a general guardian, were exclusive chancery powers, and eyen there the chancellor does not attempt to .deal with the inheritance of infants without the aid of an act of parliament. 1 Malloy, <em>525 </em>; 6 Beav., 97. There was in England no such thing as a distinct surrogate\u2019s court of court of ordinary, or of probate, and what were called county courts, while their jurisdiction, before the courts at Westminster were erected, was very extensive, yet they have had no such powers since that time, if they did before ; and while the ecclesiastical courts have since that'time exercised some of the powers which in this country belong to the jurisdiction of what in American law are called courts of ordinary, surrogate\u2019s courts, or probate courts, such as taking proof of wills, granting letters testamentary and of administration, &lt;fcc., still they had not in the matter of guardianship any power beyond the appointment- of a guardian <em>ad </em>litem,, a power incident to any jurisdiction where an infant\u2019s interest can become the subject of judicial investigation'. The books disclose but one case in which such power was exercised by them. In that case, Lord Hardwicke reprobated it as a presumption in the ecclesiastical court to appoint a guardian of the person and estate, declared their appointment of such guardian to be an interference with his power as chancellor, and recommended the Attorney-General to resort to a <em>quo warranto </em>to try the question. We thus see that the power to appoint a general guardian of the person and estate belonged exclusively to the chancellor in England. The power <em>to settle the estates of minors' 'we.?, </em>equally a chancery power, and it must be-noted that this is a greater power than the power <em>to settle </em>the account <em>of a guardian, </em>from which appellees insist no power to remove him can be implied, but of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>this we say more hereafter. We thus see that every power directed to be granted by the Constitution as to the matter of guardianship, was an exclusive chancery power in England, and that there was no court in the English system corresponding in its functions and relative powers to the courts of ordinary or of probate in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">What powers followed the grant embraced in the words, \u201c and to discharge the duties usually appertaining to courts of ordinary,\u201d so far as concerned the matter of guardianship ? These powers, it is evident, must be ascertained by reference to the powers of such courts in the United States, as there was no such court as a <em>court of ordinary </em>known to the English system. The term, ordinary, there signified every official of the bishop or other ecclesiastical judge having official power, and at common law it signified him who hath ordinary or immediate jurisdiction in causes ecclesiastical. There are comparatively but few courts known as courts of ordinary in the United States. We have examined the laws of all the States within our reach. We find but one State in which there is a \u201c court of ordinary.\u201d We find ten in which there are \u201c courts of probate,\u201d two in which there are \u201c orphans\u2019 courts,\u201d three in which there are \u201c county courts,\u201d one in which there is a court of \u201c common pleas.\u201d The term, \u201c courts of ordinary,\u201d in the Constitution, cannot be interpreted with reference exclusively to courts of that particular name. If, however, such was the case, the power to remove a guardian, to revoke his appointment, is possessed by that court. These words indicate \u201c a class of duties which the Constitution provided should be imposed by the Legislature on the officer designated, these duties to be of a like character with those imposed by other States \u201d upon the courts which, in their several systems, had the power of appointing guardians and the general supervision of their accounts. This officer was not only to be invested with the general and particular powers named in the Constitution, but the Legislature was to impose such duties as usually ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>pertained to those courts in other States which occupied in their system the same relative position which the probate court was to have in ours. And, in the matter o\u00ed guardiam ship, it made no difference whether these powers were such as belonged exclusively to the .court of chancery in England. All general power over the guardian in England being-of that character, such a construction would deny a chancery power, notwithstanding it was a power usually appertaining to courts of ordinary, and would exclude every other power, except that of appointment and settlement of accounts.' This is not a proper construction, as the Constitution expressly directed that the Legislature'should impose the duties usually performed by such courts without any such exception. These differences, in the American and English systems, are fundamental in their character, and the clear inference is, that those who made them intended great changes. These changes, too, are'not restricted alone to the matter of jurisdiction, but extend also to the.method of its exercise. binder the English system, the chancellor had a general discretion and control, and the guardian was not bound by any statute or act of parliament to render his accounts at stated periods, while here, fixed periods were indicated for his' accounting. Again, all the powers which the Legislature was to confer were to be powers, in the exercise of which this officer waste be sirbject to the direction and supervision of the court of chancery, and a court of chancery could not perform a more appropriate function than supervise an inferior officer invested with powers of a like description as those possessed by itself; while it would be an inappropriate function- to supervise the exercise of powers of a different character. It would be an anomaly for a court of chancery to supervise or direct a court exercising common law powers. Indeed, if such authority was given to it, it would cease to be a court confined to chancery jurisdiction, and become court exercising powers of each character, and thus strictly both a court of chancery and common law. The fact that the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>moval from the place of guardian was in England a power confided alone to the chancellor, is not a reason why such a power might not, in perfect accordance with the Constitution, be invested by the Legislature in this officer. The verse, we think, is the proper view. The framers of this Constitution expected, directed and intended that the Legislature should by law give this officer <em>just such powers, </em>to be exercised undpr the general control of the chancellor. This officer was to be an aid and auxiliary to that court, and, in the matter of guardianship, was to be invested with such power as would enable him to control the guardian and project the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">Is the power to remove or displace a guardian of like char.-aeter with the powers conferred by other States on their courts of ordinary, or is it a particular power following the grant of authority to settle the estate of the infant <em>% </em>We have \"exhausted the material for examination at our command, and without a single exception these courts have the power to remove or displace a guardian from his office- or place before its termination, according to the letter of his appointment. In many of the States, they have control over them similar to that exercised by the court of chancery in England, and sometimes the jurisdiction is exclusive.

We deem it unnecessary to say anything as to the power to settle the estates of infants, in view of this conclusion, as it disposes of the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We next inquire, has this power of revocation of appointment and displacement been conferred by the Legislature ?</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">'In accordance with the direction of the Constitution, the Legislature, at its first session, passed <em>\u201c </em>an act to organize the courts of probate for the State of Florida.\u201d After fixing the method of appointment and the term of office of the officer, it was enacted that it should be his \u201c duty to take probate of wills, to grant letters testamentary, of administration and guardianship, to attend to the settlement of estates of deceased persons, and of minors, and to discharge the duties usually pertaining to courts of ordinary; and an appeal shall lie from any final order or decision of the said Judge-of Probate to the Circuit Court of the proper county in like manner as the same is now authorized from the decisions Of the County Courts to the Superior Courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The act further provided \u201c that the Judges of Probate hereby authorized to be appointed, shall have all the powers and shall perform all the duties heretofore prescribed by law as the powers and duties of Judges of the County Courts, when acting as courts of ordinary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">It further provided \u201c that every Judge of Probate shall record in a book or books, to be kept for that purpose, distinct \u25a0 and at full length all wills, testaments and codicils proved before him, and the proof thereof, all letters testamentary and of administration, all accounts of executors and administrators settled before him, all orders and decrees made by him in relation to such estates, the appointment of guardians and the revocation of such appointment, the accounts rendered by guardians and settled by him, orders and decrees for the sale of minors\u2019 real estate, all orders and decrees for the assignment or admeasurement of dower, and all other orders and decrees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Under the legislation conferring powers upon the county \u25a0courts, it was provided that \u201c the county courts shall hear and determine all complaints of wards against guardians, require of them counter security, when necessary, displace them, or make such orders as to them may seem equitable, 'and right relating to the estate.\u201d Sec. 1 of Act Nov. 20, 1828, Duval, 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The 8th section of an act approved February 17, 1833, Duval, 276, provided \u201c that the Judge of each County Court shall have power either in open court or in vacation to take the probate of wills, grant and revoke letters testamentary ,a.nd letters of administration, appoint and displace guardians of infants, orphans, idiots, lunatics and persons <em>non compos mentis\u201d </em>* * * * . * *</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Section 50 of the act of November 20, 1828, enacted, provides \u201cthat the Judges of the several County Courts of this territory shall have power to take cognizance of all matters concerning orphans and their estates, and to appoint guardians in cases where it appears necessary and proper, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>shall take good security of all guardians appointed by them' for the estate of orphans committed to them.\u201d * *</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Under these statutes the Judge of Probate was invested with a very ext\u00e9nsive jurisdiction. We have already seen that the power to remove or displace a guardian is such a power as usually appertains to courts of ordinary in the sense that these words are used in the Constitution, and the same is true of the power conferred by these words in the act of tlpe Legislature organizing the probate court. Under the first section of the act of November 20, 1828, it is made his duty to hear and determine all complaints of wards. He is invested with the general pow\u00e9r to require of them counter security whenever he deems it necessary, and he has the general power to displace them, as well as to make such orders relating to the estate as to him may seem equitable and just. It was insisted in the argument that the'effect of this section was to restrict this power of displacement to those cases only in which the ward complains of the guardian. It was not the purpose of the Legislature thus to restrict the court. Such a restriction would be inconsistent with the general tenor of the whole of this legislation. Theinfantis,b3rlaw&gt; deemed incapable of attending to his own concerns, and it would be strange indeed if the j&gt;ower of the court, which has charge of his interests, could be invoked in this important matter only when one legally deemed incapable of attending to his own concerns should call for the exercise of such protection. The guardian of an infant occupies a position of power and control, both as to his person and estate, and it is against this power and influence that the infant needs protection. Strange indeed would be that law which, while it deemed one incapable of protecting himself and placed him in the control of another, still restricted the power of a court to which his general interest was confided, in extending this protection against such power to those eases only in which this incompetent person should act. The proper grammatical construction of this section vests a <em>gone</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>ral power'to displace, and such, power is .entirely consistent with the general policy of the legislation upon the subject. Section 50 of the same act invests the Judge of Probate with power to take cognizance of all matters concerning orphans and their estates, and to appoint guardians. The 8th section of the act of February 17, 1833, invests him, in general terms, without any restriction, with the power to appoint and displace guardians of infants. The Legislature, deeming it essential that this officer should preserve a record of his acts under these powers, required of him to make a record of all appointments of guardians, and the revocation of such appointments, thus 'showing that the Legislature conceived that he had the power, under this legislation, to revoke such appointment. It should be a plain case to justify us in giving a construction to a statute inconsistent with the clear legislative interpretation of its own action.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">A brief examination of the cases cited from New York will show the very great difference between those cases and this. Under the Constitution of New York, no power was conferred upon a surrogate. The Legislature was not directed to invest any officer with powers of the nature mentioned in the Constitution of Florida, and the chancery jurisdiction was invested in other courts under the letter of the organic law. Under the legislation of that State, there was no general grant of power, from which this power to revoke an appointment of guardian could be implied or result. Ilis jurisdiction to remove was restricted by the Legislature in this language : \u201c On the application of any ward, or of any relation in his behalf, or of the surety of a guardian, to the surrogate who appointed any guardian, complaining of the ineompetency of such guardian, or of his wasting the real or personal estate of his ward, or of any misconduct in relation to his duties as guardian, the surrogate, upon being satisfied by proof of the probable truth of such complaint, shall issue a citation.to.such guardian.\u201d The act further provides that if, upon the trial, he is satisfied of the incompetency or mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>conduct of such guardian, he may, by an order, remove the guardian from his trust, and, upon such removal being made, the surrogate may proceed and appoint a new guardian. Chancellor Kent held that under this statute the surrogate had no general jurisdiction over a guardian appointed by him as trustee, that power remaining in the court of chancery. (1 John., 99.) So Chancellor Walworth held, (5 Paige, 536,) that this statute gave jurisdiction to a suiTogate to remove a guardian appointed by him, (the surrogate,) for ihcompetenev or misconduct, but he had no jurisdiction to remove a guardian appointed by the court of chancery, or to compel him to account either before or after such removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">This was the point involved. In his opinion, however, the chancellor went further and remarked : \u201c The surrogate has no authority to. call any guardian to account, or to discharge or remove a guardian, except in the particular cases specified.in the statute, the surrogate, in this respect, taking no incidental power or constructive authority by implication which is not expressly given .by statute.\u201d Looking to the New York statute, it is apparent that no other conclusion could have been reached. Looking to the Constitution and statutes of New'York and Florida, it is equally apparent that the powers conferred upon the surrogate in the one State and the Judge of Probate in the other, are not at all similar, arid that the cases in New York are not authorities by which to measure the power of the Judge of Probate in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The probate court having tlie power to revoke the appointment of Simpson, and thus displace him from the place of guardian, the next qu\u00e9stion presented for our consideration is, was it necessary to the validity of this order that the wards should have been given notice <em>% </em>It is insisted that they were entitled to notice upon the broad ground that such an order was one affecting their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">. \u25a0 It is unquestionably .true, as a general proposition, that, no person can be deprived of his life, liberty, or property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>without due process of law, and also that this involves notice. It is, however, clearly settled that no ward has a right to a particular guardian, and that guardianship is an office or place under the sole and exclusive charge.' of the courts having jurisdiction over the general subject qf the custody of infants. The chancellor or court having general power of revocation, is entrusted with the management of the estate, subject to such regulations as are j&gt;reseribed by law. In England the jurisdiction, so far as the appointment was concerned, was exercised in a snmmary manner upon petition, and there are cases in the United States holding expressly that it is no objection to the validity of an appointment that the infant was not made a party. (33 Ala. 221; 1 Ala. 388 ; 2 Doug. 434 ; 1 Hay. 303 ; 39 Ala. 150; 7 M. and W. 409 ; 7 Ves., Jr., 348, 381.) The matter of the appointment of a guardian certainly affects the interest of the infant as much as the removal. The case from 1 John. Ch\u2019y, cited by appellee, sustains this view as to the power of removal. There the ward had arrived at \u2022 the age of fourteen, and sought to remove the guardian. Chancellor Kent said : \u201c This court has the care and protection of infants during their minority, and they have not, nor ought to have, any such power in regard to guardians appointed by this court.\u201d See also 1 Murphy, 227. It is the practice in many of the States for this action to be taken at the instance of some relative of the infant. Baron Alderson, in the case above cited, says, that \u201c in all cases where a party cannot sue for hiinself, the court employs a <em>proohein comA </em>as its officer to conduct the suit for him, and no appointment or subsequent confirmation by the party is necessary. It is in fact almost the same thing as appointing an attorney ; the law, if we may so speak, appoints an attorney to act in behalf o\u00ed the infant.\u201d As a matter of course, there is, in many respects, a difference between the powers and duties of a <em>prochein ami </em>and that of a general guardian, and the case is not precisely this case. The general guardian, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the <em>proehein </em>ami, are, however, both officers of the court, and the infant has, as against the power and discretion of the chancellor, no more power in the one case than in the other. . In the case of Ripton vs. Hall, 1 Stewart, 166, the complaint was filed by a person other than the infant, and the guardian was removed. The court remark, \u201c as the statute prescribes no particular mode of proceeding, (and that is the case in Florida,) nothing more is necessary to appear of record than that the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the controversy, that the guardian had an opportunity of being heard, and has been removed for good and sufficient cause.\u201d The power of removal there was limited to cases where good and sufficient cause was shown, and this case was heard upon appeal. It is insisted also that the exercise of the power of-removal or displacement here \u25a0was not in conformity with the- rule prevailing in a court of \u25a0 chancery, that the guardian was removed without cause, and as it were upon his mere resignation. . We do not say that there was any error here, but if there was, the Judge of Probate, having this power and jurisdiction of the subject matter, an erroneous exercise of it cannot be reviewed and corrected in this collateral manner. The case of Young <em>et al. </em>vs. Lorrain <em>et al., </em>11 Ill., 633, is a case precisely in point. This pi\u2019inciple is so well recognized that it is unnecessary to say more in reference to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">There remains but one more point to' be disposed of in this case, and that is whether, under the facts set xxp in the complaint, the transfer of the moneys by Simpson to Bronnum relieved Simpson from any further liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The plaintiffs in their complaint allege that on or about the first day of Januax\u2019y, 1856, pursuant to an understanding betweeix the defendant and the.said Bronnum, the defendant applied for and obtained an order from the probate court of said county discharging him from his said guardianship, and the said Bronnum applied for and obtained an order appointing him guardian of the persons and the estates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>of' the said Emelia J., Eric and Eiehard C., and thereupon the defendant turned over to the said Bronnum all the assets in his possession, or under his control, belonging to his said wards, including the proceeds of their real, estate, which the defendant had converted into money as aforesaid,, amounting in the aggregate to $9,424.87. The plaintiffs-further allege that the said Bronnum has utterly wasted and spent the entire estate, and that the sureties upon his bond, as well as himself, are insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">There is no allegation that Simpson, the removed guardian, was in any way connected with the subsequent wasting of the estate by Bronnum. There is no allegation that Simpson had any reason to believe even that Bronnum was not entirely trustworthy at the time of the change. As to the naked, understanding and agreement between these parties, in the absence of an allegation of' facts showing it to-have been fraudulent, we cannot presume that such, was the case, and therefore no case of fraud is here presented for our consideration. If there was nothing more than understanding, we cannot see the least impropriety in that. \"We think rather it is highly commendable in a guardian to continue in the discharge of his trust until he can find some suitable person to whom it can be transferred. Such would be the course of any guardian who felt much interest in his ward, in the future of the infants entrusted to his care. The court itself might refuse a revocation of -appointment until the name of some good person was suggested. Upon the revocation of the appointment of Simpson, his power as guardian for the future ceased. It - was a matter of course-to require him to account and to pay over to his successor the\u2019balance. (10 Paige, 316.) Having done this, he was relieved from any further responsibility. There is a great difference between this case and the case of Doyle vs. Blake, so much relied upon by appellee. The executors there had acted; had each intermeddledjwith the assets. The administration to Horan was void. (Levinz, 182.) Their transfer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>ring the assets to him was the same as if they had transferred them to an individual. In the present case Simpson was displaced from his guardianship by a court having that power. The simple revocation of his appointment, his removal, did not release him from any liability for past acts. When he ceased to be guardian, he. was no longer entitled to the custody of the assets. The court then appointed Bronnum. That appointment was not void like Horan\u2019s, but was effective and legal. He became legally entitled to the custody and control of the estate of the ward, and his reception of the funds relieved Simpson of all liability for the loss which occurred by the subsequent wasting of the estate by Bronnum, and the insolvency of Bronnum and his sureties.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The judgment is reversed, and the case will be remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, and conformable to law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1.)\">\n<p id=\"Aq5\">) <em>Maine </em>\u2014 The Judge of Probate may \u201cdismiss\u201d at his discretion or tupon request of guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\"><em>New Hampshire </em>\u2014 The Judge of Probate \u201c removes \u201d whenever he thinks iit necessary or expedient.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\"><em>Gonneeticut </em>\u2014 The J.
