It does not issue as a matter of course, either from the court or the clerk\u2019s office. This discretion cannot be intelligently exercised upon the mere motion of the party seeking the writ without any statement of the case which he proposes to present. A petition setting forth the nature of the case, accompanied by a certified copy of the record of the judgment, is the proper basis of a motion in this court for the writ. This motion is an <em>ese parte </em>proceeding, and unless so directed by the court, there is no necessity id)'' notice to the adverse party. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>was the practice adopted in the case of <em>ex parte </em>Edwards, 11 Fla., 174. An examination of the papers will shoyv'that. that case was presented upon petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
