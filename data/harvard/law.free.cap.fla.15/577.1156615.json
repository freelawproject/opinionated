The act of 1870, entitled \u201c An act concerning testimony,\u201d gives to the accused in all criminal prosecutions the right to make a statement, under oath, before the jury, of the matter of his or her defense, and does not make the accused a witness in the case, or subject him to the rules governing in the examination of witnesses.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b599-6\">3.

It is not sufficient, in a case of perjury, for the court to charge the jury \u201c that if they believed, from the testimony, that the accused took the oath, and that it was false, he was guilty.\u201d The court should charge that they must find that the accused took a wilfully false oath, and that it must be so taken in relation to matter material (o the issue, in order to make him subject to the punishment provided for perjury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-12\">Writ of error from tbe Circuit Court of Madison county.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b599-13\"><em>JE.

In tbe first three sections of said act, parties to civil actions who are allowed to testify are mentioned.and described as witnesses. This qualification is not used in section 4, and tbe idea conveyed by it is, by a proper construction of said section, they are excluded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-16\">.This view is not in conflict with 13 Fla. 680 \u2014 Barber vs. State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-17\">Tbe discretion given to tbe court below to permit tbe party accused to make said \u201c statement \u201d was repealed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>act in 1870, and the \u201c right \u201d to make it guaranteed without qualification. Laws 1870, Chap. 1816, No. 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-5\">The reason and policy of the law forbids:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-6\">1. Because the accused could not be made amenable as a witness \u2014 for instance, for contempt for not answering, &amp;c., impracticable, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-7\">2. Because by an expert cross-examination the accused might be entrapped into a confession, the fear of which, or ' a refusal to answer, might render this <em>\u201c </em>right \u201d a practical nullity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-8\">3.

The court ex'red in charging the jux-y that if they be- _ lieved from the evidence that the accused took the oath, and that it was false, the prisoner \u201c is guilty.\u201d Because the court should have charged that, if they believed from the evidence that the accused took the oath, and that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Jmowingly, <em>willfully </em>and <em>corruptly </em>false, they might find him guilty. 2 Bish.

That the accused should be placed on the stand as a witness. If he made his statement, why should he not be cross-examined ? The law does not forbid it. See statute, Jan. 16, 1866.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-8\">2. The second exception \u2014 no grounds for setting aside the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWq\">Perjury is defined by our statute; this is a statutory offense, not one at common law. See Perjury at Common Law; Wharton\u2019s American Criminal Law, Vol. 3, \u00a7\u00a7 2198 and 2,199.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-10\">There is a difference in the statutory offense of perjury. <em>Vide </em>act of 1868, Laws of Florida, Chap. 6, p. 89, Sec. 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-11\">It is not, as contended in the bill of exceptions, necessary that the court should have instructed the jury that the oath was <em>\u201c </em>knowingly, wilfully and corruptly false.\u201d That was not even required by the common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-12\">The indictment charges the accused with \u201c wilfully \u2019\u2019.committing perjury. This is the only term used in the statute. This is sufficient evidence in the English and American practice. See Bouv. Law Dic. title, perjury, and the large number of cases cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-13\">The third ground of exception is, that the accused was ignorant that he was committing <em>perjwry. </em>This is no excuse. <em>Vide </em>Wharton\u2019s American Criminal Law, 6 Ed. \u00a7 2,201, and eases cited on same page, notes k. n. o.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-14\">The court had the right to refuse to permit the statement to go to the jury after it was made. The discretionary power had not departed from the court to refuse the statement of the witness even after it had been made. <em>Vide </em>Barber vs. the State of Florida, XIII Fla., Opinion of the Court, p. 680, citing the act of January 16, 1866, (not of 1865, as mentioned in the opinion.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>The law in Bush is incorrectly copied; a part is left out.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-5\">It is also a mistake of Mr. Bush in stating that the act is repealed. Act of January 16, 1866.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b603-6\">\n<em>Statement of the Case.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-7\">On November 24, 1875, John Miller, the plaintiff in error, was duly arraigned and- tried in the Circuit Court of the 3d Judicial District, held in and for Madison county, on an indictment for perjury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-8\">The indictment charged that on the 20th day of October, .1874, at a Circuit Court held at the court-house in the county of Madison, one Jerry Grimes was being tried upon an indictment for feloniously procuring a felony to be committed by one Isaiah Phillips, charged with the crime of forgery. That this John Miller was called and appeared as a juror ; that he was challenged and sworn by the Judge touching his qualifications as such juror. That it became a material question and subject of inquiry whether the. said John Miller was related to the accused, Jerry Grimes. That the said John Miller, intending to deceive the said court, unlawfully, falsely, knowingly, willfully and corruptly, did swear that he was not related to the said Jerry Grimes, when, in fact, at that' time, he was the father-in-law of the said Jerry Grimes. That he so swore for the purpose of causing the said Jerry Grimes to be wrongfully acquitted on the said indictment, and for no other purpose whatever. That said John Miller knowingly, willfully and corruptly did commit willful and corrupt perjury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-9\">On the trial of the cause, the counsel for the accused took certain exceptions to the rulings of the court, which, having been duly settled and signed by the Circuit Judge, appear in the return to the writ of error in the following words;</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-10\">I. On the trial of the case, after the State had rested the defendant, the party accused, claimed and insisted' upon the1 right of making, a statement to the jury, under oath, of the matter of his def\u00e9nse. Whereupon, the court refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>allow Kim to do so, unless Ke was put up as a witness, subject to cross-examination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-4\">To which ruling of the court the said accused excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-5\">II. The court, among,other things, charged the jury that if they believed from the testimony that the accused took the oath, and that it was false, the accused was guilty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-6\">To which the accused excepted on the ground that the court should have charged that, if the accused- took the oath, and it was knowingly, willfully and. corruptly false, they might find a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-7\">III. The accused offered to make a statement of the matter, of his defense, on oath,;before the jury, which defense was (in substance) as, stated,to the court: \u201cThat it was true that Jerry Grimes married the daughter of the accused, but that soon after their marriage said Grimes ill-treated his daughter and abandoned her. That he had for several years been compelled to . support his (laughter and child. That Jerry Grimes had gone off, and he, did hot consider he was anything to him or his family. That when the accused was asked oh his <em>vtivr dwe </em>whether or not he was related to the prisoner \"at the bar, Jerry Grimes, he answered he was not, being1 \u00e1t the time of the taking the said, oath under the <em>iona fide </em>impression and conviction that, as lie, the said Jerry Grimes, had left his'.wife, &amp;c., as aforesaid; he really was not related to, the accused, Jerry Grimes. That he made oath to what he ignorantly supposed to be time, and thus that lie did'not willfully- and corruptly make said oath.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-10\">The court\u2019'refused' to allow the accused to make such a defense;1 either as a statement'or otherwise, on the ground, as the court-Said, of its irrelevancy, and that if the same vr'as trt\u00ed\u00e9 it-would b\u00e9 no d\u00e9f\u00e9nse, as ignorance of law was no excuse. \" '\" \"\u2019 ......, \u201c ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-11\">To ;tv'hi6h the accused excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-12\">TK\u00e9\u2019jury11 found' the, prisoner' guilty, of perjury. The \u25a0 counsel for \u201cthe \"accused moved for a new trial upon the \u00e9rrd\u00eds So 'alleged, and also upon the further grounds that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>verdict of the jury was contrary to law, and because the jury was mislead by the charge of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b605-5\">The motion for new trial was denied, and the court proceeded to sent\u00e9nce the prisoner to State prison for the term of ten years.

(It is simply a presentation verbally, in his own language and manner, of the'matters .pertaining to his defense, of such facts and circumstances surrounding the ease as will go to excuse the offense and negative the idea of willful or corrupt intent. It is for the jury alone, and is to be taken into consideration by them, in connection' with all of the evidence in the case, and to be allowed such weight, and such only, as they, in their judgment, may see fit to give it.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>In the case of Barber vs. the.

C., C. 27, page 433; People vs. McKenney, 3 Parker C. R. 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">. It will thus be seen that there is a, difference, between a <em>willful </em>false .oath, constituting the crime of, perjury, and a false oath which, at common law, might he punished as a misdemeanor. The one is stubborn and, corrupt, while the other is simply not true, lacking the elements which go to .constitute the crime of perjury as defined by our statute. The jury must find that the accused was guilty of taking a willfully false oath, and in relation to matter material to the issue, in order to convict him of the crime of perjury and to render him liable to the .punishment prescribed for that .offense, and to,this end the court should have so charged .them.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The third ground of error assigned*' is similar to and em\u25a0braeed in the first,' that the couft refused to permit the accused. to, make his statement pf the matters,, of his ' defense, 'on oath, before the jury. The accused, at the same time of \u25a0making such offer, stated' t\u00f3 the court\u2018the sxxbstance of the statement so proposed to be inada The coxxi't refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>grant the request upon the ground of irrelevancy, and said that if the facts so proposed to be stated to the jury were true, it was no \u25a0 defense. This point has been disposed of under the first above assignment of error, where we hold that the accused, under the statute, has a- right to make a statement of the matter of his defense, on oath, before the jury. We cannot see how such a statement as is offered by the accused would be irrelevant. It related, certainly, to the matter of his defense; to the question, which the jury must determine, of the intent. Was the oath alleged to have been taken by the accused <em>willfully false ? </em>or was it taken through inadvertence, and not with a corrupt motive ? It would go for what' it was worth, and while it might hot strictly be a defense to the prosecution,- yet the accused had \u00e1 right to its consideration by the jury, whose judgment might have been influenced in his favor by it. \u201c It - would give to the jury for their consideration the facts upon which his oath was based, and the reasons operating upon his mind, and, from those facts and reasons they might determine the motives, if any, influencing him. We think it should have been admitted by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">The judgment must be reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
