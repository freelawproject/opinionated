Much independent investigation has been made by us of the authorities in addition to the excellent briefs filed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">We find in the record an excellent memorandum opinion of the cause by the learned Chancellor, Joe W. Worley. We adopt both the reasoning and conclusion therein. His opinion reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">\u201cThis is a petition for reinstatement to membership in the bar, petitioner Moses E. Cantor having been permanently disbarred by decree of this Court dated July 30,1938. The Bar Associations of Washington and Carter County were the relators in the original proceeding, made defendants here as agencies in interest, and now actively resist the granting of the petition. The cause is before the Court after extended argument on demurrer to the amended petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u2018 \u2018 There was a somewhat similar demurrer to the original petition, wherein defendants questioned the jurisdiction of this Court to reinstate petitioner after such a decree as disbarred him, and wherein they questioned also the sufficiency of the allegations to justify reinstatement, if proved. At the time of ruling on the original demurrer the Court felt that jurisdiction existed but reserved the question, and largely in order to ascertain the showing proposed to be made at the hearing, and to provide orderly procedure in the contest, sustained the demurrer and required the petitioner to amplify his pleading in accord with the specific directions contained in the decree. Defendants were granted leave to plead to the amended petition, and have demurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\">\u201cIt is presently enough to say that petitioner has plainly complied as best he could with the decree requiring amendment. The demurrer again raises question of the petitioner\u2019s sufficiency, that it reveals failure to make restitution to certain persons held in the disbarment proceeding to have been wronged by Mr. Cantor; that it contains no clear admission of wrongdoing in the matters on which disbarment was based, and shows no penitence therefor; that in certain particulars it evidences the lack of a proper ethical sense, and other related objections. There is much force in some of demurrant\u2019s arguments on these grounds, but the elements requisite to reinstatement of a disbarred attorney cannot be completely generalized, nor are they so definite and unyielding as to commend a dismissal on demurrer when the petition has any merit whatever. The injury is so necessarily individual and so intimately personal as to render the ultimate question not adaptable to decision on mere pleadings. The ruling on original demurrer may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>been misleading. It was primarily intended to limit the scope of the inquiry and to notify defendants more specifically of that which they might choose to defend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">\u201cDemurrants have again raised and strenuously argued the jurisdictional objection in their demurrer to the amended petition, and on this point the Court has considered at length the arguments of all solicitors, the cases cited, and others available. Unfortunately nothing has been found in our state by way of statute or rule, reported cases or reference in a reported case, on the matter of reinstating an attorney once permanently disbarred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">\u201cCode, Section 9974 sets out certain grounds for disbarment, in five categories, the first of which is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">\u201c \u2018Any attorney . . . may be disbarred or suspended ... 1. Who shall commit or may have committed, any infamous crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">\u201cCode, Section 9975 reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">\u201c \u2018In cases arising under the first subdivision of the preceding section, the judgment of the court must be that the name of the attorney shall be stricken from the roll of attorneys, solicitors and counselors, and that he be excluded from practicing as such attorney or counselor in all the courts of this state; and, upon conviction, in cases under other subdivisions of the preceding section, the judgment shall be permanent or temporary deprivation of the right to practice law, or a censure or reprimand, according to the gravity of the offense. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">\u201cIt is at once apparent that the disbarment provided for offenders under the first subdivision is permanent. The finding of the offense is for the Court; the legislature has provided a penalty mandatory in terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>\u2018 \u2018 Tire memorandum opinion containing the Chancellor\u2019s findings is contained in the disbarment decree, and includes this language:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-4\">\u2018As indicated they have gone so far as to manufacture evidence in order to win an important lawsuit, and in that they have already committed offenses and misdemeanors involving moral turpitude for which the statute provides disbarment with no discretion left to the Court to impose a penalty less severe.\u2019 (Opinion of Chancellor Ex. Orig. bill)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">\u2018 \u2018 The decree orders that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">\u2018the defendants Moses E. Cantor and Herman N. Cantor and each of them, be and they are hereby permanently disbarred and that their names be permanently stricken fr,om the roll of attorneys and that they and each of them be and they are hereby forever enjoined and prohibited from engaging in the profession of lawyers or in the practice of the law in any form or manner whatsoever directly or indirectly, in the State of Tennessee.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">\u201cPetitioner was therefore disbarred on grounds arising under the first subdivision, among others. This decree was unappealed from, and of course is as final as a disbarment decree may be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">\u201cThe argument that this Court cannot, or should not, entertain the petition under these circumstances is based on dual grounds. First, it is said that the decree constitutes a permanent disability prescribed by the legislature and imposed by the Court, and that petitioner thereby became incompetent again to become an attorney, by any avenue. Or, in the alternative, it is urged that the decree at least completely deprived petitioner of the office of an attorney and left him a layman who must pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>sue the avenue presently provided for new applicants in order to reenter the profession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-3\">\u201cIt is very easy to confuse the two stated arguments, and hence the.cases that bear on them. The <em>right </em>to reinstatement on proper showing is universally held to exist, but cases cited in support thereof may be entirely misleading when applied to the <em>method </em>of reinstatement. Before treating the cases it should also be osberved that many of the older ones having to do with reinstatement were decided when the examination and licensing of attorneys, as well as their admission, was quite generally done by the inferior Courts, so there could be little question of the proper <em>place </em>to apply. The new applicant, as well as the disbarred attorney, would then generally enter and reenter, respectively, before the same Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\">\u2018 \u2018 The rule has been thus stated,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">\u2018The disbarment of an attorney is not necessarily a permanent disability; he may afterwards be reinstated on proper application on petition for that purpose, addressed to the Court by which he was disbarred, usually by motion and on a proper showing. \u2019 5 Am. Jur., p. 443, and as to the <em>right </em>of reinstatement is fully supported by the cases. See also 6 C. J. p. 615; 48 A.L.R. 1243; <em>[In re Thatcher, </em>83 Ohio St. 246; 93 N. E. 895], Am. Cas. 1912A, 813. The cases there cited, and many others, are directly opposed to demurrant\u2019s first position, that a judgment of disbarment constitutes a permanent disability rendering the defendant forever ineligible for readmission to the bar. Our legislature did not attempt expressly to impose such a disqualification, and one so drastic is not to be implied. The question of its constitutional right is not presented, and perhaps could not now be. Nor will the language of the decree of disbarment be construed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>impose a permanent disability on petitioner that prevents Mm from reentering the profession of lawyer through proper channels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-4\">\u201c \u2018Courts are interested in regeneration of erring attorneys, and it is not the policy of the law, nor is it in interest of justice, that a disbarred attorney should never be reinstated.\u2019 <em>Wettlin </em>v. <em>State Bar of Calif., </em>1944, 24 Cal. 2d 682, 151 P. 2d 255.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">\u201cThe same state has upheld the constitutionality of a statute prescribing mandatory disbarment for one convicted of a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">\u201c \u2018It requires no argument to prove that the possession of this prerequisite (good moral character) to the receipt of, and continued exercising of the right or privilege of engaging in the practice of the law is a matter of such paramount public interest as to entirely justify the Legislature in prescribing that the commission of a crime involving moral turpitude, by one either seeking to obtain this right or privilege or thereafter exercising it, should constitute sufficient ground for its orginial denial or for its subsequent revocation.\u2019 <em>In re Collins </em>188 Cal. 701, 206 P. 990 [991], 32 A.L.R. 1062, 1065-1066. Annotations, 44 L.R.A., N. S., 1195; 32 A.L.R. 1068 et seq.; 79 A.L.R. 38; <em>In re Kerl, </em>[32 Idaho 737], 188 P. 40, 8 A.L.R. 1259; <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>State, </em>[200 Ga. 440], 37 S. E. 2d 187; 5 Am. Jur. p. 428. Both the California and Idaho statutes are almost identical with ours in material respects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">\u201cWhile clear that the petitioner suffers no incompetency or ineligibility preventing his reentering the office of attorney, there remains the question of whether he should apply here, the Court wherein he was disbarred. Decision of this question necessitates consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the nature of the decree of disbarment, whether it removed petitioner completely from the office of attorney, for all purposes, or whether it left an inchoate right that can be revived by this Courts\u2019 decree of \u2018reinstatement\u2019. And assuming that the decree of disbarment left petitioner wholly denuded of his previous status as attorney, does there remain a continuing control in this Court over the decree so that he may be \u2018reinstated\u2019 without pursuing the path required for new applicants ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">\u201cIn argument and brief solicitors for petitioners say that the decree did not take away his license to practice, but merely struck his name from the rolls and forbade him to use it. But as to the nature of the decree, they say \u2018That a petition for readmission of a disbarred attorney is not a continuation of the disbarment proceedings, but a new and independent proceeding, based upon the general jurisdiction of the Judiciary to Control Membership of the Bar. \u2019 Citing <em>In re </em>Keenan, 310 Mass. 166, 37 N. E. 2d 516, 137 A.L.R. 766. In the same case [310 Mass. 170, 37 N. E. 2d 519], 137 A.L.R. 771, it is held that, \u2018A final judgment of removal from such office rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction is binding upon all the courts of the Commonwealth and constitutes an adjudication that, at the time it was rendered, the attorney so removed was not a proper person to hold such office. A subsequent petition for admission to the bar involves a new inquiry as to whether, in the interval following the . . . judgment of removal, the petitioner has become a proper person to hold such office. <em>Bar Association of City of Boston </em>v. <em>Greenhood, </em>168 Mass. 169, 183, 46 N. E. 568.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">\u201cPetitioner Keenan, <em>In re Keenan, supra, </em>had been disbarred by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>and petitioned for readmission to the Superior Conrt, the statute relating to applicants <em>generally </em>authorizing the filing of petitions for admission in <em>either </em>the Superior or Supreme Judicial Court. The opinion states [310 Mass. 168, 37 N. E. 2d 519] 137 A.L.R. 770: \u2018The present petitioner does not seek by his petition review of the final judgment of removal from his office as an attorney at law, but, in accordance with the statement just quoted, seeks <em>readmission </em>to the bar. <em>The present proceeding is a new proceeding for admission to the bar, s%(,bject to the limitations of procedure and substance resulting from the fact that the petitioner by final judgment has been \u201cremoved from the office of an attorney at law in the </em>Courts of this Commonwealth.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\u2019 The Court proceeds to hold that the statute applicable to candidates for admission generally applies to petitioner Keenan, subject to such modifications in requirements as the Court might deem appropriate, allowing the Superior Court to proceed notwithstanding that the Supreme Judicial Court had by Buie provided special procedure for the readmission of disbarred persons, and that it was the disbarring Court. The statute relating to admissions, as well as those relating to disbarment, are construed not as an unconstitutional interference with the judiciary but as \u2018 \u201cmaking provision in aid of the judicial department in reaching a proper selection of those qualified for admission as attorneys to practice in the courts\u201d \u2019. [310 Mass. 173, 37 N. E. 2d 521], 137 A.L.R. 773.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">\u201cCited as supporting the view adopted (that the application is for readmission and an entirely new proceeding) are <em>In re Newton, </em>27 Mont. 182, 183, 70 P. 510, 982; <em>Vaughn </em>v.

App. 1296], 165 S. W. 2d 300, is pertinent on the principle here involved. It also dealt with a petition for reinstatement of one permanently disbarred. Under Mo. R.S.A. Section 13316 the power to \u2018admit and license\u2019 persons to practice law lies only in the Supreme Court. The statutes also provide for \u2018disbarment\u2019, and for \u2018removal or suspension\u2019 of attorneys, in the latter class of cases providing, Mo. R.S.A. Section 13336 for a continued control of the decree by the disbarring Court, and reinstatement on proper showing \u2018at any time after one year from the date of such judgment of <em>removal or suspension\u2019.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">\u201cTreating the question of whether one permanently disbarred could be reinstated under Mo. R.S.A. Section 13336 the Court says (165 S. W. 2d 303): \u2018Did the Legislature mean by the proviso to Section 13336 that any attorney who had been permanently and finally \u2018 \u2018 removed from practice \u2019 \u2019 and his license revoked, that is, disbarred, could be reinstated and again licensed by this court or by a circuit court if the proceedings had been in a circuit court? Clearly not. When this court permanently removed respondent from the practice of the law and revoked his license, it would be absurd to say that this court could thereafter (after one year from the date of such judgment of removal) reinstate the attorney and also license him to practice law, in the face of the statute that the power to admit and license attorneys is vested ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>clusively in the Supreme Court by Section 13316. . . . The statute does not confer upon this court the authority to \u201cadmit and license\u201d a person to practice as an attorney, hut it does authorize this court to remove an attorney from the practice of the law, which of necessity would include the authority to revoke his license. Therefore, it would be a meaningless and useless gesture for this court to entertain an application to reinstate this applicant, when we have no authority whatever to issue him a license as an attorney.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\">\u201cReferring to Mo. R.S.A. Section 13316, discussed <em>supra, </em>the Court says (165 S. W. 2d 302): \u2018The words \u2018 \u2018 admit and license \u2019 \u2019, as used in this section are inseparable and refer to the same thing . . . admission as a member of the bar ... is consummated by the issuance to the applicant of a license, which is a certificate of his admission, and can be issued only by the Supreme Court. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">\u201cThe Texas Court of Civil Appeals in <em>Burns </em>v. <em>State </em>[Tex. Civ. App.], 76 S. W. 2d 172, held that the application for reinstatement of a permanently disbarred attorney should be to the Supreme Court, the licensing body, but this decision was reversed by the Commission of Appeals in <em>Burns </em>v. <em>State </em>[129 Tex. 303], 103 S. W. 2d 960, that Court holding that the application for reinstatement should be to the Court of disbarment, its decision supporting petitioner here. The decision cites several early cases, and quotes <em>Ex parte Peters, </em>195 Ala. 67, 70 So. 648, 649, in support of the view adopted, but since the Texas Case <em>Ex parte Peters </em>has been abandoned by the Alabama Court <em>In re Stephenson </em>243 Ala. 342, 10 So. 2d 1, 143 A.L.R. [166], 167. In this case the initial petition for reinstatement had been to the Circuit Court, the Court of disbarment, whose denial of it was affirmed on appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Tlie appellate Court in its holding said: \u2018 \u201c The application should be made <em>to the duly constituted authorities </em>to consider his present quality of mind, character, qualifications and fitness ...\u201d <em>Ex parte Stephenson, </em>237 Ala. 488, 187 So. 461 (quoted [243 Ala. 344, 10 So. 2d 2], 143 A.L.R. 167).\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">\u201cIt appears that after the decision last quoted the Supreme Court approved a rule providing for the filing of' applications for reinstatement before the \u2018 Board of Commissioners of the Alabama State Bar,\u2019 Rule C of \u2018Rules governing admission to the Bar of Alabama\u2019. This- rule, the Court says, \u2018supersedes the observation ... set forth from the Peters case\u2019, <em>(Ex parte Peters, supra) </em>but adds ([243 Ala. 346, 10 So. 2d 4], 143 A.L.R. 170): \u2018It may well be observed that an application for reinstatement of an attorney, after the judgment of disbarment has become final, must be treated as an application for admission to the practice, and not as an application to vacate the order of disbarment. Such is the spirit as well as the wording of our decisions and rules that obtain. Such are the holdings of the general authorities. <em>In re Fleming, </em>36 N. M. 93, 8 P. 2d 1063; <em>Danford </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>49 Cal.

W. 821, 822], is as well appropriate to the Buie just quoted: \u2018... it will be perceived that there is no other way for one to be admitted to the practice of the law than the way set forth by the Legislature in the act. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">\u201cSee also <em>In re Bowers, </em>137 Tenn. 189 [194 S. W. 1093; Id., 137 Tenn. 193], 194 [192 S. W. 919].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\u201c \u2018A statutory provision for examination for admission to the bar, even though confined to an examination into the acquirements and qualifications of the applicant other than his moral character, is as applicable to a petition by one previously disbarred as to a petition by an original applicant. <em>In re Keenan, supra </em>[310 Mass. 166, 37 N. E. 2d 516], 137 A.L.R. at [page] 768.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">\u2018 \u2018 The conclusion indicated has been reached after earnest consideration, in recognition of the importance of the question to the parties, especially petitioner, and after an initial contrary view by the Court. I am not un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>mindful that important considerations of policy are involved that could be deemed controlling in an open question on which the authorities elsewhere are divided. But if policy be thought to call for a different conclusion this Court is not that which should formulate and weigh it. The reasoning in the late cases herein referred to has made the result reached the only one logically acceptable, giving the disbarment decree the effect to which it is entitled and having regard for our presently existing procedure governing the licensing and admission of attorneys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">\u2018 \u2018 The demurrer must be sustained, and the decree may so provide, dismissing the petition at petitioner\u2019s cost, but without prejudice to the merits of his application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Supplying what is so well said above, we think that Code, Section 9543 should be read in conjunction with the Code sections referred to in the Chancellor\u2019s opinion. This section provides in substance that when an attorney has collected money which cannot be collected from him that he \u201cshall thenceforward be disqualified to practice in the courts of this state <em>until the debt is paid.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.) This language clearly indicates that an attorney thus gnilty must make restitution of money wrongfully withheld before he can be reinstated to practice. The implication also is that he may under this wrong make such an application, i.e., for reinstatement. The second portion of Code, Section 9975, above quoted, applies to a case, among others, where money is wrongfully withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">It seems to us, considering what we have said above, in the light of the second portion of Code, Section 9975 that an attorney who is disbarred for violation of subdivisions (2), (3), (4) and (5) of Code, Section 9974 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>lias the right to apply to the disbarring Court for reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">An attorney gnilty of violation of subdivision (1) of Code, Section 9974 is placed in a different category by the first portion of Code, Section 9975. The name of an attorney guilty under this subdivision of the statute must \u201cbe stricken from the roll of attorneys, etc.\u201d, that is, the Court hearing the disbarment case <em>\u201cmust\u201d </em>remove, efface and cancel his name from the roll of attorneys, etc. The appellant was so found guilty over ten years ago. By force of this statute such a finding necessarily removes his name from the roll of attorneys, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The legislature must have had some purpose in specifying the two types of punishment. In the second portion of the statute the judgment may be either permanent or temporary deprivation of the right to practice. Under the first portion of the statute his license is annulled and ceases to exist. His license is merely a right or franchise to practice law. When his name is \u201cstricken from the roll\u201d it is removed, effaced and cancelled. He stands just as though he never had a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Under the second portion of the statute he is merely enjoined from the practice. Under such circumstances the court granting the injunction \u201cmay open or modify the same where the circumstances and circumstances of the parties are shown to have so changed as to make it just and equitable to do so.\u201d 28 Am. Jur. p. 495, Section 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">For these reasons the decree of the Chancellor must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b583-8\">All concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Opinion on Petition to Rehear</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">A courteous and dignified petition to rehear has been filed herein. This petition does not question our finding but asks for clarification or specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">We held that a disbarred attorney may apply to the disbarring court when his disbarment is based on violation of subdivisions (2), (3), (4) and (5) of Code, Section 9974; that he must seek readmission to practice law through the Board of Law Examiners when he has been held guilty of the violation of subdivision (1) of Code, Section 9974; and that an attorney guilty of misappropriating the funds of his client must make restitution of such funds before he can be reinstated. In one instance this restitution should be made to appear to the Board of Law Examiners while in the other instances this restitution would have to be shown to the Court wherein application for reinstatement is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">With this clarification the petition must be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
