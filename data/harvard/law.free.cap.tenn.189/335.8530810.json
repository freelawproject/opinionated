After defendants had filed pleas to the declaration, they caused the Clerk to subpoena the plaintiff for the purpose of taking plaintiff\u2019s deposition. Plaintiff, on advice of counsel, did not appear, and thereafter similar subpoenas were served from time to time- on plaintiff, until one which was served on July 11, 1949, requiring plaintiff to appear on July 20, 1949. The case came on for trial July 28, 1949, and at that time, plaintiff moved the Court to quash the various subpoenas to take his deposition. Then defendants filed a motion calling for an instanter dismissal of the case because of plaintiff\u2019s statement in open Court, that such subpoenas would not be obeyed. Thereupon, the Court overruled plaintiff\u2019s motion to quash the subpoenas and sustained defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. An order was accordingly entered, dismissing the cause. A motion for a new trial was subsequently overruled, and the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>The only questions presented are, (1) Whether defendants were entitled to take plaintiff\u2019s deposition as they proposed to do, and (2) Whether for plaintiff\u2019s refusal and failure to obey the subpoena, the Trial Court was justified in dismissing the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Because the action was commenced on the pauper\u2019s oath, defendants support their right to take the deposition of plaintiff under the following provisions of Code, Section 9806:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">\u201cThe evidence of witnesses may he taken by deposition, in civil actions, by either party:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">\u201c(9) When the suit is brought by a party in <em>forma \u2018pauperis.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The determinative question is whether the word \u201cwitnesses\u201d as used in the foregoing, includes \u201cparties to the record.\u201d The historical background of the Code Section quoted persuades us that it did not include parties. Subsection (9) of Code Section 9806 was taken from Section 1 of Chapter 128, Public Acts of 1851-52. The obvious purpose of said subsection was to ensure that poor persons who were litigating should not be deprived of necessary witnesses on account of the inability of such parties to pay traveling expenses, etc. When the Act of the Legislature was passed in 1851, parties of record were not competent as witnesses, and this incompetence was not removed until March 13, 1868, and the enactment of Chapter 75 of the Public Acts of 1867-1868. Therefore, it is historically impossible, <em>State </em>v. <em>Nashville Baseball </em>Ass\u2019n., 141 Tenn. 456, 459, 211 S. W. 357, 4 A.L.R. 368, that the Legislature had \u201cparties\u201d in mind when the word \u201cwitnesses\u201d was used in the Act. The identical language of Code, Section 9806. of the Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>of 1932, is taken verbatim from Code, Section 3836 of the Code of 1858, which was, of course, 10 years prior to the time that parties were made competent to testify. From the examples collected and considered in Words &amp; Phrases (q.v.) it is evident that the question whether the word \u201cwitnesses\u201d includes \u201cparties,\u201d is to be determined in each case by the attendant circumstances and context, and that there is no safe general rule that can be applied universally.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The only Tennessee cases considered by the defendants are, <em>Weakly </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>1 Tenn. Ch. 523, 527, and <em>Ducktown Sulphur, Copper &amp; Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Fain, </em>109 Tenn. 56, 70 S. W. 813. In the latter case, a dictum by Judge Cooper in the former case of <em>Weakly </em>v. <em>Miller </em>is copied in the course of the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">\u201cBut either party may now have the benefit of his adversary\u2019s testimony as a witness, in the usual way, without resorting to either a bill or petition for a discovery. <em>Weakly </em>v. <em>Miller, 1 </em>Tenn. Ch. [523], 527, 528.\u201d <em>Ducktown Sulphur, Copper </em>&amp; <em>Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Fain, </em>109 Tenn. 56, 62, 70 S. W. 813, 814.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Neither in the case of <em>Weakly </em>v. <em>Miller, supra, </em>nor in <em>Ducktown Sulphur, Copper </em>&amp; <em>Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Fain, supra, </em>was the deposition of a party taken, or attempted to be taken, as it was here by the defendants. Standing alone, the foregoing quotation, however, might give the defendants some comfort, but as the authority of the Ducktown case was limited and defined by Judge Green in the later case of <em>Nashville C. </em>&amp; <em>St. L. RR. </em>v. <em>T. S. Jenkins </em>&amp; <em>Sons, </em>155 Tenn. 605, 610, 296 S. W. 1, 53 A.L.R. 812, the confusion is resolved. What was meant by the language, and what is now the law, is that when in a law case, a situation presents itself which would justify a bill for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>a discovery in equity, Gibson\u2019s Suits in Chy. (1937 Ed.) Section 1116 et seq., it is not necessary in Tennessee, to file a separate bill in Chancery to effect the discovery, <em>Bumpass </em>v. Reams, 33 Tenn. 595, but by pursuing the precedure prescribed in Code, Sections 9869 through 9878, the party desiring may have the discovery in the law court. Neither in the <em>Weakly case </em>nor in the <em>D'ucktoivn case </em>was the practice attempted here approved.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj7\">This procedure by the defendants was an attempt to introduce into a State cause Federal pre-trial procedure. Whether or not it is beneficial or desirable is a matter for the Legislature and cannot, of course, be introduced by the Courts without the authority of a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Trial Court is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Defendants will pay the costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b369-6\">All concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
