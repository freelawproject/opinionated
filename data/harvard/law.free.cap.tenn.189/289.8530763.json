The circuit judge sustained the motions and dismissed the suits. In this we think he was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">In Caruther\u2019s History of a Lawsuit (6th ed.), Section 157, p. 171, the author states that the legal test of the necessary essentials of the writ are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-11\">\u201c1. The style of the writ: \u2018The State of Tennessee.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-12\">2. The address: \u2018To the Sheriff of . . . County.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>3. The command: \u2018Summon.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-3\">4. The party defendant: \u2018James Hart.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\">5. What he is to do :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">a. To appear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">h. At circuit Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">c. Of ... . county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">d. At what term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">e. To answer the suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">f. .Of the plaintiff, A. B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-11\">6. The attestation by the clerk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">The author further states in this same section that if any of these essential parts are wanting, the writ is substantially defective and may on motion be quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">The only complaint made about the summonses in these cases is that they failed to show the amount of the damages claimed, although fully set out in the declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">Again, in Caruthers\u2019 History of a Lawsuit (6th ed.), Section 158, p. 172, the author deals with \u201cdefects cured by amendment except style, <em>teste </em>and signature of the clerk,\u201d and says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-15\">\u201cIt is true that \u2018no summons, writ, pleading, process, return, or other proceeding in any civil action in any court, shall be abated or quashed for any defect, omission, or imperfection.\u2019 But this merely means that they may be amended; the thing omitted may be supplied; the thing defective or imperfect may be made perfect by amendment. This may be done after a motion to quash the writ is made or before. The rule allowing amendments is very liberal, and, if the writ is not absolutely void because of the absence of essential parts, it may be amended. But if it is wanting in the essentials of a writ, then it is a nullity, and of no. more effect than a blank piece of paper, and it cannot be converted into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>a writ by amendment. Tbe style, tbe <em>teste, </em>and tbe signature of the clerk are essential parts of tbe process, and if those, or any one of them, be absent, tbe defect cannot be cured by amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">\u201cIf tbe requisite qualities are in substance embodied in tbe writ; that is, if tbe face of tbe writ itself, without any help from affidavits, shows that what tbe law requires, was intended to be embraced in it, however awkwardly, obscurely, or inartificially, there is no necessity for an amendment. Tbe court may direct it to be amended for tbe sake of perspicuity and order, but will not quash it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Counsel for defendant rely on tbe cases of <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>68 Tenn. 581, and <em>Bolling </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>63 Tenn. 550. In tbe Wiley case it was held that a writ or summons without stating the demand sued for, or tbe amount sued for, is void, and is no more than a blank piece of paper and must be held void. Tbe Bolling case dealt only with a writ following an order of tbe chancery court which bad.been directed to be returnable to another date, and tbe writ was held to be a nullity. There is nothing said in that case about the failure to state tbe amount of the demand in a summons, and it has no bearing on tbe issues involved in tbe instant cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Tbe practice in this State for a number of years has been to allow amendments wherever possible. We have no disposition to change this salutary rule. Tbe defendant was duly notified and brought before tbe court in tbe instant cases, and we see no reason why the amendments should not have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The judgments of tbe lower court must, therefore, be reversed and tbe cases remanded for new trials consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b322-9\">All concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
