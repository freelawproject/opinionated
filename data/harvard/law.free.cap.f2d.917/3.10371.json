JONES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b119-29\">Three inmates of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Institutional Division (TDC) filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 1983 case challenging the prison\u2019s new administrative directive, which limits total storage space inside inmate cells to four cubic feet. According to the inmates, this regulation unconstitutionally infringes on their rights of access to the courts, free exercise of religion, and possession of legally obtained property. They requested injunctive relief and $1 billion in punitive damages. We concur with the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss this complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-30\">Appellants\u2019 complaint challenges the TDC\u2019s Administrative Directive .03.72, which mandates that inmates will be provided with storage containers of approximately 1.75 cubic feet capacity. According to an affidavit attached to the complaint, a TDC warden could permit an additional storage unit of 2.25 cubic feet capacity to be obtained for storage of a prisoner\u2019s legal materials. The regulation states that if a prisoner\u2019s property cannot fit within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>these storage containers, it must either be mailed home at the inmate\u2019s expense, retrieved by approved visitors, or turned over to the prison for destruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Appellants contend that each of their legal materials alone are too voluminous to be stored within four cubic feet of space. As quoted verbatim from their appellate brief, each plaintiff lays claim to the following materials:</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Plaintiff Long:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">1.

First, the inmates contend that their right of access to the courts is hindered by the administrative limit on their available storage space. Second, in less specific terms, they allege that the limit prevents them from accumulating religious books and papers to supplement a perceived inadequacy in the prison\u2019s furnishing of such materials. Third, they contend that the threat to destroy property they have accumulated while in prison violates procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-37\">It seems to us, as it did to the district court, highly dubious that a facially neutral prison storage space limitation of <em>four cubic feet </em>might in any way restrict a prisoner\u2019s exercise of constitutional rights, especially considering the obvious space limitations in a prison setting. That each inmate possesses well over 5,000 pages of legal papers and is participating in at least five lawsuits bespeaks eloquently the current misallocation of social resources toward excessive prisoner litigation. The inmates\u2019 complaint faces a legal hurdle even prior to the assessment of its substantive merit, however. They have sought injunctive relief for the alleged constitutional violation, but such relief is only available through the mechanism of the Ruiz<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> remedial injunction that presently operates upon the Texas prison system. This court has held that \u201cseparate individual suits may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>not be maintained for equitable relief from allegedly unconstitutional Texas prison conditions,\u201d because to do so would interfere with the orderly administration of the <em>Ruiz </em>class action. <em>Gillespie v. Crawford, </em>858 F.2d 1101, 1103 (5th Cir.1988) (en banc). Hence, until the <em>Ruiz </em>injunction is lifted or modified, these inmates\u2019 claims for equitable relief must be made solely through the <em>Ruiz </em>class representative. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Insofar as the appellants have requested punitive damages, this claim is frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d). <em>Pugh v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>875 F.2d 436, 438 (5th Cir.1989). There is no arguable basis in law or in fact for a contention that, in promulgating this facially neutral administrative directive governing prisoners\u2019 accumulation of property, any TDC official maliciously, wantonly, or oppressively violated the constitutional rights of prisoners, as would be required for the assessment of punitive damages. <em>Smith v. Wade, </em>461 U.S. 30, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing appellants\u2019 complaint. Their claim for equitable relief must be sought through the <em>Ruiz </em>remedial mechanisms, and their plea for punitive damages is legally frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-26\">. <em>Ruiz v.
