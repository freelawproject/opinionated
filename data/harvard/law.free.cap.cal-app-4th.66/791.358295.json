No; the United States Constitution does not prohibit random border searches of incoming international mail, nor is there any legislative provision for the exclusion of evidence recovered by customs agents in this manner. Therefore, such evidence is admissible in California courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">After his motion to suppress evidence was denied, Mauro Miguel Blardony pleaded no contest to a charge of possessing methamphetamine for sale, while personally armed with a firearm. On appeal, he renews his claims that the evidence against him was illegally obtained and should have been suppressed. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">On March 26, 1997, a customs inspector randomly opened and searched a Federal Express package from the Philippines addressed to \u201cMiguel Blardony\u201d at an apartment in Daly City. The commercial invoice stated the package contained a karaoke tape of children and family pictures. However, the inspector discovered a crystalline substance inside. A \u201cpresumptive test\u201d on the substance yielded a positive result for methamphetamine. The substance was sent to a customs forensic laboratory for further analysis, which verified that it was methamphetamine, weighing about 30 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">On March 27, a customs agent turned the package over to Daly City Police Detective Julian Agust\u00edn. Agust\u00edn went to the address written on the package and saw the name \u201cBlardony\u201d next to the doorbell for the apartment number on the package. He ran a Department of Motor Vehicles check on the name \u201cMiguel Blardony\u201d without finding a match. On two occasions, Agust\u00edn tried to deliver the package to Blardony\u2019s apartment, but no one answered the doorbell. On March 31, Agust\u00edn applied for a search warrant, stating his training and experience led him to believe the crystal methamphetamine in the package was a bulk shipment that a dealer would break up into smaller packets for sale. He stated that other controlled substances, transaction records, cash, and firearms are typically kept in dealers\u2019 residences, and he believed Blardony was involved in a conspiracy to sell methamphetamine. The magistrate issued a search warrant, and officers found drugs, drug paraphernalia, and firearms in Blardony\u2019s apartment on March 31, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">After waiving a preliminary hearing, Blardony was charged by information with various drug and weapons violations. He moved to suppress the evidence seized from his apartment, contending (1) the customs inspector\u2019s random search of the package addressed to Blardony was unlawful; (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>chemical analysis of the package\u2019s contents was unlawful because it was performed without a warrant; (3) Detective Agust\u00edn\u2019s warrant application was insufficient to establish probable cause; and (4) the warrant could not be saved by the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule. The court denied the motion. In a negotiated plea agreement, Blardony pleaded nolo contendere to count 1 of the information and admitted a firearm enhancement, in return for dismissal of the other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">When the superior court sits as the finder of fact on a motion to suppress brought in the first instance in superior court, we must uphold the court\u2019s factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence. However, we independently determine whether the facts establish probable cause, and whether suppression of evidence is required under federal constitutional standards. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lawler </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 156, 160 [107 Cal.Rptr. 13, 507 P.2d 621]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Trujillo </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1219, 1223-1224 [266 Cal.Rptr. 473]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mikesell </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1711, 1716 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 708].)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">\n<em>1. A Random Border Search of Incoming Mail Does Not Violate the Fourth Amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Blardony relies on <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Taghizadeh </em>(9th Cir. 1996) 87 F.3d 287, 288-289, which holds that customs searches of incoming international mail packages are governed by 19 United States Code section 1582 and its implementing regulations. Among those regulations is 19 Code of Federal Regulations, section 145.3(a) (1998), which requires \u201creasonable cause to suspect the presence of merchandise or contraband\u201d for agents to open and examine letter class mail that appears to contain matter other than correspondence. Blardony contends the random search of his package violated the reasonable cause requirement, rendering the search unlawful and requiring suppression of the package\u2019s contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">We assume for purposes of argument that Blardony\u2019s Federal Express package met the definition of \u201cletter class mail\u201d provided in 19 Code of Federal Regulations, section 145.1(b) (1998)\u2014\u201cany mail article, including packages . . . mailed at the letter rate or equivalent class or category of postage.\u201d Nevertheless, the customs inspector\u2019s presumptive violation of regulatory requirements provided no basis for application of the exclusionary rule. Border searches of incoming international mail are per se \u201creasonable\u201d under the Fourth Amendment, without any need to show probable cause. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Ramsey </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 606, 619-622 [97 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>1972, 1980-1982, 52 L.Ed.2d 617]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Ani </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 138 F.3d 390, 392.) \u201cAbsent a constitutional violation or a congressionally created remedy, violation of an agency regulation does not require suppression of evidence.\u201d <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Ani, supra, </em>138 F.3d at p. 392, citing among other cases <em>United States </em>v. <em>Caceres </em>(1979) 440 U.S. 741, 744 [99 S.Ct. 1465, 1467-1468, 59 L.Ed.2d 733] [no suppression of evidence obtained in violation of IRS regulations]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Benevento </em>(2d Cir. 1987) 836 F.2d 60, 69-70 [no suppression of evidence obtained in violation of customs regulations].) \u201cThere is nothing to indicate that Congress or the United States Customs Service intended the exclusionary rule to be a remedy for violation of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1582 or 19 C.F.R. [\u00a7] 145.1 <em>et seq.\u201d (U.S. </em>v. <em>Ani, supra, </em>138 F.3d at p. 392, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Accordingly, the random search of Blardony\u2019s package was not a ground for suppression of the evidence yielded by the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">2., 3.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Phelan, P.
