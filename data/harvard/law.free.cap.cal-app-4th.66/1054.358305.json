Plaintiff and appellant Samy Tliche doing business as Pirata Restaurant (Tliche) appeals from the order of dismissal of his complaint against defendants and respondent Carl Van Quathem, VQA Property Management, and Alca Properties (collectively Van Quathem).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Tliche contends the trial court erred in dismissing his complaint for violation of a local delay reduction rule requiring service of the summons and complaint on defendant within 60 days of filing the complaint and in denying his motion to vacate the order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">We find the trial court failed to consider less drastic measures than dismissal as the first sanction (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68608, subd. (b)). Also, the trial court failed to take into account that service of process is ordinarily within the power of counsel as opposed to the client; therefore, in the absence of any information to the contrary, the sanction for failure to serve the complaint within the time period specified by the local delay reduction rule should, in the first instance, be levied against the attorney in the form of monetary sanctions and not against the client by dismissing the case. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 575.2, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">Order of dismissal reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">On December 21, 1995, Tliche filed a complaint against defendants for various causes of action arising from Tliche\u2019s lease of certain premises from defendants for restaurant use. Nineteen or more unsuccessful attempts were made to serve defendants through early February 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">On August 22, 1996, the trial court issued an order to show cause for failure to prosecute the case, citing Superior Court of Los Angeles Rules, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>rule 7 et seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, and Code of Civil Procedure sections 583.150, 583.360 and 583.420 and Government Code section 68608, subdivision (b). Thereafter, Tliche\u2019s counsel initiated renewed efforts to serve defendants and substituted service was eventually effected about October 5, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">In the interim, at the September 23, 1996, hearing on the order to show cause, Tliche\u2019s counsel did not appear by 9:30 a.m., and the trial court ordered the case dismissed in its entirety.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A copy of the minute order stating the case was dismissed in its entirety was sent to Tliche\u2019s counsel on that same date.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The order did not specify any local rule or code section as authority for the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">On February 18, 1997, Tliche\u2019s counsel, apparently believing his nonappearance was the reason for the dismissal, filed a motion for an order vacating the dismissal and reinstating the complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In support of the motion, Tliche\u2019s counsel submitted his declaration, corroborated by the declaration of his secretary, regarding the circumstances of his \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise [and] neglect\u201d which resulted in his nonappearance at the hearing on the order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>show cause and the dismissal of the complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendants opposed the motion. In his reply to the opposition, Tliche\u2019s counsel argued defendants had avoided service for a number of months and submitted documentation of his efforts to serve defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">At the March 5, 1997, hearing, the trial court denied Tliche\u2019s motion to vacate the dismissal without prejudice, stating, \u201cAlthough the counsel for plaintiff admits fault in his failure to appear at the hearing at which his clients\u2019 [sic.] case was dismissed, such.failure to appear was not the cause of the dismissal. The case was dismissed because by the date of the hearing, 9/23/96, the case had been pending for more than 9 months and the defendant [sic.] had not been served. Local Rule 7.7 requires that the complaint be served within 60 days after it is filed. The moving papers also do not state grounds for discretionary relief for Excusable neglect because no attempt to serve the defendant after 2/11/96 is shown and no explanation is given for the unreasonable delay of almost 5 months between the date the case was dismissed and the date that the motion for relief under Code of Civil Procedure Section 473 was filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">On March 28, 1997, Tliche filed a new motion for an order vacating the dismissal, this time supported by his declaration identical in substance to that supporting his first motion. At the April 29, 1997, hearing, the trial court took the matter off calendar on the grounds the motion had not been filed within six months of the date the case was dismissed and therefore the court lacked jurisdiction to rule on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">On May 5, 1997, Tliche filed a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>Issues<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">What are the limitations on the trial court\u2019s power to prescribe the sanction of dismissal of an action for noncompliance with local delay reduction rules?</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Is the sanction of dismissal for failure to serve subject to the time limits set forth in Code of Civil Procedure sections 583.410 and 583.420, subdivision (a)(1), two years after the action is commenced?</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">1. <em>The Trial Court Delay Reduction Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">Article 5 of the Government Code, commencing with section 68600, was enacted in 1986 as a pilot project. Known as The Trial Court Delay Reduction Act (the Act), it drastically altered the management of civil cases in California. In 1990 the original act was repealed and the current, revised act, with statewide application effective July 1, 1992, was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">The California Judicial Council (the Council), as the policy and rulemaking body for the courts, was directed by the Legislature to promulgate \u201cstandards of timely disposition\u201d of civil and criminal actions. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68603, subd. (a).) In establishing these standards the Council was to be \u201c. . . guided by the principles that litigation, from commencement to resolution, should require only that time reasonably necessary for pleadings, discovery, preparation, and court events, and that any additional elapsed time is delay and should be eliminated.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">Following this mandate, the Council promulgated case disposition time standards. (Cal. Stds. Jud. Admin., \u00a7 2.1 et seq. [23 pt. 2, West\u2019s Ann. Court Rules (Appen.) (1996 ed.) p. 640]) Under these standards, general civil cases other than a small claims or unlawful detainer case are to be resolved as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-12\">\u201c(1) 90 percent disposed of within 12 months after filing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>\u201c(2) 98 percent disposed of within 18 months after filing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-4\">\u201c(3) 100 percent disposed of within 24 months after filing.\u201d (Cal. Stds. Jud. Admin., \u00a7 2.3(b).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Under the Act, judges are to assume responsibility \u201c. . . to eliminate delay in the progress and ultimate resolution of litigation, to assume and maintain control over the pace of litigation, to actively manage the processing of litigation from commencement to disposition, and to compel attorneys and litigants to prepare and resolve all litigation without delay, from the filing of the first document invoking court jurisdiction to final disposition of the action.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68607.)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">2. <em>Courts\u2019 Authority to Enact Local Rules and Impose Sanctions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The Legislature granted the courts express statutory power to adopt local rules \u201cdesigned to expedite and facilitate the business of the court\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 575.1)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in 1982. The Council is authorized to promulgate rules governing pretrial conferences in civil cases at issue. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 575.)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">With the legislative mandate to manage cases, the Legislature granted to the courts authority to impose sanctions for noncompliance with rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>adopted to implement the Act. These include the power to dismiss actions or strike pleadings. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68608, subd. (b).) However, in imposing the ultimate sanction of dismissal, judges are required to consider the history of the conduct of the case. Government Code section 68608, subdivision (b) provides: \u201cJudges shall have all the powers to impose sanctions authorized by law, including the power to dismiss actions or strike pleadings, <em>if it appears that less severe sanctions would not be effective after taking into account the effect of previous sanctions or previous lack of compliance in the case. </em>Judges are encouraged to impose sanctions to achieve the purpose of this [Act].\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Code of Civil Procedure section 575.2, subdivision (a) permits a court\u2019s local rules to prescribe sanctions, including dismissal of an action, for noncompliance with those rules. However, like Government Code section 68608, subdivision (b), there is an important limitation placed upon a judge\u2019s exercise of this power. This limitation is found in subdivision (b) of section 575.2 which provides: \u201cIt is the intent <em>of </em>the Legislature that if a failure to comply with these rules is the responsibility of counsel and not of the party, any penalty shall be imposed on counsel and shall not adversely affect the party\u2019s cause of action or defense thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">In <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>McCutchen </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 469 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 319, 940 P.2d 906], the California Supreme Court concluded that, under governing statutes, a court may not dismiss an action for noncompliance with local court rules implementing the Act, if the noncompliance is the responsibility of counsel, not the litigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">In harmonizing the Act with this provision of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Supreme Court explained, \u201cNothing in either the statutory language or the legislative history of the Act reflects a legislative intent to override section 575.2(b)\u2019s limits on a court\u2019s sanctioning powers or to give courts expanded dismissal powers with respect to fast track rules. Instead, the words the Legislature chose reflect a contrary intent, i.e., to give courts only those sanctioning powers \u2018authorized by law.\u2019 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68608(b).)\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (16 Cal.4th at pp. 481-482.)</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Therefore, there are at least two limitations or restrictions on the trial court\u2019s power to dismiss an action for noncompliance with local rules: (1) dismissal is inappropriate if the noncompliance was the responsibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>counsel alone, rather than the party (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 575.2, subd. (b); <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>McCutchen, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 481); and (2) dismissal is appropriate only if less severe sanctions would be ineffective (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68608, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">3. <em>Application of Facts to the Law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">In dismissing the action on September 23, 1996, the trial court did not state its reasons. The order signed by the court stated: \u201cOrder to Show Cause Re: Failure to Prosecute the Case; [\u00b6] No appearance by 9:30 a.m. [\u00b6] Case is dismissed in its entirety. [\u00b6] It Is So Ordered.\u201d However, at the March 5, 1997, hearing on Tliche\u2019s motion for an order vacating the dismissal, the trial court explained that it dismissed the action because the case had been pending for more than nine months and the defendants had not been served, in violation of Superior Court of Los Angeles County Rules, local rule 7.7, which requires the complaint be served within sixty days of its filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The act of service of the complaint when a party is represented by counsel is usually an act peculiarly within the control of counsel, and not the party. We recognize there may be cases where the party, not counsel, is the reason for nonservice, for example where the party has directed the attorney not to serve the complaint. The court might, in certain cases, infer client culpability where a previous sanction order or orders have not brought about compliance with the court\u2019s local rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">However, in this case there is no evidence of prior sanctions against either the party or counsel nor is there evidence in the record that the client was in any way responsible for the delay in service of the complaint on the defendants. Under these circumstances, the order of dismissal must be reversed. It was premature and unauthorized as the trial court failed to apply statutorily mandated principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">4. <em>The Time Limitations of Code of Civil Procedure section 583.410 et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">Citing <em>Roman </em>v. <em>Usary Tire &amp; Service Center </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1422 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 329], Tliche contends the time limitations specified in the Code of Civil Procedure proscribe the trial court\u2019s authority to dismiss an action for delay in prosecution under delay reduction rules. Accordingly, Tilche argues, the case may not be dismissed unless service is delayed for more than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">In <em>Roman </em>v. <em>Usary Tire &amp; Service Center, supra, 29 </em>Cal.App.4th 1422, this division does not address dismissal pursuant to fast track rules.f In <em>Roman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>the trial court dismissed the action one year and eleven months after the complaint was filed, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 583.410, subdivision (a), a provision in article 4 of chapter 1.5 of title 8 of the code (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 583.410-583.430, \u201cDiscretionary Dismissal for Delay\u201d). The Court of Appeal reversed the order of dismissal, holding the trial court lacked authority to dismiss this case pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 583.410, subdivision (a), because that provision is expressly subject to the time limitations specified in section 583.420. Section 583.420 provides, in relevant part: \u201c(a) The court may not dismiss an action <em>pursuant to this article </em>for delay in prosecution except after one of the following conditions has occurred: [\u00b6] (1) Service is not made within two years after the action is commenced against the defendant.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Roman, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1430-1431.) The decision in <em>Roman </em>has no relevance to the trial court\u2019s authority pursuant to fast track rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">That this is so is further made clear by Code of Civil Procedure section 583.150, which provides that the entire chapter (Chapter 1.5) \u201c. . . does not limit or affect the authority of a court to dismiss an action or impose other sanctions under a rule adopted by the court pursuant to Section 575.1 or by the Judicial Council pursuant to statute, or otherwise under inherent authority of the court.\u201d The fast track rules are such rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Therefore, there is no prohibition against a local court, by local rule, providing for dismissal of an action if the summons and complaint have not been served within 60 days provided: (1) the failure to serve is the fault of the client and not the attorney and (2) less severe sanctions have not been effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">5. <em>The Motions to Vacate the Order of Dismissal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">In light of our finding that the initial order of dismissal was invalid, the propriety of the trial court\u2019s rulings on Tliche\u2019s subsequent motions to vacate the order of dismissal is no longer pertinent. In his first motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, Tliche\u2019s counsel mistakenly focused on his failure to appear, not on his failure to serve<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (see, e.g., <em>Rogalski </em>v. <em>Nabers Cadillac </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 816, 821 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 286]), and then delayed so that his second motion to vacate the order of dismissal was untimely and beyond the jurisdiction of the court. <em>(Northridge Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>Hamblin </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 819, 825 [122 Cal.Rptr. 109].) Tliche, the client, should not lose his action through the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>error in ordering dismissal, which error was compounded by Tliche\u2019s own counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the order effectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Order of dismissal reversed. The case is remanded to the trial court with directions to vacate the order of dismissal and to reconsider the imposition of sanctions for the violation of the local delay reduction rule regarding the failure to serve the summons and complaint within 60 days. Tliche\u2019s counsel is to bear costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Croskey, Acting P. J., and Goodman, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Superior Court of Los Angeles County Rules, local rule 7.7 states: \u201c(c) The failure to meet the deadline set forth in Subdivision (a) may result in the issuance of an Order to Show Cause why sanctions should not be imposed, including dismissal for failure to prosecute (Code of Civil Procedure Section 583.150 and Government Code Section 68608(b)) or, alternatively, why other action should not be taken. At the hearing on such OSC the Court may (1) impose such sanctions as authorized by law and (2) make further appropriate orders regarding the preparation of the case for trial. Failure to attend the hearing on such OSC may result in additional sanctions, including dismissal of the case (see Rule 7.13).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AH0\">Superior Court of Los Angeles County Rules, local rule 7.13 states: \u201cThe Court may impose appropriate sanctions for the failure or refusal (1) to comply with the Rules, (2) to comply with any order made hereunder or (3) to meet the time standards and/or deadlines established herein. Counsel are directed to Code of Civil Procedure sections 128, 128.5, 177.5, 575.2, 583.150, 583.430, 2016 through 2036, Government Code Section 68609(d), and Rule 227 of the California Rules of Court. Such sanctions may be imposed on a party and/or, if appropriate, on counsel for such party. While the court may impose sanctions for specified conduct, the court should do' so sparingly and only when clearly warranted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"As_\">Defendants filed a demurrer and motion to strike, scheduled for hearing on November 26, 1996.
