(MCM) appeals from the judgment of the San Francisco Superior Court denying its petition for writ of mandate. MCM sought to compel respondent City and County of San Francisco (City) to set aside its award of a contract for construction of inbound and outbound highway ramps at the San Francisco International Airport to respondent Myers/Kulchin-Condon, a joint venture (Myers) and to award the contract to MCM. MCM contends the City abused its discretion in rejecting its bid as nonresponsive. MCM further contends the City abused its discretion in waiving deviations from bid instructions by Myers and in awarding the contract to Myers. In response, the City and Myers argue not only that the City did not abuse its discretion in rejecting MCM\u2019s bid and in awarding the contract to Myers, but also assert that MCM waived its right to challenge the award of the contract to Myers by failing to timely protest Myers\u2019s bid and that MCM lacks standing to challenge the award of the contract to Myers. We shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Factual And Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The City, through its airport commission, is in the midst of a $2.4 billion expansion of the San Francisco International Airport (Airport). On December 23, 1996, the Airport commission authorized the Airport director to solicit bids for construction of the new inbound and outbound highway access ramps for the Airport, contract No. 5905.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">On April 3, 1997, the Airport received four bids for contract No. 5905.A. The bidders and the approximate amounts of their bids were: R.M. Harris Corporation (Harris)\u2014$59.1 million; MCM\u2014$64.1 million; Myers\u2014$66.1 million; and Morrison-Knudsen/Kiewit Pacific, Joint Venture (MK)\u2014$72.7 million. Although Harris\u2019s bid was the lowest, it was rejected as nonresponsive because Harris failed to list any of its subcontractors and did not comply with any of the City\u2019s minority business enterprise (MBE) and woman-owned business enterprise (WBE) requirements. MCM\u2019s bid was second low, followed by Myers and MK.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The Airport\u2019s \u201cInstructions to Bidders\u201d required each competitor to submit its bid documents in three separate envelopes, marked A, B, and C. Envelopes A and B were to be submitted at or before 2 p.m. April 3, 1997. Envelope C was to be submitted at or before 5 p.m. April 3, 1997. Paragraph 18.f of the bidding instructions specified that envelope B was to contain various documents, including form 430 (\u201cSubcontractors List\u201d), on which bidders were to list all subcontractors, suppliers, truckers and vendors whose work or service would exceed one-half of 1 percent of the total bid, indicating which of the firms, if any, bidders intended to use to meet the MBE/WBE subcontracting goals for the contract. That provision also clearly stated that the bidder must \u201cfurnish information required on this form, in accordance with instructions contained herein, and Section 6.48 of the SFAC [San Francisco Administrative Code].\u201d Section 6.48 of the San Francisco Administrative Code requires in part that the bidder set forth a \u201cbrief description of the work which will be done\u201d by each subcontractor listed and the \u201camount to be paid\u201d to each such subcontractor. (S.F. Admin. Code, \u00a7 6.48.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Envelope C was to contain, among other documents, form 431 (\u201cSupplemental Subcontractors List\u201d), which required similar information as to subcontractors, suppliers, truckers and vendors that the bidder intended to use to meet the MBE/WBE goals, whose work or service would equal or be less than one-half of 1 percent of the total bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The Instructions to Bidders cautioned that bidders \u201cmust supply all information required by Bid documents and specifications. Bids must be full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>and complete. The Commission reserves the right in its sole discretion to reject any Bid as nonresponsive as a result of any error or omission in the Bid.\u201d (Instructions to Bidders, \u00b6 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Envelopes B and C were opened after 5 p.m.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Harris bid was lowest. However, it failed to meet several bid requirements and Harris did not challenge the commission staff\u2019s preliminary determination that its bid was nonresponsive. MCM\u2019s bid was second lowest, followed by Myers and MK.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">MCM\u2019s form 430, submitted in envelope B, listed nine subcontractors, but failed to identify, as required, the price to be paid to seven of those subcontractors. MCM also failed to describe the work to be performed by one of the subcontractors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Myers submitted six pages of form 430 in envelope B at 2 p.m. When all the bids were opened at 5 p.m. it was discovered that Myers had submitted a single page of form 430 in the wrong envelope. Instead of being in envelope B, delivered to the Airport prior to 2 p.m., a single page of form 430 listing Rosendin Electric as a subcontractor at a price of $3 million was included in envelope C, which was submitted at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">On April 7, 1997, the commission, through the project manager for this contract, notified MCM that its bid \u201cappear[ed] to be nonresponsive,\u201d as its failure to list dollar amounts for seven of the nine subcontractors violated the requirements of the bidding documents and San Francisco Administrative Code section 6.48. In addition, Myers and MK wrote the Airport staff protesting the nonresponsive bids by Harris and MCM, while MK further protested the responsiveness of Myers\u2019s bid. MCM did not protest any of its competitor\u2019s higher priced bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">On April 11, 1997, MCM responded to the Airport, asserting that the City could not legally require it to list the prices to be paid to subcontractors, as section 6.48 of the San Francisco Administrative Code imposed requirements above and beyond the mandates of state law, and therefore could not be used to determine the responsiveness of MCM\u2019s bid. In addition, MCM argued, its failure to include that information was inconsequential and should be waived. On April 17, 1997, MCM sent to the Airport a list of subcontractors, bid items, and dollar amounts related to the work those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>subcontractors would do. MCM asserted that the commission could use that list to \u201cdetermine the approximate prices of each subcontractor\u2019s work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">On April 23, 1997, Myers responded to a protest filed by the highest bidder, MK. Myers argued that its deviation from the strict letter of the bid instructions was at most a minor \u201cirregularity\u201d which the Airport had authority to waive. In support of its response, Myers submitted the declarations of Mona Borup and Michael Condon, members of Myers\u2019s bid team. Borup, the Kulchin-Condon contract administrator who wrote out the Rosendin Electric information on the form 430 page, declared that among the forms she had prepared before 2 p.m. for inclusion in envelope B was the page that instead was included in envelope C. In particular, Borup testified that she \u201cpersonally wrote Rosendin\u2019s name and price in the appropriate form and placed the filled-out form with the other subcontractor listing forms that I knew had to be sealed in Envelope B.\u201d She personally verified by means of her handwriting that the form unsealed by the Airport staff in Myers\u2019s envelope C was the same form she prepared prior to 2 p.m. Both Borup and Condon verified that, to the best of their knowledge, no member of the Myers\u2019s bid team communicated with Rosendin or any other electrical contractor between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. on April 3d. Myers also reminded the Airport staff that, in accordance with paragraph 20 of the bid instructions, all bidders\u2019 envelopes B and C remained sealed until after the official bid opening at 5 p.m., further negating the chance that some unfair advantage could have been obtained by Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The bids, protests and responses were evaluated by the Airport staff and the city attorney. They concluded the subcontractor information MCM had omitted from its form 430 could not be determined by looking at other bid documents. Accordingly, that omission could not be waived and the bid was nonresponsive. The staff also concluded that Myers\u2019s bid substantially conformed to the bid requirements, in that the inclusion of the Rosendin page in envelope C did not affect the amount of the bid or give an unfair advantage to Myers. On April 25, 1997, the Airport staff notified MCM that it intended to recommend to the commission, at its May 6, 1997, meeting, that MCM\u2019s bid be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">At its May 6, 1997, meeting, the commission heard testimony from staff and from counsel for MK, MCM, and Myers. The commission also had before it a letter from MCM, dated May 5, 1997, and submitted for the hearing, reiterating MCM\u2019s position and, for the first time, challenging the fairness of waiving the Myers\u2019s bid deviations. Following the staff\u2019s report and recommendation, counsel for MCM spoke, reiterating its argument that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>its bid was responsive and challenging the responsiveness of Myers\u2019s bid, primarily by referring to the remarks previously made by MK\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing the commission voted to award the contract to Myers, finding that MCM\u2019s bid was nonresponsive because it failed to comply with the requirements of the bid invitation and the San Francisco Administrative Code. The resolution adopted by the commission found that \u201cany nonconformity in the [Myers] bid constitutes a minor irregularity which does not impact the time, price or quality of the work supplied, and therefore an informality which the Commission may and does waive in deciding to award this contract . . . .\u201d (Airport Com. Res. No. 97-0119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">On May 7, 1997, MCM filed a petition for writ of mandate. After a hearing on May 23, 1997, Judge William J. Cahill denied the petition. MCM then filed a petition for writ of mandate and request for stay in this court, which we denied on June 11, 1997. A final judgment and order of dismissal was entered by the superior court on June 16, 1997. On June 17, 1997, MCM appealed from the order denying its petition and on June 30, 1997, from the final judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">\n<em>The Airport Commission Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Finding MCM\u2019s Bid Nonresponsive</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">MCM contends the City abused its discretion in rejecting MCM\u2019s bid as nonresponsive on the basis that MCM failed to list the dollar amount of work to be performed by subcontractors. MCM argues that this requirement, imposed by the City\u2019s invitation to bid and San Francisco Administrative Code section 6.48(c), could not serve as the basis for determining responsiveness as it imposed a requirement above and beyond the requirements of the Subletting and Subcontracting Fair Practices Act (Act). (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 4100 et seq.) Second, MCM argues that in the event these requirements are valid, the City could and should have waived this deviation from the strict requirements of the bid documents as the deviation did not affect the amount of MCM\u2019s bid and was, consequently, insubstantial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Finally, MCM contends the City\u2019s conduct in rejecting MCM\u2019s bid as nonresponsive, while waiving the deviations in the Myers bid, constituted favoritism. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Appellate review of the award of a public contract is governed by certain well-established principles. In a mandamus action arising under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, we limit our review to an examination of the proceedings before the agency to determine whether its findings and actions are supported by substantial evidence. (E.g., <em>Ghilotti Construction Co. </em>v. <em>City of Richmond </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 897, 903-904 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 389] <em>(Ghilotti); Valley Crest Landscape, Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1432, 1437 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 184]; <em>Konica Business Machines U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 449, 453-454 [253 Cal.Rptr. 591] <em>(Konica); Taylor Bus Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Diego Bd. of Education </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 1331, 1340-1341 [241 Cal.Rptr. 379].) \u201cOur review is limited to an examination of the proceedings to determine whether the City\u2019s actions were arbitrary, capricious, entirely lacking in evidentiary support or inconsistent with proper procedure. There is a presumption that the City\u2019s actions were supported by substantial evidence, and [petitioner/plaintiff] has the burden of proving otherwise. We may not reweigh the evidence and must view it in the light most favorable to the City\u2019s actions, indulging all reasonable inferences in support of those actions. [Citations.] Mandamus is an appropriate remedy to compel the exercise of discretion by a government agency, but does not lie to control the exercise of discretion unless under the facts, discretion can only be exercised in one way. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ghilotti, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th 897, 903-904, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u201cGenerally, cities, as well as other public entities, are required to put significant contracts out for competitive bidding and to award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder. (See, e.g., Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 20162.) A bidder is responsible if it can perform the contract as promised. <em>(Taylor Bus Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Diego Bd. of Education, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at p. 1341. ) A bid is responsive if it promises to do what the bidding instructions require. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Usually, whether a bid is responsive can be determined from the face of the bid without outside investigation or information. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1342. )\u201d <em>(Valley Crest Landscape, Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th 1432, 1438.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">\u201cIn enacting the Subletting and Subcontracting Fair Practices Act (the Act), the Legislature found the practices of bid shopping and bid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>peddling[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] resulted in poor quality of materials and workmanship, deprived the public of the benefits of fair competition, and led to insolvencies, loss of wages, and other evils. (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 4101.) Bid shopping occurs where the general contractor uses the lowest bid received to pressure other subcontractors to submit even lower bids. [Citation.] The Act requires bidders for public contracts to list the names of all subcontractors who will perform work in an amount in excess of one-half of 1 percent of the prime contractor\u2019s bid. (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 4104, subd. (a).) The bidder must also set forth: \u2018The portion of the work which will be done by each subcontractor under this act. The prime contractor shall list only one subcontractor for each portion as is defined by the prime contractor in his or her bid.\u2019 (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 4104, subd. (b).)\u201d <em>(Valley Crest Landscape, Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th 1432, 1438.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u201cThe purpose of requiring governmental entities to open the contracts process to public bidding is to eliminate favoritism, fraud and corruption; avoid misuse of public funds; and stimulate advantageous market place competition. (See legis. intent declared in Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 10300; [citations].) Because of the potential for abuse arising from deviations from strict adherence to standards which promote these public benefits, the letting of public contracts universally receives close judicial scrutiny and contracts awarded without strict compliance with bidding requirements will be set aside. This preventative approach is applied even where it is certain there was in fact no corruption or adverse effect upon the bidding process, and the deviations would save the entity money. [Citations.] The importance of maintaining integrity in government and the ease with which policy goals underlying the requirement for open competitive bidding may be surreptitiously undercut, mandate strict compliance with bidding requirements. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Konica, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d at pp. 456-457.) In <em>Domar Electric, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 161, 176 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 521, 885 P.2d 934], the Supreme Court cited this passage from <em>Konica </em>with approval. (See <em>Ghilotti, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at pp. 907-908.)  However, \u201c[t]he rule of strict compliance with bidding requirements does not preclude the contracting entity from waiving inconsequential deviations.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 908.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\u201cOther cases cited by <em>Konica, supra, </em>for the proposition that a deviating bid must be set aside despite the absence of corruption or actual adverse effect on the bidding process make it clear that the deviation must be capable of facilitating corruption or extravagance, or likely to affect the amount of bids or the response of potential bidders. [Citations.] These considerations must be evaluated from a practical rather than a hypothetical standpoint, with reference to the factual circumstances of the case. They must also be viewed in light of the public interest, rather than the private interest of a disappointed bidder. \u2018It certainly would amount to a disservice to the public if a losing bidder were to be permitted to comb through the bid proposal or license application of the low bidder after the fact, [and] cancel the low bid on minor technicalities, with the hope of securing acceptance of his, a higher bid. Such construction would be adverse to the best interests of the public and contrary to public policy.\u2019 <em>(Judson Pacific-Murphy Corp. </em>v. <em>Durkee </em>(1956) 144 Cal.App.2d 377, 383 . . . .)\u201d <em>(Ghilotti, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at pp. 908-909.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn to MCM\u2019s contention that the requirement that bidders list the dollar amount of work to be performed by subcontractors, imposed by the City\u2019s invitation to bid and San Francisco Administrative Code section 6.48(c), could not serve as the basis for determining responsiveness. MCM argues that the City could not enforce a requirement above and beyond those of the Act. We are convinced the City can enforce its own more restrictive bid requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">MCM relies upon <em>Valley Crest Landscape, Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th 1432 <em>(Valley Crest), </em>for the proposition that the City may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>impose an additional requirement not found in the Act. We do not so read the case. In fact, it stands for the opposite position, holding that the city could not waive a requirement of its own specification to bidders requiring the contractor to perform contract work amounting to not less than 50 percent of the original total contract price. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1436, 1441.) In <em>Valley Crest </em>the bid request required the bidder perform at least 50 percent of the work itself and required the bidder to set forth the percentage of work to be performed by each subcontractor. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1435.) The low bidder listed subcontractor work as 83 percent of its bid. When the city pointed this out to the low bidder, it responded that the percentages were not correct and submitted new percentages totaling 44.65 percent. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Valley Crest, the second lowest bidder on the project, petitioned for a writ of mandate to set aside the award of the contract to the low bidder as nonresponsive on the ground that changes made in the low bid violated the Act. The Court of Appeal held that the low bidder could not change its bid and the city could not waive the deviation. <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, in reaching that conclusion, the court first rejected Valley Crest\u2019s contention that the change of subcontractor percentages violated the Act. It agreed with the city and the low bidder that \u201cthe Act does not require the percentage of the subcontractor\u2019s work; that requirement was imposed by the City to ensure compliance with the City\u2019s requirement that the prime contractor perform at least 50 percent of the contract.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1439.) The Act referred to the \u201cportion\u201d of work to be done by each subcontractor. (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 4104, subd (b).) That \u201cportion\u201d need not be stated as a percentage of the contract. \u201cWe decline to add a requirement not found in the statute. We conclude the percentage requirement was included to show compliance with ... the specifications and was independent of the requirements of the Act.\u201d (41 Cal.App.4th at p. 1440.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The Court of Appeal simply refused to read into the <em>Act </em>an additional requirement not found in the <em>Act </em>itself. It did not preclude the city from using its more restrictive bid specifications to determine bid responsiveness. Indeed, the Court of Appeal refused to allow the city to waive its own 50 percent requirement because the \u201cspecification made listing the subcontractor percentages a material element of the bid.\u201d (41 Cal.App.4th at p. 1443.) The appellate court refused to allow application of the doctrine that inconsequential irregularities may be waived by the city to permit the change in bid percentages. The court reasoned that waiver of an irregularity in a bid should be allowed only if it would not give the bidder an unfair advantage by allowing it to withdraw its bid without forfeiting its bid bond. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1442-1443.) \u201cThe City could not permit the mistake as to this material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>element of the bid to be corrected by purporting to \u2018waive an irregularity.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1443.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Valley Crest </em>does not support MCM\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Moreover, as a \u201ccharter city,\u201d as that status is recognized in the California Constitution (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3), the City is empowered by the Constitution to govern its own \u201cmunicipal affairs\u201d to the extent the field is not preempted by state law. In this regard, article XI, section 5, provides in relevant part: \u201cIt shall be competent in any city charter to provide that the city governed thereunder may make and enforce all ordinances and regulations in respect to municipal affairs, subject only to the restrictions and limitations provided in their several charters and in respect to other matters they shall be subject to general laws.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 5, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">On appeal, MCM does not expressly argue that state law preempts the City\u2019s efforts to impose bidding requirements for public works projects in addition to those required in the Act. Rather, it argues that the City could not impose requirements \u201cabove and beyond\u201d the Act. Our Supreme Court has held, \u201cThe expenditure of city funds on a city\u2019s public works project is a municipal affair. . . .\u201d <em>(Domar Electric Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th 161, 170-171, citations omitted.) \u201cThus, it is within the purview of a chartered city\u2019s ample autonomy over municipal affairs to enact a comprehensive program designed to achieve the fiscally sound purposes of competitive bidding.

The City argues that MCM\u2019s failure to list the dollar amount of work to be performed by subcontractors was material and not waivable by the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">As a threshold matter, MCM\u2019s argument founders upon its assumption that if the deviation from bid specifications were immaterial and thus could be waived by the City, the City necessarily abused its discretion in refusing to waive the deviation. No case cited by MCM holds that where the City <em>can </em>waive a deviation it <em>must </em>do so. In <em>Valley Crest, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th 1432, the court reversed the city\u2019s waiver of a bid requirement, where the requirement was held material and hence not waivable. In <em>Ghilotti, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th 897, the court held the city did not err in waiving insubstantial variations' from specifications. These authorities do not support the proposition that the contracting agency <em>must </em>waive deviations from bid requirements where it has the power to do so. These cases and others like them, which address the issue whether and under what circumstances a deviation from bid specifications is waivable by the agency, use permissive language to describe the agency\u2019s power to waive immaterial deviations: \u201c[A] bid which substantially conforms to a call for bids <em>may, </em>though it is not strictly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>responsive, <em>be accepted </em>if the variance cannot have affected the amount of the bid or given a bidder an advantage or benefit not allowed other bidders or, in other words, if the variance is inconsequential.

Clearly the foregoing language is not mandatory, but permissive.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">MCM concedes, as it must, that it did not fully comply with bid specifications. Given that fact, the City was not required to award MCM the bid even if its deviations were immaterial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> An agency has discretion to waive immaterial deviations from bid specifications and may accept the bid under certain conditions.

One such finding is that the omitted sums <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>could not be determined from the bid. At the commission hearing, Tom Kardos, deputy director of the Airport, was asked whether he agreed with MCM that one could determine the subcontractor amounts from the actual information within MCM\u2019s bid package. He responded in the negative. \u201cThe bid did not define the scope of the individual subcontractors participating in that particular bid item. So we made a special effort, staff did, to try to decipher and establish the scope associated with the role of the subcontractors, and we weren\u2019t able to establish those, the associated amounts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u201c \u2018Whether in any given case a bid varies substantially or only inconsequentially from the call for bids is a question of fact.\u2019 (47 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen., <em>supra, </em>at p. 131.) Under <em>Konica, </em>the factual issue to be resolved is whether the variation resulted in an unfair competitive advantage in the bidding process.\u201d <em>(Ghilotti, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 906.)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The City and Myers do not contend the failure to list the dollar amount of work to be performed by each subcontractor could have affected the amount of the bid. Rather, they contend MCM received an advantage or benefit not allowed other bidders in that it was given the opportunity to withdraw its bid. Several cases have concluded that \u201c[w]aiver of an irregularity in a bid should only be allowed if it would not give the bidder an unfair advantage by allowing the bidder to withdraw its bid without forfeiting its bid bond. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Valley Crest, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at p. 1442, citing <em>Menefee </em>v. <em>County of Fresno, supra, </em>163 Cal.App.3d 1175, 1178-1181.)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">In <em>Valley Crest, </em>the court found the bidder had an unfair advantage where it could have withdrawn its bid under Public Contract Code section 5103. \u201cMisstating the correct percentage of work to be done by a subcontractor is in the nature of a typographical or arithmetical error. It makes the bid materially different and is a mistake in filling out the bid. As such, under Public Contract Code section 5103, North Bay [the low bidder] could have sought relief by giving the City notice of the mistake within five days of the opening of the bid. That North Bay did not seek such relief is of no moment. The key point is that such relief was available. Thus, North Bay had a benefit not available to the other bidders; it could have backed out. Its mistake, therefore, could not be corrected by waiving an \u2018irregularity.\u2019 \u201d (41 Cal.App.4th at p. 1442, fn. omitted.) At the same time, the court noted that \u201capart from the relief afforded by section 5103 of the Public Contract Code, the City gave North Bay the opportunity to withdraw its bid. The City\u2019s letter to North Bay stated the bid would be considered nonresponsive unless North Bay provided additional information.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1442, fn. 1.) Subsequently, <em>Ghilotti </em>refused to read <em>Valley Crest </em>as holding that a <em>potential </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>competitive advantage precludes waiver of a bid irregularity, without the necessity of showing an <em>actual </em>advantage. \u201cThe <em>Valley Crest </em>court held North Bay had an actual advantage, not only because it could have obtained relief under the Public Contract Code as a matter of law, but also because the city expressly gave North Bay the opportunity to withdraw its bid. (41 Cal.App.4th at p. 1442, and fn. 1.)\u201d <em>(Ghilotti, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 912, fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Here, too, MCM had an <em>actual </em>advantage as the City gave MCM an opportunity to withdraw its bid without forfeiting its bid bond when it informed MCM that its bid would be considered nonresponsive if it did not provide additional information. The City advised MCM that in such case it would proceed to review the next lowest bid.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">MCM responds that the City cannot unilaterally create an unfair advantage situation by giving a nonresponsive bidder the opportunity to withdraw its bid. Although this is an interesting question, it need not detain us long. Initially, we point out that the question only arises because of MCM\u2019s failure to comply with valid bid requirements of the San Francisco Administrative Code and the invitation to bid. In no other instance that we have found has the nonresponsive bidder argued that the city was prohibited from allowing it to withdraw its bid, but rather was required to waive deviations from bid requirements. In any event, MCM had not only an <em>actual </em>opportunity to withdraw its bid, but also was <em>entitled </em>to do so under the provisions of Public Contract Code section 5103.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\"><em>Menefee </em>v. <em>County of Fresno, supra, </em>163 Cal.App.3d 1175, found that under the statutes for relief of bidders on public contracts,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the only mistakes which could release a bidder from its bid are typographical or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>arithmetical errors, not mistaken submission of a bid. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1181; Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 5103.) \u201cRelief is only allowed if the bidder can establish that \u2018[t]he mistake was made in filling out the bid and not due to error in judgment or to carelessness in inspecting the site of the work, or in reading the plans or specifications.\u2019 (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 5103, subd. (d).) This statute clearly does not contemplate relief from the mistaken <em>submission </em>of a bid.\u201d <em>(Menefee </em>v. <em>County of Fresno, supra, </em>at p. 1181, italics in original.) <em>Menefee </em>held that where a bidder had failed to sign the bid on the appropriate line, the bid was nevertheless valid because it was signed elsewhere. The relief sought was not for a typographical or arithmetical error, but for a mistaken submission of a bid. Consequently, the bidder could not be released from its bid. Since relief was not available, the irregularity could be waived. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><em>Valley Crest </em>held that misstating the correct percentage of work to be done by a subcontractor was \u201cin the nature of a typographical or arithmetical error. It makes the bid materially different and is a mistake in filling out the bid.\u201d As such, the contractor could have sought relief under Public Contract Code section 5103. Consequently, the contractor\u2019s ability to withdraw its bid without forfeiting its bond constituted an unfair advantage and the city could not waive the irregularity. <em>(Valley Crest, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th 1432, 1442.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">We believe the failure to state dollar amounts of work to be performed by seven of nine subcontractors is, like the misstatement of the correct percentage of work to be done by subcontractors in <em>Valley Crest, </em>\u201cin the nature of a typographical or arithmetical error.\u201d As such, MCM could have sought relief under the statute and had an advantage not available to other bidders. The City was without power to waive the deviation.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">MCM contends that the City acted unfairly in refusing to waive its deviations from bid specifications, while waiving Myers\u2019s mistakes. First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>we agree with the City and Myers that Myers\u2019s untimely submission of its Rosendin subcontractor listing was different from the type of deviation of the MCM bid. As explained by Deputy City Attorney Gretchen Nicholson at the commission hearing: \u201cAs I understand the question, you want to know why one deviation can be waived and why the other deviation cannot be waived. [\u00b6] The requirement to list the amount of the subcontract is a requirement of San Francisco\u2019s Administrative Code Provision 6.48 and that is something that the Commission and the City has consistently enforced. It was enacted to discourage bid shopping. It is not something that is waived. [\u00b6] Whereas the failure to list the subcontractor in the 2 o\u2019clock envelope and instead list it in the 5 o\u2019clock envelope was not a change in the bid or a correction of a mistake in the bid. The envelope that came in at 5 o\u2019clock was part of the bid. It came admittedly in at the wrong time, but it was a deviation which didn\u2019t go to affecting the price or give a competitive advantage, and that\u2019s why it can be waived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Moreover, to the extent MCM\u2019s argument may be construed to contend that the City\u2019s award to Myers constituted favoritism, MCM failed to make any showing or to introduce any evidence of such \u201cfavoritism\u201d apart from the fact that City found Myers\u2019s deviation inconsequential and its bid responsive and refused to waive a very different type of bid deviation by MCM, finding its bid nonresponsive. MCM failed to demonstrate favoritism.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Finally, to the extent such claim of unfairness is rooted in MCM\u2019s challenge of the award of the contract to Myers, it must fail because, as we explain hereafter, MCM waived any right to challenge the award of the contract to Myers by failing to protest Myers\u2019s bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\n<em>MCM Waived Any Right to Challenge Myers\u2019s Bid</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Respondents argue that MCM cannot challenge the award of the public works contract to Myers. They contend that MCM waived any right to protest Myers\u2019s bid by failing to comply with mandatory procedures set forth in the bid instructions for bid protests. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">The bid instructions for the contract set forth mandatory procedures for bid protests. (Instructions to Bidders, \u00b6 22.) These included the requirement that \u201cany bid protest must be submitted in writing to [the] Deputy Director <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>. . . before 5 p.m. of the 10th business day following bid opening.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Consequently, to protest the Myers\u2019s bid, MCM was required to do so in writing, with accompanying documentation, including \u201ca complete statement for the basis for the protest\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6 22, subd. (a)), on or before April 17, 1997. The bid instructions provide that \u201cThe procedure and time limits set forth in this paragraph are mandatory and are the Bidder\u2019s sole and exclusive remedy in the event of Bid protest and failure to comply with these procedures shall constitute a waiver of any right to further pursue the Bid protest, including filing a Government Code Claim or legal proceedings.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6 22, subd. (f).) MCM did not protest Myers\u2019s bid in the manner or in the time provided by the instructions. MCM apparently left it to MK to protest Myers\u2019s bid.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">MCM thereafter pursued only the rejection of its own bid. It argued that its bid was responsive and that the Airport should award it the contract. Correspondence between the Airport, MCM, and MK also demonstrates that the Airport and the parties viewed MK as the only party challenging Myers\u2019s bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The first time MCM raised any challenge to Myers\u2019s bid was in connection with the May 6, 1997, hearing of the Airport commission to act on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>staff recommendation that the contract be awarded to Myers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> By letter dated May 5, 1997, counsel for MCM for the first time argued that it was \u201cunfair and illogical to award to Myers . . . .\u201d In this letter, MCM argued that the City could not waive Myers\u2019s deviation from strict bidding requirements, yet enforce the same requirements against MCM. Even in this context it is not clear that MCM was protesting Myers\u2019s bid, so much as it was arguing the unfairness in holding MCM to the letter of the bid instructions, while agreeing to waive deviations by Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">MCM contends that protest requirements are in the nature of a forfeiture and are never enforced absent actual prejudice. Because Myers\u2019s bid was duly protested by MK and because the City considered this protest on its merits, MCM argues no one was prejudiced by its failure to protest Myers\u2019s bid. MCM also contends that \u201cOnly substantial compliance with the protest provisions is required, which was fulfilled by the timely protest of Myers\u2019 bid <em>by </em>MK.\u201d (Italics added.) Finally, MCM contends the City waived any failure on the part of MCM to strictly comply with bid protest requirements by considering the protest to Myers\u2019s bid on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">MCM relies upon a faulty premise and inapplicable authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">There is no indication the Airport \u201cwaived\u201d its requirements regarding the proper method for protesting a bid. Indeed, the resolution adopted by the commission awarding the contract to Myers refers to the bid protests in the plural when referencing all bid protests (including protests of the Harris, MCM, and Myers bids), but refers in the singular to- its rejection of \u201cthe bid <em>protest </em>with regard to the Myers . . . bid as being without merit. . . .\u201d (Airport Com. Res. No. 97-0119, italics added.) This is obviously a reference to the single protest filed by MK. There is no indication in the administrative record that the City intended to or in fact did waive its right to enforce its bid protest procedures. In the superior court mandamus action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the City continued to assert that MCM waived its right to challenge the award to Myers because it had not submitted a bid protest pursuant to paragraph 22 of the bid instructions for the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">That MK timely protested Myers\u2019s bid does not have any bearing upon whether MCM strictly or even \u201csubstantially\u201d complied with the procedures established by the invitation to bid. Nor does <em>Milovich </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1941) 42 Cal.App.2d 364 [108 P.2d 960] support MCM\u2019s argument that \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the protest requirements was fulfilled by MK\u2019s filing of its protest. In <em>Milovich, </em>the plaintiff sought damages for breach of a contract with the Los Angeles Department of Public Works (which the Board of Water and Power had executed in the name of the department.) The city charter required claims against the city to be presented to the board, officer or employee authorized to incur the expenditure, which the city claimed was the Board of Water and Power commissioners. The plaintiff, pursuant to provisions of the contract, filed his complaint with the chief engineer and manager of the Bureau of Water Works and Supply of the Department of Water and Power. The plaintiff was notified that the claim had been rejected, by a writing on the letterhead of the Department of Water and Power. The court affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that the Board of Water and Power commissioners, who signed the contract for and in behalf of the Department of Water and Power, acted upon and rejected the claim. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 372.) Consequently, the appellate court held that the plaintiff had \u201ccomplied substantially\u201d with the provisions of the City charter. The plaintiff had made a \u201cbona fide attempt to comply with the law\u201d by submitting the claim to the chief engineer and general manager of the contracting department. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\"><em>Milovich </em>itself serves to highlight the insufficiency of MCM\u2019s claim of substantial compliance. The plaintiff in <em>Milovich </em>promptly filed his claim against the public entity. He did not assert, as MCM does here, that the challenge of another entity relieved him of any duty to file his own claim. Further, the plaintiff in <em>Milovich </em>complied with the provisions of the contract concerning filing of claims. No remotely similar efforts toward \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d were made by MCM in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Finally, those cases cited by MCM for the proposition that \u201ccourt\u2019s [sic] never enforce such protest requirements in the absence of actual prejudice\u201d are inapposite. In <em>Blair Excavators, Inc. </em>v. <em>Paschen Contractors Inc. </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1815 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 420], a subcontractor on a public project gave statutory notices to the general subcontractor of its claim for payment against another subcontractor, sending a preliminary bond notice pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>to the Civil Code which stated the claim was about $200,000. Thereafter, the trial court allowed the subcontractor to prove damages according to the reasonable value of services\u2014$335,000. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1818.) On appeal, this court held that in the absence of prejudice, the amount stated in the preliminary bond notice does not limit the amount of recovery. The only issue in <em>Blair </em>was whether the \u201csubstantial accuracy\u201d requirements of the mechanics lien statutes could be applied to limit the amount of recovery to that set forth in the 90-day notice. We held the statute referred to the claim itself and not the amount. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The claim in the bond notice had been stated with \u201csubstantial accuracy\u201d as required by the Civil Code, and the statutory remedies enacting mechanics\u2019 liens are liberally construed to provide adequate compensation for those providing materials or services to public works projects. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1818-1820.) Such considerations are not present here, where MCM failed to protest the bid as required by the bid invitation. Certainly, even in the mechanics\u2019 lien context, the subcontractor would not have been <em>relieved </em>of the requirement that it provide the required statutory notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 715, 759-762 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 815] is also inapposite. That case involved an insured\u2019s alleged failure to give timely notice to the insurer of claims against the insured. \u201cCalifornia law is settled that a defense based on an insured\u2019s failure to give timely notice requires the insurer to prove that it suffered substantial prejudice. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 760.) MCM attempts to take this rule from the insurance context and to make it a doctrine of general application. We resist such attempt to expand doctrines developed in the insurance context, with its solicitude for the rights of the insured and its particularized concerns for the special relationship between insurer and insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">We are unpersuaded in this public contracting context that MCM may disregard entirely the requirements set forth in the invitation to bid for protesting the bids of other contractors, but may nevertheless belatedly challenge that bid in the courts. As one program handbook warns bidders, \u201cMost bid protests are brought by unsuccessful bidders (typically the second lowest prime contractor . . .) after the public agency or staff has indicated its intent to award the contract. In fact, if the contractor does not immediately lodge a protest in writing to the public entity, the bid protest right may be waived.\u201d (Brown, Public Works: Contracts and Litigation (Cont.Ed.Bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>1995) Program Handbook, p. 76.)

These provisions are strictly construed by the courts, and will not be extended beyond their reasonable purpose. Competitive bidding provisions must be read in the light of the reason for their enactment, or they will be applied where they were not intended to operate and thus deny municipalities authority to deal with problems in a sensible, practical way.\u201d (10 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d rev. ed. 1990) \u00a7 29.29, p. 375, fns. omitted.) Thus, [laws] requiring competitive bidding are not to be given such a construction as to defeat the object of insuring economy and excluding favoritism and corruption.

There, the appellate court held the district abused its discretion when it rejected plaintiff\u2019s bid for failure to demonstrate it had made a good faith effort to comply with the district\u2019s affirmative action goals as measured by the district\u2019s written criteria. Public Contract Code section 2000, subdivision (b)(1), contains the exclusive criteria for assessing good faith efforts to satisfy affirmative action goals, and the district was without authority to assess good faith according to its own criteria insofar as they differed from the statutory criteria.

The appellate court held the district abused its discretion in rejecting the bid because the Public Contract Code contained the exclusive criteria for assessing good faith efforts to satisfy affirmative action goals and the district was without authority to assess good faith according to its own criteria.

You are including within Myers\u2019 bid information about a 3 million dollar subcontract that had to be, per your bid instructions, in envelope B. It wasn\u2019t there in Myers\u2019 bid package. [\u00b6] Now, I don\u2019t understand why the Airport Commission is waiving that irregularity when it is strictly enforcing the instructions to bidders as to MCM. R[] The basic purpose of competitive bidding is that we have a level playing field. And here the commission is thinking about waiving this huge problem with Myers\u2019 bid, which is 2 million dollars higher than ours, and enforcing various minor deviations in MCM\u2019s bid.\u201d At other points in the hearing, counsel reiterated its argument that it was unfair to enforce its instructions against MCM, while waiving Myers\u2019s deviation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b305-9\"> Having determined that MCM waived its right to protest Myers\u2019s bid, we need not address the question of MCM\u2019s standing to challenge Myers\u2019s bid or the merits of MCM\u2019s challenge to City\u2019s award of the contract to Myers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
