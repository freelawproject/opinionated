J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak9\">Petitioner Gary Tensfeldt (Tensfeldt) was convicted of insurance fraud under Insurance Code section 1871.4, subdivision (a)(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for lying about the circumstances of an alleged industrial knee injury to obtain workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Tensfeldt entered a negotiated plea of nolo contendere to one misdemeanor count of insurance fraud, made restitution, and filed a second claim seeking compensation benefits for what he professed were the actual circumstances of the injury. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) denied the second claim. In affirming the Board\u2019s decision, we will hold that when convicted of insurance fraud in violation of section 1871.4(a)(1), an applicant for workers\u2019 compensation insurance benefits may be, and in this case is, wholly barred from receiving or retaining any such benefits directly emanating from or connected with the fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Tensfeldt was hired by respondent Water Department of the City and County of San Francisco (City) as an apprentice plumber on February 1, 1994. He was assigned to a cement cutting crew with two laborers under the supervision of Jim Lynch.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">On Friday, February 4, 1994, Tensfeldt\u2019s crew had a total of three job assignments, which they completed early, around 2:30 p.m. Upon completion, Lynch drove Tensfeldt and another crew member to a City gymnasium where they joined other water department employees to play basketball. Apparently this recreational activity had taken place on other Friday afternoons when work assignments were completed before the end of the work day. During the course of playing basketball, Tensfeldt injured his left knee when he jumped for a rebound and landed on the foot of another player. He was carried out of the gym and driven back to the main water department yard by other employees. He claims that other employees urged him to lie about how the injury occurred because they did not want to get in trouble. Tensfeldt then reported the injury and filed the fraudulent claim alleging that he had dislocated his knee on the job that day when he jumped out of a compressor truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">City accepted the claim. Medical treatment and temporary disability indemnity were provided until rumors surfaced regarding the truth. On April 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>1994, City instigated a criminal investigation. While the investigation was pending, Tensfeldt did not come forward with the truth. He testified that other employees urged him to keep silent. On April 18, 1994, after reviewing the police investigative reports, City terminated all benefits. Upon learning that the investigation was complete, Tensfeldt met with the police on April 22, 1994, and revealed the true nature of the injury. He admitted for the first time that he had falsely reported the injury and, in fact, was hurt while playing basketball. The incident report and police narratives were forwarded to the district attorney\u2019s office. A criminal complaint was filed against Tensfeldt charging him with a violation of section 1871.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">On June 9, 1994, while the criminal matter was pending, Tensfeldt filed a second workers\u2019 compensation claim, alleging he incurred the injury to his left knee, which was the subject of his first and false claim, while \u201cengaging in customary Friday afternoon recreational activity during hours of employment and on employer\u2019s premises.\u201d City denied the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">On November 29, 1994, Tensfeldt entered a plea of nolo contendere in the criminal case to one count of misdemeanor insurance fraud in violation of section 1871.4(a)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tensfeldt was convicted; and on December 21, 1994, the superior court entered judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">On January 2, 1996, Tensfeldt\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation case proceeded to trial before the workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) who determined that the Friday afternoon basketball games during working hours on City property were an established and encouraged custom among water department employees. Accordingly, he found that Tensfeldt sustained an injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment that was not barred by Labor Code section 3600, subdivision (a)(9). Interpreting section 1871.5, the WCJ also held that the fraud conviction did not prevent Tensfeldt from seeking and receiving compensation benefits for an otherwise legitimate work injury based on the true facts of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">City petitioned for reconsideration. In a two-to-one opinion the Board held that Tensfeldt was barred under section 1871.5 from \u201creceiving or retaining any workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d Citing its holding in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (1996) 61 </em>Cal.Comp.Cases 118 <em>(Miller), </em>the majority reasoned: \u201cWe see no exception in the statute for the circumstances presented by this case. Clearly the conduct intended to be punished is the fraudulent misrepresentation. The penalty attaches to the conduct, and in this case would extend to all benefits arising from the basketball activity on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>February 4, 1994.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The majority, thus, impliedly rejected the theory that a subsequent claim, attempting to classify an injury as within the course and scope of employment, could vitiate the first claim for the same injury which was fraudulent; i.e., that once fraud was initiated and admitted by Tensfeldt, he got no second bite of the compensation apple by such means. Consequently, the Board did not address the issue of statutory compensability of Tensfeldt\u2019s injury incurred while playing basketball.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The dissent cited the Board\u2019s holding in <em>Zenith Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Ball) </em>(1996) 61 Cal.Comp.Cases 1107 <em>(Ball), </em>decided after <em>Miller. </em>In <em>Ball, </em>the Board did not interpret section 1871.5 to bar an injured employee convicted of fraud under section 1871.4(a)(1) from seeking to prove entitlement to compensation benefits for an otherwise legitimate industrial injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The dissent would have affirmed the WCJ\u2019s findings because the basketball activity was a reasonable expectation of Tensfeldt\u2019s employment and, thus, compensable under Labor Code section 3600, subdivision (a)(9), i.e., that Tensfeldt\u2019s entitlement to further compensation benefits for a compensable injury based solely on the true circumstances of an otherwise legitimate industrial injury was not barred by the plain wording of section 1871.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">This petition for writ of review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">A. <em>Section 1871.5 Precludes Tensfeldt\u2019s Recovery of Benefits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">As we explain, the majority of the Board correctly analyzed the application of sections 1871.4(a)(1) and 1871.5 in this case. These sections were enacted as part of a series of comprehensive reform legislation (Stats. 1989, ch. 1119, \u00a7 3, p. 4130 et seq.), which has been supplemented in subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>legislation.  The Insurance Frauds Prevention Act (\u00a7 1871 et seq.) was aimed at reducing fraudulent workers\u2019 compensation claims as well as other insurance fraud. (See <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 792, 800 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 463].) \u201cThe clear aim of the legislation was to control fraudulent claim practices by increasing professional and criminal penalties and actively investigating and prosecuting fraud.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 801; \u00a7 1871, subds. (d) &amp; (e).) To this end, section 1871.4(a)(1), enacted in 1991, makes it a crime to \u201cMake or cause to be made any knowingly false or fraudulent material statement or material representation for the purpose of obtaining or denying any compensation, as defined in Section 3207 of the Labor Code.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Stats. 1991, ch. 116, \u00a7 13, p. 688.)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The Legislature also enacted Labor Code section 5803.5 in 1991. It provides, as follows: \u201cAny conviction pursuant to Section 1871.4 of the Insurance Code that <em>materially </em>affects the basis of any order, decision, or award of the appeals board shall be sufficient grounds for a reconsideration of that order, decision, or award.\u201d (Stats. 1991, ch. 116, \u00a7 33, p. 700, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>In 1993, section 1871.5 was added to provide further limitations on receipt of compensation benefits by individuals convicted of workers\u2019 compensation fraud: \u201cAny person convicted of workers\u2019 compensation fraud pursuant to Section 1871.4 or Section 550 of the Penal Code shall be ineligible to receive or retain any compensation, as defined in Section 3207 of the Labor Code,[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] where that compensation was owed or received as a result of a violation of Section 1871.4 or Section 550 of the Penal Code for which the recipient of the compensation was convicted.\u201d (Stats. 1993, ch. 120.)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">In the case before us, Tensfeldt challenges the Board\u2019s application of section 1871.5 as a total bar to his entitlement to receive or retain any workers\u2019 compensation benefits resulting from the basketball injury. We address the application of section 1871.5 to the case at bench as a matter of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The objective of statutory interpretation is to construe a law consonant with its purpose. <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224].) The language of the statute is the prime indicator of such purpose and should generally be interpreted according to its \u201cusual, ordinary import.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Where the words of the statute are clear, we may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear from its legislative history or on the face of the statute. <em>(Burden </em>v. <em>Snowden </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 556, 562 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 531, 828 P.2d 672].)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Turning to the language in question, section 1871.5 clearly states that \u201cAny person convicted of workers\u2019 compensation fraud . . . shall be ineligible to receive or retain any compensation . . . where that compensation was owed or received <em>as a result of a violation . . . for which the recipient of the compensation was convicted.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Giving the language its ordinary meaning, section 1871.5 unambiguously provides that an injured worker must return only \u201cthat compensation\u201d obtained by fraud, and may not receive further compensation stemming from the fraud. This interpretation does not conflict with Labor Code section 5803.5. That section, consistent with section 1871.5, posits a fraud conviction which \u201cmaterially\u201d affects the basis of an award, as a predicate condition to \u201creconsideration\u201d of an order, decision, or award theretofore made. Obviously, such \u201creconsideration\u201d may, dependent on the facts of a case, result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>in annulment of the award previously made. Accordingly, we hold that following a conviction of workers\u2019 compensation fraud under section 1871.4(a)(1), an individual who seeks to receive or retain workers\u2019 compensation benefits is barred from retaining or receiving any compensation, as defined in Labor Code section 3207, which stems directly from the fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Applying this parameter to the record before us, Tensfeldt\u2019s conviction necessarily aborts his right to receive or retain any and all compensation benefits flowing from the injury he sustained while playing basketball on February 4, 1994. Consequently, it was unnecessary for the Board to decide whether the WCJ had correctly found that Tensfeldt\u2019s basketball injury was compensable under Labor Code section 3600, subdivision (a)(9).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The fact that Tensfeldt filed a second claim alleging the true circumstances of the knee injury is irrelevant because, as we discuss <em>post, </em>on this record Tensfeldt would be barred under section 1871.5 notwithstanding the question of his statutory eligibility for compensation in the first place. When an employee is convicted for fraud because of a lie about the statutory compensability of an injury, section 1871.5 precludes that employee from \u201creceiving or retaining\u201d <em>all </em>workers\u2019 compensation benefits, because the fraudulent misrepresentation is material to entitlement to <em>any </em>benefits under the Labor Code. Here, both the language of section 1871.5 and its obvious deterrent intent are consistent with this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">We further emphasize that as a general rule these fraud cases must be determined on an ad hoc basis. It is unworkable to attempt a fixed rule interpreting section 1871.5 to completely bar individuals convicted under section 1871.4 from forever receiving or retaining any workers\u2019 compensation benefits connected with a claim for an otherwise legitimate industrial injury, without regard for the specific facts of the case. Nor would such an inflexible rule be justified by the plain language of section 1871.5. Any implication to the contrary derived from <em>Muniz </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1997) 62 Cal.Comp.Cases 1597 <em>(Muniz) </em>is erroneous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>nonpublished minute order denying the employee\u2019s petition for writ of review, the Fourth Appellate District stated in pertinent part: \u201cJose Francisco Muniz .... contends he should only be barred from receiving those temporary total disability benefits he obtained while employed. [H] . . . [H] We agree with the [Board\u2019s] interpretation that an applicant convicted of fraud relating to a claim is completely barred from receiving or retaining any workers\u2019 compensation benefits in connection with the claim.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1599.)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">However, in an earlier case, <em>Longs Drug Stores </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Sciutto) </em>(1996) 61 Cal.Comp.Cases 1307, 1309 <em>(Sciutto), </em>the Fourth Appellate District denied a petition for writ of review and approved an exactly opposite result in its accompanying nonpublished minute order, stating: \u201c\u2018Here, the [Board] was reasonable in concluding the applicant worker was not statutorily ineligible for compensation under . . . section 1871.5 <em>if he was able to show that compensation is not owed as a result of his unlawful conduct. The clause \u2018any compensation\u2019 in section 1871.5 is qualified in the same section to mean specific compensation sought or obtained through fraud.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Italics added.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Entitlement to receive further compensation benefits after a fraud conviction necessarily will require (1) an actual, otherwise compensable, industrial injury; (2) substantial medical evidence supporting an award of compensation not stemming from the fraudulent misrepresentation for which the claimant was convicted; and (3) that claimant\u2019s credibility is not so destroyed as to make claimant unbelievable concerning any disputed issue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the underlying compensation case. Whether an employee is barred from receiving benefits by application of section 1871.5, following a conviction of workers\u2019 compensation fraud under section 1871.4(a)(1), must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Absent a clear and express intention of the Legislature, we cannot interpret section 1871.5 to bar without qualification receipt of all classes of compensation benefits as a result of the fraudulent receipt of any one benefit unless there is substantial proof that those benefits in question were owed or received as a result of the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In the case at bar, however, Tensfeldt was convicted under section 1871.4 for lying about the very fact of compensability, the essential event which is material to establishing an <em>industrial </em>injury, and which is necessary to trigger City\u2019s statutory liability for workers\u2019 compensation benefits in the first place. It is undisputed that Tensfeldt\u2019s second, so-called \u201ctruthful\u201d claim, seeks the same benefits sought by the false claim leading to his conviction. In summary, application of section 1871.5 in this case precludes Tensfeldt from seeking any and all compensation benefits for the <em>same </em>knee injury regardless of the circumstances of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">B. <em>Compensability of Tensfeldt\u2019s Basketball Injury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">We depart from the proscription against reviewing unnecessary matters to address the compensability of Tensfeldt\u2019s basketball injury. Because the issue of recreational or athletic activity related to employment is of continuing public interest and likely to recur, it deserves discussion here despite its posture before us. (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, \u00a7 338, pp. 379-380.) At oral argument on June 29, 1998, the parties declined the opportunity for further briefing when questioned about the compensability of Tensfeldt\u2019s injury under Labor Code section 3600, subdivision (a)(9), in the event this court decided to look at the issue as a matter of law. The parties further stipulated to a waiver of Government Code section 68081 and agreed that this issue, thoroughly briefed in the arguments presented to the WCJ and Board, could be considered on this appeal. We have reviewed the record and conclude that the injury issue is susceptible to only one reasonable inference and is, therefore, a question of law. (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 338-339, pp. 379-382.)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">As explained by this court (Division Two of the First Appellate District) in <em>Ezzy </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 252, 261-263 [194 Cal.Rptr. 90], in enacting what is now Labor Code section 3600, subdivision (a)(9), the Legislature intended to eliminate from workers\u2019 compensation coverage injuries sustained during recreational, social, or athletic activities which are only remotely work related. In this case there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>little, if any, evidence that Tensfeldt <em>reasonably </em>believed that he was expected to participate in basketball games on Friday afternoons with other water department employees or that participation was expressly or impliedly required by the employment. <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 211, 215 [244 Cal.Rptr. 643]; <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 757, 760 [243 Cal.Rptr. 925].) It is undisputed that no supervisors were present at the gymnasium during the Friday basketball game. Furthermore, there is no evidence that any supervisors other than Lynch knew about the game. Tensfeldt conceded he was not forced by anyone to play basketball. The fact that Tensfeldt may not have been technically \u201coff-duty\u201d at the time he injured his knee, or that his immediate supervisor may have condoned the basketball game, on this record, would not bring Tensfeldt within the test for coverage under Labor Code section 3600, subdivision (a)(9). <em>(Todd, supra, </em>at p. 760.)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">HI.

The Board emphasized that \u201cbenefits which were not obtained or received by reason of those [fraudulent] statements would not be barred. While it may be true as a general rule that statements for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation fraud reflect the falsity of the entire claim (see, e.g., <em>Miller . . </em>.), <em>we believe that each case must be considered on its particular facts </em>and that in the present case the remedy determined by the [WCJ] is not barred by section 1871.5.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
