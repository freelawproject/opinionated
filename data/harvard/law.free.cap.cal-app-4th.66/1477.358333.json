(Reef) built and maintained a shark aquarium for the Club. After a shark outgrew its tank, the Club hired Reef to move it. Richard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1479\">*1479</page-number>Barbosa, a Reef principal, brought along his employee, Rosenbloom, to help with the endeavor. Barbosa told Rosenbloom to drain the aquarium. Once this was completed, Barbosa directed Rosenbloom to take off his shoes, enter the tank and grab the shark by its tail as Barbosa held its head. Rosenbloom complied, and as the two began lifting the shark, it suddenly thrashed about. Barbosa let go and the shark spun around, biting Rosenbloom\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">Rosenbloom filed the underlying suit alleging negligence and strict liability; The Club moved for summary judgment, maintaining Rosenbloom\u2019s causes of action were barred under the assumption of the risk doctrine. Rosenbloom requested a continuance, claiming he needed time to take the scheduled depositions of two critical experts who, Rosenbloom claimed, would reveal triable issues of fact necessary to defeat the Club\u2019s motion. The court denied Rosenbloom\u2019s request and granted the summary judgment motion. Thereafter, the court denied Rosenbloom\u2019s Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 petition for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">As a general rule, strict liability is imposed upon one who keeps a naturally dangerous animal. (BAJI No. 6.65) Ownership of a human-eating shark would certainly qualify,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but liability is not absolute. (See <em>Milwaukee Electric Tool Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 547, 561 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 24].) The owner of a naturally dangerous animal may be excused from the usual duty of care: \u201cIn cases involving \u2018primary assumption of risk\u2019\u2014where, by virtue of the nature of the activity and the parties\u2019 relationship to the activity, the defendant owes no legal duty to protect the plaintiff from the particular risk of harm that caused the injury\u2014the doctrine . . . operate[s] as a complete bar to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery.\u201d <em>(Knight </em>v. <em>Jewett </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 296, 314-315 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 834 P.2d 696],)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-8\"><em>Cohen </em>v. <em>McIntyre </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 650 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 143] is instructive. There a dog bit the veterinarian who was treating it. The court determined the veterinarian\u2019s claims against the dog\u2019s owner were barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1480\">*1480</page-number>under the doctrine of assumption of the risk. The court first reviewed application of the primary assumption of the risk doctrine in cases involving firefighters. It noted in those cases courts held a person who negligently starts a fire is not liable for an injury sustained by a firefighter who is called to extinguish the blaze. It explained this \u201cfirefighter\u2019s rule\u201d is based on the rationale no duty is owed to protect the firefighter from the very danger that he or she is employed to confront. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 654)</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">The <em>Cohen </em>court decided the rule had correctly been extended \u201cto veterinarians and their assistants who are bitten while an animal under their control is receiving care and treatment [i.e., the veterinarian\u2019s rule].\u201d <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>McIntyre, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at pp. 654-655.) \u201cThe risk of being attacked or bitten in the course of veterinary treatment is an occupational hazard which veterinarians accept by undertaking their employment and are in the best position to guard against by taking the necessary precautions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 655, relying on <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 709 [211 Cal.Rptr. 668] [veterinary assistant bitten while holding dog before operation].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">The court then held, \u201c[I]t is apparent that this case falls within the \u2018primary\u2019 category of assumption of the risk. . . . [The] . . . veterinarian^ was injured during the course of treating an animal under his control, an activity for which he was employed and compensated and one in which the risk of being attacked and bitten is well known. Thus, this is a classic situation where a defendant\u2019s ordinary duty of care is <em>negated </em>due to the nature of the activity and the relationship of the defendant to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>McIntyre, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 655, fn. omitted, original italics.) In other words, the veterinarian, like the firefighter, cannot recover for injures arising out of the very conditions he or she was hired to confront. The rationale is persuasive in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">The Club recognized a certain expertise was necessary for the dangerous task of handling a shark. Accordingly, it hired Reef, a known expert in the field, to do the work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Certainly shark bites were Reef\u2019s occupational hazard. And like the firefighter and veterinarian, no duty is owed to protect the shark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>handler from the very danger that he or she was employed to <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under the circumstances, the Club is not liable as a matter of law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">The judgment is affirmed. The Club shall recover its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">Wallin, Acting P. J., and Rylaarsdam, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1143-9\">Such liability has been imposed on \u201ckeepers of lions and tigers, bears, elephants, wolves [and] monkeys.\u201d (Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed. 1984) \u00a7 76, p. 542, fns. omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1143-10\">In <em>Knight, </em>the Supreme Court disapproved of \u201cearlier cases that applied the doctrine as a bar to liability on the basis of plaintiff\u2019s subjective, voluntary assumption of a known risk.\u201d <em>(Neighbarger </em>v. <em>Irwin Industries, Inc. </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 532, 537 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 630, 882 P.2d 347].) Rosenbloom argues the trial court improperly employed this discarded authority and other inapt legal principles when granting the motion. We need not decide the issue because we conduct a de novo review, deciding whether the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. <em>(Mata </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 141, 147 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 314].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">Rosenbloom incorrectly asserts that the veterinarian\u2019s rule, as first developed in <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d 709, has been \u201csuperseded by\u201d later Supreme Court opinions. To the contrary, in <em>Knight </em>the Supreme Court cited <em>Nelson </em>and several firefighter\u2019s rule cases as good examples of the primary assumption of the risk doctrine. <em>(Knight </em>v. <em>Jewett, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at pp. 309-310, fn. 5.) One year later, the court noted in dicta, \u201cIf the rule is based . . . appropriately on the defendant\u2019s relationship with the veterinarian, and the defendant\u2019s conduct in entrusting the animal to the professional care and control of the veterinarian, it may be sound.\u201d <em>(Neighbarger </em>v. <em>Irwin Industries, Inc., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 545.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1144-8\">We reject Rosenbloom\u2019s claim his lack of experience with sharks and consequent misapprehension of the danger should be considered. The Supreme Court made clear in <em>\u201cKnight . . . </em>that a plaintiff\u2019s subjective knowledge or appreciation of the nature or magnitude of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>potential risk is no longer a relevant inquiry.\u201d <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>McIntyre, supra </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 655.) As explained above, all that matters is the defendant\u2019s relationship and conduct towards the plaintiff. Here, it is undisputed the Club contracted with a shark expert, entrusting its shark to Barbosa\u2019s company\u2019s professional care and control. Just as a dog owner owes no duty to hired veterinarians or their assistants <em>(Nelson </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d at p. 714), the Club owed none to Barbosa or the crew acting under his control and supervision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1145-11\">In his reply brief, Rosenbloom argues there is no public policy in favor of extinguishing the Club\u2019s liability. But assumption of the risk doctrine does not hinge upon such considerations. Indeed, the Supreme Court noted this in <em>Neighbarger: </em>\u201cAlthough the elements of public service and public compensation are missing [in application of the veterinarian\u2019s rule], the \u2018defendant\u2019s ordinary duty of care is [nevertheless] <em>negated </em>due to the nature of the activity and the relationship of the defendant to the plaintiff.\u2019 ...*... [V]eterinarians accept [the occupational hazard of dog bites] by undertaking their employment and are in the best position to guard against [such risks] by taking the necessary precautions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Neighbarger </em>v. <em>Irwin Industries, Inc., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 545, citation omitted, original italics.) And, in any event, there are sound policy reasons to excuse the Club\u2019s liability. As aptly stated by the Supreme Court, \u201c[I]t is unfair to charge the defendant with a duty of care to prevent injury to the plaintiff arising from the very condition or hazard the defendant has contracted with the plaintiff to remedy or confront.\u201d <em>(Neighbarger </em>v. <em>Irwin Industries, Inc., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 542.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1145-12\">Rosenbloom also contends the court erred in denying his request for more time to gather evidence of disputed facts. But additional facts would make no difference in our determination that the Club\u2019s duty was excused as a matter of law. For this same reason, we need not consider Rosenbloom\u2019s claim the court erred in denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
