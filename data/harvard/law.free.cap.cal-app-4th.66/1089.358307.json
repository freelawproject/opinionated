(\u00a7 4061.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 4062 provides a similar option when the parties do not agree on other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>medical issues such as the treating physician\u2019s determination concerning the permanent and stationary status of the employee\u2019s medical condition. (\u00a7 4062)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Section 4062.9 states that even with such comprehensive medical evaluation, the findings of the treating physician are presumed to be correct. The presumption is, however, rebuttable. Here we conclude the presumption was annihilated.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Al Keulen, Jr. (Keulen) petitions this court for a writ of review of the order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB or the Board) denying reconsideration of its decision that Keulen only suffered a 2.25 percent permanent disability from industrial injury to his left thumb. The Board also decided that he did not suffer ulnar neuropathy to the left elbow arising from the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>Keulen presented undisputed medical evidence of ulnar neuropathy arising from the injury subsequent to the complete medical release by his original treating physician. We annul the decision of the Board because it misconstrues the law and is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Keulen, a carpenter, injured his thumb while at work. He suffered atypical pain. His treating physician, Mark F. Mooney, referred him to Doctor Vincent R. Hentz, who performed a surgical metacarpal joint fusion on his left thumb joint on March 14, 1995. On July 27, 1995, Doctor Hentz reported that Keulen\u2019s fusion \u201cappears to be very solid and [X]-rays confirm this.\u201d Doctor Hentz released Keulen to full duty on July 31, 1995. On October 31, 1995, Doctor Hentz again reported that \u201cX-rays demonstrated satisfactory fusion . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">On December 16, 1996, Keulen applied for adjudication of his claim before the WCAB. Keulen was represented by counsel. Doctor Mooney submitted his report of January 11, 1996, which stated that, as a result of the industrial injury, Keulen exacerbated \u201cbasal joint arthrosis\u201d suffered in a previous injury. (\u00a7 4061.5.) Keulen still had difficulty moving his thumb, picking up and manipulating small objects. He felt a \u201c[t]ight sensation\u201d over the base of the thumb, among other things.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">In his report, Doctor Mooney stated that Keulen\u2019s complaints are \u201cconsistent with the <em>attempted </em>fusion,\u201d and that Keulen \u201cmay be considered permanent and stationary at this time.\u201d (Italics added.) Doctor Mooney took X-rays that he believed demonstrated that the joint had a \u201cwell contoured surface for effusion.\u201d He stated, \u201cThere does, however, still appear to be a lucency in the area.\u201d Although Doctor Hentz agreed that \u201cthere is some persistent radiographic lucency, ... he feels that clinically there is truly fusion present . . . .\u201d Lucency in X-rays indicates that a joint did not fuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">Doctor Mooney stated that Keulen could return to his routine, regular and customary duties. Doctor Mooney concluded that Keulen \u201cdoes not require any [further] active medical intervention.\u201d Doctor Mooney cautioned, however, that \u201c[s]hould he develop recurrence of pain over the basal joint, I would recommend a further imaging study of the quality of the fusion</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">After returning to work, Keulen noticed that the symptoms around his thumb worsened, and he began to experience numbness in the last three fingers of his left hand. The State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>offered Keulen a 2.25 percent disability rating. Keulen objected to Doctor Mooney\u2019s findings and requested an agreed medical examiner pursuant to section 4062. SCIF did not respond to the request, and on March 28, 1997, it declared its readiness to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Keulen arranged for his own qualified medical evaluator, Doctor Donald R. Schwartz, to conduct a comprehensive medical evaluation. (\u00a7\u00a7 4061, 4062.) Doctor Schwartz reviewed the relevant medical records and examined Keulen on April 22, 1997. Keulen told Doctor Schwartz that sometime after Doctor Mooney released him to return to full activities, he noticed the onset of numbness predominantly in the ring and index fingers of his left hand. The numbness in his left hand was becoming worse, and he felt new pains in his wrist. Keulen informed Doctor Mooney about these symptoms, but Doctor Mooney told him that his symptoms would probably go away eventually or he would simply learn to live with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">When Doctor Schwartz examined Keulen, Keulen reported that the pain restricted his activities upwards of 70 percent of the day, and that he had to alter the way he uses his left arm and hand. On April 22, 1997, Doctor Schwartz X-rayed Keulen\u2019s left hand and wrist. The X-rays revealed \u201cwhat appears to be a nonunion at the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb.\u201d Doctor Schwartz concluded that the joint did not fuse after surgery. Keulen needed to compensate for the increasing pain in his wrist area by abnormally using his upper left extremity. Keulen began to suffer from ulnar entrapment neuropathy in his left elbow.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Doctor Schwartz concluded that Keulen\u2019s condition had not become permanent and stationary in January 1996, and that his condition had deteriorated. Keulen suffered \u201cnew symptomatology with the ulnar nerve entrapment problem.\u201d Doctor Schwartz pointed out that Doctor Mooney\u2019s own review of the previous X-rays revealed lucency in the area of the purported fusion which suggests that no union occurred. Although Keulen had previously suffered from arthritis of the carpometacarpal joints of the thumb, Doctor Schwartz concluded that Keulen\u2019s current thumb disability was entirely due to the injury at issue here. Keulen developed ulnar neuropathy as a result of his accommodation for the ongoing pain in his thumb. The pain persisted because of failure to treat the nonunion of the thumb joint to the wrist. The failure of the surgery to fuse the joint exhibited itself in both sets of X-rays taken by Doctors Mooney and Schwartz. SCIF did not send Doctor Schwartz\u2019s report to Doctor Mooney for review, comment or rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">At the WCAB hearing on July 17, 1997, Keulen testified without contradiction that, in March or April 1997, he was continuing to lose range of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>motion of his left thumb. Furthermore, he was experiencing sharp, intense pain in his wrist and numbness in his outside three fingers which did not exist when he last saw Doctor Mooney. The medical reports presented into evidence included the X-rays that showed lucency in the area of the joint. SCIF did not cross-examine Keulen, nor did it present any witnesses. On September 17, 1997, a disability evaluator recommended rating the disability at 2.25 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The workers\u2019 compensation referee found that Keulen\u2019s injury to his left thumb caused 2.25 percent permanent disability for the total sum of $945. He determined that Keulen did not sustain injury resulting in ulnar neuropathy, but that Keulen is in need of future medical care. The referee awarded Keulen $945 less attorney\u2019s fees of $113.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The referee did not believe that Keulen overcame the presumption that the treating physician\u2019s opinion is correct pursuant to section 4062.9. He opined that \u201c[a]s noted in <em>Minniear </em>v. <em>Mt. San Antonio Community College District </em>(1996) [61 Cal.Comp.Cases 1055], the treating physician is presumptively correct and an opinion that essentially disagrees with that of the treating physician is not . . . sufficient to rebut that presumption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">In his report, the referee \u201crecognizes that Dr. Schwartz indicates that applicant is not permanent and stationary and entertains a different diagnosis, the undersigned is simply not convinced that the presumption has been overcome. [\u00b6] Therefore, the undersigned has relied upon the report of Dr. Mooney ... for the factors of disability which have been described to the rater. Additionally, the undersigned has not found injury resulting in ulnar neuropathy, also, based on that [Doctor Mooney\u2019s] opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Keulen petitioned for reconsideration. In his recommendation to the WCAB, the referee opined that \u201ca report which merely differs as to the extent of permanent disability is not, in and of itself, sufficient to rebut the presumption of correctness.\u201d Although the referee acknowledged that Doctor Schwartz\u2019s report was well thought out, he dismissed it as merely more up to date and more consistent with Keulen\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">The WCAB relied on the referee\u2019s report and denied the petition for reconsideration. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahq\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">\u201c \u2018In considering a petition for writ of review of a decision of the WCAB, this court\u2019s authority is limited. This court must determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>the evidence, when viewed in light of the entire record, supports the award of the WCAB. This court may not reweigh the evidence or decide disputed questions of fact. [Citations.] However, this court is not bound to accept the WCAB\u2019s factual findings if determined to be unreasonable, illogical, improbable or inequitable when viewed in light of the overall statutory scheme. [Citation.] Questions of statutory interpretation are, of course, for this court to decide. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mote </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 902, 909 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 806]; <em>Western Growers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 227, 233-234 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 26]; see also \u00a7\u00a7 5950, 5954; <em>Chu </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1176, 1182 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 221].) \u201cAll aspects of workers\u2019 compensation law . . . are to be liberally construed in favor of the injured worker.\u201d <em>(Save Mart Stores </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 720, 723 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 597]; \u00a7 3202.)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Section 4062.9 explains that \u201c[i]n cases where an additional comprehensive medical evaluation is obtained under Section 4061 or 4062, the findings of the treating physician are presumed to be correct. This presumption is rebuttable and may be controverted by a preponderance of medical opinion indicating an [sic] different level of impairment. However, this presumption shall not apply where both parties select qualified medical examiners.\u201d (Fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Sections 4061 and 4062 concern admitted injuries where issues such as appropriate medical treatment, temporary or permanent disability or vocational rehabilitation exist, as here.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The parties rely on <em>Minniear </em>v. <em>Mt. San Antonio Community College District </em>(1996) 61 Cal.Comp.Cases 1055. <em>Minniear </em>is an in bank decision discussing the nature and effect of section 4062.9. The Legislature enacted section 4062.9 to reduce costs by reducing the number of physicians participating in each workers\u2019 compensation proceeding. (61 Cal.Comp.Cases at pp. 1059-1060.) <em>Minniear </em>explains that the presumption stated in section 4062.9 affects the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The presumption requires the party against whom it operates to show, by a preponderance of medical opinion, that a different level of impairment exists. <em>(Minniear </em>v. <em>Mt. San Antonio Community College District, supra, </em>61 Cal.Comp.Cases at p. 1060.) The presumption applies to any and all of the medical issues covered by sections 4061 and 4062. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, <em>Minniear </em>states that a preponderance of the evidence indicating a different level of impairment may rebut the treating physician\u2019s view on appropriate medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>treatment and whether the disability is temporary or permanent at a given point in time. (See \u00a7\u00a7 4061, 4062.)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\"><em>Minniear </em>acknowledged that \u201ceach case presents its own facts and evidence.\u201d <em>(Minniear </em>v. <em>Mt. San Antonio Community College District, supra, </em>61 Cal.Comp.Cases at p. 1060.) Certain general principles apply, however. Evidence from a lay witness is not substantial evidence; medical proof is required on diagnosis, prognosis and treatment which are beyond the bounds of ordinary knowledge. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1060-1061.)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Also, the chronological sequence of examinations is not dispositive. \u201cUnless the treating physician\u2019s opinion clearly is no longer valid, it should be not considered of lesser relevance than that of the qualified medical evaluator.\u201d <em>(Minniear </em>v. <em>Mt. San Antonio Community College District, supra, </em>61 Cal.Comp.Cases at p. 1061.) Allegations that the treating physician\u2019s position is out of date must be specific, in accord with Board rule 10606 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 10606), and supported by evidence, not mere conjecture. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Keulen has more than met the requirements of the statute, as interpreted by <em>Minniear, </em>to rebut Doctor Mooney\u2019s position. Doctor Mooney stated that Keulen\u2019s complaints are consistent with the <em>attempted fusion </em>and that Keulen may be considered permanent and stationary as of January 11, 1996. But Doctor Mooney also stated, \u201cThere does, however, still appear to be a lucency in the area [of the attempted fusion].\u201d Doctor Hentz agreed that \u201cthere is some persistent radiographic lucency,\u201d even though he felt clinically there was fusion. Accordingly, Doctor Mooney cautioned that \u201c[s]hould [Keulen] develop recurrence of pain[,] ... I would recommend a further imaging study of the quality of the fusion . . . .\u201d Doctor Mooney\u2019s report regarding whether or not the joint had been fused was equivocal at best. Nonetheless, Doctor Mooney opined that as of January 11, 1996, Keulen\u2019s condition was permanent and stationary and only affected his thumb.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Keulen developed recurrent pain that became worse. Furthermore, he developed numbness in his fingers, a new symptom from that known at the time Doctor Mooney last saw and released him to work full time at his former position. As Doctor Mooney recommended, Doctor Schwartz ordered new X-rays again revealing \u201cwhat appears to be a nonunion at the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb\u201d consistent with Keulen\u2019s recurrent, increased pain and the development of ulnar neuropathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">Doctor Schwartz\u2019s medical report provided specific evidence that Keulen\u2019s condition was not stable. The new evidence established that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>Keulen\u2019s condition was neither permanent nor stationary. (See &amp; cf. \u00a7 4065 [board is only entitled to choose between differing views on the parties\u2019 proposed <em>permanent </em>disability ratings].)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">SCIF did not send Doctor Schwartz\u2019s report to Doctor Mooney for review, comment or rebuttal as to the additional evidence of neuropathy resulting from the injury. The evidence of Keulen\u2019s numbness and ulnar neuropathy in Doctor Schwartz\u2019s medical report is unrebutted and uncontested. It is further corroborated by Keulen\u2019s unrebutted, uncontested testimony. Keulen\u2019s testimony and reports of increased pain and numbness are consistent with Doctor Schwartz\u2019s medical report which provided medical evidence of the unfused joint. From this evidence the referee could not reasonably conclude that Doctor Schwartz\u2019s comprehensive medical evaluation simply presents another opinion on the same facts that \u201cessentially disagrees with that of the treating physician . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">There is no substantial evidence presented by respondents on either the development of numbness in Keulen\u2019s fingers or on his ulnar neuropathy. The medical evidence in Doctor Schwartz\u2019s report shows more than a different level of impairment. It shows an entirely new impairment suffered by Keulen as the result of the industrial injury and the failure to fuse the joint.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The facts and evidence here are distinguishable from the situation in <em>Minniear. </em>The reports of both the treating physician and Minniear\u2019s qualified medical examiner were similar. Based on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging results, medical examination and the subjective complaints of Minniear, both physicians found that he was precluded from engaging in heavy work or lifting. Both physicians submitted proposed permanent disability ratings that differed by only a few percentage points. Minniear admitted that \u201c \u2018his condition is pretty much the same now as when he last saw [the treating physician].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Minniear </em>v. <em>Mt. San Antonio Community College District, supra, </em>61 Cal.Comp.Cases at pp. 1058-1959.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The slight difference in opinion between the doctors about the degree of severity of Minniear\u2019s injury did not rebut the treating physician\u2019s medical evidence. <em>(Minniear </em>v. <em>Mt. San Antonio Community College District, supra, </em>61 Cal.Comp.Cases at p. 1061.) The reports and Minniear\u2019s subjective complaints were also quite consistent. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1061-1062.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Here, however, the uncontested medical evidence presented by Doctor Schwartz\u2019s report, corroborated by Keulen\u2019s uncontested testimony, rebutted the presumption that the treating physician\u2019s findings are correct. (See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number><em>Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical </em>v. <em>W.C.A.B. (Ausen) </em>(1997) 62 Cal.Comp.Cases 832.) Doctor Schwartz documented that Keulen\u2019s condition continued to deteriorate so that Keulen suffered a different level of impairment; he suffered debilitating new traumas since Doctor Mooney last saw him.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">\u201cUpon reviewing the entire record in this case, we have concluded that the evidence relied upon by the board to discredit petitioner\u2019s uncontradicted testimony was insubstantial and cannot support its decision.\u201d <em>(Garza </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 312, 317 [90 Cal.Rptr. 355, 475 P.2d 451].) Generally, \u201cthe board \u2018must accept as true the intended meaning of [evidence] both uncontradicted and unimpeached.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 317-318.) \u201cUpon the filing of a petition for reconsideration the board may direct the taking of additional evidence [section 5906] . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 318; <em>King </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1640, 1649 [283 Cal.Rptr. 98]; see also \u00a7 5701.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The earlier medical opinions regarding the lucency of the prior X-rays were equivocal, and the new, uncontradicted medical evidence established a new pathology. If the Board had doubts about this evidence, it could have directed additional medical evidence. <em>(King </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at p. 1649, citing <em>Raymond Plastering </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 748, 753 [60 Cal.Rptr. 860]; see also <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp.

Instead, the Board relied on the outdated evidence proffered by the employer. Absent any evidence to the contrary, as here, the Board\u2019s decision upon reconsideration may not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">The order denying reconsideration is annulled, and the matter is remanded to the Board with directions to commence further proceedings forthwith consistent with this opinion. Petitioner shall recover his costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">Stone (S. J.), P.
