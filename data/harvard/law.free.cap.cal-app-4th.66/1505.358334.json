J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7V\">A jury found defendant guilty of first degree burglary in violation of Penal Code section 459.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant subsequently admitted that he had suffered seven prior \u201cstrike\u201d convictions (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (c) and (e), 1170.12, subd. (c)), three prior serious felony convictions (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)), and four prison priors (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)). Defendant was sentenced to state prison for a total indeterminate term of 40 years to life. This was composed of a term of twenty-five years to life under the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law and five years for each of the three prior serious felony convictions. Defendant appeals on three separate grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">The facts are not in dispute. On December 22, 1996, defendant was caught in the act of burglarizing a residence. A woman observed defendant go into her neighbor\u2019s backyard. She called the police who apprehended defendant while he was walking away from the rear of the house. A police officer advised defendant of his constitutional rights pursuant to <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974]. Defendant waived those rights and admitted that he planned to burglarize the residence. He further admitted that he had cut the screen on the window but had not been able to enter the house because a washer and dryer pushed against the window prevented the window from opening wide enough for him to get into the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-9\">I. <em>CALJIC No. 2.90</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-10\">II. <em>Felony Status of Grand Theft of a Firearm</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-11\">Section 667, subdivision (a) provides for a five-year enhancement for each prior serious felony conviction. A \u201cserious felony\u201d is defined as a serious felony listed in subdivision (c) of section 1192.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1508\">*1508</page-number>Defendant contends that the trial court erred in imposing a five-year term under section 667, sudivision (a) for his prior conviction for grand theft of a firearm (former \u00a7 487, subd. 3)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because such offense is not a serious prior felony under section 1192.7, subdivision (c). Section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(26) provides that \u201cgrand theft involving a firearm\u201d is a serious felony. Defendant argues that theft of a firearm does not \u201cinvolve\u201d a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">To determine the meaning of section 1192.7 we must \u201c \u2018ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u2019 [Citation.] Our first step is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute, giving them a plain and commonsense meaning. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Valladoli </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 590, 597 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 695, 918 P.2d 999].) Defendant argues that the words \u201cinvolving a firearm\u201d mean to \u201cemploy\u201d or \u201cengage\u201d a firearm. (Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict. (3d ed. 1961) p. 1191.) While this definition is arguably valid, it is not exclusive. \u201cInvolve\u201d also means \u201cto have within or a part of itself,\u201d to \u201ccontain\u201d or to \u201cinclude.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> Accordingly, grand theft \u201cinvolving\u201d a firearm is reasonably construed as any grand theft where a firearm is part of the crime\u2014whether as a weapon to effect the crime or as the object of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">Second, if possible, every word and phrase of a statute should be given significance in order to effect the legislative intent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Black </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 1, 5 [184 Cal.Rptr. 454, 648 P.2d 104].) The People properly afford such significance arguing \u201c[h]ad the Legislature intended to limit the category of serious felonies to those situations where the defendant actually uses a firearm during commission of a grand theft, it could have easily done so by listing a serious felony \u2018grand theft using a firearm.\u2019 The Legislature, instead, appears to have contemplated a broader class of crimes</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">Finally, arguing that any ambiguity must be construed in defendant\u2019s favor, defendant fails to first consider legislative intent to clarify the meaning of section 1192.7. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Whisenand </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1389 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 501].)  The Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest states \u201c[t]his bill would include within the list of serious felonies the grand theft of a firearm . . . .\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 566, 4 Stats. 1989 (Reg. Sess.) Summary Dig., p. 386.) In light of this clearly stated legislative intent and the fact that the plain meaning of \u201cinvolve\u201d does not prohibit the inclusion of defendant\u2019s offense, we hold that grand theft of a firearm constitutes a serious felony within the meaning of section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(26). Accordingly, we affirm the five-year term imposed for this serious prior felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1509\">*1509</page-number>III. <em>Cruel and Unusual Punishment</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">Richli, J., and Gaut, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Gout was denied January 20, 1999.
