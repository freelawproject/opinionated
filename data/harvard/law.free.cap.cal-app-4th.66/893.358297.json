In this case, we consider the related question whether a state court <em>in a dissolution action </em>may properly enter a domestic relations order providing the nonemployee spouse with the right to name a successor in interest to receive her share of undistributed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>community property pension benefits upon her death. We hold the order in question is not a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) and therefore it is an invalid alienation of pension benefits under ERISA. Specifically, we conclude the order is not a QDRO because a successor in interest is not an \u201calternate payee\u201d within the meaning of ERISA. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Janet D. and Gene T. Shelstead married on June 16, 1973. During the marriage, Gene earned pension credits and became a vested participant in Carpenters Pension Trust for Southern California (CPT), a multiemployer trust fund governed by ERISA. Upon retirement and completion of the eligibility conditions, Gene will be entitled to an annuity for his life and for the life of a surviving spouse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">On November 17, 1992, Janet and Gene separated. During the subsequent marital dissolution action, the parties joined CPT as a party. The court entered a judgment of dissolution on August 30, 1993. At the time, Gene had not yet retired. The judgment awarded Janet one-half interest in the community portion of Gene\u2019s pension benefits with CPT. The court determined the community property benefit reflected Gene\u2019s employment from January 16, 1973, through November 17, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">On February 1, 1994, the court signed a document entitled \u201cQualified Domestic Relations Order.\u201d Paragraph 3 of the order stated the parties agreed that each would receive 50 percent of the community portion of Gene\u2019s CPT pension benefits. Paragraph 5 stated: \u201cCommencing with the effective date of [Gene\u2019s] pension benefit, [CPT] shall pay to [Gene] each month, the balance of [Gene\u2019s] pension benefit remaining after deducting therefrom the amount payable to [Janet]. At the same time, [CPT] shall pay to [Janet] each month [Janet\u2019s] share of pension benefit. <em>The share payable to [Janet] shall continue to be paid to [Janet], or her designated successor in interest should [Janet] predecease [Gene], until terminated by [Gene\u2019s] death. </em>[CPT] shall not be liable to [Gene] for any payments made to [Janet] before [CPT] receives written notice of [Janet\u2019s] death.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>After Janet served the order on CPT, CPT advised Janet that the order was not a QDRO since it required CPT to pay Janet\u2019s designated successor if she predeceased Gene. (See \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(G)(i)(II).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">Janet petitioned for an order to show cause, asking the superior court to order CPT to comply with the February 1 order. After a hearing, the court found the February 1 order was a QDRO and that the order \u201c[did] not impose an excessive burden on [CPT].\u201d The court awarded attorney fees of $2,000 against CPT.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">CPT appealed, asserting the trial court erred in determining the February 1 order was a QDRO and in awarding attorney fees to Janet. CPT contended the court order was not a QDRO because (1) the provision permitting Janet to name a successor in interest to receive her share of the pension benefits provides a type or form of benefit not provided in CPT\u2019s plan (\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(D)(i)); and (2) Janet\u2019s successor in interest is not an \u201calternate payee\u201d within the meaning of ERISA (\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(K)). Janet did not file a respondent\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Because the issues raised by CPT were of first impression, we invited amicus curiae briefs from several family law and appellate organizations. The San Diego County Certified Family Law Specialists<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Family Law Specialists) responded and filed an amicus curiae brief supporting Janet\u2019s position below that the February 1 order is a QDRO. Two other organizations filed amicus curiae briefs: the United States Department of Labor (DOL) and an organization of pension funds (Pension Funds).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In our previous opinion, we rejected CPT\u2019s arguments, but determined the court order was not a QDRO to the extent it did not identify the name or address of Janet\u2019s successor in interest or the mechanism for determining an alternate successor. We reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The California Supreme Court granted CPT\u2019s petition for review, and later retransferred the case to this court with directions to vacate our opinion and reconsider in light of <em>Boggs </em>v. <em>Boggs, supra, </em>520 U.S. 833 [117 S.Ct. 1754], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>a decision filed after our original opinion. CPT submitted supplemental briefs, as did amici curiae DOL, Pension Funds, Family Law Specialists, and Cement Masons Southern California Pension Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">After our Supreme Court retransferred this matter and before the parties had completed their briefing, Janet died. This unfortunate event does not render the matter moot. CPT is bound by the February 1 order in determining the appropriate parties to receive pension payments upon Gene\u2019s retirement unless the order is reversed or modified on appeal. This viable issue requires resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">I. <em>The February 1 Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">CPT does not dispute the February 1 order is proper under California community property law. (See Fam. Code, \u00a7 2610; <em>In re Marriage of Powers </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 626, 634-646 [267 Cal.Rptr. 350]; <em>In re Marriage of Taylor </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 435, 440-443 [234 Cal.Rptr. 486]; <em>In re Marriage of Nice </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 444, 450-453 [281 Cal.Rptr. 415].) CPT argues instead the order is prohibited by federal law (ERISA) and this federal law preempts California community property law. In considering this contention, we first discuss ERISA\u2019s preemption and antialienation provisions. We next discuss the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Boggs </em>v. <em>Boggs, supra, </em>520 U.S. 833 [117 S.Ct. 1754]. We then describe ERISA\u2019s QDRO provisions and explain our conclusion the February 1 order is invalid because it does not meet the requirements of a QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">A. <em>ERISA\u2019s Preemption and Antialienation Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">ERISA is a comprehensive federal statutory scheme designed to protect the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans. <em>(Boggs </em>v. <em>Boggs, supra, </em>520 U.S. at p. 845 [117 S.Ct. at p. 1762]; <em>Burch </em>v. <em>George </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 246, 288 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 165, 866 P.2d 92].) ERISA contains a broad preemption clause, providing that ERISA provisions preempt any state law relating to an employee benefit plan. (\u00a7 1144(a).) ERISA also contains an anti-alienation or spendthrift provision, stating \u201c[e]ach pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\u201d (\u00a7 1056(d)(1).) Congress included the spendthrift provision to protect employees and their dependents from the participant\u2019s financial improvidence and to ensure benefits were available upon retirement. (See <em>Guidry </em>v. <em>Sheet Metal Workers Pension Fund </em>(1990) 493 U.S. 365, 376 [110 S.Ct. 680, 687, 107 L.Ed.2d 782].)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>Shortly after ERISA\u2019s enactment, courts began grappling with the question whether the transfer of pension benefits incident to a divorce was a prohibited assignment or alienation. Although most courts held the alienation provision was not applicable to transfers or allocations between an employee and his or her former spouse (see, e.g., <em>In re Marriage of Campa </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 113, 121-131 [152 Cal.Rptr. 362]; <em>American Tel &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Merry </em>(2d Cir. 1979) 592 F.2d 118, 120-125), some courts held ERISA preempted the application of state community property law with respect to interspousal transfers. (See <em>Francis </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1978) 458 F.Supp. 84, 86.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Seeking to address this and other issues, Congress enacted an amendment to ERISA, known as the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (REA). <em>(Mackey </em>v. <em>Lanier Collection Agency &amp; Serv. </em>(1988) 486 U.S. 825, 838 [108 S.Ct. 2182, 2190, 100 L.Ed.2d 836]; see <em>Ablamis </em>v. <em>Roper </em>(9th Cir. 1991) 937 F.2d 1450, 1453 <em>(Ablamis); In re Marriage of Oddino </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 67, 75 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 566, 939 P.2d 1266].) Congress \u201csought to protect the rights of nonemployee spouses and dependents by allowing state courts to make equitable divisions of property in a divorce or dissolution and provision for support of dependents.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Oddino, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 75; see <em>In re Marriage of Baker </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 206, 216-217 [251 Cal.Rptr. 126]; Summers, <em>ERISA Preemption of \u201cDirect\u201d and \u201cIndirect\u201d Community Property Interests in Pension Plans Upon the Non-Participant Spouse\u2019s Death </em>(1994) 55 La. L.Rev. 409, 423-425.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Although it could have done so, Congress did not attempt to achieve this objective by broadly permitting all interspousal transfers of pension benefits upon divorce. Instead, Congress took a two-step approach. First, it declared the transfers of pension benefits between spouses in a divorce context <em>were </em>prohibited alienations within the meaning of the anti-alienation provision. (\u00a7 1056(d)(1) &amp; (d)(3)(A).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, Congress created a limited exception to the rule, providing the anti-alienation provision \u201cshall not apply if the order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order [QDRO].\u201d (\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(A).) Consistent with this language, Congress added an exception to the express ERISA preemption provision, stating the preemption provision \u201cshall not apply to [QDRO\u2019s].\u201d (\u00a7 1144(b)(7).)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">These amendments provide that a domestic relations order that attempts to transfer pension benefits away from the employee is specifically barred by the spendthrift clause unless the order satisfies the QDRO criteria. (See <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number><em>Marriage of Oddino, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 77; <em>In re Marriage of Baker, supra, </em>204 Cal.App.3d at p. 219; <em>Fox Valley &amp; Vic. Const. Wkrs. Pension F. </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(7th Cir. 1990) 897 F.2d 275, 279.) As one commentator explains, \u201c[b]y stating explicitly that divorce divisions of pension plans are [alienations], Congress has foreclosed community ownership of the right to receive benefits by non-participant spouses unless that right is transferred to the spouse by a QDRO.\u201d (Summers, <em>supra, </em>55 La. L.Rev. at p. 438.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">B. <em>Boggs v. Boggs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In <em>Boggs, </em>the United States Supreme Court held ERISA preempts state law permitting a \u201cpredeceasing non-employee spouse\u201d <em>(Ablamis, supra, </em>937 F.2d at p. 1457) to transfer undistributed pension benefits by testamentary instrument. <em>(Boggs </em>v. <em>Boggs, supra, </em>520 U.S. at pp. 842-854 [117 S.Ct. at pp. 1761-1767].) This holding is not dispositive here because <em>Boggs </em>did not arise in the divorce context or concern a domestic relations order and thus the court did not specifically interpret or apply the QDRO provisions. But the decision contains relevant analysis guiding our consideration of the issues raised in this case. Most significant for our purposes, the decision makes clear the fundamental importance of the statutorily defined \u201cparticipant\u201d and \u201cbeneficiary\u201d statuses as a limitation on those entitled to receive ERISA pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">To understand <em>Boggs\u2019s </em>applicability to the issues raised here, it is helpful to briefly summarize the facts and reasoning underlying the court\u2019s conclusions. Issac Boggs began working for his employer in 1949. Issac and his wife, Dorothy, had three sons. In 1979, Dorothy died, leaving Issac one-third of her estate and her sons the remaining two-thirds subject to Issue\u2019s life estate (called a \u201clifetime usufruct\u201d under Louisiana law). In 1980, Issac married Sandra. In 1985, Issac retired, obtaining three primary benefits: (1) a lump-sum distribution from his employer\u2019s savings plan, which he rolled over into an IRA (individual retirement account); (2) shares of his employer\u2019s stock; and (3) a monthly annuity during his retirement. In 1989, Issac died.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The sons filed suit in Louisiana state court, seeking a portion of Issac\u2019s IRA, stock shares, and past monthly annuity payments, and portions of Sandra\u2019s past and future survivor annuity payments. <em>(Boggs </em>v. <em>Boggs, supra, </em>520 U.S. at p. 837 [117 S.Ct. at p. 1759].) Sandra responded by filing a federal court complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that ERISA preempts Louisiana\u2019s community property and succession laws to the extent they recognize the sons\u2019 claim to an interest in the retirement benefits. <em>(Ibid.) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>After the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s determination that there was no preemption, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Holding ERISA preempted Louisiana law permitting Dorothy to bequeath her community property pension benefits, the high court first discussed the sons\u2019 claims they were entitled to a portion of Sandra\u2019s survivor\u2019s annuity. <em>(Boggs </em>v. <em>Boggs, supra, </em>520 U.S. at pp. 842-865 [117 S.Ct. at pp. 1761-1772].) The court detailed ERISA\u2019s provisions mandating a survivor\u2019s annuity unless waived by the surviving spouse (\u00a7 1055) and explained the importance of the survivor\u2019s annuity to achieving ERISA\u2019s goals of ensuring a stream of income to participants and their beneficiaries. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Based on this discussion, the court concluded it would undermine congressional intent to allow Dorothy by a testamentary instrument to limit Sandra\u2019s right to the guaranteed annuity. <em>(Boggs </em>v. <em>Boggs, supra, </em>520 U.S. at pp. 842-865 [117 S.Ct. at pp. 1761-1772].)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\"><em>Boggs </em>then concluded the sons could not prevail on their claims to the remaining undistributed<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> retirement benefits because they were not \u201cparticipants\u201d or \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d under the QDRO or survivor annuity provisions. <em>(Boggs </em>v. <em>Boggs, supra, </em>520 U.S. at pp. 845-850 [117 S.Ct. at pp. 1762-1765] .) The court further determined that, as with survivors\u2019 annuities, these additional pension benefits were intended to provide a stream of income to participants and their beneficiaries and therefore it would be \u201cinimical to ERISA\u2019s purposes to permit testamentary recipients to acquire a competing interest in undistributed pension benefits.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 852 [117 S.Ct. at p. 1766] .)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">In reaching these conclusions, <em>Boggs </em>implicitly approved the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Ablamis, supra, </em>937 F.2d 1450. In <em>Ablamis, </em>the wife of an ERISA plan participant named her children from a former marriage as beneficiaries of a portion of her community property pension benefits. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1452.) After the wife died, the trustee of the ERISA plan obtained a declaratory order holding that the wife\u2019s estate was not entitled to an interest in the community pension benefits. <em>Ablamis </em>affirmed, reasoning the attempted transfer was a prohibited alienation under ERISA because a transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>of benefits in probate is not a \u201cdomestic relations\u201d order. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1455-1456.) The court stressed that permitting a testamentary transfer would violate the fundamental purpose and goals of ERISA\u2014\u201cto ensure that both spouses would receive sufficient funds to afford them security during their lifetimes, not to arrange for an opportunity for a predeceasing non-employee spouse to leave a part of her surviving husband\u2019s pension rights to others.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1457.)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">C. <em>Is the February 1 Order a </em>QDRO?</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">We turn now to the particular issue raised here: Is the February 1 order a QDRO? To establish an order is a QDRO, the parties must show it is a \u201cdomestic relations order\u201d and that it is a \u201cqualified\u201d order. (See \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(A).)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">It is undisputed the February 1 order is a domestic relations order. Section 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii) defines a \u201cdomestic relations order\u201d to mean a property settlement agreement which \u201crelates to the provision of. . . marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant\u201d and which \u201cis made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law).\u201d (\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii)(I), (II).) The February 1 order satisfies these requirements since it reflects a property division upon divorce and was made under Family Code section 2610.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">A domestic relations order is \u201cqualified\u201d if it \u201ccreates or recognizes the existence of an <em>alternate payee\u2019s </em>right to, or assigns to an <em>alternate payee </em>the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(i)(I), italics added.) The order must \u201cclearly specif [y]\u201d the name and address of the participant and of the alternate payee and the amount and manner of the payments to be paid to the alternate payee. (\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(C).) A \u201cqualified\u201d order cannot require the plan to pay increased benefits or provide benefits not otherwise provided under the plan. (\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(D).) The QDRO provisions define <em>\u201calternate payee\u201d </em>to mean \u201cany spouse, <em>former spouse, </em>child, or other dependent of a participant who is recognized by a domestic relations order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under a plan with respect to such participant.\u201d (\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(K), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">CPT argues the order is not \u201cqualified\u201d because Janet\u2019s \u201csuccessor in interest\u201d is not an \u201calternate payee\u201d within the meaning of ERISA and because the order provides a type of benefit not offered under the plan. Because we agree with the first (alternate payee) argument, we do not reach the second (type of benefit) argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>The portion of the February 1 order providing Janet with pension benefits during her lifetime satisfies the \u201calternate payee\u201d requirement because she is a \u201cformer spouse\u201d within the meaning of the alternate payee definition. However, the portion of the order providing Janet\u2019s \u201csuccessor in interest\u201d with the right to potential benefits does not satisfy the \u201calternate payee\u201d definition since Janet is free to name an individual who is not the \u201cspouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(K).)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Family Law Specialists maintain the designation of a successor in interest does not invalidate the order because section 1056(d)(3)(B)(i) (I) does not state a domestic relations order is qualified only if <em>each </em>potential recipient of benefits is an alternate payee. Rather, the code section states that an order is qualified if it creates or recognizes the rights of an alternate payee to receive pension benefits. (\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(i)(I).) Under the Family Law Specialists\u2019 view, the February 1 order satisfies this requirement because Janet is an \u201calternate payee\u201d and the February 1 order expressly \u201crecognizes\u201d Janet\u2019s right to her community property portion of Gene\u2019s pension benefits; the fact that the order further permits the alternate payee to exercise her rights under state community property law does not change this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">While this position may be supported by a literal reading of the QDRO provisions, <em>Boggs </em>makes clear that ERISA\u2014when viewed in its entirety\u2014 does not permit a third party to obtain a right to pension benefits unless that person falls within ERISA\u2019s statutory definitions of a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d or \u201calternate payee.\u201d As <em>Boggs </em>explains, this result is compelled by the central purpose of the ERISA and REA provisions which seek to provide for the economic security of the participant or the participant\u2019s dependents\u2014those defined as \u201calternate payees.\u201d Since Janet\u2019s \u201csuccessor in interest\u201d could be any third party\u2014including a friend, neighbor, or creditor\u2014the order is inconsistent with this fundamental Congressional intent. (See <em>Ablamis, supra, </em>937 F.2d at pp. 1456-1457 [\u201c. . . one of Congress\u2019 primary purposes in enacting the limited exception to ERISA\u2019s prohibition on assignment and alienation was to safeguard the security of the employee\u2019s <em>immediate family members </em>in the case of divorce or separation,\u201d italics added].) Under the existing order, a third party \u201csuccessor\u201d would have the right to obtain benefits at the expense of the living employee; this outcome is \u201cincompatible with [ERISA\u2019s] spendthrift provision.\u201d <em>(Boggs </em>v. <em>Boggs, supra, </em>520 U.S. at p. 852 [117 S.Ct. at p. 1766].)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Equally important, the rule that only an \u201calternate payee\u201d may obtain ERISA benefits through a domestic relations order is mandated by the limited scope of a plan\u2019s fiduciary obligations, which expressly run only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>\u201cparticipants\u201d and \u201cbeneficiaries.\u201d (\u00a7 1104(a)(1).) <em>Boggs </em>specifically rejected the argument that a court has the power to recognize an additional class of persons entitled to receive pension benefits: <em>\u201cIt is unpersuasive to suggest that third parties could assert their claims [to ERISA </em>benefits] <em>without being counted as </em>\u2018beneficiaries.\u2019 A plan fiduciary\u2019s responsibilities run only to participants and beneficiaries. (\u00a7 1104(a)(1).) Assets of a plan are held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants and beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administration. (\u00a7 1103(c)(1).) Reading ERISA to permit nonbeneficiary interests, even if not enforced against the plan, would result in troubling anomalies. Either pension plans would be run for the benefit of only a subset of those who have a stake in the plan or state law would have to move in to fill the apparent gaps between plan administration responsibilities and ownership rights, resulting in a complex set of requirements varying from State to State. <em>Neither result accords with the statutory </em>scheme.\u201d <em>(Boggs </em>v. <em>Boggs, supra, </em>520 U.S. at pp. 850-851 [117 S.Ct. at p. 1765], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Janet\u2019s undesignated \u201csuccessor in interest\u201d is neither a participant nor a beneficiary. A participant is the employee or the former employee. (\u00a7 1002(7).) A beneficiary is defined as \u201ca person designated by a participant, or by the terms of an employee benefit plan, who is or may become entitled to a benefit thereunder.\u201d (\u00a7 1002(8).) The QDRO provisions specifically add an \u201calternate payee\u201d to this definition, providing \u201c[a] person who is an alternate payee under a [QDRO] shall be considered for purposes of any provision of this chapter a beneficiary under the plan.\u201d (\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(J).) The obvious corollary to this rule is that a third party named in a domestic relations order who is not an alternate payee is not a \u201cbeneficiary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Read together, ERISA\u2019s statutory definitions and fiduciary provisions prohibit a court from issuing a domestic relations order requiring an ERISA plan administrator to pay benefits to a person who does not fall within the definition of an \u201calternate payee.\u201d (\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(K).) Because paragraph 5 of the February 1 order may require CPT to pay benefits to an individual (Janet\u2019s successor) who is not an alternate payee within the meaning of ERISA, this paragraph is fatal to establishing the order as a QDRO.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">We stress the narrowness of our decision. Our holding concerns only the order before us today. We do not decide, as CPT urges us to do, that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>testamentary devise contained in a QDRO is invalid. For example, we do not reach the issue of whether the February 1 order would be valid under ERISA if the parties had specifically identified Janet\u2019s \u201csuccessor in interest\u201d to be a particular individual who came within the \u201calternate payee\u201d definition (e.g., the Shelsteads\u2019 child). We likewise do not determine the validity of a domestic relations order providing a nonemployee spouse with testamentary rights in a form different than that contained in the February 1 order. There are several different ways of dividing a pension benefit, including a \u201cshared payment\u201d approach (dividing the <em>payments </em>made to a retired employee) and a \u201cseparate interest\u201d approach (dividing the retirement <em>benefit </em>rather than just the payments). (See U.S. Dept. of Labor, Pension and Welf. Admin., QDROs: The Division of Pensions Through Qualified Domestic Relations Orders (1997) ch. 3 [available at http://www.dol.gov/dol/pwba/public/pubs/ qdro.htm (visited June 9, 1998)].) As noted by the DOL, under the separate interest approach, a court may have additional options permitting it to provide the divorced nonemployee spouse with a form of testamentary rights consistent with CPT\u2019s plan and with ERISA. These and other related questions are properly left to a dispute where both spouses are still living, and thus able to advocate their respective positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Guided by the recent <em>Boggs </em>decision and ERISA\u2019s statutory language, legislative history, and underlying public policy, we determine the February 1 order is not a QDRO because it may require CPT to pay benefits to an individual who is not an \u201calternate payee\u201d within the meaning of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">II. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">In its original amicus curiae brief, DOL challenged this court\u2019s jurisdiction to determine whether the February 1 order is a QDRO, arguing federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In its supplemental brief, DOL states it is not abandoning this argument. The contention is without merit. (3) As our Supreme Court recently held, California courts have subject matter jurisdiction to decide whether a superior court\u2019s order assigning retirement benefits in a dissolution action is a QDRO. <em>(In re Marriage of Oddino, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 73-82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">III. <em>Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">The court awarded Janet $2,000 in attorney fees. The fee order must be reversed since Janet is no longer the prevailing party.  Moreover, a party is entitled to attorney fees only if the fees are permitted by statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>or agreement. (See <em>Trope </em>v. <em>Katz </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 274, 278-279 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 902 P.2d 259].) There is no showing in the record that CPT and Janet agreed to a fee award or that the court based its fee award on a specific statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">We reverse.
