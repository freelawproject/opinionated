In order to ensure an adequate response to \u201cincidents,\u201d the three departments cooperated to form the \u201cNorth County Regional\u201d SWAT team (hereafter the Regional Team) which was composed of all three departments\u2019 SWAT teams. The Regional Team trained together and responded to incidents as a single team, although the members of the Regional Team remained employed by their individual departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Regional Team training exercises often utilized the services of \u201crole players.\u201d During a Regional Team training exercise, Theodore Brassinga, a Palo Alto reserve police officer who was not a SWAT team member but was assigned to serve as a role player, was shot to death by Greg Acton, a Mountain View police officer who was a Regional Team member. Plaintiffs, Brassinga\u2019s heirs, filed a wrongful death action against Mountain View and Acton. Mountain View asserted as an affirmative defense that workers\u2019 compensation benefits were the exclusive remedy because either Mountain View was Brassinga\u2019s \u201cspecial employer\u201d at the time of his death or the Regional Team was the \u201cspecial employer\u201d of both officers. Acton\u2019s motion for summary adjudication was granted, but Mountain View\u2019s summary judgment motion was denied. The case was tried before a jury, but the trial court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a directed verdict on liability in respondeat superior. The only issue put before the jury was the level of damages. It returned a $3,250,000 verdict for plaintiffs. Mountain View claims on appeal that the superior court erred in denying summary judgment and the trial court erred in directing the verdict because either there was a legitimate factual question that should have been put before the jury or the evidence indisputably established the affirmative defense. Plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal challenges the summary adjudication in favor of Acton. We conclude that the superior court erred in granting Acton\u2019s motion and the trial court erred in directing the verdict. Therefore, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The Pleadings</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that Acton had been negligent and that Mountain View was liable by way of respondeat superior for Acton\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>negligent acts. It also alleged that Mountain View had been directly negligent in \u201cthe hiring, retention, training and supervision of Acton, the inspection of Acton\u2019s weapon, and the failure to establish procedures\u201d to prevent accidental shootings. Mountain View pled as an affirmative defense that Brassinga was Acton\u2019s \u201cco-worker\u201d and Mountain View\u2019s \u201cemployee\u201d at the time of his death and therefore his exclusive remedy was provided by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Summary Judgment Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Mountain View and Acton moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication. They argued that workers\u2019 compensation was the exclusive remedy because Brassinga was a \u201cspecial employee\u201d of either the Regional Team or Mountain View. The affidavits submitted by Mountain View and Acton in favor of their summary judgment motion established the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The Regional Team regularly trained together and responded to incidents as a single team although the members of the Regional Team remained employed by and were paid by their individual departments. The Regional Team itself had no employees. The equipment used by the Regional Team was purchased by and stored at the individual departments. The departments attempted to complement each other by not duplicating equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">On May 15, 1994, the Regional Team held a training exercise at the Gilroy train yard. Brassinga was employed by Palo Alto as a reserve police officer and paid for his services. Palo Alto paid Brassinga on May 15 for \u201chelping the regional team\u201d during its day-long training exercise. He was assigned to act as a \u201crole player\u201d during the training exercise.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brassinga had served in the same capacity at a previous Regional Team training exercise. Role players were brought to the May 15 training exercise by both Palo Alto and Mountain View. Mountain View brought four Mountain View employees who were not members of the SWAT team to act as role players.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">At the beginning of the training session, a weapons inspection was conducted by \u201crange masters\u201d who had been \u201ctrained to insure that the weapon is empty.\u201d Early in the training session, the Regional Team split into two groups. One group was composed of the Palo Alto members while the other was composed of the Mountain View and Los Altos members. The plan was for these two groups to train separately and then \u201cblend together\u201d and train as a group. The role players, including Brassinga, were initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>utilized in the Palo Alto group\u2019s training. When the Palo Alto group took a break, Mountain View Police Officer David Worley, who was supervising the Mountain View/Los Altos group\u2019s training, asked Brassinga and the other role players \u201cif they minded coming on over, instead of taking a break\u201d and acting as role players in the Mountain View/Los Altos group\u2019s training. Brassinga and the other role players agreed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">These role players included the four Mountain View employees, Brassinga and a second Palo Alto reserve police officer. Worley gave the role players five to ten minutes of instructions about what they should do. He continued to give them instructions as the training progressed. Two or more Amtrak employees<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requested permission to join the role players. Worley allowed them to participate. Regional Team members from Palo Alto and Mountain View were also acting as role players at times for the Mountain View/Los Altos group. Worley had the power to discipline any of the role players by removing them from their role playing duties. If any of the role players had decided that they no longer wished to participate, they could have discontinued their participation without criticism or discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">While he was carrying out his role playing duties, Brassinga was sometimes supervised by Palo Alto officers and at other times supervised by a Mountain View officer. Brassinga\u2019s role playing included the use of a \u201ctoy gun\u201d which had been provided to him by Palo Alto. While acting as a role player in the training of the Mountain View/Los Altos group, Brassinga was shot to death by Acton. Plaintiffs received workers\u2019 compensation death benefits from Palo Alto.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Ruling on Summary Judgment Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Judge Jeremy D. Fogel denied Mountain View\u2019s motion for summary judgment. However, he granted Acton\u2019s motion for summary adjudication on the ground that \u201cas a matter of law based upon the undisputed evidence\u201d Acton and Brassinga \u201cwere general employees of their respective police agencies and special employees of the Regional SWAT Team, a joint enterprise among the cities of Los Altos, Mountain View and Palo Alto.\u201d Fogel -concluded that, because Brassinga and Acton \u201cwere in effect co-employees of the same joint enterprise, plaintiffs cannot recover against Acton directly unless Acton\u2019s conduct comes within one of the exceptions contained in Labor Code section 3601(a), in which event respondeat superior liability against City would be barred by Labor Code section 3601(b).\u201d Nevertheless, Fogel found that \u201cActon\u2019s immunity does not extend to City . . . .\u201d He stated \u201csomebody has got to be responsible if there is tort conduct committed by Officer Acton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Judge Richard C. Turrone was the trial judge. He denied Mountain View\u2019s request that the court bifurcate the affirmative defense and try it before the rest of the issues in the case. Mountain View conceded that Acton had been negligent. It moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that it was immune from liability under Government Code sections 815 and 815.2. This motion was denied. Judge Turrone ruled that Judge Fogel\u2019s finding that Acton and Brassinga were special employees of the Regional Team was not binding on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Trial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The Regional Team was formed because the individual departments lacked adequate resources and personnel to handle emergencies. The Regional Team had about 27 members. It had a single standard for membership and a \u201cunified chain of command.\u201d This meant that a Regional Team member from one department could supervise Regional Team members from another department. The Regional Team did not pay the salary of any of its members, owned no property and had no office. It trained in four week-long sessions each year. Although all of the equipment used by the Regional Team was owned by and stored at individual departments, the departments attempted to complement each other by not duplicating equipment and having interchangeable equipment. The team members \u201cinterchanged equipment all the time . . . .\u201d The members of the Regional Team wore identical \u201cteam SWAT uniforms.\u201d These uniforms were worn only for Regional Team activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The Regional Team regularly used \u201crole players\u201d in its training. The role players were either members of the Regional Team or other \u201claw enforcement agency\u201d people. Usually, the role players were police department employees. These role players could be supervised by any member of the Regional Team. The Regional Team commanders were in command of the role players \u201cregardless [of whether the role player] was a Palo Alto employee, a Mountain View employee or a Los Altos employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">On May 15, 1994, the Regional Team met for what was planned to be a day-long training exercise at the Gilroy Caltrain yard. The intent was for the Regional Team members from all three departments to work together. In order to simulate actual situations, the training exercise was planned to include role players, and Palo Alto and Mountain View had brought police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>department employees to act as role players.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Brassinga was a Palo Alto reserve police officer. He was not a member of the Regional Team or the Palo Alto SWAT team. Brassinga was assigned to act as one of the role players to assist the Regional Team in this training exercise. He had acted as a role player during a previous Regional Team training exercise. Brassinga was paid $7.40 per hour for his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Acton was employed by Mountain View, and he was a member of its SWAT team and the Regional Team. He became a \u201crange master\u201d in 1994. Acton had been asked to become a range master because the range masters on the Regional Team were predominantly from Palo Alto, and Mountain View wanted to \u201ctake a little bit of the burden off of them.\u201d A range master \u201cis someone who controls the overall supervision of weapons and training.\u201d Mountain View did not have a weapons inspection policy which set forth how a weapons inspection was to be done. On May 15, the weapons inspection was done simultaneously for the entire Regional Team. All of the team members lined up at once. The Mountain View officers\u2019 weapons were checked by Mountain View range masters while other individuals checked the weapons of the Los Altos and Palo Alto officers. Acton and another Mountain View officer were the range masters who inspected the weapons of the Mountain View officers. Like his fellow officer, Acton intended to have each of the officers whose weapons he inspected inspect his weapon. However, unlike his fellow officer, he neglected to have <em>anyone </em>inspect his weapon. Thus, prior to the shooting of Brassinga, no one discovered that Acton had never unloaded his weapon. Acton felt that one of the \u201cfactors\u201d contributing to his failure to inspect his weapon or have his weapon inspected was that another Mountain View officer was hurrying the weapons inspection along.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">A Regional Team member from Palo Alto explained to Brassinga and the other Palo Alto reserve officer what the two men would be doing as role players. After the weapons inspection, the entire Regional Team went on an extensive tour of the trains on which they would be training. Brassinga and the other Palo Alto reserve police officer accompanied the Regional Team members on this tour. Then, the Regional Team split into two equal groups. One group was made up of the Palo Alto members and the other group was made up of the Mountain View and Los Altos members. The two groups began training in different train cars. Brassinga and the other role players worked with the Palo Alto group for about an hour. The role players were wearing \u201ccivilian clothes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">When the Palo Alto group took a break, Mountain View Police Sergeant David Worley asked the role players to assist the Mountain View/Los Altos <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>group with its training.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Worley was the Regional Team\u2019s assistant tactical commander, and he was in command of the Mountain View/Los Altos group\u2019s training exercises. The group of role players included Brassinga, the other Palo Alto reserve police officer, four Mountain View Police Department employees and several members of the Regional Team command staff. The role players agreed to assist the Mountain View/Los Altos group in its training. These role players were joined by two Amtrak employees who \u201cvolunteered\u201d to act as role players in the exercise. Brassinga could have discontinued his role playing duties at any time without discipline or criticism. Any Regional Team member could have complained about Brassinga\u2019s conduct in performing his role playing duties and caused Brassinga to be disciplined by directing a complaint through the \u201cchain of command\u201d back to Palo Alto. A Regional Team member could also have removed Brassinga from his role playing duties as discipline for inappropriate conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Throughout his role playing duties, Brassinga was given instructions on how he should act. While Brassinga and the other role players were role playing with the Mountain View/Los Altos group, they were \u201csubject to the command\u201d of Worley, and Worley gave them instructions on how to fulfill their role playing duties. He would explain the scenario to the role players and tell them how much of a challenge to provide and what type of behavior to engage in, but he would allow the role players to decide among themselves who would play which role and where to conceal themselves. Worley talked to the role players after each scenario and gave them instructions. The role players provided the same services to the Mountain View/Los Altos group that they had provided to the Palo Alto group.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In the course of one of the scenarios conducted by the Mountain View/Los Altos group, about halfway through the day\u2019s training exercises, Acton shot Brassinga. At that point, it was discovered that Acton\u2019s weapon was fully loaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Motions for Nonsuit and Directed Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">After both sides had rested, plaintiffs moved for nonsuit on Mountain View\u2019s affirmative defense. Mountain View opposed plaintiffs\u2019 motion and made its own motion for a directed verdict. Each side argued that it had established its case as a matter of law. However, Mountain View also argued, in opposition to plaintiffs\u2019 motion, that the issue of whether Brassinga was a special employee \u201cneeds to go before the jury.\u201d Judge Turrone found that \u201cthe facts in this case, in large part, are not in dispute.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>uncontradicted [Acton\u2019s] an employee of Mountain View. He\u2019s working on his job as a Mountain View police officer, paid by Mountain View, [f] At the time of the shooting it\u2019s conceded that his chain of command, that is to say his supervisors, were Mountain View officers .... And that he was never under the command of Palo Alto. flO . . . [Brassinga\u2019s] a reserve officer of Palo Alto. I think it\u2019s significant that he\u2019s not a member of the regional team .... And I think significantly he was a volunteer to be a role model [sic] for Palo Alto as well as later Mountain View when they needed a role player.\u201d \u201cThe role players, without exception, were, as I understand it, volunteers .... I think that\u2019s significant. I mean, is one to argue that the Amtrack [sic] volunteers were special employees of the City of Mountain View? I have some trouble with that.\u201d \u201c[T]he Palo Alto reserve officers were doing the same thing they had done for Palo Alto. No one ever countermanded, \u2018Forget everything that Palo Alto told you; you are now subject to our rulings.\u2019 \u201d \u201cAnd significantly everything that transpired that day, except for that latter portion of Mountain View\u2019s training with role players, was done separate and distinct.\u201d \u201cThis regional team had no office, no payroll, no equipment of its own.\u201d \u201cEach member of the team and the victim was not a member of the team, but each member of the team was paid by the respective police agencies. The equipment that [Brassinga] was using belonged to Palo Alto . . . .\u201d \u201cThe evidence is just not there that [Brassinga] . . . ever consented to a new employment relationship.\u201d \u201cMountain View\u2019s right to control the details of what [Brassinga] did were minimal at best.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Judge Turrone granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for nonsuit on Mountain View\u2019s affirmative defense and denied Mountain View\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. He directed a verdict \u201con negligence in respondeat superior\u201d in favor of plaintiffs. \u201cThis case is uncontradicted Acton was negligent, he was working for the city. They are responsible. There\u2019s no immunity.\u201d The case went to the jury solely on damages, and the jury returned a verdict in the amount of $3,250,000 for plaintiffs. Judgment was entered on the jury\u2019s verdict. Mountain View\u2019s motions to vacate the judgment, for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict were denied. Mountain View filed a timely notice of appeal. Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of cross-appeal challenging the summary adjudication of its action against Acton.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The only defense litigated by Mountain View was its affirmative defense based on the exclusive remedy provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. \u201c[T]he right to recover [workers\u2019] compensation is [with certain exceptions not applicable here] ... the sole and exclusive remedy of the employee or his or her dependents against the employer . . . .\u201d (Lab. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>\u00a7 3602, subd. (a).) \u201c[Workers\u2019 compensation is, with certain exceptions,] the exclusive remedy for injury or death of an employee against any other employee of the employer acting within the scope of his or her employment . . . .\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3601, subd. (a).) \u201cIn no event. . . shall the employer be held liable, directly or indirectly, for damages awarded against, or for a liability incurred by the other employee . . . .\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3601, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">It was undisputed that Palo Alto was Brassinga\u2019s general employer, but this fact did not preclude a finding that Mountain View or the Regional Team was Brassinga\u2019s special employer.  \u201c \u2018Where an employer sends an employee to do work for another person, and both have the right to exercise certain powers of control over the employee, that employee may be held to have two employers\u2014his original or \u201cgeneral\u201d employer and a second, the \u201cspecial\u201d employer.\u2019 . . . ffl] If general and special employment exist, \u2018the injured workman can look to both employers for [worker\u2019s] compensation benefits. [Citations.] If work[er]\u2019s compensation is available, it constitutes, with an exception not pertinent here, the work[er]\u2019s sole remedy against the employer. [Citation.] Thus where there is dual employment the work[er] is barred from maintaining an action for damages against either employer.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kowalski </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 168, 174-175 [151 Cal.Rptr. 671, 588 P.2d 811], fn. omitted.) The basic issues presented in this appeal and the cross-appeal are: (1) did the evidence establish as a matter of law that <em>either </em>Mountain View or the Regional Team <em>was </em>Brassinga\u2019s special employer; and (2) did the evidence establish as a matter of law that <em>neither </em>Mountain View <em>nor </em>the Regional Team was Brassinga\u2019s special employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">A. <em>Standards of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Mountain View argues that this case presents \u201cthe problem of conflicting and mutually irreconcilable standards of review with respect to the same evidence, the same facts, the same issue and the same causes of action, arising out of the different procedural contexts in which the trial court\u2019s rulings took place.\u201d We do not find the applicable standards of review to be problematic, conflicting or irreconcilable. The challenged rulings are all reviewed de novo, and the relevant standards require reversal of the denial of summary judgment if Mountain View established its defense as a matter of law, reversal of the directed verdict if there was sufficient evidence to support Mountain View\u2019s exclusive remedy defense, and reversal of the summary adjudication if there was a material triable factual issue as to Acton\u2019s exclusive remedy defense. These standards do not conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>1. <em>Summary Judgment Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Appellate review of a ruling on a summary judgment or summary adjudication motion is de novo. <em>(Stratton </em>v. <em>First Nat. Life Ins.

This remains true \u2018[w]here the evidence, though not in conflict, permits conflicting inferences.\u2019 . . . However, if neither the evidence nor inferences are in conflict, then the question of whether an employment relationship exists becomes a question of law which may be resolved by summary judgment. . . .\u201d <em>(Riley </em>v. <em>Southwest Marine, Inc. </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1242, 1248-1249 [250 Cal.Rptr. 718], citations omitted.)  \u201c[S]pecial employment is most often resolved on the basis of <em>\u2018reasonable inferences </em>to be drawn from the circumstances shown.\u2019 Where the evidence, though not in conflict, permits conflicting inferences, \u2018 \u201c. . . the existence or nonexistence of the special employment relationship barring the injured employee\u2019s action at law is generally a question reserved for the trier of fact.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Marsh </em>v. <em>Tilley Steel Co. </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 486, 493 [162 Cal.Rptr. 320, 606 P.2d 355], first italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">2. <em>Directed Verdict</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">A directed verdict is also subjected to de novo appellate review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   \u201c[T]he power of the court to direct a verdict is absolutely the same as the power of the court to grant a nonsuit.\u201d <em>(Estate of Lances </em>(1932) 216 Cal. 397, 400 [14 P.2d 768].) \u201cA motion for a directed verdict \u2018is in the nature of a demurrer to the evidence, and is governed by practically the same rules, and concedes as true the evidence on behalf of the adverse party, with all fair and reasonable inferences to be deduced therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 400-401.) If substantial evidence before the jury could have supported a finding that Mountain View had established its exclusive remedy defense, the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict. On the other hand, if the record lacked substantial evidence supporting this defense, the directed verdict was proper. (Cf. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 112, 117-118 [184 Cal.Rptr. 891, 649 P.2d 224, 35 A.L.R.4th 1036].)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">B. <em>Regional Team Could Not Qualify as an \u201cEmployer\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Mountain View argues that the Regional Team was the special employer of both Brassinga and Acton. Plaintiffs maintain that the Regional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Team was not an entity which could qualify as an \u201cemployer\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">The Labor Code states that, for workers\u2019compensation purposes, \u201c \u2018employer\u2019 means: [^] (a) The State and every State agency. [^] (b) Each county, city, district, and <em>all public and quasi public corporations and public agencies therein. </em>ftQ (c) Every person including any public service corporation, which has any natural person in service. [^] (d) The legal representative of any deceased employer.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3300, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Mountain View concedes that the Regional Team was not a \u201cjoint powers agency\u201d with independent existence, but it characterizes the Regional Team as a \u201c \u2018joint enterprise\u2019 arising out of a \u2018mutual aid agreement\u2019 of the type authorized by Gov. C. \u00a7\u00a7 8616-8617.\u201d It describes a \u201cjoint enterprise\u201d as an informal undertaking in which the \u201cassociates\u201d share control.

That decision, <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Mead </em>(1983) 127 Mich.App. 209 [338 N.W.2d 919], is of little help on this subject, because it does not consider whether a \u201cjoint enterprise\u201d comes within California\u2019s definition of an \u201cemployer\u201d for worker\u2019s compensation purposes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Berger, supra, </em>at p. 923.) We can also find no support in <em>Horney </em>v. <em>Guy F. Atkinson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number><em>Co. </em>(1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 923 [190 Cal.Rptr. 18] for Mountain View\u2019s claim that the Regional Team was an employer. In <em>Horney, </em>it was undisputed the injured employee was a <em>general </em>employee of <em>the joint venture. (Horney, supra, </em>at p. 925.) <em>Horney </em>did not consider the question of what type of entity qualifies as an employer. The joint venture in that case was the prime contractor on a construction project, and it maintained its own bank account from which it paid <em>its </em>employees. <em>(Horney, supra, </em>at pp. 925-926.) The only proposition for which <em>Horney </em>stands which is relevant to this case is that \u201c[a]n employee of a joint venture is an employee of each individual member of the joint venture [and therefore] ... a member of a joint venture is entitled to the protection of the exclusive remedy provisions of the Labor Code.\u201d <em>(Horney, supra, </em>at p. 927.) If Mountain View had established that the Regional Team was an employer which employed Brassinga, <em>Horney </em>might support its exclusive remedy defense. However, <em>Horney </em>tells us nothing about whether the Regional Team could qualify as an \u201cemployer\u201d under Labor Code section 3300.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Another potentially relevant case is <em>Rogness </em>v. <em>English Moss Joint Venturers </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 190 [239 Cal.Rptr. 387], In <em>Rogness, </em>the plaintiffs were general employees of one member of a joint venture. They were injured while working on a construction project in which the joint venture was engaged. They sued the joint venture and each of the joint venturers. <em>(Rogness, supra, </em>at pp. 191-192.) The appellate court distinguished <em>Horney </em>and held that the joint venture and the joint venturers other than the plaintiffs\u2019 employer had no exclusive remedy defense. It held that \u201c. . .an employee of one party in a joint venture is not as a matter of law also an employee of the joint venture itself or the other joint venturers and therefore is not limited to his workers\u2019 compensation remedy under the Labor Code in seeking recovery from the remaining joint venturers for alleged negligence.\u201d <em>(Rogness, supra, </em>at p. 191.) Like <em>Horney, Rogness </em>did not consider whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>any of the involved entities qualified as an \u201cemployer\u201d under Labor Code section 3300.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">The Labor Code definition of \u201cemployer\u201d is quite specific about the nature of \u201cpublic\u201d employers. Unquestionably the Regional Team was not a \u201cState agency\u201d or \u201cpublic [or] quasi public corporation,\u201d and the only question remaining is whether it was a \u201cpublic agenc[y]\u201d within the meaning of Labor Code section 3300.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We can find nothing in the record which even suggests that the Regional Team was a \u201cpublic agenc[y]\u201d within what we construe to be the meaning of Labor Code section 3300. As plaintiffs point out, the undisputed evidence established that the Regional Team had no office, property, employees, letterhead, phone number or any other indicia that it functioned as a \u201cpublic agenc[y].\u201d Clearly, the Regional Team was not an entity that could have been subjected to any claim for recompense because there would have been no way to contact \u201cit.\u201d Under these facts, we agree with plaintiffs that the evidence presented below established as a matter of law that the Regional Team could not have been an \u201cemployer\u201d of anyone within the meaning of Labor Code section 3300.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">C. <em>Was Mountain View Brassinga\u2019s Special Employer?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Mountain View\u2019s alternative theory is that the evidence either established as a matter of law that, or raised a triable issue of fact as to whether, Mountain View was Brassinga\u2019s special employer. Plaintiffs assert that the evidence established as a matter of law that (1) Brassinga was acting as a \u201cvolunteer,\u201d (2) even if Brassinga was a special employee of Mountain View, Mountain View would still be liable under <em>Marsh </em>and (3) Brassinga was not a special employee of Mountain View.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court accepted all of plaintiffs\u2019 assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>1. <em>\u201cVolunteer\u201d Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Plaintiffs convinced the trial court that Brassinga had been acting as a \u201cvolunteer\u201d at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The term \u201cemployee\u201d is defined broadly, and, ordinarily, \u201c[a] person who renders service to another is presumed to be an \u2018employee.\u2019 \u201d <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 391, 396 [179 Cal.Rptr. 214, 637 P.2d 681].) \u201c \u2018Employee\u2019 means every person in the service of an employer under any appointment or contract of hire or apprenticeship, express or implied, oral or written, whether lawfully or unlawfully employed . . . .\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3351.) However, \u201c \u2018 [e]mployee\u2019 excludes the following: [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] (i) Any person performing voluntary service for a public agency or a private, nonprofit organization who receives no remuneration for the services other than meals, transportation, lodging, or reimbursement for incidental expenses.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3352.) The test of whether a person was providing \u201cvoluntary service\u201d depends on whether the services were rendered for charitable or gratuitous reasons or for remuneration. <em>(Arriaga </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1055, 1067 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 116, 892 P.2d 150]; <em>Hoppmann </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1119, 1125 [277 Cal.Rptr. 116]; <em>Barragan </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 637, 649 [240 Cal.Rptr. 811].) \u201c[T]he reality of the situation, not the parties\u2019 characterization of the relationship, controls the outcome.\u201d <em>(Hoppmann </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1126-1127.)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">It was undisputed that Brassinga was receiving hourly wages in return for acting as a role player for the May 15 Regional Team training exercises. Although the evidence disclosed that Brassinga could, but did not, decline his assignment by Palo Alto to this duty or Worley\u2019s request for his services during the training exercises, this did not establish that Brassinga was a \u201cvolunteer.\u201d The mere fact that an employee is given the freedom to decline a particular assignment does not mean that, when the employee accepts an assignment and engages in compensated work, he or she is transformed into a volunteer. Slavish obedience is not a requisite element of an employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">It is immaterial that Worley characterized his request for role players as seeking \u201cvolunteers.\u201d As <em>Hoppmann </em>explained, it is the reality of the relationship rather than the characterization of it by the parties that controls. The group of role players who responded to Worley\u2019s request included both Palo Alto and Mountain View employees. Unquestionably, the Mountain View employees who were, like Brassinga, being paid for their services as role <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>players when they responded to Worley\u2019s request, were not suddenly transformed into nonemployee volunteers when they responded to their supervisor\u2019s request for their services. In fact, a person who is being paid by his or her employer for his or her time at the time that the person provides services to a public agency could never fall within the exception stated in Labor Code section 3352, subdivision (i) unless that person\u2019s <em>employer </em>was donating its employee\u2019s services to the public agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">The evidence in this case did not establish that <em>Palo Alto </em>was donating Brassinga\u2019s time to Mountain View at any time on May 15. Similarly, the evidence did not demonstrate that Brassinga, as a compensated employee, was free to make a unilateral decision to donate the time for which he was being compensated by Palo Alto to another entity. Therefore, the evidence did not establish as a matter of law that the role playing services Brassinga was providing at the time of his death were \u201cvoluntary services\u201d within the meaning of Labor Code section 3352, subdivision (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">2. <em>Marsh</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\"><em>Marsh </em>held that \u201c. . . where the negligence of a special employee injures another of the special employer\u2019s workers, the victim is not barred by workers\u2019 compensation law from suing the general employer of the tortfeasor in negligence on respondeat superior principles.\u201d <em>(Marsh </em>v. <em>Tilley Steel Co., supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 490.) Plaintiffs assert that this principle is applicable here to permit Brassinga to sue Acton\u2019s general employer, Mountain View, even if Brassinga was a special employee of Mountain View. Not so. In <em>Marsh, </em>the injured employee had no employment relationship whatsoever with the general employer of the tortfeasor. Consequently, the exclusive remedy provisions did not bar a tort action by the injured employee against the general employer of the tortfeasor. Here, if Mountain View was Brassinga\u2019s special employer, the exclusive remedy provisions would necessarily bar a tort action by Brassinga against Mountain View.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">3. <em>Factual Dispute Whether Mountain View Was Brassinga\u2019s Special Employer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">a. <em>The Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">The key to the existence of a special employment relationship is control. \u201c[W]here the servants of two employers are jointly engaged in a project of mutual interest, each employee ordinarily remains the servant of his own master and does not thereby become the special employee of the other.\u201d <em>(Marsh </em>v. <em>Tilley Steel Co., supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 493.) It is only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>where some measure of control over the employee is relinquished by the employee\u2019s general employer to another entity that the other entity may become the employee\u2019s special employer. \u201cIn determining whether a special employment relationship exists, the primary consideration is whether the special employer has \u2018 \u201c[t]he right to control and direct the activities of the alleged employee or the manner and method in which the work is performed, whether exercised or not However, \u2018[w]hether the right to control existed or was exercised is generally a question of fact to be resolved from the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the circumstances shown. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Kowalski </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 175, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Plaintiffs argue that a special employment relationship cannot be created unless the general employer relinquishes \u201call\u201d control to the special employer and the special employer becomes solely responsible for the special employee\u2019s actions. They claim to find this principle of law in <em>Marsh. </em> \u201cWhen an employer\u2014the \u2018general\u2019 employer\u2014lends an employee to another employer and relinquishes to a borrowing employer <em>all right of control </em>over the employee\u2019s activities, a \u2018special employment\u2019 relationship arises between the borrowing employer and the employee.\u201d <em>(Marsh </em>v. <em>Tilley Steel Co., supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 492, italics added.) However, plaintiffs take this sentence out of context. <em>Marsh </em>itself made clear that relinquishment of \u201call\u201d control is not necessary for creation of a special employment relationship. \u201cFacts demonstrating the existence of a special employment relationship do not necessarily preclude a finding that a particular employee also remained under the <em>partial control </em>of the original employer. Where general and special employers <em>share control </em>of an employee\u2019s work, a \u2018dual employment\u2019 arises, and the general employer remains concurrently and simultaneously, jointly and severally liable for the employee\u2019s torts.\u201d <em>{Marsh, supra, </em>at pp. 494-495, italics added.) The point <em>Marsh </em>was making in the sentence relied upon by plaintiffs was that the general employer is absolved of respondeat superior liability when it relinquishes total control to the special employer but it is jointly and severally liable with the special employer in respondeat superior if it relinquishes only partial control to the special employer. The applicable legal principle is that a general employer\u2019s relinquishment of partial control over its employee to another entity may create a special employment relationship.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u201cThe special employment relationship and its consequent imposition of liability upon the special employer flows from <em>the borrower\u2019s power </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>to supervise the details of the employee\u2019s work. </em>Mere instruction by the borrower on the result to be achieved will not suffice.\u201d <em>(Marsh </em>v. <em>Tilley Steel Co., supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 492, italics added; <em>Kowalski </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at pp. 176-178.) \u201cThe <em>right </em>to control and direct the activities of the alleged employee or the manner and method in which the work is performed, <em>whether exercised or not </em>gives rise to the employment relationship.\u201d <em>(Industrial Ind. Exch. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com., supra, </em>26 Cal.2d at p. 135, italics added; <em>McFarland </em>v. <em>Voorheis-Trindle Co., supra, </em>52 Cal.2d at p. 704.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">In addition to the alleged special employer\u2019s control over the employee, there are a number of other factors relevant to deciding whether a special employment relationship existed. The existence of a special employment relationship may be supported by evidence that (1) the alleged special employer paid wages to the employee, (2) the alleged special employer had the power to discharge the employee, (3) the work performed by the employee was unskilled, (4) the work tools were provided by the alleged special employer, (5) the work was part of the alleged special employer\u2019s regular business, (6) the employee expressly or impliedly consented to a special employment relationship, (7) the parties believed they were creating a special employment relationship, and (8) the alleged special employment period was lengthy. <em>(Marsh </em>v. <em>Tilley Steel Co., supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at pp. 492-493; <em>Kowalski </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at pp. 176-178.) On the other hand, a special employment relationship may be negated by evidence that \u201c[t]he employee is (1) not paid by and cannot be discharged by the borrower, (2) a skilled worker with substantial control over operational details, (3) not engaged in the borrower\u2019s usual business, (4) employed for only a brief period of time, and (5) using tools and equipment furnished by the lending employer.\u201d <em>(Marsh, supra, </em>at p. 492.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u201c[S]pecial employment is most often resolved on the basis of <em>\u2018reasonable inferences </em>to be drawn from the circumstances shown.\u2019 Where the evidence, though not in conflict, permits conflicting inferences, \u2018 . . the existence or nonexistence of the special employment relationship barring the injured employee\u2019s action at law is generally a question reserved for the trier of fact.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Marsh </em>v. <em>Tilley Steel Co., supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 493, first italics added.)  \u201cHowever, if neither the evidence nor inferences are in conflict, then the question of whether an employment relationship exists becomes a question of law which may be resolved by summary judgment. . . .\u201d <em>(Riley </em>v. <em>Southwest Marine, Inc., supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1248, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">b. <em>Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The first question is whether the superior court erred in denying Mountain View\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We conclude that it did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>because there was a triable issue of fact as to whether Mountain View was Brassinga\u2019s special employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The relevant factors other than control were mixed. Some favored the existence of a special employment relationship while others tended to negate the existence of a special employment relationship between Brassinga and Mountain View. It was not disputed that (1) the Regional Team training exercises were part of the regular business of the involved police departments, (2) Palo Alto, not Mountain View, paid Brassinga\u2019s wages on May 15, (3) the role playing services provided by Brassinga were unskilled, and (4) the alleged special employment period was brief. Although the parties argue about whether Mountain View could have complained to Palo Alto about Brassinga\u2019s work and caused him to be disciplined, it is not seriously disputed that Mountain View lacked the power to discharge Brassinga from his position as a Palo Alto reserve police officer. However, Mountain View did have the power to remove Brassinga from his role playing duties for Mountain View. The evidence established that the only tool used by Brassinga, a toy gun, was provided by Palo Alto, not Mountain View. Brassinga clearly consented to serve as a role player under Worley\u2019s supervision, but whether this action constituted consent to a \u201cspecial employment relationship\u201d was the subject of conflicting inferences. There was no evidence that Worley and Brassinga believed they were creating a special employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">On the key question of Mountain View\u2019s right or power to control Brassinga, the evidence was also mixed. Palo Alto had assigned Brassinga to help the Regional Team as a role player during the day\u2019s training exercise. Like Palo Alto, Mountain View also assigned some of its general employees to act as role players during the Regional Team\u2019s training exercise. Hence, Brassinga was one of a group of role players that included both Palo Alto employees and Mountain View employees. The Regional Team split up into two groups for the first portion of the training exercises. Regional Team commanders were in charge of each group. The role players, including Brassinga, initially worked with a group composed entirely of Palo Alto Regional Team members and supervised by a Palo Alto Regional Team commander. Subsequently, the role players agreed to serve in the same capacity for a group of Mountain View and Los Altos Regional Team members. Worley, a Mountain View Regional Team member, supervised the role players when they worked with the Mountain View group. Worley provided five to ten minutes of instructions to the role players at the outset and continued to give them instructions on how to perform their duties as the training progressed. Regional Team members from Palo Alto and Mountain View were also acting as role players at times for the Mountain View/Los Altos group.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>The conflicting inferences that arose from these facts precluded summary judgment. A jury could have concluded that Worley did not have sufficient control over the details of Brassinga\u2019s discharge of his role playing duties to justify the creation of a special employment relationship between Brassinga and Mountain View. Similarly, the circumstances other than control were decidedly mixed. Although Brassinga was performing unskilled work that was part of Mountain View\u2019s regular business, Palo Alto was paying his wages and the period of the alleged special employment was very brief. Brassinga agreed to serve as a role player under Worley\u2019s supervision, but the only tool, a toy gun, was provided by Brassinga\u2019s general employer, Palo Alto. Mountain View had no power to discharge Brassinga from his Palo Alto reserve police officer position although it could discharge him as a role player for Mountain View. Because the evidence on the control issue was not definitive and could have supported conflicting inferences and the other factors also supported conflicting inferences, Mountain View had not established its defense on its motion for summary judgment, and the superior court did not err in denying its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">c. <em>Directed Verdict</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The next question is whether the disputed factual issues remained based on the trial evidence such that the trial court erred in granting plaintiffs a directed verdict on liability based on respondeat superior. We conclude that the question of whether Mountain View was Brassinga\u2019s special employer was not established as a matter of law based on the trial evidence, and the trial court therefore erred in granting a directed verdict on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">As with the affidavits on the summary judgment motion, there was no dispute that (1) the Regional Team training exercises were part of the regular business of the involved police departments, (2) Palo Alto, not Mountain View, paid Brassinga\u2019s wages on May 15, (3) the role playing services provided by Brassinga were unskilled, and (4) the alleged special employment period was very brief. While Mountain View lacked the power to discharge Brassinga from his position as a Palo Alto reserve police officer, it did have the power to remove Brassinga from his role playing duties. The only tool used by Brassinga was provided by Palo Alto. Brassinga consented to serve as a role player under Worley\u2019s supervision, but whether this action constituted consent to a \u201cspecial employment relationship\u201d was the subject of conflicting inferences. There was no evidence that anyone believed a special employment relationship was being created. In sum, the factors other than control continued to be mixed based on the trial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Conflicting inferences could also have been drawn from the trial evidence regarding Mountain View\u2019s right or power to control Brassinga. Palo Alto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>had assigned Brassinga to help the Regional Team as a role player during the day\u2019s training exercise. Like Palo Alto, Mountain View also assigned some of its general employees to act as role players during the Regional Team\u2019s training exercise. Consequently, there was a group of role players made up of Palo Alto employees and Mountain View employees. This group of role players first worked with a group composed entirely of Palo Alto Regional Team members and supervised by a Palo Alto Regional Team commander. Throughout his role playing duties, Brassinga was given instructions on how he should act.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">After working with the Palo Alto group, the role players agreed to serve in the same capacity for a group of Mountain View and Los Altos Regional Team members. Regional Team members from Palo Alto and Mountain View joined the role players at times while they were working with the Mountain View/Los Altos group. The role players provided the same services to the Mountain View/Los Altos group that they had provided to the Palo Alto group. While working with the Mountain View/Los Altos group, the role players were \u201csubject to the command\u201d of and supervised by Worley. Worley gave them instructions on how to fulfill their role playing duties. He explained each scenario to the role players and told them how much of a challenge to provide and what type of behavior to engage in, but he allowed the role players to decide among themselves who would play which role and where to conceal themselves. Worley debriefed the role players after each scenario and gave them additional instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The same conflicting inferences which precluded summary judgment precluded a directed verdict. The evidence presented at trial detailed above could have supported a jury finding that Worley\u2019s control over Brassinga\u2019s discharge of his role playing duties was indicative of the existence of a special employment relationship between Brassinga and Mountain View. The factors other than control could have supported either a finding of a special employment relationship or a finding that there was no special employment relationship. Brassinga\u2019s duties were unskilled and part of the regular business of Mountain View, but his wages were not paid by Mountain View and the period of the alleged special employment was brief. Brassinga consented to act as a role player for Mountain View, but the toy gun was provided by Palo Alto. Mountain View could discharge Brassinga from his role playing duties but not from his Palo Alto reserve police officer position. On this record, the trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of plaintiffs on liability in respondeat superior. Consequently, we must reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">D. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Cross-appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Plaintiffs appeal from the superior court\u2019s order granting Acton\u2019s motion for summary adjudication and dismissing him from this action. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>order was expressly based on the superior court\u2019s finding that the undisputed evidence established as a matter of law that the Regional Team was the employer of both Acton and plaintiff. As we have already discussed, the evidence presented below established that the Regional Team did <em>not </em>qualify as an \u201cemployer\u201d under Labor Code section 3300. Acton\u2019s motion was based solely on the argument that he and Brassinga were co-employees of the Regional Team or of Mountain View. The undisputed facts do not support this argument. The Regional Team was not shown to be an entity that could qualify as an employer, and the evidence presented in support of Acton\u2019s motion did not establish as a matter of law that Mountain View was Brassinga\u2019s special employer.

Code, \u00a7 8616.) \u201cIn periods other than a state of war emergency, a state of emergency, or a local emergency, state agencies and political subdivisions have authority to exercise mutual aid powers in accordance with the Master Mutual Aid Agreement and local ordinances, resolutions, agreements, or plans therefor.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 8617.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\">\u201cThe agency or entity provided by the agreement to administer or execute the agreement may be one or more of the parties to the agreement or a commission or board constituted pursuant to the agreement or a person, firm or corporation, including a nonprofit corporation, designated in the agreement. One or more of the parties may agree to provide all or a portion of the services to the other parties in the manner provided in the agreement. The parties may provide for the mutual exchange of services without payment of any consideration other than such services.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6506.) \u201cFor the purposes of this article, the agency is a public entity separate from the parties to the agreement.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6507.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\"><em>Berger </em>simply does not address the dispositive issue before us. The plaintiff in <em>Berger </em>worked for one city\u2019s police department. The defendants worked for police departments in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>other cities. <em>(Berger </em>v. <em>Mead, supra, </em>338 N.W.2d at p. 922, fn. 3.) All of the officers were members of the \u201cSouth Oakland Tactical Support Unit.\u201d The plaintiff was shot during a training exercise held by the unit. <em>(Berger, supra, </em>at p. 922.) He brought a civil action against the defendants. Defendants sought summary judgment based on workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity. They claimed that the unit was a \u201cjoint venture\u201d of the various cities and the plaintiff and the defendants were coemployees of the unit. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayq\">The court of appeal, after noting that it was a question of law whether the unit was a \u201cnoncommercial joint venture\u201d or \u201cjoint enterprise,\u201d determined that the unit was a joint enterprise of the cities. <em>(Berger </em>v. <em>Mead, supra, </em>338 N.W.2d at pp. 922, 923.) It proceeded directly to the question of whether the undisputed facts established that the unit was the special employer of the plaintiff and the defendants. Concluding that this issue had been established as a matter of law on the undisputed facts, the court affirmed the summary judgment. <em>(Berger, supra, </em>at pp. 923-924.) There was no issue before the court in <em>Berger </em>analogous to the question before us of whether the Regional Team can qualify as an \u201cemployer\u201d under California\u2019s statutory definition of that term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The Government Code states that \u201c \u2018public agency\u2019 includes, but is not limited to, the federal government or any federal department or agency, this state, another state or any state department or agency, a county, county board of education, county superintendent of schools, city, public corporation, public district, or regional transportation commission of this state or another state.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6500.) This nonexclusive definition of public agency for Government Code purposes tells us very little about the meaning of \u201cpublic agencies\u201d in Labor Code section 3300.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Plaintiffs also argue that Labor Code section 3362.5 establishes that Brassinga was solely Palo Alto\u2019s employee. That statute provides that a person who is appointed to act as a reserve city police officer and \u201cassigned specific police functions\u201d by a city is an employee of the city \u201cwhile performing duties as a peace officer.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3362.5.) This statute tells us only that Brassinga was Palo Alto\u2019s employee if his duties could be characterized as those of a peace officer on May 15. There was never any dispute as to whether Brassinga was a Palo Alto employee. However, the statute is silent as to whether such an officer might also be a special employee of some other entity. As the statute is nonexclusive, it does not, in and of itself, preclude a conclusion that a reserve officer was, at some point, a special employee of an entity other than the one which appointed him or her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\">This principle was settled long before Marsh, and <em>Marsh </em>did not purport to overrule any of the prior California Supreme Court cases on this issue. \u201c[I]t is settled that \u2018a general and special employment relationship is present if there exists <em>in each </em>some power, not necessarily complete, of direction and control.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Industrial Ind. Exch. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1945) 26 Cal.2d 130, 135 [156 P.2d 926], italics added; <em>McFarland </em>v. <em>Voorheis-Trindle Co. </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 698, 704 [343 P.2d 923].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
