The trial court granted Charter Oak\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">Factual and Procedural Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">The Mountain Meadows Patio/Terrace project is a 172-unit townhome development in Pomona, California. According to respondent, WSLA purchased the project in 1984, and the homes were built between 1985 and 1990. The underlying action was brought by Mountain Meadows Patio/ Terrace Maintenance Association against several defendants, including Western Property Service Corporation and WSLA doing business as WSLA Development Corporation of California. The complaint alleged five causes of action arising from construction defects in the townhomes: negligence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>breach of implied and express warranties, negligent misrepresentation, strict product liability, and negligence per se. Four insurance companies, including appellant, defended the action. These insurers paid all attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses arising from the defense of WSLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">F&amp;D issued policy No. SM 69 08 291 effective March 21, 1985, to April 1, 1988, to numerous insureds, including WSLA, Western Properties Service Corporation, and WSLA doing business as WSLA Development Corporation. This policy provided insureds with property and liability coverage for their premises and operations. The F&amp;D policy contained an \u201cExclusion or Excess Coverage\u201d endorsement which excluded coverage for risks insured under several other policies, including those issued by Charter Oak. The policy issued by appellant had annual premiums of $158,571, $461,276, and $585,220, respectively, for each of the first three years of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Respondent Charter Oak (erroneously named and sued herein as the Travelers Aetna Insurance Company) issued policy No. 650-503G264-3-COF-86 effective March 21, 1986, to March 21, 1987, to \u201cWestern Savings &amp; Loan Assoc DBA Marina Inn.\u201d The Marina Inn is located in Russellville, Arkansas and was acquired by WSLA through foreclosure. A renewal policy (policy No. 650-503G264-3-COF-87) was effective March 21, 1987, to March 21, 1988. Both policies were issued in Little Rock, Arkansas and provided first party property coverage and third party general liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">The general declarations pages of the Charter Oak policies specify that the business of the named insured is \u201cMotel &amp; Restaurant.\u201d \u201cMotel\u201d is typed in above the space designated for the name and address of the insured. The applicable buildings are listed as (1) \u201cMotel\u201d and (2) \u201cOffice, Restaurant\u201d located at \u201c1-40 &amp; Hwy 7, Russellville AR.\u201d The mailing address for the named insured is 2901 West Airport, Russellville, Pope County, Arkansas 72701. A typed-in designation specifies that the insured is a \u201cMotel,\u201d not an individual, partnership, or corporation. The premiums associated with the risk of property damage claims arising from \u201cpremises and operations\u201d are $118 and $115, respectively, for the 1986-1987 and 1987-1988 policies. The premiums associated with the risk of property damage claims on \u201cproducts/completed operations\u201d are $175 and $151 for the two annual policy periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">Change endorsements to the 1986-1987 Charter Oak policy list the \u201cNamed Insured\u201d as \u201cWestbrooks Inns Management Inc.,\u201d \u201cWestbrooke Inns Management Inc DBA Marina Inn,\u201d and \u201cMarina Inn.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>Under both Charter Oak policies, \u201cZenith Management\u201d is an additional insured with respect to liability arising while acting as a real estate manager for the named insured. \u201cH&amp;S Company\u201d is also designated as an additional insured with respect to the ownership, maintenance or use of land at \u201cI-40 &amp; Hwy 7 Russellville, AR\u201d under the two policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The Charter Oak policies contain a hotels and motels (operator\u2019s risk) endorsement detailing coverage in relation to saddle animals or watercraft, products hazards, and malpractice and professional services. The declarations schedule which \u201cdiscloses all hazards insured hereunder known to exist at the effective date of this policy\u201d lists the premises and operations as \u201cHotels\u2014Not Apartment Hotels AVith Swimming Pools or Bathing Beaches,\u201d \u201cRestaurants/With Sale of Alcoholic Beverages That Are Less Than 75% of the Total Annual Receipts of the Restaurant\u2014Without Dance Floor,\u201d and \u201cBuilding or Premises\u2014Bank, Mercantile, Manufacturing or Office\u2014Not Occupied by the Insured (Lessor\u2019s Risk Only).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Tender of the defense of WSLA in the underlying action was made to Charter Oak by Kenneth P. Scholtz, counsel for Resolution Trust Corporation as receiver of WSLA and two of its subsidiaries, WSLA Development Corporation of California and Western Property Service Corporation. According to respondent, Charter Oak issued a preliminary denial on the ground that the policyholder for the subject policy was Marina Inn, not WSLA or any of its subsidiaries. Charter Oak requested additional information from Mr. Scholtz for respondent to properly evaluate the claim. A follow-up letter, repeating the request, was sent by Charter Oak. Respondent submitted a letter from Mr. Scholtz, stating: \u201cI have been advised by my client\u2019s insurance administrator that the Marina Inn was a piece of property that was acquired by Western Savings through foreclosure and was thereafter insured under the referenced policy. Therefore, it does appear that the [Charter Oak] policy does not apply to the Mountain Meadows claim.\u201d Charter Oak requested confirmation of its understanding that counsel was withdrawing the tender of defense. Mr. Scholtz did not reply. Charter Oak then formally declined the defense and indemnity of WSLA, WSLA Development Corporation, and Western Property Service Corporation because there was no evidence of property damage occurring during the policy period, and none of the defendants in the underlying action were covered under the policy issued to Marina Inn in Russellville, Arkansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Appellant filed an action against three insurance companies, including respondent, seeking declaratory relief, contribution, and indemnity. Charter Oak moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>The trial court granted Charter Oak\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the \u201cfour comers\u201d of the Charter Oak policies limited coverage to the Marina Inn motel and restaurant in Russellville, Arkansas. \u201c[T]he caption in the underlying complaint. . . contains the names of three WSLA entities which are named insureds in P\u2019s policies . . . WSLA, WSLA Develp. Corp., and Western Property Service Corp., and does not contain the only insured in the [Charter Oak] policies, [WSLA doing business as Marina Inn].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court ruled that even if WSLA doing business as Marina Inn were not a separate entity, as appellant argues it is, the policies indicated that the insurance only covered WSLA\u2019s property in Arkansas. F&amp;D filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c) allows the trial court to grant summary judgment if no triable issue exists as to a material fact, and if the papers entitle the moving party to a judgment as a matter of law. The judgment is appealable under subdivision (1) of that section. We apply the standard rules in reviewing a grant of summary judgment. \u201c \u2018The motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. . . . [\u00b6] A defendant meets his or her burden on a motion for summary judgment if that party has proved there is a complete defense to the cause of action. (\u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2).) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists. [Citations.] [\u00b6] On appeal, we independently assess the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling, applying the same legal standard as the trial court. [Citations.] \u2018\u201c[W]e construe the moving party\u2019s affidavits strictly, construe the opponent\u2019s affidavits liberally, and resolve doubts about the propriety of granting the motion in favor of the party opposing it.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Van Dyke </em>v. <em>Dunker &amp; Aced </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 446, 450-451 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 862].)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">The essence of appellant\u2019s argument is that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the scope of the third party general liability coverage provided by the Charter Oak policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>An insurance company can choose which risks it will insure and which it will not, and coverage limitations set forth in a policy will be respected. <em>(Legarra </em>v. <em>Federated Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1472, 1480 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 101].) The information in the declarations will control the coverage provided, and the named insured is generally identified in the declarations. If the declarations indicate that the policy does not provide coverage for the defendant in the underlying litigation, no further review of the policy is necessary. (1 Cal. Liability Insurance Practice: Claims and Litigation (Cont.Ed.Bar 1997) \u00a7\u00a7 3.10-3.14, pp. 3-15 to 3-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Charter Oak presents convincing evidence that coverage under its policies was limited to the risks involved in operation of the Marina Inn. The general declarations pages identify the business of the insured as a motel and restaurant. The applicable buildings are a motel, an office, and a restaurant located at 1-40 and highway 7 in Russellville, Arkansas. The policies specifically identify the status of the named insured as a \u201cMotel,\u201d not an individual, partnership, or corporation. (See <em>Milazo </em>v. <em>Gulf Ins. Co. </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 1528, 1536 [274 Cal.Rptr. 632] [where policy states that the named insured is a partnership, partner was not insured in his individual capacity even though both the partnership and its partners were listed as named insureds].) Change endorsements identify a hotel management company as well as the Marina Inn itself as insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Moreover, Charter Oak received modest premiums under these policies. The premiums associated with the risk of property damage liability claims totaled $293 for 1986-1987 and $266 for 1987-1988. The insured\u2019s payment of a relatively small premium suggests that Charter Oak provided coverage for the relatively small risks associated with the Marina Inn, not the much larger risks associated with all of WSLA\u2019s projects. (See <em>International Surplus Lines Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Devonshire Coverage Corp. </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 601, 612 [155 Cal.Rptr. 870] [if insured paid relatively small premium, it is not reasonable to expect that insurer intended to create entirely new areas of risk]; <em>Herzog </em>v. <em>National American Ins. Co. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 192, 197 [84 Cal.Rptr. 705, 465 P.2d 841] [insurance premiums are commensurate with level of risk covered].) We conclude that, as a matter of law, the policies issued by respondent covered the Marina Inn alone. (See <em>Pieper </em>v. <em>Commercial Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1016 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 551] [interpretation of an insurance policy is generally a question of law]; <em>Regan Roofing Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 425, 435 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 413] [\u201cIn the context of insurance contract law, it is well established that a duty to defend is contractual in nature [citation] and determination of such a duty is a matter of law appropriate for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>adjudication. [Citations.]\u201d].) Charter Oak did not breach its insurance contracts in declining the defense and indemnity of defendants in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in determining that the designation of a \u201cdba\u201d (doing business as) on the declarations pages of the Charter Oak policies limited coverage to the Marina Inn. F&amp;D contends that there is no legal distinction between the \u201cdba\u201d and the holder of the name, and that use of a fictitious business name through a \u201cdba\u201d does not create a separate legal entity. But respondent does not rely on the \u201cdba\u201d designation alone in maintaining that Charter Oak did not have a duty to defend Western Property Service Corporation or WSLA Development Corporation of California in the <em>Mountain Meadows </em>action. Even if the Marina Inn is not a separate entity from WSLA, the Charter Oak policies, when read as a whole, clearly limit coverage to a motel and restaurant in Russellville, Arkansas. The Mountain Meadows Patio/Terrace project in Pomona is not covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">F&amp;D argues that because \u201cpolicy territory\u201d is defined broadly in respondent\u2019s insurance policies, general liability coverage is not limited to a specific premises. The liability provisions state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">\u201c \u2018Policy territory\u2019 means (1) the United States of America, its territories or possessions, or Canada, or (2) international waters or air space, provided the bodily injury or property damage does not occur in the course of travel or transportation to or from any other country, state, or nation, or (3) anywhere in the world with respect to damages because of bodily injury or property damage arising out of a product which was sold for use or consumption within the territory described in paragraph (1) above . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">Appellant\u2019s contention lacks merit. Where a contract is partly written or printed under the special direction of the parties, and the remainder is copied from a form prepared without reference to the particular contract in question, the parts which are original control those which are not. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1651.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The declarations pages tailored for these particular policies limit the site of coverage to the Marina Inn. When information in the declarations conflicts with general information in the preprinted forms, the former prevails over the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">F&amp;D argues that the Charter Oak policies are ambiguous, and any ambiguity in the policies is resolved against the insurer. Appellant fails to recognize that other rules of contractual interpretation also apply. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>Courts implement the ordinary rules of contract interpretation when construing insurance contracts. <em>(Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545].) A contract must be interpreted to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties at the time of contracting. (\u00a7 1636.) The intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the language of the contract, to the extent that the language is clear and explicit. (\u00a7 1638.) If the contract is ambiguous, \u201c. . . it must be interpreted in the sense in which the promisor believed, at the time of making it, that the promisee understood it.\u201d (\u00a7 1649.) The contract is interpreted against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist only if application of these rules does not resolve the ambiguity. (\u00a7 1654.) Courts generally resolve ambiguities in the insurance context in favor of coverage. <em>(AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 822 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253].)  The language of the Charter Oak policies plainly limits coverage to a motel and restaurant in Russellville, Arkansas. Since the policies are not ambiguous, we interpret them to give effect to the parties\u2019 mutual intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The judgment is affirmed. Charter Oak is awarded its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Vogel (C. S.), P. J., and Cooper, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 18, 1998.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-9\">The caption in the <em>Mountain Meadows </em>complaint names the following WSLA entities as defendants: \u201cWestern Savings and Loan Association, an Arizona corporation dba in California as Wsla Development Corporation of California\u201d and \u201cWestern Property Service Corporation, an Arizona corporation doing business in California as WSLA.\u201d The second defendant is referenced in paragraph 10 of the complaint as \u201cWestern Property Services Corporation, an Arizona corporation, doing business in California as WSLA Development Corporation of California.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b799-11\"> All further statutory references are to this code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
