MTA demurred on the grounds that (1) \u201c. . . Petitioner has a plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law by filing its claim against Respondent in the manner prescribed by law\u201d and (2) \u201cPetitioner is seeking to circumvent the discovery process, which is applicable to her and available when Petitioner files her claim, by seeking discovery of information that Respondent asserts as privileged and was prepared in anticipation of litigation or the filing of a claim by Petitioner.\u201d MTA also filed an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The matter was dismissed by the trial court. The order dismissing the petition stated: \u201cThere is an adequate remedy at law, . . . e.g. formal discovery in the anticipated civil . . . lawsuit to be filed by petitioner against respondent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Section 6250 expresses the legislative policy behind the CPRA: \u201c[A]ccess to information concerning the conduct of the people\u2019s business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.\u201d The term \u201cPublic records\u201d was defined broadly by the statute to include \u201cany writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public\u2019s business prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or characteristics.\u201d (\u00a7 6252, subd. (d).) Under section 6253, subdivision (a), \u201cPublic records\u201d are to be \u201copen to inspection at all times during the office hours of the state or local agency and every person has a right to inspect any public record, except as hereafter provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Section 6258 provides: \u201cAny person may institute proceedings for injunctive or declarative relief or writ of mandate in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce his or her right to inspect or to receive a copy of any public record or class of public records under this chapter. The times for responsive pleadings and for hearings in these proceedings shall be set by the judge of the court with the object of securing a decision as to these matters at the earliest possible time.\u201d Under section 6259, subdivision (a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u201cWhenever it is made to appear by verified petition to the superior court of the county where the records or some part thereof are situated that certain public records are being improperly withheld from a member of the public, the court shall order the officer or person charged with withholding the records to disclose the public record or show cause why he or she should not do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Review of grant or denial of a section 6258 proceeding is also by way of writ: \u201cIn an action filed on or after January 1, 1991, an order of the court, either directing disclosure by a public official or supporting the decision of the public official refusing disclosure, is not a final judgment or order within the meaning of Section 904.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure from which an appeal may be taken, but shall be immediately reviewable by petition to the appellate court for the issuance of an extraordinary writ.\u201d (\u00a7 6259, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The trial court concluded that this statutory procedure was subject to the rule applicable to ordinary mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085); that mandate is not available where there is a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086.) This rule has been applied to administrative mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5) as well. (See, e.g., <em>Nast </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 343, 347 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 592]; <em>Mystery Mesa Mission Christian Church, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessment Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 37, 39 [133 Cal.Rptr. 565].) Because petitioner could theoretically obtain the same or similar documents from MTA by pursuing a legal claim, the court refused to enforce her rights under the CPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">We believe the trial court\u2019s analysis is incorrect. The statutory provision for enforcing the CPRA is not the equivalent of ordinary mandamus. Under the CPRA, the Legislature created an avenue whereby \u201cevery person in this state\u201d may obtain ready access to \u201cpublic records.\u201d Where documents are withheld \u201c[a]ny person may institute proceedings for injunctive <em>or </em>declarative relief <em>or </em>writ of mandate . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 6258, italics added.) The express \u201cobject\u201d of the enforcement provision is to ensure that review of an agency decision to withhold documents from a \u201cmember of the public\u201d be secured \u201cat the earliest possible time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Petitioner did not cease to be a \u201cmember of the public\u201d when she was struck by the Blue Line. The statute, which we are bound to interpret in accordance with its plain language unless doing so would lead to absurd results, requires that public records be made available to \u201cevery person in this state,\u201d without exception. It further allows \u201cany person\u201d aggrieved to obtain relief either through legal proceedings (for \u201cinjunctive or declarative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>relief\u2019) or through \u201cwrit of mandate.\u201d There is no exception for persons who may potentially have a claim for damages against a governmental agency. The Legislature made both legal proceedings and mandamus available to all aggrieved members of the public \u201cwith the object of securing a decision as to these matters at the earliest possible time.\u201d (\u00a7 6258.) It is not the prerogative of the courts to insist that petitioner employ one type of remedy over another where the Legislature has expressly made both equally available.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">This leads to our second difficulty with the court\u2019s ruling. Assuming that section 6258 mandamus is not available where an alternative legal remedy exists which is plain, speedy, and adequate, the remedy identified by MTA is none of those things. Putting aside for the moment the time, effort, and financial resources required to institute a lawsuit against a governmental entity and to promulgate discovery requests, discovery is limited to matters \u201crelevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action\u201d which are themselves \u201cadmissible in evidence\u201d or \u201cappear[] reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2017, subd. (a).) A CPRA request can cover anything the person making the request suspects the agency might have in its files. As a member of the public, petitioner is entitled to the broader categories of documents available under the CPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Moreover, at the time of petitioner\u2019s requests, it could not be conclusively presumed that she would file a government claim or institute a lawsuit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It may well have been the case that the documents were requested to ascertain whether grounds for such a claim or lawsuit existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">This conclusion is supported by the Supreme Court decisions discussing the legislative purpose and constitutionality of section 6259, subdivision (c), which gives litigants the right to immediate review of trial court orders by way of writ proceedings. In <em>Powers </em>v. <em>City of Richmond </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 85 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 839, 893 P.2d 1160], the court explained: \u201c[T]he statutory provision at issue in the present case\u2014Government Code section 6259, subdivision (c) (hereafter section 6259(c))\u2014was enacted in 1984 in response to problems encountered in direct appeals in cases arising under the Public Records Act. The principal proponent of the legislation, the California Newspaper Publishers\u2019 Association\u2014which represented numerous news organizations that frequently relied upon the Public Records Act to obtain information concerning the actions of governmental entities and public officials\u2014maintained that, in practice, the ordinary process of direct appeal was operating in cases under the Public Records Act to frustrate the significant public purposes underlying the act. In this regard, the association <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>pointed out that, even when a newspaper or other plaintiff that had brought an action under the Public Records Act prevailed at the trial court level and obtained a judgment compelling disclosure of particular records, a defendant public agency or public official routinely could delay disclosure of the records in question for a considerable period of time (often years) simply by filing an appeal of the adverse judgment, thereby preventing disclosure of public information at a time when the material still was newsworthy or of particular importance to the plaintiff. fl[] Persuaded that the <em>timeliness </em>of disclosure often is of crucial importance in actions brought under the Public Records Act, the Legislature responded by enacting section 6259(c).  As amended in 1990, that statute provides that a trial court order made under the Public Records Act\u2014either directing disclosure of a public record or supporting the decision of a public official refusing disclosure\u2014is not subject to ordinary direct appeal but instead is \u2018immediately reviewable\u2019 by petition for an extraordinary writ to the Court of Appeal. [^] As this legislative background demonstrates, it is clear that section 6259(c) was enacted not to diminish the rights of individuals, such as plaintiffs in this case, who seek disclosure of governmental information under the Public Records Act, but, on the contrary, for the general purpose of enhancing such persons\u2019 rights by ensuring that appellate review of trial court decisions under the act is conducted in a manner that promotes, rather than frustrates, the purpose of the act.\u201d <em>(Powers </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 117-118, citing <em>Times Mirror Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325, 1332-1335 [283 Cal.Rptr. 893, 813 P.2d 240], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The legislative purpose of expediency and immediate reviewability, recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Powers, </em>cannot be served by transforming a public record request into a drawn out discovery battle.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">We are mindful of the trial court\u2019s belief that petitioner and her counsel are attempting to circumvent ordinary litigation protections and procedures, and its concern that if potential claimants are allowed to pursue documents under the CPRA, they will possess an unfair advantage over public agencies attempting to defend themselves. The CPRA contains numerous exemptions which would discourage improper CPRA requests of the type suspected here. (See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 6254, subds. (b), (c), &amp; (k), 6255.) The trial court\u2019s role is to review the agency\u2019s objections to the CPRA requests in light of the relevant exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">An appellate court\u2019s role in the CPRA process is to \u201cconduct an independent review of the trial court\u2019s ruling; factual findings made by the trial court will be upheld if based on substantial evidence. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Times Mirror Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1336.) Here, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>court dismissed the matter and no factual findings were made concerning the documents, such as whether they are work product or covered by privilege or protected by the employee\u2019s right to privacy. We must therefore remand with instructions to conduct further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The alternative writ, having served its purpose, is discharged. Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue compelling respondent court to set aside its order of May 5, 1998, which dismissed the petition on the ground that there is an adequate remedy at law available to petitioner, and to reconsider the petition in conformity with the views expressed herein. Petitioner\u2019s request for attorney fees is denied. Each party is to bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Vogel (C. S.), P.
