J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">Statement of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">On February 4, 1997, a complaint charging three felony counts against appellant Peter Lopez (hereafter Lopez) was filed in Tulare County Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Court. In count 1, Lopez was charged with grand theft of a vehicle, a violation of Penal Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 487, subdivision (d); in count 2, he was charged with unlawful driving or taking a vehicle, a violation of Vehicle Code section 10851; and, in count 3, he was charged with receipt of stolen property, a violation of section 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">On February 19, 1997, pursuant to a negotiated disposition, Lopez pled guilty to count 2. Under the terms of the plea agreement, Lopez would receive an indicated sentence of not more than 270 days in custody, a restitution fine, and felony probation, and the other 2 charges would be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">On March 18, 1997, Lopez was sentenced to three years\u2019 felony probation, with a term of two hundred seventy days to be served in the Tulare County jail, a $200 restitution fine, and a penalty assessment of $340. Various conditions of probation were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">At approximately 2 a.m. on February 1, 1997, an officer with the Lindsey Police Department saw a vehicle stopped in the middle of the roadway, with its driver\u2019s side door open and its brake lights illuminated. A codefendant, Miguel Perez, was standing at the rear of the vehicle; Lopez was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. As the officer approached, Lopez and Perez began running away. The officer gave chase on foot, identified himself, and ordered Lopez and Perez to stop. They ignored the command and continued to flee. The two were eventually apprehended and taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\n<em>Introduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">During the change of plea hearing on February 19, 1997, in addition to other advisements, the court told Lopez that if he pled guilty to the count 2 offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-12\">\u201cThen you will be placed on felony probation and receive not more than 270 days in custody initially. You will be required to pay any actual restitution owing to the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-13\">\u201cYou are subject to a fine of up to $10,000 plus penalty assessments. A restitution fine of up to $10,000. <em>Other standard terms of probation will be </em>imposed(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>The court did not advise Lopez of his rights under section 1192.5 at any time before he entered his plea.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The probation report, prepared and filed on March 14, 1997, noted that: \u201cA review of the Tulare County Sheriff\u2019s Department classification record, reveals that the defendant is a self admitted gang member and claims \u2018Norteno\u2019. He has a tattoo of \u2018XIV\u2019 on his left thumb and \u2018XIV\u2019 on his stomach. He has a drug abuse history of using methamphetamine, cocaine, and PCP.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The probation report then recommended the imposition of 17 separate conditions of probation, including the following, which was No. 15: \u201cThe defendant is not to be involved in any gang activities or associate with any gang members, nor wear or possess, any item of identified gang clothing, including: any item of clothing with gang insignia, moniker, color pattern, bandanas, jewelry with any gang significance, nor shall the defendant display any gang insignia, moniker, or other markings of gang significance on his/her person or property as may be identified by Law Enforcement or the Probation Officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">At the sentencing hearing on March 18, 1997, the court announced its tentative decision to follow the recommendations of the probation department, except that Lopez\u2019s in custody time would be reduced from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>recommended 370 days to the indicated 270 days.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the court asked for comments from counsel, Lopez\u2019s attorney asked the court to strike the \u201ccollateral information\u201d about Lopez\u2019s gang membership. Counsel asserted there was no evidence the present charges were gang related, the police report did not say Lopez was wearing gang clothing when apprehended, the information was irrelevant, and the classification records could be erroneous. The court denied Lopez\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">After the court read condition No. 15, Lopez\u2019s counsel inquired about why this term of probation was being imposed. The trial court responded that Lopez was an admitted gang member and had engaged in criminal activities during the early morning hours with a codefendant, and these facts generated a rational inference that the current crime could have been related to gang activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Defense counsel responded that condition No. 15 infringed on Lopez\u2019s constitutional rights to freedom of association and freedom of speech and thus could not be lawfully imposed because there was no evidence the current crime was gang related. The trial court overruled the objection, completed the pronouncement of sentence, and notified Lopez of his appeal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Lopez now contends the condition of probation proscribing gang association and indicia must be stricken or narrowed because it: 1) is not reasonably related to the instant crime or to future criminality; 2) violates his constitutional rights of freedom of association, speech and due process; and 3) violates the terms of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\n<em>Relationship to Instant Crime or Future Criminality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Lopez first argues the trial court erred in imposing condition No. 15 because his relationship to a gang or gangs was not reasonably related to his present crime or to his future criminality. The People acknowledge there is nothing in the record which suggests the offense to which Lopez pled guilty was the product of gang activity. Nonetheless, the People maintain the information in the probation report about Lopez\u2019s gang connections justified the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Trial courts have broad discretion to set conditions of probation in order to \u201cfoster rehabilitation and to protect public safety pursuant to Penal Code section 1203.1.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carbajal </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1114, 1120 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 681, 899 P.2d 67]; see \u00a7 1203.1, subd. (j); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 410.) If it serves these dual purposes, a probation condition may impinge upon a constitutional right otherwise enjoyed by the probationer, who is \u201cnot entitled to the same degree of constitutional protection as other citizens.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Peck </em>(1996) 52 Cal.App.4th 351, 362 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">However, the trial court\u2019s discretion in setting the conditions of probation is not unbounded. A term of probation is invalid if it: \u201c \u2018(1) has no relationship to the crime of which the offender was convicted, (2) relates to conduct which is not in itself criminal, and (3) requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related to future criminality.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lent </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 481, 486 [124 Cal.Rptr. 905, 541 P.2d 545],)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Conversely, \u201c. . . a condition of probation which requires or forbids conduct which is not itself criminal is valid if that conduct is reasonably related to the crime of which the defendant was convicted or to future criminality.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Condition No. 15 was not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in this case. Prohibitions against a variety of gang-related activities have been upheld when imposed upon juvenile offenders. <em>(In re Laylah K. </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1496, 1500-1502 [281 Cal.Rptr. 6]; see also <em>In re Michael D. </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1610, 1617 [264 Cal.Rptr. 476]; <em>In re Josh W. </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1, 6 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 701].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because \u201c[association with gang members is the first step to involvement in gang activity,\u201d such conditions have been found to be \u201creasonably designed to prevent future criminal behavior.\u201d <em>(In re Laylah K., supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1501, 1503.) Whether the minor was currently connected with a gang has not been critical. Thus, probation terms have been approved which bar minors from being present at gang gathering areas, associating with gang members, and wearing gang clothing. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1502.)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>We believe probationary proscriptions against gang-related conduct are equally proper when imposed upon adult offenders such as Lopez. The path from gang associations to criminal gang activity is open to adults as well as to minors. Though the courts have sometimes sustained probation conditions imposed upon a juvenile offender that would be \u201cunconstitutional or otherwise improper\u201d if imposed upon an adult offender, the basis for this distinction has been that a juvenile probationary order is a part of a final order, which the minor may not reject, aimed at ensuring the minor\u2019s reformation and rehabilitation, while an adult probationary order, which the defendant may reject, is an act of leniency in lieu of the prescribed statutory punishment. (<em>In re Tyrell J. </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 68, 80-82 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 33, 876 P.2d 519].) This difference is not of material effect here. The rehabilitative point of condition No. 15 is the same with respect to an adult such as Lopez as it is with respect to a minor such as the juvenile in <em>Laylah.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The federal courts, acting under the authority of federal statutes (including 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3563(b)(6)) have found curtailments of an adult probationer\u2019s associations with specified groups to be proper where such restrictions serve a rehabilitative purpose, even where the crime in issue was not shown to have been group related.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Showalter </em>(7th Cir. 1991) 933 F.2d 573, 575; <em>Malone </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1974) 502 F.2d 554, 555-556; <em>Porth </em>v. <em>Templar </em>(10th Cir. 1971) 453 F.2d 330, 334.) In <em>Malone </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>502 F.2d at page 555, the defendant was convicted of the unlawful export of firearms. He was emotionally involved in the activities of the Irish Republican movement. A probation condition prevented him from participating in any American Irish Republican movement, from belonging to any Irish organization, from participating in any Irish Catholic organization, from visiting any Irish pubs, and from accepting employment that would directly or indirectly associate him with any Irish organization. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Ninth Circuit concluded that this broad range of proscriptions was \u201creasonably related to the goals of probation and the accomplishment of public order and safety and . . . [did] not constitute an abuse of the [trial court\u2019s] discretion in the circumstances.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 557.) In <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Showalter, supra, </em>933 F.2d at page 575, the circuit court approved of a condition that prohibited the defendant from associating with \u201cskinheads and neo-Nazis.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 574.) The basis for the holding was the trial court\u2019s determination that because \u201c[these] groups embrace violence and the threat of violence as a method of advancing their views, . . . [defendant\u2019s] association with them would create a high likelihood that [he] would be drawn into that same behavior.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(5th Cir. 1969) 414 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>630, 636 [trial court has discretion to restrict the probationer\u2019s association with \u201cgroups that would palpably encourage him to repeat his criminal conduct\u201d]; <em>Porth </em>v. <em>Templar, supra, </em>453 F.2d at p. 334.) In <em>Showalter, </em>the crime of which the defendant was convicted was not connected to any activity by the groups described in. the probation condition; the defendant had brandished a weapon when being evicted from his apartment for nonpayment of rent and other lease violations. (933 F.2d at p. 574.)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The probation report pertaining to Lopez disclosed that he admitted membership in the Norteno gang. The gang apparently has some history of overt criminal behavior because it was known to the Tulare County Sheriff\u2019s Department. The present conviction is Lopez\u2019s first adult felony, but he has a lengthy history of juvenile offenses and misdemeanor adult crimes. Although an adult, he was only in his early 20\u2019s. Even if the evidence was insufficient to show that the present crime was in some manner gang related, Lopez\u2019s age, gang affiliation, and consistent and increasing pattern of criminal behavior warranted a conclusion by the trial court that Lopez\u2019s disassociation from gang-connected activities was an essential element of any probationary effort at rehabilitation because it would insulate him from a source of temptation to continue to pursue a criminal lifestyle. (See <em>In re Laylah K., supra, 229 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 1501; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Showalter, supra, </em>933 F.2d at p. 575; <em>Malone </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>502 F.2d at p. 557.)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The two specific elements of condition No. 15 were legitimately related to this end. The restriction on contacts with gang members was reasonable because \u201c[association with gang members is the first step of involvement in gang activity.\u201d <em>(In re Laylah K., supra, 229 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 1501.) The prevention of future criminality was also served by this prohibition because it insured that Lopez would not be present at confrontational situations between rival gangs; hostility among different gangs is often an underlying cause of criminal activity. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawthorne </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 43, 51, fn. 2 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 133, 841 P.2d 118].) The restriction on the display of gang indicia was reasonable because it removed from Lopez the visible reminders of his past gang connection. <em>(In re Laylah K., supra, 229 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 1502.)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We are therefore satisfied the inclusion of the gang-based probationary condition was not unlawful. Instead, under the circumstances, it promoted section 1203.l\u2019s goals of rehabilitation and public safety by forbidding conduct reasonably related to future criminality. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lent, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 486.)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>\n<em>Constitutionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Lopez alternatively contends that even if the gang-related restriction is sustainable under <em>Lent, </em>it is nevertheless unconstitutional.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, Lopez maintains that condition No. 15 is (1) overbroad and therefore infringed on his rights of free association and free speech, and (2) is vague and therefore violated due process.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\n<em>First Amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Lopez contends condition No. 15 unjustifiably curtails his constitutional right of free association because it forbids contact with a member of a gang even though Lopez may not know of the person\u2019s gang affiliation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 97, 102-103 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 340] [language prohibited association with all felons regardless of the defendant\u2019s knowledge].) Lopez contends condition No. 15 unjustifiably curtails his constitutional right of free speech because it restricts his display of gang indicia even though Lopez may not know of any connection between, for example, an item of clothing or color and a particular gang.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Lopez also contends that neither aspect of condition No. 15 can be modified to make it applicable to only members or indicia of the Norte\u00f1o gang, in which he admits membership, or to any other gang, because the prosecutor did not prove at sentencing that the Norte\u00f1os or any other gang was engaged in criminal activity. Lopez relies upon the principle that conditions which compel a waiver of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights \u201cmust be narrowly drawn.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th at pp. 102-103; <em>People </em>v. <em>Burden </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1277, 1279 [253 Cal.Rptr. 130].) According to Lopez, because condition No. 15 is overbroad it is \u201c \u2018 \u201cnot reasonably related to a compelling state interest in reformation and rehabilitation and is an unconstitutional restriction on the exercise of fundamental constitutional rights.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th at p. 102; <em>People </em>v. <em>Burden, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at p. 1279.) The People claim condition No. 15 can be saved if it is modified to apply to only those persons known by Lopez to be gang members. <em>(Burden, supra, </em>at p. 1279.)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The right to associate, as Lopez concedes, \u201cmay be restricted if reasonably necessary to accomplish the essential needs of the state and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>public order.\u201d <em>(Malone </em>v.. <em>United States, supra, </em>502 F.2d at p. 556, cert, den. 419 U.S. 1124 [95 S.Ct. 809, 42 L.Ed.2d 824]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Peck, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th at p. 363.) Such restrictions are \u201c \u2018part of the nature of the criminal process. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Peck, supra, </em>at p. 363.) A limitation on the right to associate which takes the form of a probation condition is permissible if it is \u201c(1) primarily designed to meet the ends of rehabilitation and protection of the public and (2) reasonably related to such ends.\u201d  v. <em>Bollinger </em>(9th Cir. 1991) 940 F.2d 478, 480; see <em>Peck, supra, </em>at p. 362; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wardlow </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 360, 367 [278 Cal.Rptr. I].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Similarly, the right of free speech, as Lopez also concedes, \u201cis not absolute at all times and under all circumstances.\u201d <em>(Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire </em>(1942) 315 U.S. 568, 571 [62 S.Ct. 766, 769, 86 L.Ed. 1031].) Prohibiting speech which is likely to constitute a breach of the peace, \u201c \u2018including \u201cclassical fighting words,\u201d [or] words in current use less \u201cclassical\u201d but equally likely to cause violence, and other disorderly words,\u2019 \u201d is constitutionally allowable. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 573 [62 S.Ct. at p. 770].) The California Supreme Court has noted that \u201cFirst Amendment protects the inherent communicative value ... up to the point at which the state\u2019s compelling interest in maintaining order must outweigh the speaker\u2019s freedom of expression.\u201d <em>(In re M.S. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 698, 714 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 355, 896 P.2d 1365]; see <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Women\u2019s Health Center, Inc. </em>(1994) 512 U.S. 753, 765 [114 S.Ct. 2516, 2524-2525, 129 L.Ed.2d 593] [Speech may be burdened no. more than is necessary to serve an important governmental interest.]; <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Acuna, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 1120 [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">We agree that condition No. 15 suffers from constitutionally fatal overbreadth because it prohibits Lopez from associating with persons not known to him to be gang members. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th at p. 102; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hackler </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1058 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 681]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 816, 817 [245 Cal.Rptr. 50]; see also <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Acuna, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>at p. 1117.) In <em>Garcia, </em>we held that a probation condition was not \u201csufficiently narrowly drawn\u201d where the condition required the defendant to refrain from associating with persons not known to the defendant to be users and sellers of narcotics, or felons, or ex-felons. <em>(Garcia, supra, </em>at p. 102.) We modified the condition to add the element of knowledge and affirmed it as modified. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 103.) We will so modify condition No. 15 here. (See <em>Gallo, supra, </em>at p. 1117.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We also agree with Lopez that condition No. 15 suffers from constitutionally fatal overbreadth because it prohibits Lopez from displaying indicia not known to him to be gang related. We will in this respect modify the condition so that it will apply only to displays of symbols known by Lopez to have a gang connotation. (See <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Acuna, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 1117.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">It is apparent from the foregoing that we reject Lopez\u2019s claim that, because the prosecution did not prove the Norte\u00f1o\u2019s or any other gang had engaged in criminal activity, condition No. 15 is not susceptible of modification to correct its overbreadth. To compel the prosecution to prove at sentencing which groups are \u201cgangs\u201d within the ambit of the condition is equivalent to requiring the prosecution to prove at sentencing which persons are \u201cusers and sellers of narcotics, felons and ex-felons\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th at p. 102) or possessors of a \u201ccriminal record\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hackler, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 1058) with whom a defendant may not associate as a condition of probation. Such a demand is obviously impractical and likely impossible. No case we know of has saddled the prosecution with any such burden, and neither will we. An otherwise proper probation condition need only articulate a standard of conduct of sufficient precision to inform the defendant of what is required of him or her and to allow the court to determine whether a violation has occurred. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1374, 1380 [277 Cal.Rptr. 444].) Nothing we have found suggests the prosecution must further validate a provision which complies with this standard by demonstrating for the defendant, when the condition is imposed, every circumstance that would constitute a future violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\n<em>Fourteenth Amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Lopez contends condition No. 15 violates his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights because it is \u201cso broad and so vague that [Lopez] runs the risk of being violated at the whim of any police or probation officer.\u201d As we understand his argument, Lopez takes the position (1) the condition does not make clear that the word \u201cgang\u201d means only associations or groups which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>have criminal activities as their primary purpose, and (2) the provision which purports to describe the prohibited gang indicia as that \u201cidentified by Law Enforcement or the Probation Officer\u201d does not set a clear standard of conduct and thus subjects Lopez to being charged and convicted of an unwitting violation of the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The concept of unconstitutional vagueness is related to the concept of unconstitutional overbreadth, but \u201cthere are important differences.\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Acuna, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 1115.) \u201c \u2018A clear and precise enactment may nevertheless be \u201coverbroad\u201d if in its reach it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The underlying concern of the vagueness doctrine is the core due process requirement of adequate <em>notice:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">\u201c \u2018No one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes. All are entitled to be informed as to what the State commands or forbids.\u2019 [Citations.] The operative corollary is that \u2018a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law.\u2019 [Citation.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">\u201c. . . Thus, a law that is \u2018void for vagueness\u2019 not only fails to provide adequate notice to those who must observe its strictures, but also \u2018impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Acuna, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at pp. 1115-1116.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">A probation condition is subject to the \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d doctrine, and thus \u201cmust be sufficiently precise for the probationer to know what is required of him . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reinertson </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 320, 324-325 [223 Cal.Rptr. 670]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at p. 1380.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Two principles guide the evaluation of whether a law or, in this case a probation condition, is unconstitutionally vague. First, \u201cabstract legal commands must be applied in a specific <em>context. A </em>contextual application of otherwise unqualified legal language may supply the clue to a law\u2019s meaning, giving facially standardless language a constitutionally sufficient concreteness.\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Gallo, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 1116.) Second, only reasonable specificity is required. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1117.) Thus, a statute \u201cwill not be held void for vagueness \u2018if any reasonable and practical construction can be given its language or if its terms may be made reasonably certain by reference to other definable sources.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>We agree with Lopez that the word \u201cgang\u201d in condition No. 15 is, on its face, uncertain in meaning. Although \u201cgang\u201d has in the recent past likely acquired generally sinister implications, the word has considerable benign connotations. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary contains these definitions, among others, for the word: \u201cb: a number of individuals making up a group: as (1): a group of persons working under the same direction or at the same task . . . (2): a company of criminals . . . (3): an elementary and close-knit social group of spontaneous origin; <em>esp. : </em>such a unit composed of antisocial adolescents . . . (4): a group of persons acting in accord who are believed to engage in improper acts or to be influenced by self-seeking, corrupt, or unworthy motives . . . (5): a group of congenial persons having close and informal social relations: a group of persons drawn together by a community of tastes, interests, or activity . . . .\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict. (3d ed. 1986) p. 934.)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Given this commonplace definition, were we compelled to decide the issue in the abstract we might concur in Lopez\u2019s assertion condition No. 15 is unenforceable. The Supreme Court in <em>Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(1939) 306 U.S. 451 [59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed. 888], cited by Lopez, came to such a conclusion with respect to a New Jersey statute that made criminal a person\u2019s membership in a gang, which was defined as a group of two or more persons. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 452 [59 S.Ct. at pp. 618-619].) The United States Supreme Court held that, because it \u201ccondemns no act or omission\u201d and because \u201cthe terms it employs to indicate what it purports to denounce are so vague, indefinite and uncertain,\u201d the statute \u201cmust be condemned as repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 458 [59 S.Ct. at p. 621].) The court noted the \u201cnumerous and varied\u201d definitions of the word \u201cgang\u201d in dictionaries and \u201chistorical and sociological writings\u201d; the court also noted its inability to find any definition of the word in the statutory, case, or common law or to find \u201cany other statute attempting to make it criminal to be a member of a \u2018gang.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra, </em>306 U.S. at pp. 453-455 [59 S.Ct. at p. 620].) As the court saw it: \u201c[W]e cannot, [find] that \u2018gang\u2019 has ever been limited in meaning to a group having purpose to commit any particular offense or class of crimes, or that it has not quite frequently been used in reference to groups of two or more persons not to be suspected of criminality or of anything that is unlawful. The dictionary definitions . . . extend to persons acting together for some purpose, \u2018usually criminal,\u2019 or \u2018mainly for criminal purposes.\u2019 So defined, the purposes of those constituting some gangs may be commendable, as, for example, groups of workers engaged under leadership in any lawful undertaking.\u201d (Lan<em>zetta, supra, </em>at p. 457 [59 S.Ct. at p. 621].)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Here, when \u201cgang\u201d is considered in the context in which it is found in condition No. 15, and with regard for the purpose of the provision in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>it is found, it is apparent the word was intended to apply only to associations which have for their purpose the commission of crimes. As we have already decided, condition No. 15 is valid under the principles of <em>Lent </em>because it is reasonably calculated to rehabilitate Lopez by deterring him from engaging in future illegal conduct. This purpose would hardly be served by preventing Lopez from associating with or displaying insignia of groups which engage in only lawful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The contextual construction of the word \u201cgang\u201d to mean a group primarily engaged in the pursuit of criminal activities tends to give it a \u201cconstitutionally sufficient concreteness.\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Acuna, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 1116.) Activities of an association which deprive third parties of their lawful rights fall outside the constitutional pale. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 1112.) The commission of crimes is the most apparent manifestation of such unprotected conduct. The performance of acts that constitute a civil nuisance is another. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">California has at least one statute in its penal laws which contains a detailed definition of a criminal \u201cgang.\u201d Section 186.22, a provision of the STEP Act,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (1) criminalizes active participation in any \u201ccriminal street gang with knowledge that its members engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity, and who willfully promotes, furthers, or assists in any felonious criminal conduct by members of that gang\u201d (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (a)); and (2) mandates the imposition of an enhanced term of punishment upon a person convicted of a felony \u201ccommitted for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members\u201d (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)). For purposes of this statute, the phrase \u201ccriminal street gang\u201d is defined as: \u201cany ongoing organization, association, or group of three or more persons, whether formal or informal, having as one of its primary activities the commission of one or more of [23 identified crimes], having a common name or common identifying sign or symbol, and whose members individually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.\u201d (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u201cPattern of criminal gang activity\u201d under the statute means: \u201cthe commission of, attempted commission of, or solicitation of, sustained juvenile petition for, or conviction of two or more of [certain identified crimes], provided at least one of these offenses occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of those offenses occurred within three years after a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>prior offense, and the offenses were committed on separate occasions, or by two or more persons[.]\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Section 186.22 has been upheld against a variety of constitutional challenges, including claims based upon the First Amendment and the due process clause of the Fourteenth. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gardeley </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 605, 622-633 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 356, 927 P.2d 713]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 692, 698-704 [278 Cal.Rptr. 140]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gamez </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 957, 969-976 [286 Cal.Rptr. 894]; <em>In re Alberto R. </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1309, 1323-1324 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 348].) As these cases have explained, the carefully crafted terms of the statute ensure that mere membership in a criminal street gang will not be punished and that groups or associations whose primary purpose is not the commission of crime will be excluded from coverage. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gamez, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at pp. 970-971, 973-974; <em>In re Alberto R., supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at p. 1324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Because section 186.22 has withstood attack on the same constitutional grounds advanced here by Lopez against condition No. 15, we believe it appropriate to order modification of the probation condition in issue so as to incorporate into it the definitions contained in subdivisions (e) and (f) of the statute. By so amending the condition, any due process concerns about it will be eliminated and Lopez will be unambiguously notified of the standard of conduct required of him. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gardeley, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at pp. 622-623 [detailed requirements of section 186.22 are sufficiently explicit to inform those subject to it about what constitutes a criminal street gang]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Heitzman </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 189, 200 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 236, 886 P.2d 1229] [citizens are required to inform themselves of a statute\u2019s language; legislative history and subsequent judicial construction]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bamba </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1120 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 450] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Moreover, such a modification will not disturb the rehabilitative end of condition No. 15. The provision aims at deterring Lopez from future criminality by compelling him to avoid actions and associations which provide temptations to violate the Penal Code. Read in this context, the word \u201cgang\u201d in condition No. 15 contemplates precisely the sort of criminally oriented association described in subdivisions (e) and (f) of section 186.22. Were the word \u201cgang\u201d in the condition construed to mean anything less, the condition would be subject to constitutional question on the grounds raised here and in those cases which have passed upon the statute. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gardeley, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at pp. 623-624; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gamez, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at pp. 970-971.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The modifications to condition No. 15 that we will order will also resolve the issues raised by Lopez about the prohibition against the display of gang indicia \u201cidentified by Law Enforcement or the Probation Officer.\u201d Without at least the insertion in this aspect of the condition of a knowledge element, Lopez was subject to being charged with an unwitting violation of the condition because nothing in it required the police or the probation office to apprise Lopez of the \u201cidentified\u201d items of gang dress before he was charged with a violation. In this respect, then, the unmodified condition was inconsistent with the rule that a probation condition \u201cmust be sufficiently precise for the probationer to know what is required of him . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reinertson, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.3d at pp. 324-325; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at p. 1380.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Notwithstanding the modifications we shall make in condition No. 15, a problem involving the reference to law enforcement and the probation office still remains. As a result of our modifications, the phrase might have a limiting effect; in other words, even though Lopez may know that a particular item of indicia is related to a \u201ccriminal street gang\u201d as defined in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>186.22, subdivision (f), he might not be in violation of the prohibition because the item has not yet been \u201cidentified\u201d to Lopez by law enforcement or the probation office. Because we are not certain whether the reference to \u201cLaw Enforcement or the Probation Officer\u201d will retain any value under the condition as modified, we will not strike it. The trial court on remand, and on motion by either party, may reassess whether it would serve any purpose to retain the phrase in light of the modifications we will order.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\n<em>Plea Agreement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">In the final portion of his brief, Lopez argues that even if condition No. 15 is valid, it cannot be imposed in this case because it violates the plea agreement and thus his \u201cdue process right to the benefit of his plea agreement.\u201d He also challenges the condition because, according to him, it would require him to undergo surgery to remove from his skin the gang tattoos that existed at the time of sentencing.  Lopez did not raise either objection at sentencing, and asserts that the issues have not been waived for purposes of appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The People impliedly concede the issue is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">When a defendant enters a plea in exchange for specified benefits, such as dismissal of other counts or a particular punishment, both the defendant and the state must abide by the bargain, and the punishment imposed by the court \u201cmay not significantly exceed that which the parties agreed upon.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1024; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Olea </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1289, 1296 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 722]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1041, 1050 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 726].)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201c[W]hen a plea rests in any significant degree <em>on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><em>consideration, such promise must be </em>fulfilled.\u201d <em>(Santobello </em>v. New York (1971) 404 U.S. 257, 262 [92 S.Ct. 495, 499, 30 L.Ed.2d 427], italics added.) Failure of the state to honor the agreement violates the defendant\u2019s due process rights for which the defendant is entitled to some remedy. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1024.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">However, the imposition of an additional sentence term does not constitute a violation of a plea agreement if the term was not encompassed by the parties\u2019 plea negotiations. <em>(In re Moser </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 342, 357 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 723, 862 P.2d 723] [length of parole]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McClellan </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 367, 380 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 739, 862 P.2d 739] [registration as a sex offender].) Moreover, \u201cthe variance must be \u2018significant\u2019 in the context of the plea bargain as a whole to violate the defendant\u2019s rights. A punishment or related condition that is insignificant relative to the whole, such as a standard condition of probation, may be imposed whether or not it was part of the express negotiations.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1024.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">There is no suggestion in this record that condition No. 15, or any gang-related probationary term, was the subject of the negotiations which culminated in Lopez\u2019s plea. The exchange for Lopez\u2019s plea to the single felony was a sentence of three years\u2019 probation, with a specified amount of county jail time and a fine, along with dismissal of the other two felony counts. Absent some evidence that the People\u2019s consideration for the deal was the omission of condition No. 15 or its equivalent, the condition cannot be said to have been a part of the \u201cbargain\u201d agreed to by Lopez and the prosecution. <em>(Santobello </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>404 U.S. at p. 262 [92 S.Ct. at pp. 498-499].) There is also no indication in the record, and no assertion on appeal, that the prosecution in any way misled Lopez as to what conditions of probation would be imposed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McClellan, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 367.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In any event, we find condition No. 15, as it will be modified pursuant to our disposition, not to be \u201c \u2018significant\u2019 in the context of the plea bargain as a whole.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1024.) A standard condition of probation, even if not agreed upon or discussed, is an immaterial deviation from the agreement as a matter of law. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Lopez implicitly acknowledges that one of the other conditions imposed upon him\u2014to \u201cobey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>all laws\u201d\u2014is a \u201cstandard\u201d condition. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hove </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1003, 1005, fn. 6 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 295].) Condition No. 15 as it will be modified in effect serves as an adjunct to this \u201cstandard\u201d condition, for it facilitates Lopez\u2019s compliance with the law by foreclosing him from consorting with groups whose primary activity is the commission of felonies and thereby removing him from a source of temptation to violate the law. Considered in connection with this other condition, condition No. 15 did not constitute a punishment significantly greater than Lopez had bargained for. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1026; <em>People </em>v. <em>Olea, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at p. 1299.) On this subject, we note that though Lopez objected to condition No. 15 in the trial court, he did not reject, as he could have, the negotiated plea on the ground it contained this condition. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Torres </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 771, 781 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 803].)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Furthermore, we believe condition No. 15 was appropriately imposed by the trial court as a \u201cstandard\u201d condition of probation. Conditions prohibiting gang related conduct are not new; appellate courts have approved similar conditions, at least as applied to juvenile probation, for at least the past eight years. <em>(In re Michael D., supra, </em>214 Cal.App.3d at p. 1617; <em>In re Laylah K., supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at p. 1501.) The federal courts have approved analogous associational restrictions for at least the past 24 years. <em>(Malone </em>v. <em>United States supra, </em>502 F.2d at p. 557; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Showalter, supra, </em>933 F.2d at p. 575.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In addition, the condition serves a legitimate purpose consistent with the rehabilitative goal of probation. In <em>Torres, </em>the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a period of probation for drug-related offenses and requiring a commitment to a drug treatment facility, and then routinely conditioning probation on a waiver of custody credits for time spent in the facility. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Torres, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th at p. 782.) The court based this conclusion upon the \u201cgigantic efforts of this state to support productive and effective drug rehabilitation programs,\u201d the \u201cwide discretion accorded sentencing judges by section 1203.1,\u201d and the \u201clogic\u201d inherent in the proposition that by denying credits the probationer was benefited because he or she was offered not a means by which to \u201cmanipulate the system by serving jail time in an ineffectual substance abuse treatment detour\u201d but instead \u201ca greater incentive to succeed in substance abuse treatment and on probation.\u201d <em>(Torres </em>at p. 776.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The essence of each of these three elements exist here with respect to the gang condition. First, the \u201cbroad discretion\u201d of the trial court extends to all probationary grants. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carbajal, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 1120.) Second, there can be little dispute about the seriousness of the threat to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>social order and public safety presented by criminal gangs; the Legislature has expressly found there is a \u201ccrisis\u201d in this state caused by gangs and their individual members who engender fear in and intimidate law-abiding citizens. (\u00a7 186.21.) Third, the point of the grant of probation, to give Lopez the incentive and the means to abandon further criminality, is promoted by provisions, such as condition No. 15, which seek to insulate him from persons, and deter him from conduct, conducive to a resumption of criminality.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Last, we deal with Lopez\u2019s claim the condition is a significant deviation from the plea agreement because it would require him to have his gang tattoos removed surgically. We will not read the provision to impose such an unreasonable requirement. (See <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Acuna, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 1117.) To the extent the condition can be so construed, the People have stipulated that Lopez need not have his tattoos, existing at the time sentence was imposed, surgically removed. We will modify the condition to so state.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Condition No. 15 is modified to read as follows; \u201cDefendant is not to be involved in or associate with any person known to defendant to be a gang member.
