David contends the denial of services constituted an unfair retroactive application of these newly enacted provisions that denied him due process. He further contends section 361.5, subdivision (b), violates constitutional protections of due process and equal protection because it discriminates against those individuals who cannot afford to pay for private reunification services.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">David also argues the court abused its discretion in denying him visitation with Joshua.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Procedural and Factual History</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">This is the second dependency proceeding for Joshua, who was bom on July 21, 1992. Joshua is the son of David and Tina M. David and Tina also are the birthparents of another boy, born on August 21, 1990, who tested positive for methamphetamine at birth and became a dependent child. David was incarcerated at the time. The parents failed to reunify, and, on December 1, 1992, their parental rights were terminated as to the older boy, who was adopted by his foster mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">In Joshua\u2019s first dependency proceeding, the Department of Social Services (Department) filed a petition under section 300, subdivisions (b) and (g), on August 23, 1993. The petition alleged Joshua had been residing with Tina in a hotel room full of electrical appliances that posed a danger to him, he had attempted to put his hand in boiling water and his parents were incarcerated and unable to arrange care for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">Joshua was declared a dependent after David and Tina submitted on the petition and the court found the allegations true. Custody was removed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>the parents, who were ordered to comply with a reunification plan. David\u2019s plan required him to complete a parent education program, attend therapy, participate in a 12-step substance abuse program and drug test.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">David had completed a number of the requirements of his reunification plan while incarcerated. Joshua was ordered detained with David on May 5, 1994, on the condition David cooperate with family preservation workers, continue to drug test for an additional 60 days, and enroll in, attend, and complete an anger management course.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Although David\u2019s subsequent compliance with his reunification plan was uneven, the social worker reported Joshua appeared to adjust well to David\u2019s care. At the time of the six-month review report, the Department was considering recommending jurisdiction be terminated, but David was arrested in December 1994, and Joshua was placed in foster care again.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">After Tina\u2019s release from custody in April 1994, her whereabouts were unknown for several months. However, in the first two months of 1995, Tina complied with the requirements of her reunification plan, and the Department recommended detaining Joshua with Tina. In October 1995, the court issued exit orders awarding Tina physical custody of Joshua and David supervised visits with a neutral party; David was restrained from having any other contact with Tina or Joshua.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">David was arrested in October 1995 for receiving stolen property. Upon conviction, he was sentenced to 16 months in prison. On December 16, 1995, a baby girl, Gina P., was born to David and his girlfriend, Regina P. David was released from prison on August 6, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">David was arrested again on December 17, 1996, after he threatened to beat up Regina and ripped the telephone out of the wall. He pled guilty to a felony count of making terrorist threats.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">On May 4, 1996, Tina was arrested for public intoxication and possession of a controlled substance; she was released on May 7. Tina was arrested on October 28, 1996, and subsequently convicted of burglary. Upon her arrest, Tina left Joshua with a roommate; they were living in a motel room. Later, Joshua\u2019s 18-year-old half sister, Gyrene M., took him in. Joshua had a bad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>case of head lice. Cyrene repeatedly advised Tina that she was unable to care for her half brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\n<em>Joshua\u2019s Current Dependency Proceeding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">By January 1997, Cyrene could no longer care for Joshua, and the Department took Joshua into protective custody on January 8, 1997. At the time, Joshua was in\u2019 soiled clothing, and he had visible cavities in his teeth. Subsequently, a dentist found five cavities requiring two root canals. Also, it was later determined that Joshua was suffering from two types of parasitic infections. Although he was four and one-half years old, Joshua did not recognize colors, shapes or letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">On January 13, 1997, the Department filed a petition alleging under section 300, subdivision (b): \u201cOn or about and between 10/01/96 to present, the child\u2019s mother left the child inadequately attended and inadequately supervised in that when the mother was incarcerated in October, 1996, the mother left the child in the care of his then 18 year old sibling, Cyrene [M.], who has been unable to cope with and appropriately care for the child. Cyrene [M.] has on several occasions advised the mother that she is unable to care for and cope with the child but the mother has failed to make other arrangements for the child\u2019s care and there is substantial risk the child will suffer serious physical harm or illness,\u201d and under section 300, subdivision (g): \u201cOn or about January 8, 1997 to present, the whereabouts of the father was not known and reasonable efforts to locate the father have been unsuccessful, and the mother was incarcerated and unable to arrange appropriate and adequate care, and the relative or other adult custodian having physical custody of the child is not able and/or willing to continue providing care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">David, who was in local custody, was present at a dependency hearing on February 13, 1997, and the court permitted him to have telephone contact with Joshua. David asked the social worker to personally read his letters to Joshua because David did not trust the foster mother to do so, but the social worker did not receive any letters from David while he was in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">David was released from custody on March 27, 1997, and resumed living with Regina. On April 1, David tested positive for methamphetamines.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">On April 28, 1997, Department filed an amended petition on behalf of Joshua, adding the following allegations concerning David under section 300, subdivision (b): \u201cThe father is unable to provide safe, appropriate and regular care for the child in that, including but not limited to, custody orders direct the father is to have only supervised visits with the child; the father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>has a history of substance abuse and tested positive for methamphetamines on or about 04/01/1997; between 02/01/1997 and 02/19/1997 the father\u2019s girlfriend, Regina [P.], who lives with the father, used methamphetamine and marijuana to excess which rendered her unable to provide regular care for Joshua\u2019s half-sibling Gina [P.]; in December 1996 the father and Regina [P.] were involved in a domestic confrontation which resulted in the father\u2019s incarceration. As a result, there is substantial risk the child will suffer serious physical harm or illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The amended petition contained the following allegation concerning David under section 300, subdivision (g): \u201cOn or about 01/08/1997 to present, the mother, who is the child\u2019s custodial parent, was incarcerated and unable to arrange appropriate and adequate care, and the relative or other adult custodian having physical custody of the child is not able and/or willing to continue providing care and, pursuant to custody orders entered by the San Diego County Juvenile Court in October 1995, the father is only permitted supervised visitation with the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">On April 29, 1997, and May 12, 1997, David tested positive for marijuana. On May 29, 1997, David was arrested for possession of methamphetamine and a syringe.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">At the June 13, 1997 jurisdictional hearing, Tina submitted to the allegations of the petition. David, who was present with counsel, contested jurisdiction. Social worker Elizabeth Morgan testified she did not place Joshua with David after David was released from custody because of her concerns about his ability to care for the minor. She cited David\u2019s criminal history, drug use, domestic violence with Regina, his positive drug tests and the child protective services history. The court sustained both counts of the petition by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The contested dispositional hearing was held on four days in August 1997.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The foster mother testified David had called once and sent two letters. Joshua was willing to talk to David but he was not very responsive. Joshua said he did not want to visit his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Joshua\u2019s therapist, Debbie Brown, testified that during play therapy Joshua showed fear of David and talked about violence he had witnessed between David and Tina and/or Regina. The most important issue for Joshua, who had been in nine placements, was a sense of trust that adults will take care of him and protect him, according to Brown. Brown opined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>David should undergo therapy to gain an understanding of his impact on Joshua; visitation between David and Joshua would be appropriate after David\u2019s therapist indicated David could interact appropriately with Joshua. Brown also said visitation should begin in a safe environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Social worker Morgan recommended neither Tina nor David receive reunification services. With respect to David, Morgan cited his long-term and continued drug use, frequent incarcerations and unstable lifestyle. Morgan testified David lied to her and accused her of \u201cwanting to adopt his son away from him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">There was also testimony regarding David\u2019s attempts to treat his substance abuse and other problems that led to the removal of Joshua\u2019s older half brother in 1990. Sharon Lubert, the social worker on the 1990 dependency case, testified upon David\u2019s release from prison in August 1991 he participated in reunification services for only a few weeks. David initially was to drug test at San Diego Health Alliance, but that was changed because of his work schedule. David was supposed to test at North Inland Recovery Center, which had later hours, but he never went there. Lubert gave David referrals to drug rehabilitation programs, but he never enrolled in one.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Jacquie Ayadi, the supervising social worker in Joshua\u2019s first dependency proceeding, testified that in May 1994 Joshua was detained with David, who had been receiving services in prison, even though David had tested positive for cocaine in March 1994. At one point, the Department could not locate David and Joshua. By December 1994, David was no longer participating in his maintenance plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Morgan testified she had no evidence David had completed a drug program since Joshua\u2019s first dependency. Morgan also stated David was offered a reunification plan in Gina\u2019s dependency case, which was ongoing, and he continued to test positive for drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">The court declared Joshua a dependent and removed custody from the mother as custodial parent and from David as the noncustodial parent requesting custody. The court found by clear and convincing evidence that reasonable efforts had been made to prevent removal from the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Pursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10) and (12), the court ordered no reunification services were to be provided to David. Services were to be provided to Tina if she wanted them.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">On September 15, 1997, the court ordered a specific reunification plan for Tina. The court also ordered no visitation for David would occur until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>child\u2019s therapist determined it was in Joshua\u2019s best interest. The court also gave the social worker the discretion to permit telephone and letter contact with the concurrence of Joshua\u2019s therapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">I. <em>Denial of Reunification Services</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">David contends it was error to deny him reunification services under section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10) and (12), because these newly enacted statutory provisions were unfairly applied to him retroactively. David also contends section 361.5, subdivision (b) is invalid because it discriminates against people who cannot afford reunification services, thereby violating constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">A. <em>The Statutory Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Notwithstanding the crucial role of reunification services when a child is removed from the home (see <em>In re Jamie M. </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 530, 545 [184 Cal.Rptr. 778]), the Legislature, by enacting section 361.5, subdivision (b), has discerned \u201c. . . it may be fruitless to provide reunification services under certain circumstances.\u201d <em>(In re Rebecca H. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 825, 837 [278 Cal.Rptr. 185]; see also <em>Deborah S. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 741, 750 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 858].) In <em>Deborah S. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at page 751, the Court of Appeal noted: \u201cInherent in this subdivision appears to be a very real concern for the risk of recidivism by the parent despite reunification services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">As originally enacted in 1986, section 361.5, subdivision (b), provided the court had the discretion not to order reunification services, if it was shown by clear and convincing evidence that: the parent\u2019s whereabouts were unknown; the parent suffered from a mental disability rendering him or her incapable of using the services; the child, who previously was adjudicated a dependent as a result of physical or sexual abuse, was being removed from the home a second time because of additional physical or sexual abuse; the parent had caused the death of another minor through abuse or neglect; or the child was under the age of five and had suffered severe physical abuse. (Stats. 1986, ch. 1122, \u00a7 13, pp. 3984-3986.)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">At issue here is 1996 legislation that expanded the number of circumstances under which the juvenile court can deny reunification services. (Stats. 1996, ch. 1083, \u00a7 2.5.) In particular, we are concerned with section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10) and (12), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>\u201c(b) Reunification services need not be provided to a parent or guardian described in this subdivision when the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">\u201c(10) That (A) the court ordered a permanent plan of adoption, guardianship, or long-term foster care for any siblings or half-siblings of the minor because the parent or guardian failed to reunify with the sibling or half-sibling after the sibling or half-sibling had been removed from that parent or guardian pursuant to Section 361 and that parent or guardian is the same parent or guardian described in subdivision (a), or (B) the parental rights of a parent or guardian over any sibling or half-sibling of the minor had been permanently severed, and that, according to the findings of the court, this parent or guardian has not subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to removal of the sibling or half-sibling of that minor from that parent or guardian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\u201c(12) That the parent or guardian of the minor has a history of extensive, abusive, and chronic use of drugs or alcohol and has resisted prior treatment for this problem during a three-year period immediately prior to the filing of the petition which brought that minor to the court\u2019s attention, or has failed or refused to comply with a program of drug or alcohol treatment described in the case plan required by Section 358.1 on at least two prior occasions, even though the programs identified were available and accessible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10) and (12), became effective January 1, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">B. <em>Retroactivity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">David contends it was reversible error to deny him reunification services under section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10) and (12), based on conduct which occurred before the effective date of these provisions. The contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Under section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10) and (12), reunification services may be denied if a parent was unsuccessful in reunifying with a sibling or half sibling or unsuccessful in treatment of a long-standing substance abuse problem. Both provisions, therefore, rely upon the parent\u2019s past failure to either reunify with the child\u2019s sibling or comply with a substance abuse program.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Joshua\u2019s second dependency petition was filed on January 13, 1997, approximately two weeks after subdivision (b)(10) and (12) became effective. Thus, the relevant question is whether David\u2019s past conduct\u2014conduct that occurred before the law was in effect\u2014can properly be used to cut off his reunification services.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The answer is yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that \u2018[a] statute does not operate retroactively merely because some of the facts or conditions upon which its application depends came into existence before the enactment.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Armstrong </em>v. <em>County of San Mateo </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 597, 613 [194 Cal.Rptr. 294].)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The statute\u2019s reliance upon antecedent events or conduct is analogous to recidivism provisions in the Penal Code, such as the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law and other habitual offender laws, that enhance punishment because the defendant has committed other crimes in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">\u201cIn the context of habitual criminal statutes, \u2018increased penalties for subsequent offenses are attributable to the defendant\u2019s status as a repeat offender and arise as an incident of the subsequent offense rather than constituting a penalty for the prior offense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 826, 833 [210 Cal.Rptr. 623, 694 P.2d 736], overruled on different grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 343, 355 [243 Cal.Rptr. 688, 748 P.2d 1150].) As the court noted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Venegas </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 814, 823 [89 Cal.Rptr. 103], \u201cA statute is not retroactive in operation merely because it draws upon facts antecedent to its enactment for its operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">David\u2019s principal argument is that statutes are prospective rather than retroactive<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> unless the Legislature clearly intends retroactivity. We have no quarrel with this premise, which correctly states general law. (See <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 148, 153 [233 Cal.Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743].) However, in this case the argument is unavailing as we conclude the Legislature clearly intended section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10) and (12), to be triggered by prior dependency proceedings or other events occurring before these provisions were enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Section 361.5 reflects the Legislature\u2019s desire to provide services to parents only where those services will facilitate the return of children to parental custody. The exceptions in subdivision (b) to the general mandate of providing reunification services \u201cdemonstrate a legislative determination that in certain situations, attempts to facilitate reunification do not serve and protect the child\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>(In re Baby Boy H. </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 470, 474 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 793].) Certainly, it cannot serve a child\u2019s best interest to unnecessarily prolong the lengthy dependency process when there is no chance of successful reunification because of circumstances that make it \u201cfruitless to provide reunification services . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Rebecca H., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at p. 837.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Furthermore, in construing legislative intent, it is important to consider all sections of the statute. <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224].) Section 361.5, subdivision (a) requires the provision of reunification services to parents. Subdivision (b) lists various circumstances in which the requirement need not be met. Subdivision (c) provides guidance to the court in determining whether reunification services are likely to succeed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Section 361.5, subdivision (c) explicitly permits the juvenile court to consider such antecedent conduct as \u201cfailure to respond to previous services\u201d or \u201ca past history of violent behavior\u201d in deciding whether reunification services are likely to be unsuccessful in the current dependency proceeding. Thus, the Legislature, in fashioning limitations to the general mandate of providing reunification services, has historically included antecedent events or past behavior as legitimate criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Our interpretation of section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10) and (12)\u2014that the Legislature intended these provisions to be triggered by prior dependency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>proceedings that occurred before January 1, 1997\u2014thus gives effect to, and harmonizes, all parts of section 361.5, including subdivision (c). <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 230.) Also, our interpretation of subdivision (b)(10) and (12) in the context of the rest of the statute does not yield an absurd or arbitrary result. <em>(DeYoung </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 11, 18 [194 Cal.Rptr. 722].) Moreover, the basic purpose of section 361.5, subdivision (b)\u2014to limit reunification services to situations where they are likely to be successful\u2014would be frustrated by a construction that did not take into account a parent\u2019s historical circumstances, such as past failures of the parent in previous dependency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Further, in an era of limited resources it is not only reasonable but prudent as well to focus reunification efforts on those cases most likely to succeed. (See <em>Raymond C. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 159, 164 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 33] [when one of the exceptions in \u00a7 361.5, subd. (b) applies, the general rule favoring reunification is replaced by legislative assumption that offering services would be unwise use of government resources].) Therefore, \u201cas a matter of public policy, this exception to the general rule favoring reunification services appears neither absurd nor arbitrary.\u201d <em>(Deborah S. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at p. 751, citing <em>Cossack </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 726, 733 [114 Cal.Rptr. 460, 523 P.2d 260].)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In sum, there was no impermissible retroactivity in applying section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10) and (12), to Joshua\u2019s dependency even though the circumstances that activated these provisions took place before January 1, 1997. Contrary to David\u2019s position, the critical date is not that of the antecedent events or behaviors that trigger subdivision (b)(10) and (12), but rather the date the current dependency petition was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">David also argues the retroactive application to his past conduct constituted a denial of due process because he was not timely informed that termination of his parental rights as to Joshua\u2019s brother could later deny him reunification services for any subsequent dependent child.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Procedural due process focuses upon the essential and fundamental elements of fairness of a procedure that would deprive an individual of important rights. As stated in <em>Fuentes </em>v. <em>Shevin </em>(1972) 407 U.S. 67, 80 [92 S.Ct. 1983, 1994, 32 L.Ed.2d 556]: \u201c. . . the central meaning of procedural due process [is] clear: \u2018Parties whose rights are to be affected are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right they must first be notified.\u2019 [Citations.] It is equally fundamental that the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard \u2018must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Initially, we observe subdivision (c) of section 361.5 (see fn. 6, <em>ante) </em>provides for procedural safeguards. Further, we agree with <em>In re Baby Boy H., supra, </em>63 Cal.App.4th 470, in which the Court of Appeal rejected a due process attack on section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10). \u201c[A]ppellant\u2019s position that this subdivision creates an irrebutable presumption of inability to parent based on prior court orders and dramatically increases the risk of erroneous deprivation of parental rights is unfounded. Rather, it is the person\u2019s current parenting skills, examined in light of a heightened standard of proof, which determine whether the child will be adjudged a dependent.\u201d (63 Cal.App.4th at pp. 477-478.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">We find this reasoning persuasive and adopt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">II. <em>Is Section 361.5, Subdivision (b) Constitutional?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">David contends section 361.5, subdivision (b), violates constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection because it discriminates against indigent parents who cannot afford to pay for reunification services on their own and thereby have virtually no chance to reunite with their children as opposed to nonindigent parents who can pay for private services if the government services are denied. David\u2019s argument is based on a recent United States Supreme Court case, <em>M.L.B. </em>v. <em>S.L.J. </em>(1996) 519 U.S. 102 [117 S.Ct. 555, 136 L.Ed.2d 473], which held the appeal of an order terminating parental rights cannot be conditioned on the appellant\u2019s prepayment of record preparation fees. Before addressing David\u2019s specific constitutional argument, we shall set forth the relevant principles of constitutional law and demonstrate section 361.5, subdivision (b) is constitutional on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">A. <em>Relevant Constitutional Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\"> Our Supreme Court has discussed constitutional rights in the juvenile dependency context as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">\u201cThe federal and state Constitutions guarantee that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law. [Citation.] A parent\u2019s interest in the companionship, care, custody and management of his children is a compelling one, ranked among the most basic of civil rights. [Citation.] Likewise, natural children have a fundamental independent interest in belonging to a family unit [citation], and they have compelling rights to be protected from abuse and neglect and to have a placement that is stable, permanent, and that allows the caretaker to make a full emotional commitment to the child. [Citation.] The interests of the parent and the child, therefore, must be balanced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>\u201cSubstantive due process prohibits governmental interference with a person\u2019s fundamental right to life, liberty or property by unreasonable or arbitrary legislation. [Citation.] In substantive due process law, deprivation of a right is supportable only if the conduct from which the deprivation flows is prescribed by reasonable legislation that is reasonably applied; that is, the law must have a reasonable and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Marilyn H. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 295, 306-307 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 544, 851 P.2d 826].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Under the equal protection clause, \u201c[a] classification \u2018must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Reed </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1971) 404 U.S. 71, 76 [92 S.Ct. 251, 254, 30 L.Ed.2d 225].) However, only where the state has adopted \u201ca classification that affects two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal manner\u201d are equal protection rights implicated. <em>(In re Eric J. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 522, 530 [159 Cal.Rptr. 317, 601 P.2d 549], italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">B. <em>Section 361.5, Subdivision (b) Is Constitutional on Its Face</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In assessing the constitutionality of section 361.5, subdivision (b), we consider its purpose and how it operates within the context of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">We conclude subdivision (b) of section 361.5 comports with due process. With respect to procedural due process, section 361.5, subdivision (c) requires the court to hold a dispositional hearing and the probation officer to submit a report on whether reunification services should be provided. As to substantive due process, subdivision (b) represents a reasonable and rational means to advance a prime purpose of juvenile court law\u2014providing protection and stability to dependent children in a timely fashion\u2014by efficiently allocating scarce reunification services.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">As the Court of Appeal in <em>In re Baby Boy H., supra, </em>63 Cal.App.4th at page 478, observed: \u201cThe exception at issue here, section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10), recognizes the problem of recidivism by the parent despite reunification efforts. Before this subdivision applies, the parent must have had at least one chance to reunify with a different child through the aid of governmental resources and fail to do so. Experience has shown that with certain parents, as is the case here, the risk of recidivism is a very real concern. Therefore, when another child of that same parent is adjudged a dependent child, it is not unreasonable to assume reunification efforts will be unsuccessful. Further, the court may still order reunification services be provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that reunification is in the best interests of the child. (\u00a7 361.5, subd. (c).)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">In <em>In re Christina A. </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1073 [261 Cal.Rptr. 903], the Court of Appeal upheld the constitutionality of section 361.5, subdivision (b)(2), which permits the cut-off of reunification services if the parent is mentally incapable of utilizing such services. With respect to the equal protection claim, the Court of Appeal observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">\u201c[Appellant\u2019s argument is that the classification of parents with dependent children into those provided with reunification services and those to whom such services are not extended, is invidious and discriminatory. The equal protection clause requires some rationality in the nature of the class singled out and requires that the distinctions drawn have '\u201csome relevance to the purpose for which the classification is made.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] <em>(Rinaldi </em>v. <em>Yeager </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 305, 309 [16 L.Ed.2d 577, 580, 86 S.Ct. 1497].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\u201cWe perceive no improper purpose underlying the statute. The stated purpose of section 361.5, subdivision (b) is to exempt from reunification services those parents who are unlikely to benefit. This purpose is related to that of the juvenile law itself\u2014to ensure the well-being of children whose parents are unable or incapable of caring for them by affording them another stable and permanent home within a definite time period. Although the goal of the juvenile law is to reunite children with their parents whenever possible, this reunification must be accomplished within 18 months from the time the child is originally taken from his or her parents\u2019 custody. (\u00a7 366.25, subd. (a).) This strict time frame, in turn, is a recognition that a child\u2019s needs for a permanent and stable home cannot be postponed for an extended period without significant detriment. (See \u00a7 352; 1 Goldstein, Freud and Solnit, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child, pp. 42-43; <em>In re Micah S. </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 557, 566 [243 Cal.Rptr. 756] [Brauer, J., conc.].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">\u201cIt is apparent that section 361.5, subdivision (b) bears a rational relation to these purposes. It is reasonable for the state, before expending its limited resources for reunification services, to distinguish between those who would benefit from such services and those who would not.\u201d <em>(In re Christina </em>A., <em>supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1079-1080.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">We agree with the reasoning of <em>Christina A. </em>and adopt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">C. <em>Is Section 361.5, Subdivision (b) Constitutional in Light of M.L.B. v. S.L.J.?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">In <em>M.L.B. </em>v. <em>S.L.J., supra, </em>519 U.S. at page 107 [117 S.Ct. at page 559], the United States Supreme Court held a state violates due process and equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>protection when it conditions appeals from trial court orders terminating parental rights on the affected parent\u2019s ability to pay record preparation fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">After petitioner\u2019s parental rights to two minor children were terminated, she sought to appeal the termination decree but the State of Mississippi required she pay in advance record preparation fees estimated at $2,352.36. Petitioner\u2019s appeal was dismissed because she lacked the money to pay the fees. (519 U.S. at p. 106 [117 S.Ct. at p. 559].)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In ruling that Mississippi may not block an indigent parent\u2019s access to an appeal of a parental termination order because of her poverty, the high court \u201cplace[d] decrees forever terminating parental rights in the category of cases in which the State may not \u2018bolt the door to equal justice.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(M.L.B. </em>v. <em>S.L.J., </em>supra, 519 U.S. at p. 124 [117 S.Ct. at p. 568].)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The high court relied on two lines of cases: (1) those holding appellate review of criminal cases cannot be denied on the basis of poverty (see, e.g., <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1956) 351 U.S. 12 [76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891, 55 A.L.R.2d 1055]; <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>City of Chicago </em>(1971) 404 U.S. 189 [92 S.Ct. 410, 30 L.Ed.2d 372]); and (2) those recognizing that the interest of parents in their relationship with their children is a fundamental liberty right protected by the Fourteenth Amendment (see <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services </em>(1981) 452 U.S. 18 [101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640]; <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 745 [102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599]).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Because of the primacy of the parent-child relationship, the high court found the petitioner\u2019s interest at stake\u2014maintaining a parental relationship with her children\u2014outweighed Mississippi\u2019s justification for requiring the records fee\u2014the state\u2019s need for revenue to offset costs\u2014and deserved the same heightened protection afforded to criminal cases, where access to appellate review cannot be denied to indigents. <em>(M.L.B. </em>v. <em>S.L.J., supra, </em>519 U.S. at pp. 119-124 [117 S.Ct. at pp. 565-568].)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\"><em>M.L.B. </em>v. <em>S.L.J., supra, </em>519 U.S. 102 [117 S.Ct. 555], however, has little to do with this case and does not advance David\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">We begin by noting this case is not about David\u2019s access to an appeal or to any other judicial process. It is about the state\u2019s decision to stop providing him reunification services, which points to another distinction: This case is not about an order terminating the parent-child relationship.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">David\u2019s attempts to convince us otherwise are unavailing. David argues that without reunification services \u201che is denied the exclusive means by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>which he can reunify with Joshua\u201d and \u201che will have no realistic way of convincing the court he is fit to regain custody of Joshua when the case is reviewed in six months.\u201d The law simply does not compel such dire consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">At the relevant time, subdivision (f) of section 361.5 read in pertinent part: \u201cIf a court, pursuant to paragraph (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), or (12) . . . does not order reunification services, it shall conduct a hearing pursuant to Section 366.25 or 366.26 within 120 days of the dispositional hearing. However, the court shall not schedule a hearing so long as the other parent is being provided reunification services pursuant to subdivision (a).\u201d (Stats. 1996, ch. 1083, \u00a7 2.5.) So long as Tina is being provided reunification services, David will have the opportunity to address his drug and other problems affecting his parenting.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the parent-child relationship is not necessarily terminated at the permanency planning hearing. (See \u00a7 366.26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Section 361.5, subdivision (b), does not treat indigents differently from nonindigents. It does not withhold government services on the basis of an invidious classification distinguishing the rich from the poor. Section 361.5, subdivision (b), is facially neutral; it creates no classification. Moreover, this statutory provision does not directly affect the fundamental right of maintaining the parental relationship, but rather concerns the provision of governmental services. Reunification services are a benefit, and there is no constitutional \u201centitlement\u201d to these services. <em>(In re Christina A., supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1078-1079.) In short, section 361.5, subdivision (b), which is neutral on its face and is designed to serve neutral ends, does not violate equal protection principles simply because David postulates a negative result down the line.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">David was not denied reunification services because he is indigent; he was denied those governmental services because the court found, after a hearing and by clear and convincing evidence, that section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10) and (12), applied by virtue of David\u2019s failure to reunite with his other son and his noncompliance with substance abuse programs. The legislative determination that reunification services should not be afforded in such circumstances had nothing to do with indigency.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Section 361.5, subdivision (b), also does not violate the constitutional guarantee of due process of law. The statute incorporates the constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>standard of clear and convincing proof as required in parental termination proceedings by <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, supra, </em>455 U.S. at pages 768-770 [102 S.Ct. at pages 1402-1404], David was represented by counsel below, as he is on appeal; accordingly, the issues raised by <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services, supra, </em>452 U.S. 18, are not implicated. Finally, section 361.5, subdivision (b), can only be invoked after a hearing for which the probation officer must prepare a report. (\u00a7 361.5, subd.
