J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKD\">Leland S. Puryear (Puryear) appeals from a summary judgment granted defendants in his malicious prosecution action.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">The trial court reasoned that defendants Golden Bear Insurance Company (Golden Bear) and Jones &amp; Dyer, Golden Bear\u2019s counsel in the underlying lawsuit, had probable cause to sue Puryear personally because of confusion over the correct individual or entity legally responsible for the acts of an insurance brokerage firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Puryear contends the trial court erred in finding probable cause. We agree. The test is whether a reasonable attorney would have thought the claim objectively tenable. The record at most suggests there was liability on the part of an insurance brokerage doing business as a corporation in which Puryear had been a corporate officer and had owned stock. There is no evidence from which the defendants could have inferred that Puryear was personally liable for the acts of the brokerage. In these circumstances no reasonable attorney would have thought the claim against Puryear was tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">We will reverse the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b902-13\">In August 1987, Puryear and Allen Spangenberg incorporated A &amp; L Insurance Services, Inc., a California corporation, to conduct business as an excess and surplus lines insurance broker. They owned all the stock and were the officers and directors of the corporation. They observed all of the requisite formalities for conducting the corporation, and all of its business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>transactions were conducted under the corporate name. The corporation did business with Golden Bear only under its corporate name.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Early in 1993, Puryear and Spangenberg decided to sell their interests in the corporation. They sold all of their shares, half in February 1993 and the other half in September 1993, to Terry Suzuki, represented by Attorney Mark Wood. The corporate records and share certificates were delivered to Wood in September 1993. In November 1993, Wood, as general counsel for the corporation, filed with the Secretary of State the annual corporation statement under Corporations Code section 1502, listing the new officers and directors and Suzuki as chief executive officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">In March 1993, George Makris sued Golden Bear and 20 Doe defendants, alleging that Golden Bear wrongfully failed to pay fire insurance proceeds. The complaint in pertinent part alleged the following. Before the fire that gave rise to this action, Makris requested through \u201cA &amp; L Insurance,\u201d an authorized agent of Golden Bear, that his fire insurance coverage under a Golden Bear policy be increased. Golden Bear and \u201cA &amp; L Insurance\u201d told him that upon receipt of a letter, verifying that specified safety improvements were made, coverage would be increased. He made the improvements and sent the letter. The fire occurred. He submitted a claim. \u201cA &amp; L Insurance\u201d then told him that his coverage had not been increased and Golden Bear refused to pay benefits required under the increased coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Sometime before December 23, 1993, Golden Bear filed a cross-complaint in the Makris action. On that date it filed an amended cross-complaint naming \u201cA &amp; L Insurance Services\u201d and Roe defendants 6-10 as cross-defendants from whom equitable indemnity was sought. The amended cross-complaint describes \u201cA &amp; L Insurance Services\u201d as \u201ca business organization, the exact legal description of which is presently unknown.\u201d It alleges that the cross-defendants were negligent in transmitting Makris\u2019s letter verifying the safety improvements to Golden Bear.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">In January 1994, Golden Bear filed an amended complaint. It added A &amp; L Insurance Services, Inc., as a named defendant and used that appellation in the allegations previously made concerning \u201cA &amp; L Insurance Services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">In some manner not explained in the record, counsel for Makris conversed with Suzuki\u2019s counsel, Wood, in January 1994. Wood said that he represented A &amp; L Insurance Services, Inc., that L. Scott Puryear<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Melody Packet were employees of the corporation and he agreed to produce them for a deposition. However, they did not appear at the scheduled time.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>In some manner not explained in the record, Golden Bear took \u201cA &amp; L Insurance Services\u201d default. On March 17, 1994, Wood faxed a letter to Sandra Sava, counsel for Golden Bear. The letter asserts that Wood had been mistaken, and that L. Scott Puryear and Melody Packet were \u201cnot employed at the present time by A &amp; L.\u201d On March 25, 1994, Sava had a telephone conversation with Wood, who requested that the default be set aside. Sava said she would probably not agree to that in light of Wood\u2019s failure to produce L. Scott Puryear and Melody Packet for depositions. Wood told her that \u201cA &amp; L Insurance Services had been sold by Mr. Spangenburg <em>[sic] </em>and Mr. Puryear to new owners in the Fall of 1993.\u201d Sava declared that Wood said Spangenberg and Puryear were no longer involved with \u201cthe new A &amp; L Insurance Services\u201d and suggested that Golden Bear \u201chad sued the wrong A &amp; L entity.\u201d Sava\u2019s handwritten notes from the conversation include the following: \u201cSold their shares to Suzuki.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Sava further declared that: \u201cPrior to April 4, 1994, at my request, a law clerk in our office conducted some research from the Department of Insurance regarding A &amp; L entities and Puryear.\u201d An undated memorandum from the law clerk to Sava, in pertinent part on the subject of \u201cDept, of Insurance Investigation of A &amp; L Services, Inc.,\u201d reads as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-5\">\u201cA &amp; L Insurance Services, Inc. 4525 Wilshire Blvd Los Angeles CA 90010</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-6\">\u201cA &amp; L is licensed as a Fire &amp; Casualty Broker-Agent, surplus broker and special surplus broker. . . . [\u00b6] In addition to Puryear and Spangenberg, A &amp; L endorsees include: Mia C. Chang, Patrick J. Omeirs and Joseph Trocino. [\u00b6] Spangenberg &amp; Puryear are no longer active/licensed in surplus &amp; special, only active in Fire &amp; Casualty w/A&amp;L. [\u00b6] When I searched under Spangenberg &amp; Puryear individually, I discovered through the department\u2019s \u2018organization endorsements\u2019 files that each is presently active w/A&amp;L Fire &amp; Casualty and with another company . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">On April 8, 1994, Golden Bear amended its cross-complaint again, naming as Roe 6: \u201cLee Puryear, aka L. Scott Puryear, individually, and dba A &amp; L Insurance Services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">On April 11, 1994, Sava wrote a letter to Wood asking when the sale of \u201cA &amp; L Insurance Services\u201d occurred, whether all assets and liabilities were transferred, whether any prior owners still have an interest in \u201cthe existing company,\u201d and what is the present legal status of \u201cA &amp; L.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">On May 4, 1994, Sava sent a letter to Golden Bear in which she asserted, among other things, that Wood \u201cdenied that the new A &amp; L assumed any of the former A &amp; L\u2019s liabilities . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>On December 17, 1994, Golden Bear caused a summons on the cross-complaint to be served on Puryear. Trial was scheduled in the Makris case for March 6, 1995. On March 2, 1995, Golden Bear settled with Makris, paying him $175,000. Golden Bear then sought to recoup this sum or some portion of it from Puryear. When Puryear refused to settle, Golden Bear ultimately dismissed its cross-complaint against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Puryear then filed the complaint initiating this malicious prosecution action against Golden Bear and Jones &amp; Dyer. The defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that Golden Bear\u2019s indemnity action against Puryear was filed (and presumably maintained) with probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">In addition to the foregoing background, Puryear contended that summary judgment was inappropriate in light of defendants\u2019 responses to various discovery requests, to wit: Golden Bear admitted that it had never done business with Puryear as an individual and knew that he was an officer of A &amp; L Insurance Services, Inc. In response to an interrogatory asking on what theory and factual investigation the allegation of Puryear\u2019s negligence was based, Golden Bear responded that it did not know.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">As to Jones &amp; Dyer, Gregory Dyer and Sava conceded in deposition testimony that they had no evidence to support a theory of alter ego liability against Puryear and failed to identify any evidence to support Puryear\u2019s personal liability for the shortcomings of A &amp; L Insurance Services, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Golden Bear and Jones &amp; Dyer responded that the opposition to the summary judgment was' misdirected. Their claim was succinctly stated as follows. \u201cThrough interaction with Mark Wood, and investigation at the Department of Insurance, facts developed suggesting the A &amp; L Insurance Services, Inc. entity which had appeared in the action was not the proper entity. Therefore, it raised the reasonable probability the old A &amp; L entity and potentially its individual officers and shareholders could be responsible for the acts of that entity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">The trial court granted summary judgment because the facts adduced by the defendants \u201cestablish there was a legally tenable claim against A &amp; L Insurance Services and sufficient confusion in the minds of defendants over the correct individual or entity which was legally responsible for the acts of the former A &amp; L Insurance Services, to constitute probable cause for filing the cross-complaint against plaintiff as an individual at the time the cross-complaint was filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">The trial court summarized its reasoning as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>\u201cOne of my favorite quotes was the old Dick Butkus quote and it\u2019s rather famous. When they asked him what his philosophy was as a defensive back, he said, I go through the line. I tackle the entire back field and then I throw them away one at a time until I find the guy with the ball. And in some cases in litigation, that also is necessary. The fact that the entire back field got tackled doesn\u2019t mean that he had no probable cause to tackle any given one of them under some circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-4\">\u201cHere, where you\u2019re getting conflicting information, you got to sort through it somehow. And the attorney who waits until he or she has absolutely clear in their mind exactly who the right entity to sue is may sometimes miss the statute and then face the possibility of being sued for professional negligence by his or her own client.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Puryear appeals from the ensuing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Puryear contends the trial court erred in concluding defendants had probable cause to sue him personally because there was no objective, reasonable basis in the facts known to Golden Bear and Jones &amp; Dyer for a belief that the claim against him in his personal capacity was tenable. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">\u201cUnder the governing authorities, in order to establish a cause of action for malicious prosecution of either a criminal or civil proceeding, a plaintiff must demonstrate \u2018that the prior action (1) was commenced by or at the direction of the defendant and was pursued to a legal termination in his, plaintiff\u2019s, favor [citations]; (2) was brought without probable cause [citations]; and (3) was initiated with malice [citations].\u2019 <em>(Bertero </em>v. <em>National General Corp. </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 43, 50 [118 Cal.Rptr. 184, 529 P.2d 608, 65 A.L.R.3d 878]; Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 653-681B.)\u201d <em>(Sheldon Appel Co. </em>v. <em>Albert &amp; Oliker </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 863, 871-872 [254 Cal.Rptr. 336, 765 P.2d 498],)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">The standard of probable cause is \u201cwhether any reasonable attorney would have thought the claim tenable . . . .\u201d <em>(Sheldon Appel Co. </em>v. <em>Albert &amp; Oliker, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 886.) \u201c[T]he probable cause element calls on the trial court to make an objective determination of the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s conduct, i.e., to determine whether, on the basis of the facts known to the defendant, the institution of the prior action was legally tenable. The resolution of that question of law calls for the application of an objective standard to the facts on which the defendant acted.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 878, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>italics omitted.) \u201c[I]t does <em>not </em>include a determination whether the attorney subjectively believed that the prior claim was legally tenable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 881, italics added.) In this respect, <em>Sheldon Appel </em>overruled the earlier leading case, <em>Tool Research &amp; Engineering Corp. </em>v. <em>Henigson </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 675 [120 Cal.Rptr. 291]. However, the term \u201clegally tenable,\u201d employed in <em>Sheldon Appel </em>to describe probable cause, is derived from <em>Tool Research </em>at page 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The question in this case is the meaning of the term \u201clegally tenable\u201d when the issue is whether the person who filed the allegedly malicious action had sufficient facts to warrant that action. Specifically, the question is whether an action is \u201clegally tenable\u201d when a prospective plaintiff and counsel do not have evidence sufficient to uphold a favorable judgment or information affording an inference that such evidence can be obtained for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\"><em>Tool Research </em>and the earlier California case law on which it relies suggest (albeit without discussion) that an action is not legally tenable unless it is founded on facts sufficient to support a reasonable belief that the evidence will sustain a favorable judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">\u201c \u2018Probable cause\u2019 has sometimes been defined as \u2018reasonable cause\u2019; and in the case of both civil and criminal prosecutions has been further defined to be an honest suspicion or belief on the part of the instigator thereof, founded upon facts sufficiently strong to warrant the average person in believing the charge to be true.\u201d <em>(Murdock </em>v. <em>Gerth </em>(1944) 65 Cal.App.2d 170, 178-179 [150 P.2d 489].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">Under this standard probable cause requires evidence sufficient to prevail in the action or at least information reasonably warranting an inference there is such evidence. (See generally, Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 662, and com. g, pp. 425-426.) A lack of probable cause may arise from an insufficiency in the facts or the law. (See Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 662, 675.) The Restatement Second of Torts section 662, comment g, page 426, describes the principal kind of insufficiency in the facts applicable to this case: \u201cA third type of mistake occurs when the accuser, having no personal knowledge of the actual conduct of the accused, knows or is credibly informed of circumstances that lead him mistakenly to believe that the accused has acted or failed to act in a particular manner. Whether this knowledge or information is enough to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>give the accuser probable cause for initiating . . . proceedings depends upon whether the inferences of fact that he draws from the data before him are such as a reasonable man would draw.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">As related, the trial court was of the view that a less stringent standard of \u201clegally tenable\u201d should be applied. Under that standard, a prospective plaintiff would require something less than substantial evidence or the likelihood of substantial evidence to support the cause of action in order to justify filing the action. Because the earlier California case law does not squarely address this prospect and because there is a less stringent standard in some other jurisdictions, we will examine it.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">The majority rule related in Restatement Second of Torts section 675,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is significantly less stringent in an action for malicious prosecution when the underlying action is a civil proceeding. \u201cOne who takes an active part in the initiation, continuation or procurement of civil proceedings against another has probable cause for doing so if he reasonably believes in the existence of the facts upon which the claim is based, and . . . [\u00b6] (a) correctly or reasonably believes that under those facts the claim <em>may </em>be valid under the applicable law . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) Comment d explains the basis for this latitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\"><em>\u201cd. Points of. difference between criminal and civil proceedings. </em>In one particular a private prosecutor\u2019s reasonable belief in the guilt of the accused differs from the reasonable belief of one who initiates private civil proceedings against another. A private prosecutor does not have reasonable grounds for believing that the accused has conducted himself in a particular manner, if he merely entertains a suspicion even though he reasonably believes it may be verified upon further investigation. (See Comment <em>c </em>on \u00a7 662). On the other hand, when the proceedings are civil, while the person initiating them cannot have a reasonable belief in the existence of the facts on which the proceedings are based if he knows that the alleged facts are not true and his claim is based on false testimony, it is enough if their existence is not certain but he believes that he can establish their existence to the satisfaction of court and jury. In a word, the initiator of private civil proceedings need not have the same degree of certainty as to the relevant facts that is required of a private prosecutor of criminal proceedings. In many cases civil proceedings, to be effective, must be begun before all of the relevant facts can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>ascertained to a reasonable degree of certainty. To put the initiator of civil proceedings to a greater risk of liability would put an undesirable burden upon those whose rights cannot be otherwise effectively enforced.\u201d (Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 675, com. d, p. 459.)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">We are not persuaded by this comment to depart from the California cases which have applied the more stringent test of probable cause to malicious civil prosecution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Restatement rule is predicated on a dilemma to prosecute or perish that is obviated by an unusual feature of California procedural law. That feature is the unique broad scope of our fictitious defendant practice under Code of Civil Procedure section 474. (See Hogan, <em>California\u2019s Unique Doe Defendant Practice: A Fiction Stranger Than Truth </em>(1977) 30 Stan.L.Rev. 51.)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Under Code of Civil procedure section 474, a plaintiff who lacks sufficient evidence to prove a cause of action, or information warranting an inference that such evidence will be obtained, can \u201cotherwise effectively enforce its rights\u201d by use of a Doe allegation, or, as in this case, a Roe allegation. (See, e.g., 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Pleading, \u00a7 445, pp. 540-541.) This avoids the need for \u201cthe harmful practice in all litigation of requiring that all persons who might conceivably have some connection with the lawsuit be specifically named . . . .\u201d <em>(Munoz </em>v. <em>Purdy </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 942, 947-948 [154 Cal.Rptr. 472].) A prospective California plaintiff need not tackle the entire back field to ascertain the likely defendants. Since the reason for the Restatement rule does not apply to this case, neither does the rule. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 3510.)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Under the California probable cause rule an action against Puryear is tenable only if the facts known to Golden Bear and Jones &amp; Dyer afforded an inference that he personally was negligent in communicating between Golden Bear and Makris, or that A &amp; L Insurance Services, Inc., was not a corporation at that time, or that the corporate veil could be pierced as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the respondents, there is nothing in the record which affords such an inference. There is no information suggesting that Puryear was personally involved in the Makris matter, or that he satisfied any criterion for piercing the corporate veil. As to corporate status, there is nothing which affords an inference that A &amp; L Insurance Services, Inc., was not a corporation at the pertinent time.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Golden Bear admitted it was aware Puryear was a corporate officer. The client-serving assertion of Wood to Sava that A &amp; L Insurance Services, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>Inc., had not assumed liabilities in the sale does not suffice. The statement is a legal conclusion, from a dubious source, and, in any event, any aspersion on the corporate status of what Sava mischaracterizes as the former A &amp; L entity is utterly belied by Wood\u2019s factual statement that the transfer was accomplished by a sale of stock. The information suggesting that Puryear was still listed by the Department of Insurance as an \u201cendorsee\u201d of A &amp; L Insurance Services, Inc., has no tendency to suggest that the entity is anything but a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">For all the foregoing reasons, the trial court erred in finding that Golden Bear and Jones &amp; Dyer had probable cause. Their self-proclaimed \u201cconfusion\u201d is immaterial to probable cause vel non. The proverbial reasonable attorney would not think a claim manifestly unsupported by essential evidence or information reasonably affording an inference that such evidence could be procured is tenable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">The summary judgment is reversed.
