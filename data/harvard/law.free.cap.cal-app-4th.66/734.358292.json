(Lab. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 3852.) We conclude the trial court violated section 3860, subdivision (b) by distributing half of the $200,000 settlement proceeds to the officers under equitable apportionment principles. We reject, however, City\u2019s contention the error automatically entitles it to the entire settlement amount. While the court must adhere to the statutory scheme in allocating settlement proceeds subject to an employer\u2019s reimbursement rights, the employer\u2019s priority is subject to certain exceptions. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand for a new evidentiary hearing and redistribution of the proceeds in conformance with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">In 1994, Gapusan and McGee were seriously injured when a drunk driver, David Patrick Jay, caused his pickup truck to collide with their patrol car. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>As a result, McGee was forced to retire and Gapusan was alternately off work and limited to light duty for more than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Gapusan and McGee brought this action for personal injuries. Their wives, Victoria Gapusan and Kattie McGee,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> joined and sought damages for loss of consortium.  City intervened, seeking reimbursement for workers\u2019 compensation benefits it paid Gapusan and McGee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Jay had liability insurance of $100,000 per injured person and apparently no ability to pay additional damages.  He filed a cross-complaint in interpleader and the carrier deposited $200,000 with the court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> City and plaintiffs accepted the policy limits in settlement of their respective claims against Jay, but failed to agree on any apportionment of the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">In a hearing to resolve the matter, City claimed entitlement to the full $200,000 because the total benefits it paid the officers exceeded that amount. City declared McGee and Gapusan received compensation of $38,254.72 and $42,840.98, respectively. Additionally, McGee was entitled to disability retirement of 50 percent of his annual salary for life, adjusted for inflation, at a cost of $268,287.79 to City.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Plaintiffs argued the court may equitably apportion settlement funds when they are insufficient to fully reimburse the employer and pay the employee for pain and suffering and other losses not covered by the workers\u2019 compensation system. Gapusan and McGee submitted medical records and attested to their injuries and disabilities, and a certified public accountant declared McGee\u2019s economic losses not covered by workers\u2019 compensation exceeded $503,546.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">The court agreed with plaintiffs\u2019 view and awarded City $100,000 and each plaintiff couple $50,000. Judgment was entered accordingly and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AXG\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Plaintiffs urge us to apply an abuse of discretion standard. This case, however, involves the interpretation and application of statutes in the context of undisputed facts. We thus review the purely legal questions de novo. <em>(Insurance Co. of North America </em>v. <em>T.L.C. Lines, Inc. </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 90, 94 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 542].)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">\u201cOur primary aim in construing any law is to determine the legislative intent. [Citation.] In doing so we look first to the words of the statute, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Committee of Seven Thousand </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 491, 501 [247 Cal.Rptr. 362, 754 P.2d 708].) \u201cStatutes must be given a fair and reasonable interpretation, with due regard to the language used and the purpose sought to be accomplished.\u201d <em>(Home Depot, U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Contractors\u2019 State License Bd. </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1592, 1601 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 302].)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">II. <em>The Court Erred in Equitably Apportioning the Settlement Proceeds</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">City contends the trial court violated the Labor Code by distributing the settlement proceeds on equitable grounds. Section 3860, subdivision (b) states: \u201cExcept as provided in Section 3859 [inapplicable here], <em>the entire amount of such settlement, with or without suit, is subject to the employer\u2019s full claim for reimbursement </em>for compensation he has paid or [may] become obligated to pay and any special damages to which he may be entitled under Section 3852, together with expenses and attorney fees, if any, subject to the limitations in this section set forth.\u201d (Italics added.) As discussed more fully later, prior to the employer\u2019s reimbursement, the court is required to determine the parties\u2019 entitlement to reasonable attorney fees and other litigation expenses. (\u00a7 3860, subds. (c)-(f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Plaintiffs counter that under common law principles of equitable subrogation, the trial court may ignore the plain language of section 3860, subdivision (b) and apportion inadequate settlement proceeds so the employee recovers something for pain and suffering or other damages not covered by workers\u2019 compensation law. They point out that the Labor Code\u2019s subrogation provisions are a legislative recognition of the common law doctrine of equitable subrogation, and therefore they should be construed in accordance therewith. <em>(Breese </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 923, 930 [176 Cal.Rptr. 791, 633 P.2d 987].) Plaintiffs rely on automobile insurance cases holding common law equity principles prohibit a carrier from recovering payments made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>to its insured from a third party tortfeasor, where the insured had not yet been made whole. <em>(Sapiano </em>v. <em>Williamsburg Nat. Ins. Co. </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 533, 536-537 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 659]; <em>United Pacific-Reliance Ins. Companies </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 72, 77 [189 Cal.Rptr. 323]; <em>Security Nat. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hand </em>(1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 227, 231-233 [107 Cal.Rptr. 439].)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">We are unpersuaded.  Where the Legislature has \u201cminutely described the limitations and exceptions dealing with a given subject matter,\u201d we may assume it intended to supplant any relevant common law. <em>(In re Marriage of Plescia </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 252, 261 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 120].)  The Legislature has clearly provided that where, as here, a third party settlement includes the employer\u2019s reimbursable benefits, the employer\u2019s right of reimbursement takes first and full priority after the payment of litigation expenses and attorney fees, where appropriate. (\u00a7 3860, subds. (b)-(f); <em>Board of Administration </em>v. <em>Glover </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 906, 912-914 [196 Cal.Rptr. 330, 671 P.2d 834]; <em>Marrujo </em>v. <em>Hunt </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 972, 978 [138 Cal.Rptr. 220]; 1 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers\u2019 Compensation (rev. 2d ed. 1997) \u00a7 11.25[2], pp. 11-97, 11-98.) Any common law principles suggesting a different result have thus been abrogated. As another court has observed, there is \u201ca clear legislative policy militating in favor of reimbursement whenever possible.\u201d <em>(Abdala </em>v. <em>Aziz, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.4th at p. 377.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">We also reject plaintiffs\u2019 assertion the clause \u201csubject to\u201d in section 3860, subdivision (b) may be interpreted to give the court discretion to equitably apportion inadequate settlement funds. The phrase \u201csubject to\u201d means \u201csubordinate to.\u201d (See <em>Swan Magnetics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1504, 1510 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 541].) \u201cSubordinate\u201d means \u201cinferior in order, nature, dignity, power, importance, or the like . . . .\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dict. (6th ed. 1990) p. 1426, col. 1.) On its face, subdivision (b) of section 3860 gives the employer\u2019s reimbursement claim priority, after payment of litigation costs and attorney fees where appropriate. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument the provision is applicable only where settlement proceeds are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>adequate to fully compensate employer and employee is similarly unavailing. The implicit purpose of section 3860 is to prioritize payments when settlement funds are insufficient to satisfy all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">In sum, we conclude the court erred in equitably distributing a portion of the settlement proceeds to Gapusan and McGee. We reject, however, City\u2019s request that we merely award it the entire $200,000 in settlement funds. Its reimbursement right is subject to other considerations, discussed below, requiring a new evidentiary hearing and the court\u2019s redistribution of the proceeds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">III. <em>Loss of Consortium</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">A wife\u2019s loss of consortium is comprised of her \u201cown physical, psychological and emotional pain and anguish which results when her husband is negligently injured to the extent that he is no longer capable of providing the love, affection, companionship, comfort or sexual relations concomitant with a normal married life. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Lantis </em>v. <em>Condon </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 152, 157 [157 Cal.Rptr. 22].) While triggered by the spouse\u2019s injury, a loss of consortium claim is separate and distinct, and not merely derivative or collateral to the spouse\u2019s cause of action. <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 148, 162 [233 Cal.Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743]; <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 382, 406 [115 Cal.Rptr. 765, 525 P.2d 669]; <em>Lantis </em>v. <em>Condon, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.3d at p. 157.)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Nothing in section 3860, subdivision (b) indicates the Legislature intended to deprive an employee\u2019s spouse of any recovery for separate loss of consortium claims where, as here, there is an unallocated settlement with the third party tortfeasor. Further, we cannot imply such intent from the workers\u2019 compensation scheme. The primary purpose of allowing an employer to obtain reimbursement is to prevent the employee\u2019s double recovery. (S<em>ea-Land Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 76, 82 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 190, 925 P.2d 1309]; <em>O\u2019Dell </em>v. <em>Freightliner Corp. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 645, 653 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 774].) A spouse\u2019s retention of settlement funds for loss of consortium damages, for which an employer has no liability <em>(Gillespie </em>v. <em>Northridge Hosp. Foundation </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 867, 870-871 [98 Cal.Rptr. 134]), does not violate the rule against double recovery. Put another way, an employer simply has no subrogation rights to a spouse\u2019s loss of consortium claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>While \u201cjoinder in one action is \u2018the preferred method for asserting a claim of loss of consortium . . . .\u2019 [citation], an action for loss of consortium can be maintained independently of the action by the physically injured spouse. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Evans </em>v. <em>Dayton Hudson Corp. </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 49, 54-55 [285 Cal.Rptr. 550].)  Had Victoria and Kattie filed a separate action, City obviously could not have intervened or obtained any reimbursement from a judgment or settlement. The fact that they voluntarily joined their causes of action with those of their husbands, and agreed to a global settlement, should not change the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">An employer is entitled to press its reimbursement claims only against a judgment or settlement in favor of its employee.  Where a settlement is in satisfaction of both the employee\u2019s claims and independent claims, such as ones for loss of consortium, the court must first ascertain the damages to which each plaintiff is entitled and then apportion the settlement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See <em>Eli </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 901, 905 [235 Cal.Rptr. 704].) In <em>Eli, </em>the court held the employer did not have priority where a $50,000 insurance policy limit was paid in satisfaction of the independent claims of the workers\u2019 compensation carrier and the employee\u2019s parents, nondependent heirs who had wrongful death claims under Code of Civil Procedure former section 377 (now section 377.60).  In that instance, the employer and the heirs enjoyed equal priorities.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such is the case here with City and the officers\u2019 wives.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">City, in fact, essentially concedes the trial court had authority to allocate a portion of the settlement funds to Victoria and Kattie for their loss of consortium claims. It complains, however, that they failed to present any evidence in support. This is correct, but such evidence may be submitted on remand.  \u201c \u2018[A]n unqualified reversal remands the cause for a new trial [citation], and places the parties in the trial court in the same position as if the cause had never been tried, with the exception that the opinion of the court on appeal must be followed so far as applicable.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Hall </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d.377, 381 [289 P.2d 431].)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">IV. <em>Litigation Expenses and Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">On remand, the court must also determine whether attorney fees and other litigation costs should be deducted from the settlement proceeds before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>City is reimbursed.  Ordinarily, parties are responsible for their own attorney fees. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021.) \u201cBut an established exception to this rule is the so-called \u2018common fund doctrine.\u2019 [Citation.] That is, a party who expends attorney fees in winning a lawsuit which creates a fund from which others derive benefits may require those passive beneficiaries to bear a fair share of the litigation costs. The amount of the judgment owing to the passive beneficiary may be reduced to compensate the active litigant for his [or her] attorney fees. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Walsh </em>v. <em>Woods </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1273, 1276 [232 Cal.Rptr. 629].)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Under section 3860, the trial court must set reasonable attorney fees and costs based on efforts which created a common fund.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n                   Where settlement is effected solely through the efforts of the employee\u2019s attorney, the employer is a passive beneficiary and its reimbursement rights are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>subject to reasonable fees and expenses for \u201cservices in securing and effecting settlement for the benefit of both the employer and the employee.\u201d (\u00a7 3860, subd. (c).) \u201c[I]f the employer receives his fair share of the recovery, he must bear his fair share of the cost of the recovery.\u201d <em>(Quinn </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 176.) Where the settlement is insufficient to satisfy the employer\u2019s claim and compensate counsel, the attorney fees and costs take priority. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 175, fn. 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The same standard is applied where settlement is achieved solely through the efforts of the employer\u2019s attorney. (\u00a7 3860, subd. (d).) \u201cAfter fixing the amount of the attorney fee award, the trial court must apportion the fee award between the parties benefitted by the recovery; in doing so, the trial court must decide to what extent the passive beneficiary should contribute to the litigation expenses and fees which created the recovery fund. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Walsh </em>v. <em>Woods, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.3d 1273, 1277.)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The common fund doctrine, however, is inapplicable where there are no passive beneficiaries. Thus, where both parties\u2019 attorneys \u201cactively participated\u201d in effecting the settlement, section 3860 provides that the fee awards of each attorney are \u201cbased upon the respective services rendered in securing and effecting settlement for the benefit of the party represented.\u201d (\u00a7 3860, subd. (e).) \u201cAccordingly, the amount of the award to each attorney will be based on the efforts of the attorney for his own client. The doctrine of apportionment does not apply therein; each attorney fee award comes out of each party\u2019s own share of the recovery. \u2018[W]hen each party separately employs his own attorney ... the statute direct[s] the court to relinquish this duty of equitable apportionment ....

For instance, if the damages of an employee and independent claimant are $200,000 and $50,000, respectively, the employee is allocated 80 percent of the settlement and the other claimant is entitled to 20 percent of it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b613-11\"> As City points out, <em>Eli </em>concerned section 3852\u2019s express direction to the trial court to determine the \u201crights of the heirs of an employee claiming under Section [377.60] of the Code of Civil Procedure and the employer claiming pursuant to [this] section . . . .\u201d We reject the notion the court is unauthorized to apportion a settlement in any other context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b614-5\"> Section 3856 extends the common fund doctrine to recovery obtained by judgment, as opposed to settlement. Sections 3856 and 3860 codify identical results regarding the apportionment of attorney fees and other litigation costs. Opinions discussing 3856 are therefore applicable to the instant case. <em>(Quinn </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 162, 176, fn. 20 [124 Cal.Rptr. 1, 539 P.2d 761]; <em>Raisola </em>v. <em>Flower Street Ltd. </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1008, fn. 1 [252 Cal.Rptr. 726].)</p>\n<p id=\"ACJ\">Section 3860 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"A2q\">\u201c(c) Where settlement is effected, with or without suit, solely through the efforts of the employee\u2019s attorney, then prior to the reimbursement of the employer, as provided in subdivision (b) hereof, there shall be deducted from the amount of the settlement the reasonable expenses incurred in effecting such settlement, including costs of suit, if any, together with a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to be paid to the employee\u2019s attorney, for his [or her] services in securing and effecting settlement for the benefit of both the employer and the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ6g\">\u201c(d) Where settlement is effected, with or without suit, solely through the efforts of the employer\u2019s attorney, then, prior to the reimbursement of the employer as provided in subdivision (b) hereof, there shall be deducted from the amount of the settlement the reasonable expenses incurred in effecting such settlement, including costs of suit, if any, together with a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to be paid to the employer\u2019s attorney, for his [or her] services in securing and effecting settlement for the benefit of both the employer and the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"A5I\">\u201c(e) Where both the employer and the employee are represented by the same agreed attorney or by separate attorneys in effecting a settlement, with or without suit, prior to reimbursement of the employer, as provided in subdivision (b) hereof, there shall be deducted from the amount of the settlement the reasonable expenses incurred by both the employer and the employee or on behalf of either, including costs of suit, if any, together with reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to be paid to the respective attorneys for the employer and the employee, based upon the respective services rendered in securing and effecting settlement for the benefit of the party represented. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"AjYt\">\u201c(f) The amount of expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees referred to in this section shall, on settlement of suit, or on any settlement requiring court approval, be set by the court. . . .

That case, however, has been accepted for review and thus provides no precedent. The other case plaintiffs cite, <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 1260, 1262-1263 [257 Cal.Rptr. 813], is also inapplicable because the employer there was a passive beneficiary of plaintiff\u2019s efforts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b616-6\"> City asserts plaintiffs waived the right to attorney fees and other costs by failing to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 870(a)(1), which provides: \u201cA prevailing party who claims costs shall serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of mailing of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is first.\u201d The provision is inapplicable because there was no underlying judgment here from which to make a \u201cprevailing party\u201d determination. Rather, the proceeding below was limited to the court\u2019s consideration of how the settlement funds should be distributed under section 3860, which necessarily should have included a consideration of entitlement to attorney fees and costs. Obviously, no post-hearing motion for fees and costs is customarily required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\"> We note the record shows the settlement consisted of a $100,000 policy limit per injured person or couple. City paid $42,840.98 in benefits to Gapusan, thus it was entitled to reimbursement of no more than that amount from his share of the settlement proceeds. The court, however, at plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion, awarded City $50,000 reimbursement from Gapusan. On remand, City\u2019s reimbursement is confined to workers\u2019 compensation benefits actually incurred for Gapusan. Contrary to City\u2019s view, the mere fact that the officers joined in bringing suit does not expose Gapusan\u2019s settlement funds to City\u2019s reimbursement claims for McGee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b617-8\"> Because the benefits City paid McGee substantially exceed the settlement amount, he would receive no recovery from which his counsel\u2019s fees could be satisfied should the court determine City\u2019s attorney actively participated in the case. We also point out, however, that if the court determines City was a passive beneficiary of plaintiffs\u2019 efforts, McGee\u2019s counsel is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and litigation costs even though McGee would receive no net recovery. <em>(Crampton </em>v. <em>Takegoshi, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at pp. 318-319.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
