J.</author>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Ashley Chad Lockwood (appellant) appeals from an order denying his application for a certificate of rehabilitation pursuant to Penal Code section 4852.01.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s application, but the application was improperly denied with prejudice. Accordingly, we affirm, but remand with instructions to correct the order to deny the application <em>without </em>prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">II. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Appellant was convicted of his first felony, vehicle theft (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851), in February 1978. In March 1982, after appellant successfully completed probation, the conviction was dismissed. (\u00a7 1203.4.) On March 30, 1984, the court granted appellant\u2019s petition for a certificate of rehabilitation and pardon. (\u00a7 4852.01 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">In June and July 1990, appellant was convicted of grand theft (\u00a7 487, former subd. 1) and carrying a loaded firearm (\u00a7 12025, subd. (a)). After appellant again successfully completed probation, these convictions were dismissed in July 1993. (\u00a7 1203.4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">On November 5, 1996, appellant filed a petition for a second certificate of rehabilitation with the.Sonoma County Superior Court. (\u00a7 4852.01 et seq.) Oh June 24, 1997, the court conducted a hearing on the petition. The court had before it six responses to a form questionnaire sent out by the district attorney\u2019s office. The responses came from three \u201cfriends,\u201d his girlfriend, a friend and coworker, and a neighbor. They were attached to a page and a half \u201cReport of Investigation by District Attorney\u2019s Office\u201d signed by its chief criminal investigator. The responses from everyone except the neighbor, who happened to be an investigator for the district attorney\u2019s office, were favorable to appellant\u2019s character and trustworthiness. The investigator-neighbor, on the other hand, wrote that, based upon a few brief interactions with appellant, he could not recommend appellant because of his \u201cconvictions\u201d and \u201cmutual acquaintances in the business world of less than trustworthy actions\u201d and his \u201cless than reputable\u201d associates. The court denied appellant\u2019s petition, commenting that it had great respect for the investigator and could not ignore the strength of his comments because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>was in law enforcement and appellant\u2019s friends could only say he was a \u201cnice man.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Later in court that same day, appellant apparently angered the trial court by speaking out of turn. The court then denied the petition with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">On August 21, 1997, appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">This is a case of first impression. Our independent research has revealed no case that articulates the proper standard of review. However, it appears from the language, history, and statutory scheme of section 4852.01 et seq. that review of a grant or denial of a certificate of rehabilitation is confined to an abuse of discretion standard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Section 4852.01 was originally enacted in 1943 (Stats. 1943, ch. 400, \u00a7 1, p. 1922) and subsequently amended numerous times. There were three significant changes in the 1996 amendments that are pertinent to our discussion of appellate review. These changes mandated denial of a certificate to a person who has been convicted of one or more sex offenses involving a minor, extended the rehabilitation period from three to five years, and provided the court with discretion to grant a rehabilitation certificate if it finds that the petitioner has been rehabilitated and also to rescind such a certificate if the grantee has not maintained a specified standard of conduct. (See Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 2017 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.).) These changes reflected the Legislature\u2019s obvious intent to apply stricter standards to the application process, and to make it more difficult for ex-felons to receive and maintain certificates of rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The changes also reflected the Legislature\u2019s desire to provide the trial courts with the \u201cexpress discretion\u201d to grant or deny petitions for rehabilitation certificates. (Sen. Com. on Crim. Proc., Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2017 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) June 25, 1996; Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2017 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 16, 1996.) This intent is manifest in the changes the Legislature made to section 4852.13. Prior to its effective date of July 8, 1996, section 4852.13 stated in relevant part: \u201cIf, after hearing, the court finds that the petitioner has demonstrated by his course of conduct his rehabilitation and his fitness to exercise all of the civil and political rights of citizenship, the court <em>shall </em>make an order declaring that the petitioner has been rehabilitated . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1978, ch. 380, \u00a7 126, p. 1189, italics added.) The word \u201cshall\u201d was changed to \u201cmay\u201d by the 1996 amendments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Stats. 1996, ch. 981, \u00a7 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In general, of course, the word \u201cmay\u201d connotes a permissive standard as compared with the mandatory nature of the word \u201cshall.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>In re Richard E. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 349, 354 [146 Cal.Rptr. 604, 579 P.2d 495]; 1A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th ed. 1993) \u00a7\u00a7 25.03-25.04, pp. 449-454.) Further, even before the 1996 amendment, the statute had been interpreted as vesting discretion in the trial court. (See <em>Sovereign </em>v. <em>People </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 143, 152 [192 Cal.Rptr. 469].) Finally, the 1996 legislative history cited above manifests the Legislature\u2019s intention to, among other things, make clear that trial courts had discretion on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">We cannot and will not disturb the lower court\u2019s decision on appeal absent a clear abuse of that discretion. And we cannot find that the lower court abused its discretion unless such an abuse is \u201cmanifest\u201d and results in a \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Nicolaus </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 551, 578 [286 Cal.Rptr. 628, 817 P.2d 893].)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">B. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Denying Appellant\u2019s Application for a Certificate of Rehabilitation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Appellant argues that the court abused its discretion per se because there was <em>no </em>evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s denial of the petition. This argument is simply untenable in light of the negative recommendation from a district attorney\u2019s investigator that was before the court. Because there was clearly <em>some </em>evidence present in the record, this argument merits no further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">In the alternative, appellant argues that, even if there was some evidence, the court gave too much weight to the investigator-neighbor\u2019s negative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>comments without conducting a sufficient probe into the source of the allegations or allowing appellant to correct any misstatements. This argument is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">In general, in order to successfully petition a court for a rehabilitation certificate, a person shall, during a period of five years after he is released from custody, \u201clive an honest and upright life, shall conduct himself . . . with sobriety and industry, shall exhibit a good moral character, and shall conform to and obey the laws of the land.\u201d (\u00a7 4852.05.) Section 4852.13, as discussed above, gives courts the express discretion to decide whether a petitioner has demonstrated to its satisfaction, his \u201ccourse of conduct[,] his . . . rehabilitation and his . . . fitness to exercise all of the civil and political rights of citizenship.\u201d (\u00a7 4852.13.) In addition, a court may, but is not mandated to, require \u201ctestimony as it deems necessary\u201d and an investigative report from the district attorney of the petitioner and his residence, in addition to any documentary evidence a petitioner presents. (\u00a7\u00a7 4852.1 and 4852.12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Here, the court was presented with an investigative report which included questionnaire responses from a number of appellant\u2019s friends, a coworker, and a neighbor who happened to be a district attorney investigator. The responses from his five friends and coworker, while positive, were pro forma and cursory and included no \u201ccustomized\u201d comments regarding appellant. The investigator-neighbor, in contrast, responded to the same form questionnaire by both grading appellant as \u201cpoor\u201d for \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d and, more importantly, adding a handwritten notation to the effect that he could not recommend appellant\u2019s application due to his belief that appellant was not to be trusted and had \u201cless than reputable\u201d associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">At the hearing on his petition for a certificate of rehabilitation, appellant supplied additional information to the court about his employment history and his friends\u2019 professional backgrounds, and attempted to mitigate the investigator\u2019s negative remarks. No additional testimony was provided or requested at the hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The court found the investigator\u2019s comments worthy of taking at \u201cface value\u201d and gave great weight to them. The court explained that, because the investigator was skilled in the area of law enforcement, a comment that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>strong was too important to be ignored. By way of contrast, the court also noted that, at most, appellant\u2019s friends were only able to say that he was a \u201cnice man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the court relied on \u201cinconsequential and unsupported statements\u201d is not supported by the record. The record demonstrates that the court relied on the evidence it deemed most credible. Moreover, and contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, the statute does not require the court to conduct a further inquiry or verify these statements because it was satisfied with the evidence already presented. (\u00a7\u00a7 4852.1 and 4852.12.) Finally, and although not articulated by the court, it could well have had in mind that this was appellant\u2019s \u201csecond time around\u201d on the certificate of rehabilitation route. Based upon this record, we find that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">C. <em>The Trial Court Improperly Denied Appellant\u2019s Application With Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Appellant contends that the court impermissibly denied his petition with prejudice. The record indicates that the court initially denied appellant\u2019s petition without prejudice, and then changed its order after appellant, while represented by counsel, spoke directly to the court during further proceedings on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">It should first be noted that section 4852.01 et seq. does not provide for a petition to be denied <em>with prejudice. </em>Nor does there appear to be any other statute that specifically authorizes a court to deny this type of petition with prejudice. However, we are guided by those cases discussing the general inherent power of courts to dismiss a claim and the limitations placed upon them when dismissing a claim with prejudice. <em>(Lyons </em>v. <em>Wickhorst </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 911, 915-917 [231 Cal.Rptr. 738, 727 P.2d 1019] <em>(Lyons); </em>see also Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 581 et seq. [governing judgment of dismissals generally] and 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Proceedings Without Trial, \u00a7 252, pp. 670-671.)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">\u201cIn the absence of express statutory authority, a trial court may, under certain circumstances, invoke its limited, inherent, discretionary power to dismiss claims with prejudice.\u201d <em>(Lyons, supra, 42 </em>Cal.3d at p. 915.) However, this inherent power to dismiss with prejudice is circumscribed. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In order to determine whether a plaintiff\u2019s actions warrant a dismissal of a claim with prejudice, a court must first \u201cdiscern whether the plaintiff\u2019s pattern of conduct was so \u2018severe [and] deliberate\u2019 as to constitute extreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>circumstances.\u201d <em>(Lyons, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 917, quoting <em>Wrenn </em>v. <em>American Cast Iron Pipe Co. </em>(5th Cir. 1978) 575 F.2d 544, 547.) Second, a court must \u201clook to see whether alternatives less severe than dismissal are available.\u201d <em>(Lyons, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 917.) \u201cThe \u2018 \u201csound exercise of discretion requires the judge to consider and use lesser sanctions\u201d \u2019 unless the court\u2019s authority cannot possibly be otherwise vindicated.\u201d (Ibid., quoting <em>Schenck </em>v. <em>Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., Inc. </em>(2d Cir. 1978) 583 F.2d 58, 60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">There is an even greater impetus for courts not to bar applicants for a certificate of rehabilitation from ever being able to petition in the future. Even if a petition is denied, a petitioner is not barred from filing a new claim in the event of \u201cchanged circumstances.\u201d In contrast, when a court denies a petition for a certificate of rehabilitation with prejudice, it has the much more drastic effect of barring an applicant from ever petitioning the court again, regardless of the applicant\u2019s future progress toward rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The overall goal of the statute to restore civil and political rights of citizenship to ex-felons who have proved their rehabilitation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 120, 129-130 [221 Cal.Rptr. 382], and \u00a7 4852.17.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In light of this goal, a court should not deny this type of petition <em>with </em>prejudice. By definition, rehabilitation may well take years to achieve. The statute permits those who have been stripped of many of their civil and political rights to seek to have those rights restored. Those who so endeavor should be encouraged; denying a petition for a certificate of rehabilitation with prejudice works in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Here, appellant merely spoke out in court while he was represented by his attorney, a deputy public defender. This may have been an annoyance to the court and, at most, bordered on contempt of court. However, it clearly did not rise to the level of \u201csevere\u201d and \u201cdeliberate\u201d conduct of \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d as is required to dismiss claims with prejudice. Nor did his behavior, warrant forever prohibiting him from seeking a certificate of rehabilitation. Thus, although the court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s petition for rehabilitation, the denial <em>with prejudice </em>was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>IV. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The order denying the certificate of rehabilitation is affirmed, but the cause is remanded to the trial court with directions to amend so much of the order as states it is \u201cwith prejudice\u201d to read \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Lambden, J., and Ruvolo, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-12\">All statutory references hereinafter are to the Penal Code, unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The court specifically stated: \u201cI\u2019ll be very candid, You know that Mr. Meese is a District Attorney Investigator, and I have great respect for Mr. Meese as do the other judges. And that\u2019s very important. And when he says something like that - it\u2019s not like he\u2019s a tree trimmer that has absolutely no knowledge about what goes on in the real world of law enforcement and crime. And when he makes statements like he made, I take that at face value. That\u2019s what he does for a living.</p>\n<p id=\"A6X\">\u201cTo be very candid, the artist can tell me what a nice man Mr. Lockwood is on that level, the grocery clerk can tell me what a nice man he is on that level.
