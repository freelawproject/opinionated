We find the trial court (Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff) was justified in revoking appellant\u2019s pro se status and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Since appellant\u2019s contention raises no trial issues it is unnecessary to detail the trial evidence. This synopsis will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">During a three-week period in May 1995 appellant committed a series of armed robberies and carjackings in Glendale and North Hollywood. Most occurred in underground residential garages. Appellant would confront the driver and passenger with a gun and take their purses, jewelry, money, and sometimes their car. The last robbery occurred May 23, 1995. Two days later, May 25, 1995, appellant was arrested in San Bernardino. In his possession were a gun and purses and jewelry belonging to the robbery victims. He was transported to the North Hollywood station and held in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Three days later, on May 28, 1995, appellant attempted to escape. When Officer Sara Delacerda opened his cell door appellant tried to grab her keys, pushed the door open, bumped her, causing her to fall, and ran toward a door leading to the main hallway. Another officer heard Officer Delacerda\u2019s cries for help and, with drawn gun, captured appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Appellant was placed in a rear felony cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">The next morning, May 29, 1995, an officer searched appellant\u2019s cell and discovered preparations for another escape attempt:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The bunk bed had been moved, the mattress ripped, the ceiling light removed and dismantled, and shoelaces created from sweatshirt strips.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">Felony charges were filed and on June 23, 1995, the matter was set for preliminary hearing. Appellant, represented by the public defender, made a <em>Marsden (People </em>v. <em>Marsden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44]) motion which the magistrate denied. Appellant then made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number><em>Faretta </em>motion but when appellant gave an indication he was merely dissatisfied with his present counsel, the magistrate denied the motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The hearing began but did not end that day. Appellant agreed the hearing could resume Monday, June 26, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">It did not do so. On June 26, 1995, when the magistrate said, \u201cWe will resume the preliminary hearing in this matter,\u201d appellant said \u201cNo.\u201d Appellant disrupted the proceeding by \u201ctalking to demons,\u201d claiming he saw nonexistent people, screaming and generally feigning mental illness<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> until the magistrate declared a doubt about appellant\u2019s competency (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1368) and suspended further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Resumption of the preliminary hearing was delayed almost four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The superior court having found appellant competent, the matter was returned to the magistrate on October 17, 1995, for completion of the preliminary hearing. Appellant again tried to disrupt the proceedings by claiming he was \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cready to go.\u201d But this time the magistrate observed: \u201cThe bailiff\u2019s report to the Court is that you were completely lucid downstairs and that somehow in the elevator right up from the first floor to the ninth floor, I guess maybe the altitude, but somehow in between there\u2014I believe that you are feigning\u2014that you are acting out is not genuine <em>[sic], </em>but just a subterfuge, and I find [you] competent and Judge Shabo found you sane and competent for these proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Appellant was held to answer, bail was set at $850,000, and arraignment in superior court was scheduled for October 31, 1995. It did not happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">On October 23, 1995, appellant escaped from the men\u2019s central jail by cutting the wire mesh on a roof and by using cut up sheets as a descending rope.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">Five days later, October 28, 1995, appellant arrived in Chicago where police arrested him on the bus. He had a gun in his bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">The arraignment was delayed six and one-half months.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">On May 10, 1996, when appellant appeared for arraignment he moved for a 30-day continuance. Superior Court Judge Michael Hoff granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>On June 10, 1996, appellant, represented by counsel, pleaded not guilty. Trial setting was scheduled for July 11, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">On July 11, 1996, when appellant\u2019s counsel informed the court \u201cWe\u2019d like to set the matter for a trial, your Honor,\u201d appellant immediately interrupted, stating: \u201cHold it. Excuse me, your Honor . . . .\u201d Appellant then conferred with his counsel who informed the trial court appellant wanted to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The court informed appellant of the risks of self-representation, inquired about his background, and then asked, \u201cWhen do you think you will be ready to go to trial?\u201d Appellant stated, \u201cAt this time I don\u2019t know\u201dand said he doubted he could be ready in 30 days. When the court asked him \u201cDo you think it\u2019s going to take you a year?\u201d appellant replied, \u201cI can\u2019t say yes or no . . .\u201d and \u201cit would be impossible for me to tell you, give you a time frame.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The prosecutor asked the court to consider all the delay appellant had already caused by feigning insanity during the preliminary hearing and later escaping before his superior court arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Before ruling, the court observed: \u201cThe question I have is whether you are going to be able to handle this in a timely fashion or whether this move or request on your part is simply to delay things.\u201d Again the court asked, \u201cCan you give me a ballpark estimate of when you are going to be ready to go to trial?\u201d Appellant declined to do so. The court asked if appellant could be ready for trial by the end of August and appellant said he wasn\u2019t sure but he\u2019d try. The court granted appellant\u2019s motion to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">On July 25, 1996, the court returned to the subject of when appellant would be ready for trial. Appellant said he had just started his review, had \u201cfound a small discrepancy in counts 16, 17, and 18\u201d (all involving one victim), and \u201cit could probably take me two more months just to review that particular case.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The following colloquy then ensued.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">\u201cThe Court: Give me a straight answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\">\u201cThe Defendant: About how long?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\">\u201cThe Court: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-13\">\u201cThe Defendant: In my estimate [sic] it will be over a year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The court stated that was \u201csimply too long\u201d and it was inclined to appoint counsel. Appellant remonstrated and the court set trial for September 9, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">On August 23, 1996, appellant moved for continuance. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">On August 30, 1996, appellant moved for a continuance. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">On September 5, 1996, appellant moved for a continuance. The court asked \u201chow much\u201d and appellant said \u201cAt this time 60 days.\u201d The court then revoked appellant\u2019s pro se status and appointed counsel to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">The court explained its decision;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">\u201cI think that you are pulling a sham on the court system and it\u2019s just, your actions are just completely dilatory ... the People have a right to have a fair trial. The People have a right to have a trial within a certain reasonable time period although it\u2019s not statutory. And the court has a right to process cases in an orderly fashion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">\u201cI\u2019m convinced that as long as you are representing yourself, you will always come up with a different reason why not to go to trial. Therefore, I\u2019m going to revoke your pro per status status and the alternate public defender is going to be reappointed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">Thereafter appellant was represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">Of the twenty-five counts, appellant was found not guilty of seven and an eighth was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b93-14\">\u201cA defendant has a federal constitutional right to represent himself if he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so. <em>(Faretta </em>v. <em>California </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 806 [45 L.Ed.2d 562, 95 S.Ct. 2525].) In order to invoke an unconditional right of self-representation, the defendant must assert the right \u2018within a reasonable time prior to the commencement of trial.\u2019 A motion made after this period is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-15\">\u201cThe \u2018reasonable time\u2019 requirement is intended to prevent the defendant from misusing the motion to unjustifiably delay trial or obstruct the orderly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>administration of justice. \u2018For example, a defendant should not be permitted to wait until the day preceding trial before he moves to represent himself and requests a continuance in order to prepare for trial without some showing of reasonable cause for the lateness of the request. In such a case the motion for self-representation is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burton </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 843, 852-853 [258 Cal.Rptr. 184, 771 P.2d 1270].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The right of self-representation is not absolute. It \u201c \u2018is not a license to abuse the dignity of the courtroom\u2019 \u201d and \u201c[t]hus, \u2018the trial judge may terminate self-representation by a defendant who deliberately engages in serious and obstructionist misconduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 41, 115 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 554, 833 P.2d 561].)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">As our Supreme Court noted in <em>People </em>v. Clark, often a trial court dealing with a pro se defendant is presented \u201cwith a \u2018judgment call\u2019 under combat conditions upon which we may, and must, give deference to the trial court.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 41, 116.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">That was the case in <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>and that is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>the pro se defendant, who had been cross-examining a prosecution expert witness, refused to resume cross-examination and said he would remain mute for the rest of the trial. The court revoked his pro se status and had standby counsel resume the cross-examination for the remainder of the day. The next day, defendant having had a change of heart, the court reinstated his pro se status.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Clark contended his pro se status was improperly revoked because he had a right to conduct his defense by standing mute. The Supreme Court, while acknowledging he had such a right <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 114), rejected his claim. It held the trial court was empowered to determine defendant\u2019s motivation and sincerity. Defendant\u2019s threat to stand mute \u201cwas merely one of a series of attempts to manipulate or coerce the trial court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 115.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">\u201c \u2018Trial courts are not required to engage in game playing with cunning defendants who would present Hobson\u2019s choices.\u2019 <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>422 U.S. 806, held generally that a defendant may represent himself. It did not establish a game in which defendant can engage in a series of machinations, with one misstep by the court resulting in reversal of an otherwise fair trial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 115.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>also upheld the trial court\u2019s later and final termination of defendant\u2019s pro se status based upon the following colloquy: \u201cDefendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>told the court \u2018Your prejudices are running away with you\u2019 and accused the court of \u2018jumping to conclusions\u2019 and predetermining the case. When the court warned defendant about his behavior, defendant told it to \u2018stop that crap,\u2019 and accused the court of bias, of lying, and of having its mind made up \u2018from day one.\u2019 Defendant stated, \u2018This railroad train of yours is going to have to come to a screeching halt.\u2019 When the court once again warned defendant to behave or his in propria persona privileges would be revoked, defendant responded, \u2018are you trying to intimidate me? Well, you goddamn can\u2019t do that, flj] . . . [Wjill you just back off and do your job?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 41, stated, \u201cThe court was justified in concluding that defendant intentionally sought to disrupt and delay his trial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 117.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">As in <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>the instant record justifies the trial court\u2019s determination that appellant was \u201cpulling a sham\u201d and deliberately delaying the trial. Appellant\u2019s \u201cpretrial delays . . . would be strong evidence of a purpose to delay.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burton, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d 843, 854.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Appellant\u2019s feigned mental illness (four months\u2019 delay), escape (seven and one-half months\u2019 delay), continuous motions for continuance, and \u201cover a year\u201d readiness estimate support the trial court\u2019s revocation order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Lillie, P. J., and Neal, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 24, 1998. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-11\">Appellant was charged with attempting to escape (count 10) but convicted only of a lesser related offense of vandalism.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-13\">No issue is raised concerning this denial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b91-14\">Appellant was referred to department 95 and examined by Dr. Sara Bjit Sandhue who found him competent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b92-14\">That \u201ccase\u201d was just one of 11 separate incidents represented by the 25 counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b95-12\">Appellant\u2019s claim the trial court should have conducted a review of the curtailment of his jail in propria persona privileges is misplaced. The curtailment occurred more than two months <em>after </em>the trial court had revoked appellant\u2019s pro se status.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
