Cheyanna was bom after David was killed. The trial court mled that Cheyanna lacked standing to pursue a wrongful death action because she could not establish that David was her father. Cheyanna appeals that determination. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In May 1995, David met Angela in Desert Hot Springs. David was there visiting his brother, and Angela was visiting her aunt. Neither was married. A few days after they met, David and Angela began having sexual relations. They had sexual intercourse several times over a period of approximately 11 days. David used a condom on all but one occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">While still in Desert Hot Springs, Angela took a home pregnancy test, which indicated that she was pregnant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Angela told David that she was pregnant. He asked her what she was going to do. She said she did not know. David told Angela that he would leave that decision up to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">In late May or early June 1995, David left Desert Hot Springs and returned to the Los Angeles area, where he lived with his parents. Angela returned to her home in Banning. Angela did not see David again. She spoke to him once by telephone and asked him if he wanted to see a sonogram of the baby. He said yes and told her that he would come to see her. He never came. Nor did he acknowledge to Angela that he was the baby\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">On one occasion, Angela\u2019s mother tried to reach David by telephone at his parents\u2019 home. She ended up talking to David\u2019s mother, telling her that David could see the baby after it was bom. Later, David\u2019s mother asked him if he was the baby\u2019s father. He said he did not believe so because he had been with Angela for such a short time. According to his parents, David never held out the baby as his own.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> One of David\u2019s close friends, Heriberto Sicairos, stated that David did not tell him anything about Angela or the baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>On or about November 11, 1995, David was walking across a street in South Gate when he was hit by an automobile. He died from his injuries. Cesar Hernandez was driving the vehicle, which was registered to his employers, A.C. Nielsen Company and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">On February 2, 1996, Angela gave birth to Cheyanna. David\u2019s parents asked Angela to move in with them so they could be close to the baby. Angela did so. Cheyanna refers to David\u2019s mother as \u201cma,\u201d meaning \u201cgrandma,\u201d and to David\u2019s father as \u201cda,\u201d meaning \u201cgrandpa.\u201d David\u2019s parents have told several people that Cheyanna is their <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">In August 1996, Cheyanna filed this wrongful death action, with Angela acting as her guardian ad litem. Named as defendants were Hernandez, A.C. Nielsen Company, and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. A separate wrongful death action was filed by David\u2019s parents. The two actions were consolidated. In October 1996, the trial court disqualified Angela from acting as Cheyanna\u2019s guardian ad litem and appointed Attorney Paul Fukushima to serve in that capacity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court also ordered the South Gate Police Department to produce a sample of David\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">In connection with David\u2019s death, criminal charges were brought against Hernandez. He was convicted. At the sentencing hearing, one of David\u2019s brothers stated that David \u201chas a daughter [and] now she can\u2019t see her dad.\u201d David\u2019s mother also spoke at the hearing, saying, \u201cI have [David\u2019s] daughter at home with me. Every time I look at her, it is a reminder of what I lost, but it also soothes the pain that I feel . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">In May 1997, David\u2019s parents filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that Cheyanna lacked standing to maintain a wrongful death action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> David\u2019s parents argued that, to have standing, Cheyanna had to be an \u201cheir\u201d within the meaning of the laws of intestate succession (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6400-6455). They asserted that she was not an heir because David did not openly hold her out as his child. (See Prob. Code, \u00a7 6453, subd. (b)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">In response, Cheyanna argued that standing under the wrongful death statute should not be determined by the laws of intestate succession, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>should instead be governed by the Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity (Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7550-7558).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Cheyanna further claimed that, even if the laws of intestate succession determine standing in a wrongful death action, she need not prove that David held her out as his child. Given that David died before she was bom, Cheyanna asserted that it was impossible for him to hold her out as his \u201cchild,\u201d i.e., as a human being bom alive. In the event of such impossibility, the laws of intestate succession permit a child to establish a parent-child relationship through clear and convincing evidence of paternity. (See Prob. Code, \u00a7 6453, subd. (b)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The trial court mled that Cheyanna\u2019s standing to bring a wrongful death action was determined by the right to inherit under the laws of intestate succession. The court concluded that Cheyanna was not an heir because David had not held her out as his child. Accordingly, the trial court granted the summary judgment motion and entered judgment in favor of all defendants. As a result, David\u2019s parents are the only plaintiffs in the action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Cheyanna filed a timely appeal from the judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Summary judgment is appropriate if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\u201c \u2018A defendant seeking summary judgment has met the burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established [or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action]. . . . Once the defendant\u2019s burden is met, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of fact exists as to that cause of action. ... In reviewing the propriety of a summary judgment, the appellate court independently reviews the record that was before the trial court. . . . We must determine whether the facts as shown by the parties give rise to a triable issue of material fact. ... In making this determination, the moving party\u2019s affidavits are strictly construed while those of the opposing party are liberally construed.\u2019 . . . We accept as undisputed facts only those portions of the moving party\u2019s evidence that are not contradicted by the opposing party\u2019s evidence. ... In other words, the facts alleged in the evidence of the party opposing summary judgment and the reasonable inferences therefrom must be accepted as true.\u201d <em>(A-H Plating, Inc. </em>v. <em>American National Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 427, 433-434 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 113], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">As stated, Cheyanna argues that her standing to maintain an action for wrongful death should be determined by the Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity, not the laws of intestate succession. She further contends that even if the laws of intestate succession apply, she has standing to sue for wrongful death. Finally, she claims that if she does not have standing to sue, then the wrongful death statute unlawfully discriminates against illegitimate children in violation of the equal protection clause of the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">We conclude that Cheyanna\u2019s standing to bring a wrongful death action must be determined in accordance with the laws of intestate succession, but we also find that there are triable issues as to whether she has standing to sue. We therefore reverse the judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">A. <em>Standing to Bring a Wrongful Death Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">California\u2019s first wrongful death statute was enacted in 1862. (Stats. 1862, ch. 330, \u00a7\u00a7 1-4, pp. 447-448.) In 1872, the statute was codified as former section 377 of the Code of Civil Procedure (section 377). (See Historical Note, 14 West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (1973 ed.) \u00a7 377, pp. 59-60.) At the time of its repeal in 1992, section 377 provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">\u201c(a) When the death of a person is caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another, his or her <em>heirs </em>or personal representatives on their behalf may maintain an action for damages against the person causing the death ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>\u201c(b) For the purposes of subdivision (a), <em>\u2018'heirs\u2019\u2019 </em>means only the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\">\u201c(1) Those persons who would be entitled to succeed to the property of the decedent according to the provisions of Part 2 (commencing with Section 6400) of Division 6 of the Probate Code[, i.e., the intestacy laws] . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1983, ch. 842, \u00a7 12, pp. 3022-3023, italics added, repealed by Stats. 1992, ch. 178, \u00a7 19, p. 890; see Historical Note, 14 West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 377, at pp. 60-61; Historical and Statutory Notes, 14 West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (1998 pocket supp.) \u00a7 377, pp. 19-20.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In construing section 377, our Supreme Court stated: \u201c[W]e are persuaded that the Legislature intends to occupy the field of recovery for wrongful death. For this reason the remedy remains a creature of statute in California . . . regardless of whether a cause of action for wrongful death did or did not exist at common law. . . . [\u00b6] Because it is a creature of statute, the cause of action for wrongful death \u2018exists only so far and in favor of such person as the legislative power may declare.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 564, 575 [139 Cal.Rptr. 97, 565 P.2d 122], citations omitted, disapproved on other grounds in <em>Ochoa </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 159, 171 [216 Cal.Rptr. 661, 703 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The high court also explained that \u201c[i]t is well settled that the right to bring an action for the wrongful death of a human being is limited to the persons described in Code of Civil Procedure section 377. . . . The use of the word \u2018heirs\u2019 in section 377 has been narrowly interpreted as limiting this class of persons to those <em>who would have been eligible to inherit from the decedent\u2019s estate had he died intestate.\u201d (Steed </em>v. <em>Imperial Airlines </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 115, 119 [115 Cal.Rptr. 329, 524 P.2d 801, 68 A.L.R.3d 1204], citations omitted, italics added; accord, <em>Mayo </em>v. <em>White </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 1083, 1088 [224 Cal.Rptr. 373].)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">In 1992, the Legislature repealed section 377 and enacted the present wrongful death statute, codified as sections 377.60 to 377.62 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Stats. 1992, ch. 178, \u00a7\u00a7 19-20, pp. 890, 893-894; Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 14 West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (1998 pocket supp.) \u00a7 377, pp. 19-20.) Section 377.60, subdivision (a), of the Code of Civil Procedure (section 377.60(a)) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">\u201cA cause of action for the death of a person caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another may be asserted by any of the following persons or by the decedent\u2019s personal representative on their behalf:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>\u201c(a) The decedent\u2019s surviving spouse, <em>children, </em>and issue of deceased children, or, if there is no surviving issue of the decedent, the persons, including the surviving spouse, who would be entitled to the property of the decedent by intestate succession.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Cheyanna correctly points out that while the former wrongful death statute allowed \u201cheirs\u201d to bring suit, section 377.60(a) confers that right on the decedent\u2019s \u201cchildren,\u201d among others. Because section 377.60(a) does not define \u201cchildren,\u201d Cheyanna argues that paternity should be determined in accordance with the Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity. That act authorizes the use of blood tests in any civil action where paternity is an issue. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7551; see fn. 6, <em>ante.) </em>David\u2019s parents, on the other hand, contend that we should look to the intestacy laws to determine whether Cheyanna is among the \u201cchildren\u201d who can bring a wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Faced with two different statutory schemes for defining \u201cchildren,\u201d we examine the legislative history of the wrongful death statute for guidance. (See <em>In re York </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1133, 1142 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 308, 892 P.2d 804].) That examination leads us to conclude that the laws of intestate succession determine whether Cheyanna can bring an action under section 377.60(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">In <em>Phraner </em>v. <em>Cote Mart, Inc. </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 166 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 740], the plaintiff, an adopted child, brought a wrongful death action against the persons allegedly responsible for the death of her <em>biological </em>mother. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff lacked standing because, under the laws of intestate succession, the adoption had terminated the parent-child relationship between the plaintiff and the decedent. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">\u201c[The plaintiff] relies heavily on the 1992 repeal of section 377 and its reenactment as section 377.60, in which the term \u2018heir\u2019 was replaced by \u2018children.\u2019 She asserts the change is indicative of legislative intent to include children previously adopted in the class of people permitted to bring a wrongful death action. But the legislative history and case law indicate otherwise. The change was intended to allow the children of a decedent to maintain an action for the wrongful death of a parent even though the parent\u2019s entire estate was community property bequeathed to the surviving spouse. Essentially, those children who are not heirs only because the estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>consists entirely of community property may now assert a claim. . . . <em>The change in the language was not a broadening of the statute, but a mere clarification.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\">\u201c. . . [T]he statutory right to bring a wrongful death action under section 377.60, subdivision (a) is grounded <em>in the right to inherit from the decedent. </em>Thus, whether an adopted child is considered a child of her biological parent <em>for purposes of intestate succession </em>is highly relevant to the definition of \u2018children\u2019 in section 377.60.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">\u201c[The plaintiff] correctly asserts the \u2018purpose behind the wrongful death statute is to provide compensation for the loss of companionship and other losses resulting from decedent\u2019s death.\u2019 . . . She suggests we judicially create standing in wrongful death actions for children who maintain a relationship with their biological parent even after adoption. However, [the plaintiff], \u2018 \u201clike any number of other persons who, in particular cases, may suffer injury . . . and personal loss by the death of an individual, is without legal recourse absent specific statutory remedy.\u201d Granting standing to [the plaintiff] would expand the category of people able to recover for the loss beyond that which was contemplated by the Legislature in drafting the statute. We decline to do so.\u201d (55 Cal.App.4th at pp. 169-170, citations and fn. omitted, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Moreover, the California Law Revision Commission has explained that the reference to \u201cchildren\u201d in section 377.60(a) simply restates the provisions of the former wrongful death statute <em>\u201cwithout substantive change, </em>except as discussed below. . . . [\u00b6] Subdivision (a) [of section 377.60] revises the language of former Section 377(b)(1) to refer specifically to the decedent\u2019s surviving spouse, children, and issue of deceased children, as proper parties plaintiff in a wrongful death action. This makes clear that, even if the decedent\u2019s estate is entirely community property, the decedent\u2019s children and issue of deceased children are proper parties plaintiff, along with the decedent\u2019s surviving spouse. <em>This codifies Fiske </em>v. <em>Wilkie, </em>67 Cal.App.2d 440, 444, 154 P.2d 725 (1945). . . .\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 14 West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (1998 pocket supp.) \u00a7 377.60, p. 47, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">In sum, although section 377.60(a) differs from its predecessor in that it permits a wrongful death action to be brought by the decedent\u2019s \u201cchildren,\u201d as opposed to \u201cheirs,\u201d the Legislature did not intend to broaden standing under the statute. Rather, section 377.60(a) was enacted to codify our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>holding in <em>Fiske </em>v. <em>Wilkie </em>(1945) 67 Cal.App.2d 440, 444 [154 P.2d 725], that the intestacy laws permit a decedent\u2019s children to maintain a wrongful death action even if the decedent\u2019s entire estate passes to a surviving spouse. (See <em>Desplancke </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 631, 633-635 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 586].) Consequently, under section 377.60(a), standing to bring a wrongful death action remains linked to the intestacy laws. (See <em>Phraner </em>v. <em>Cote Mart, Inc., supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at pp. 169-170.) We must therefore determine whether Cheyanna is an \u201cheir\u201d under the laws of intestate succession.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In arguing that the intestacy laws do not govern standing under section 377.60(a), Cheyanna relies on cases that are either inapposite or distinguishable. In <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Lyerla </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 556 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 63], the plaintiff (a grandmother) brought a wrongful death action against her daughter-in-law, alleging that the latter had murdered her own daughter (the plaintiff\u2019s granddaughter). The grandmother claimed that she had standing to sue because Probate Code section 250 precludes a murderer from taking any of the victim\u2019s property through intestate succession. The court rejected this contention. As the court noted, the wrongful death statute (\u00a7 377) defined \u201cheir\u201d as \u201c \u2018. . . [t]hose persons who would be entitled to succeed to the property of the decedent according to the provisions of <em>Part 2 (commencing with Section 6400) of Division 6 of the Probate Code . . . </em>.\u2019\u201d (1 Cal.App.4th at p. 560.) Because Probate Code section 250, which disinherits a murderer, is not within part 2 of division 6 of the code, the court concluded that the decedent\u2019s sole surviving heir was her mother and alleged murderer. (1 Cal.App.4th at pp. 560-561.)</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">As we read it, <em>Marks </em>illustrates the principle that \u201c[t]he category of persons eligible to bring wrongful death actions is strictly construed.\u201d <em>(Marks </em>v. <em>Lyerla, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th at p. 560; accord, <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Regional Center of the East Bay </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 350, 355 [220 Cal.Rptr. 89].) In fact, <em>Marks </em>recognized that standing under the wrongful death statute is determined by the laws of intestate succession. In rejecting the grandmother\u2019s standing argument the court stated: <em>\"[U]nder the intestacy scheme incorporated into section 377, </em>parents have priority over more remote relatives, such as grandparents.\u201d (1 Cal.App.4th at p. 560, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Cheyanna\u2019s reliance on out-of-state cases is also misplaced. In <em>Brookbank </em>v. <em>Gray </em>(1996) 74 Ohio St.3d 279 [658 N.E.2d 724], the court interpreted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>Ohio wrongful death statute, which provided that \u201c \u2018[a]n action . . . shall be brought ... for the exclusive benefit of the surviving spouse, the <em>children, </em>and the parents of the decedent....\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 281, fn. 1 [658 N.E.2d at p. 726], italics added.) In construing the word \u201cchildren,\u201d which the legislature had not defined, the court noted that the wrongful death statute \u201cdoes <em>not </em>incorporate \u2018heirship\u2019 into its provisions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 284 [658 N.E.2d at p. 728], italics added.) The court held that standing in a wrongful death action should be determined without reference to the laws regarding inheritance. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 281-287 [658 N.E.2d at pp. 726-730].) In <em>Garza </em>v. <em>Maverick Market, Inc. </em>(Tex. 1989) 768 S.W.2d 273, the Texas Supreme Court reached the same conclusion in applying the Texas wrongful death statute. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 275-276.) However, neither decision is pertinent here because, in enacting the relevant part of California\u2019s wrongful death statute (\u00a7 377.60(a)), the Legislature has indicated that standing is to be determined with reference to the laws of intestate succession.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">B. <em>Existence of a Parent-child Relationship</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">We now turn to the question of whether Cheyanna is an heir under the laws of intestate succession. Because this case comes to us on appeal from a summary judgment, Cheyanna need not establish that she is an heir as a matter of law. Instead, she need only show that there is a triable issue as to whether she is an heir.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">To answer the question before us, we begin by examining the intestacy laws. We then turn to other statutes and to legislative history materials. Ultimately, we conclude that Cheyanna may be an heir and that summary judgment was improperly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">As stated, David did not have a spouse. Consequently, under the laws of intestate succession, his entire estate would pass to his \u201cissue,\u201d if any. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 6402, subd. (a).) If David has no \u201cissue,\u201d the entire estate goes to his parents. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">The \u201cissue\u201d of a person is defined as \u201call [of] his or her lineal descendants of all generations, with the <em>relationship of parent and child </em>at each generation being determined by the definitions of <em>child </em>and parent.\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 50, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>italics added.) \u201cChild\u201d means \u201cany individual entitled to take as a child under this code by intestate succession from the parent whose relationship is involved.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 26.) \u201cParent\u201d is defined as \u201cany individual entitled to take as a parent under this code by intestate succession from the child whose relationship is involved.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">\u201c[A] <em>relationship of parent and child </em>exists between a person and the person\u2019s <em>natural parents, </em>regardless of the marital status of the natural parents.\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 6450, subd. (a), italics added.) \u201cNatural parent\u201d is defined by Probate Code section 6453. For purposes of the present case, a biological father is a \u201cnatural parent\u201d if \u201c[p]aternity is established by clear and convincing evidence that the father has openly held out the child as his own.\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 6453, subd. (b)(2).) However, if \u201c[i]t was impossible for the father to hold the child out as his own,\u201d the biological father is a \u201cnatural parent\u201d if \u201cpaternity is established by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b)(3).)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Thus, if David <em>could </em>have held Cheyanna out as his \u201cchild,\u201d and there is clear and convincing evidence that he did so, Cheyanna would be an heir under the intestacy laws. If it was <em>impossible </em>for David to hold Cheyanna out as his \u201cchild,\u201d she would be an heir if there is clear and convincing evidence of David\u2019s paternity. Under both alternatives, Cheyanna must present evidence that is clear and convincing. But the first alternative requires proof of a specific act\u2014that David held Cheyanna out as his \u201cchild.\u201d The second alternative simply requires proof that David was Cheyanna\u2019s biological father; it does not require proof of any specified conduct, nor does it limit the type or source of permissible evidence, provided the evidence is clear and convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">David\u2019s parents contend that David could have held Cheyanna out as his \u201cchild,\u201d but that he did not do so. Of course, David died before Cheyanna\u2019s birth, which raises the question of whether Cheyanna was a \u201cchild\u201d before she was bom. In that regard, David\u2019s parents argue that the term \u201cchild,\u201d as used in the laws of intestate succession, includes an unborn child or fetus. They emphasize that David lived for six months after he learned that Angela was pregnant and that he never acknowledged paternity. As the trial court noted: \u201c[David] could have offered to care for the child. He could have asked [Angela] to marry him. He could have told his friends and family that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>he was going to be a father. There is no evidence that he did any of these things.\u201d Under this line of reasoning, it was possible for David to hold Cheyanna out as his \u201cchild.\u201d Because he did not do so, Cheyanna would not be an heir. (See Prob. Code, \u00a7 6453, subd. (b)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">For her part, Cheyanna argues that the term \u201cchild\u201d does not include an unborn child or fetus. She contends that \u201cchild\u201d means a human being bom alive. Under this definition, it was impossible for David to hold Cheyanna out as his \u201cchild\u201d since he died before she was born. Accordingly, Cheyanna would be an heir if she can establish David\u2019s paternity through clear and convincing evidence. (See Prob. Code, \u00a7 6453, subd. (b)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">At the outset, we note that the laws of intestate succession provide no guidance in determining whether the term \u201cchild\u201d includes an unborn child or fetus. The intestacy laws define \u201cchild\u201d by using the word \u201cchild\u201d and are therefore of no help. (See Prob. Code, \u00a7 26.) Further, while the intestacy laws refer to the parent-child relationship of a \u201cperson\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 6450, subd. (a)), the word \u201cperson\u201d is defined as \u201can individual, corporation, government or governmental subdivision or agency, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company, association, or other entity\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 56). Again, we must look elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">At first blush, Probate Code section 6407 appears promising. It provides that \u201c[Relatives of the decedent conceived before the decedent\u2019s death but bom thereafter inherit as if they had been bom in the lifetime of the decedent.\u201d Obviously, a decedent\u2019s daughter is one of his \u201crelatives.\u201d Yet, where the child is illegitimate, section 6407 cannot be applied without first determining whether the child is, in fact, a \u201crelative,\u201d i.e., whether the decedent was the child\u2019s father. Section 6407 does not indicate how that determination should be made. Thus, as applied in this case, section 6407 tells us that <em>if </em>Cheyanna is David\u2019s daughter, she is an heir even though she was bom after he died. But to determine whether David could hold Cheyanna out as his \u201cchild,\u201d we must search beyond the intestacy laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">David\u2019s parents direct our attention to Civil Code section 43.1, formerly Civil Code section 29. Before its repeal in 1994, section 29 provided in part: \u201cA child conceived, but not yet bom, is to be deemed an existing person, so far as may be necessary for its interests in the event of its subsequent birth . . . .\u201d (6 West\u2019s Ann. Civ. Code (1982 ed.) \u00a7 29, p. 94 repealed by Stats. 1993, ch. 219, \u00a7 2.) Effective January 1, 1994, the relevant part of section 29 was reenacted without substantive change as section 43.1. (See Stats. 1992, ch. 163, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 161, pp. 724-725, 842; Stats. 1992, ch. 162, \u00a7 13, p. 722; Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 6 West\u2019s Ann. Civ. Code (1998 pocket supp.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>\u00a7 43.1, p. 12.) Section 43.1 states: \u201cA child conceived, but not yet bom, is deemed an existing person, so far as necessary for the child\u2019s interests in the event of the child\u2019s subsequent birth.\u201d The intestacy laws are to be construed in a manner consistent with section 43.1. (See Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 53 West\u2019s Ann. Prob. Code (1991 ed.) \u00a7 6407, p. 510.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">In <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 564, the Supreme Court discussed section 43.1 in the context of a wrongful death action. There, a married couple brought a wrongful death action against a physician and a hospital based on the stillbirth of a fetus. The plaintiffs argued that a stillborn fetus is a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of the wrongful death statute. In rejecting that argument, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">\u201c \u2018[Tjhere are major and decisive areas where the embryo and fetus are not treated as equivalent to the bom child.\u2019 Indeed, such equivalence is the exception rather than the mle. ... \u2018In areas other than criminal abortion, the law has been reluctant to endorse any theory that life, as we recognize it, begins before live birth or to accord legal rights to the unborn except in narrowly defined situations and except when the rights are contingent upon live birth. For example, the traditional rule of tort law denied recovery for prenatal injuries even though the child was bom alive. That rule has been changed in almost every jurisdiction. . . . Similarly, unborn children have been recognized as acquiring rights or interests by way of inheritance or other devolution of property, and have been represented by guardians <em>ad litem. </em>Perfection of the interests involved, again, has generally been contingent upon live birth. In short, the unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense.\u2019 . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">\u201cThe law of California on these questions is statutory. Recovery is permitted for prenatal injuries by a child who is bom alive, solely because the action falls within the terms of Civil Code section [43.1]. That section provides generally that \u2018A child conceived, but not yet bom, is to be deemed an existing person, so far as . . . necessary for [the child\u2019s] interests in the event of [the child\u2019s] subsequent birth; . . .\u2019 Among the \u2018interests\u2019 of the child under this statute is the right to compensation for personal injuries inflicted by the intentional or negligent conduct of another. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">\u201cThe property rights of an unborn child are also prescribed in Civil Code section [43.1], together with a number of special statutes on the subject. . . . None of these rights vests, however, unless and until the child is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>bom alive: that requirement is . . . explicitly stated ... in Civil Code section [43.1] . . . .\u201d (19 Cal.3d at pp. 577-578, citations and fn. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">As <em>Justus </em>makes clear, section 43.1 confers various rights upon an unborn child\u2014including the rights to inherit, to own property, and to recover for prenatal injuries\u2014provided the child is born alive. (19 Cal.3d at pp. 577-579.) <em>Justus </em>also points out that the law typically does not equate a fetus with a bom child. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 577.) Thus, \u201cwhen the Legislature speaks generally of a \u2018person,\u2019 as in [the wrongful death statute], it impliedly but plainly excludes . . . fetuses.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 579.) Finally, <em>Justus </em>teaches that ambiguous terms in the wrongful death statute are to be interpreted so as to promote justice. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 579-580.)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Equally important, the courts have applied section 43.1 outside the wrongful death context in construing statutes that use the term \u201cchild.\u201d For example, in <em>Lavell </em>v. <em>Adoption Institute </em>(1960) 185 Cal.App.2d 557 [8 Cal.Rptr. 367], an unmarried couple, Frederick and Mary, were cohabiting when Mary became pregnant. A week before the child was born, Mary left the couple\u2019s residence and never returned. Without Frederick\u2019s knowledge, Mary gave birth to the child and put it up for adoption. Frederick eventually found the baby and brought suit against the adoption agency to gain custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The adoption agency invoked former Civil Code section 200, which allowed the mother of an <em>illegitimate </em>child to put it up for adoption without the father\u2019s consent. (185 Cal.App.2d at p. 558.) Frederick relied on former Civil Code section 224, which required the consent of both parents to place a <em>legitimate </em>child up for adoption. (185 Cal.App.2d at p. 558.) In arguing that the child was legitimate, Frederick cited former Civil Code section 230, which provided: \u201c \u2018The father of an illegitimate <em>child, </em>by publicly acknowledging it as his own, receiving it as such, with the consent of his wife, if he is married, into his family, and otherwise treating it as if it were a legitimate <em>child, </em>thereby adopts it as such; and such <em>child </em>is thereupon deemed for all purposes legitimate from the time of its birth.\u2019 \u201d (185 Cal.App.2d at p. 561, italics added.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The trial court awarded custody to Frederick.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">On appeal, the adoption agency phrased the question before the court as, \u201c \u2018May the legitimation of a child under Civil Code, Section 230 be accomplished prior to its birth?\u2019 \u201d (185 Cal.App.2d at p. 560.) To this, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>replied, \u201c[O]ur answer must be in the affirmative.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In upholding the trial court, the Court of Appeal applied section 43.1 and concluded that an unborn child is a \u201cchild\u201d for purposes of former Civil Code section 230. The court explained: \u201c[U]nder section [43.1], the unborn child of unwed parents is an existing person for the purpose of adoption and we believe is as capable of being received into the family of the father, and to be as much a part of the family as an unborn child of married parents. The child must be treated as if it were legitimate, but this requirement may not be construed as applying only to a child after its birth. It is not questioned that [Frederick] provided a home for the child\u2019s mother and supported her until their separation, shortly before the birth of the child. Certainly he did not deny parenthood, nor did he in any manner treat it otherwise than as a legitimate child. He has not neglected the child or failed in any duty toward it.\u201d (185 Cal.App.2d at p. 561; see also <em>Estate of Abate </em>(1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 282 [333 P.2d 200].)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">In <em>Kyne </em>v. <em>Kyne </em>(1940) 38 Cal.App.2d 122 [100 P.2d 806], a mother filed an action for child support on behalf of her illegitimate unborn child. The action was based on former Civil Code section 196a, which provided: \u201c \u2018The father as well as the mother, of an illegitimate <em>child </em>must give him support and education suitable to his circumstances. A civil suit to enforce such obligations may be maintained in behalf of a minor illegitimate <em>child, </em>by his mother or guardian . . . .\u2019\u201d (38 Cal.App.2d at p. 126, italics added.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The father argued that the lawsuit was premature because the \u201cchild\u201d had not yet been bom. The Court of Appeal rejected that argument, stating: \u201cObviously, a child must be supported both before, as well as after birth. . . . [S]ection [43.1] must be read together with section 196a so as to confer the right on an unborn child through a guardian <em>ad litem </em>to compel the right to support . . . .\u201d (38 Cal.App.2d at p. 127.)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Here, David\u2019s parents contend that, under section 43.1, the term \u201cchild,\u201d as used in the phrase \u201cheld out the child as his own\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 6453, subd. (b)(2)), must be constmed to include an unborn child or fetus. If that were so, David could have held Cheyanna out as his \u201cchild\u201d before she was bom. Since he did not do so, the argument goes, Cheyanna is not an heir, and she has no standing to sue for wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">We reject this contention because it ignores the purpose of section 43.1. As the statutory language indicates, section 43.1 is applicable \u201cso far as necessary for the child\u2019s interests.\u201d Put another way, section 43.1 applies to the extent it <em>benefits </em>a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>In <em>Scott </em>v. <em>McPheeters </em>(1939) 33 Cal.App.2d 629 [92 P.2d 678], the court was faced with the question of whether a child, once bom, can maintain an action for personal injuries sustained <em>in \u00fatero. </em>In recognizing such a claim, the court discussed the \u201cinterests\u201d protected by section 43.1: \u201cThere appears to be no language in [section 43.1] which is uncertain or ambiguous. It seems to be as clear and concise as the English language could make it. It says that an unborn child which has been conceived is deemed to be \u2018an existing person\u2019 when that assumption is necessary \u2018for [the child\u2019s] interests\u2019, in the event of [the child\u2019s] subsequent birth. There appears to be no reason for confining the word \u2018interests\u2019 to the child\u2019s right of inheritance or to its property rights. Clearly the word is general in its application and includes both personal and property rights. . . . We assume the word \u2018interests\u2019 is used in section [43.1] in the general sense of anything that is profitable or beneficial to the child. In Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, ... the term is defined as \u2018a right to have the advantage accruing from anything.\u2019 All standard dictionaries include in the definition of the word \u2018an advantage, profit or benefit\u2019 in any property, enterprise or thing. That includes benefits or rights flowing from real or personal property or from choses in action. . . .\u201d <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>McPheeters, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.2d at pp. 631-632.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Similarly, in <em>Kyne </em>v. <em>Kyne, supra, </em>38 Cal.App.2d 122, where the court held that a father has a duty to support his unborn child, the court noted that section 43.1 \u201ccomes into operation whenever it is in the interests of the child that it should come into operation. . . . [T]he word \u2018interests,\u2019 appearing in the section means \u2018anything that is profitable or beneficial to the child.\u2019 . . . It is clearly to the best \u2018interests\u2019 of the child that its father be compelled to support it, if the mother cannot, prior to its birth.\u201d (38 Cal.App.2d at p. 127.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">A concern for the child\u2019s best interests was also at work in <em>Lavell </em>v. <em>Adoption Institute, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.2d 557. As discussed, in that case, an unmarried couple had a child, which the mother put up for adoption without the father\u2019s consent. The father successfully sued the adoption agency for custody of the child. In applying section 43.1, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">\u201cThe contention [of the adoption agency] appears to be that it would not be necessary, in the interest of the child, that it be adopted by its father. We do not doubt that it is in the interest of any child to be reared by a married couple. But we believe that the <em>primary interest and right </em>of an unborn child of unwed parents is to acquire the status of a legitimate child. We doubt that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>it has ever been questioned that the <em>welfare of a child </em>of parents who are well qualified to fulfill, and have fulfilled, the obligation of parenthood will be better served by its being reared by its natural parents than by adoptive parents. Adoption by strangers is a beneficent substitute for the custody of natural parents, but it is a measure that is not to be employed when the natural parents are qualified, able and willing to bear their responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">\u201c. . . [W]e are convinced that an unborn child of unwed parents may be adopted by its father. It is deemed an existing person \u2018as far as may be necessary for its interests,\u2019 most important of which is the right of legitimation and to have the security of a father\u2019s care and support.\u201d (185 Cal.App.2d at pp. 560-561, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">As the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has stated more recently: \u201cCalifornia Civil Code section [43.1] was enacted ... to create a cause of action for the benefit of the child, and to protect its interests in the event of its subsequent birth. . . . The word \u2018interests\u2019 as used in section [43.1] means anything that is profitable or beneficial to the child, . . . including the right to compensation \u2018for personal injuries wrongfully inflicted by the willful or negligent acts of another person.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Endo Laboratories, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Ins. Group </em>(9th Cir. 1984) 747 F.2d 1264, 1267.)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In sum, the statutory language and the pertinent case law leave no doubt that section 43.1 was intended to <em>benefit </em>a child born out of wedlock. The statute serves to <em>protect </em>the interests of the unborn child, not to destroy them.  We think it beyond question that Cheyanna has a significant interest in determining the identity of her father. If it turns out that David was her father, Cheyanna would also have an important interest in seeking redress for his allegedly wrongful death.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Cheyanna\u2019s interests would hardly be served by applying section 43.1 in construing the intestacy laws, i.e., by defining \u201cchild\u201d to include a fetus. Such an application would preclude Cheyanna from obtaining a legal determination of paternity and from maintaining a wrongful death action. Plainly, the operation of the statute would not further Cheyanna\u2019s interests, nor would it promote \u201cjustice.\u201d <em>(Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 579.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>Accordingly, section 43.1 does not apply in resolving the question of David\u2019s paternity.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">In these circumstances, the term \u201cchild,\u201d as used in the intestacy laws, means a human being born alive, not an unborn child or fetus. (See <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 579 [\u201cwhen the Legislature determines to confer legal personality on unborn fetuses for certain limited purposes, it expresses that intent in specific and appropriate terms\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ward </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 122, 126-128 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 531] [absent qualifying language, the word \u201cchild\u201d excludes an unborn child]; <em>Reyes </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 214 [141 Cal.Rptr. 912] [same].) Because David died before Cheyanna was bom, it was impossible for him to hold her out as his \u201cchild,\u201d i.e., as a bom child. Given this impossibility, we find that Cheyanna may establish David\u2019s paternity, if at all, through clear and convincing evidence. (See Prob. Code, \u00a7 6453, subd. (b)(3).)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Our conclusion is compelled not only by the foregoing statutory analysis but also by the legislative history of the intestacy laws.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Before January 1, 1994, the laws of intestate succession did not contain an \u201cimpossibility\u201d alternative for proving the paternity of an illegitimate child. Instead, former Probate Code section 6408, subdivision (f)(2), provided that' a biological father was a \u201cnatural parent\u201d if (1) a court order was entered during the father\u2019s lifetime declaring paternity or (2) paternity was established by clear and convincing evidence that the father had openly and notoriously held out the child as his own.

(Stats. 1993, ch. 529, \u00a7 4.) To replace it, the Legislature enacted Probate Code section 6453, which has remained unchanged. (See Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 53 West\u2019s Ann. Prob. Code, (1998 pocket supp.) \u00a7 6453, p. 183.) Section 6453, unlike its predecessor, includes a third means of proving paternity\u2014by clear and convincing evidence if \u201c[i]t was impossible for the father to hold out the child as his own.\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 6453, subd.

The father was in traction until his death 28 days later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-10\">\u201cIn another Los Angeles County case, <em>the alleged father (unmarried) was killed while the mother of the illegitimate child was still pregnant. </em>Under these facts, if the father did not hold out the child as his own, no court order establishing paternity could have been entered during the father\u2019s lifetime. <em>Current law would bar the child from establishing paternity.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-11\">\u201cThis bill would offer another alternative for establishing the parent-child relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>\n<em>\". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">\u201cAccording to the author\u2019s office, \u2018[s]ection 6408 of the Probate Code as currently written, appears to be unconstitutional when applied to certain cases. In cases where the father did not have an opportunity to openly and notoriously hold out the child as his own, and <em>there was not enough time to obtain a court order establishing paternity between the time of the child\u2019s birth and the father\u2019s death, </em>Probate Code Section 6408 bars the child from establishing paternity.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">\u201c \u2018In such cases,\u2019 states the author, \u2018Probate Code Section 6408 creates an \u2018impenetrable barrier\u2019 which does not allow an illegitimate [child] to establish paternity. A similar statute which constituted an \u2018impenetrable barrier\u2019 to illegitimate children in establishing paternity was held unconstitutional in Gomez v. Perez (1973) 409 U.S. [535].\u2019 \u201d (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1137 (1993-1994 Reg.

In part, the letter reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">\u201cThe bill alleviates a problem that was brought to my attention by Dave Bianchi, a Lancaster attorney. He had a case in which a child was not treated fairly due to a deficiency in the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">\u201cThe child\u2019s parents were unmarried but living together. <em>On the day that the child was bom the father was [injured] in a diving accident. </em>He went into a coma and died a few weeks later. Although he had made obvious preparations for the birth of his child, the law holds that he must \u2018openly and notoriously hold out [that] the child is his own.\u2019 Obviously, a person in a coma would not be able to meet this legal threshold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">\u201c[The bill] would allow the existence of a parent-child relationship for the purpose of [intestate] succession [to] be established by clear and convincing evidence when it was impossible for the father to hold out the child as his own and paternity is established by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d (Letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>dated Aug. 31, 1993, from Assemblyman William Knight to Governor Pete Wilson, on file with Legislative Intent Service, History of Assem.

Sess.), prepared Aug. 6, 1998, document No. 9, A-l, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In sum, the legislative history indicates that the \u201cimpossibility\u201d provision was enacted to cover the situation now before the court\u2014where the father dies before the child is born. It follows that the trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment. The motion was premised on the theory that David could have held Cheyanna out as his child but failed to do so. That was the wrong theory. Under the correct analysis, it was impossible for David to hold Cheyanna out as his child. Consequently, Cheyanna is permitted to prove paternity through evidence that is clear and convincing. Under the applicable test, the moving parties are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Nor have they established that, under the correct test, the material facts are undisputed. We accordingly reverse the judgment.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The judgment is reversed.

(Prob. Code, \u00a7 6402, subd. (a).) If there is no surviving spouse or child, the decedent\u2019s parents take the entire estate. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).) Thus, assuming that the intestacy laws determine standing in a wrongful death action, David\u2019s parents are the sole plaintiffs because David did not have a surviving spouse and, under the trial court\u2019s ruling, he did not have any children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b648-10\"> A month after the entry of judgment, Cheyanna moved the trial court to vacate the judgment based on newly discovered evidence (i.e., statements that David purportedly made to two friends). The trial court denied the motion, finding that the new evidence was not competent to show that David had held Cheyanna out as his child. In her opening brief on appeal, Cheyanna does not challenge the trial court\u2019s ruling. We therefore treat the ruling as correct and do not consider the incompetent evidence submitted in support of the motion to vacate the judgment.

Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7550-7558). Family Code section 7551, which was enacted in 1992 to replace Evidence Code section 892, determines paternity in child support cases. (See Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 29E West\u2019s Ann. Fam.

In California, the Legislature has already weighed those factors and has come to a different conclusion. Our task is to apply the California statute in accordance with legislative intent. (See <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 816, 826 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 823 P.2d 1216].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b655-8\"> These alternatives for proving paternity apply if a child has no \u201cpresumed\u201d father or if the \u201cpresumed\u201d father is dead.
