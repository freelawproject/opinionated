California workers allegedly were exposed to these asbestos fibers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>here, thereby sustaining progressive lung diseases. They claim Cassiar failed to adequately warn of the health risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">We apply the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Vons Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seabest Foods, Inc. </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 434 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 899, 926 P.2d 1085] to find sufficient contacts to justify the exercise of specific jurisdiction. The instant litigation results from injuries \u201crelated to\u201d Cassiar\u2019s forum activities of selling asbestos to certain companies located in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Cassiar argues there is no \u201cevidence of record\u201d that plaintiffs were actually exposed to the asbestos fibers it sold in California or sustained injury as a result. Following <em>Vons </em>we will not impose such a strict causation burden for jurisdictional purposes, nor will we require a minitrial. It is manifestly \u201cfair\u201d to require that Cassiar account in California for the consequences of its activities within the state, and Cassiar has not presented any compelling considerations to suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Cassiar was incorporated in Canada in 1951. It began its mining operations in British Columbia in 1953, and mined, milled, and sold raw asbestos fiber. It ceased operations in 1992, when it went bankrupt and subsequently dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Cassiar did not itself manufacture or sell any finished products. Instead it sold the raw asbestos fibers to manufacturers, including companies such as Johns-Manville, Fibreboard, and CertainTeed, with plants in California. For some 38 years (from 1953 until 1991), Cassiar sold thousands of tons of raw asbestos to these California operations. It has made no sales or otherwise had any contacts with California since 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Cassiar first became a target of asbestos lawsuits in the 1970\u2019s. It has appeared and defended such lawsuits in California and has not challenged California\u2019s specific jurisdiction where it admittedly supplied the raw asbestos to which the plaintiffs were exposed. (See, e.g., <em>Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Cassiar Mining Corp. </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 148, 151-152 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 132] [affirming in part and reversing in part jury verdict against Cassiar for supplying asbestos to plaintiff\u2019s jobsite, a CertainTeed cement plant in Santa Clara].) As Cassiar explains, \u201cWe do not contest jurisdiction in cases where it\u2019s clearly connected to Cassiar\u2019s past contacts with the State of California. [\u00b6] For example ... a case brought by workers who worked at the plant that Cassiar shipped fiber to, we\u2019d answer, defend, we don\u2019t make an issue of it, but there\u2019s a difference between defending a limited number of cases where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>there\u2019s a clear connection with the forum and sort of an infinite number of cases where the connection is speculative at best.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The instant litigation is brought by 10 workers who allegedly sustained asbestos-related lung injuries as a result of inhaling asbestos during the course of their employment. Cassiar is one of 162 named defendants said to have manufactured, distributed, supplied, or installed asbestos products to which plaintiffs were exposed at their jobsites. Plaintiffs claim they were injured when they inhaled asbestos supplied by Cassiar to such companies as Fibreboard (in Emeryville), CertainTeed (in Santa Clara) and Johns-Man-ville (in Lompoc). But, unlike the worker in <em>Gutierrez, </em>none of the plaintiffs worked at the Fibreboard, CertainTeed or Johns-Manville plants where Cassiar shipped the asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Cassiar appeared specially and moved to quash service of the summons. While conceding it sold asbestos fiber to these \u201ccertain discrete locations in California between 1953 and 1991,\u201d Cassiar declared, \u201cno sales of asbestos fib[er] [were made] at any time to any jobsite where any plaintiff alleges occupational exposure to asbestos . . . .\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 counterdeclarations did not establish any causal link between their injuries and Cassiar\u2019s California sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The superior court denied Cassiar\u2019s motion to quash. Cassiar filed a petition for writ of mandate. We issued an order to show cause and set the matter for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Cassiar has a liberty interest in not being subjected to the jurisdiction of California courts if its connection with this state falls below the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d threshold, or if so doing will violate \u201c \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Internat. Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1945) 326 U.S. 310, 316 [66 S.Ct. 154, 158, 90 L.Ed. 95, 161 A.L.R. 1057].) The minimum contacts requirement prevents nonresident defendants from being subjected to California jurisdiction \u201c \u2018solely as a result of \u201crandom,\u201d \u201cfortuitous,\u201d or \u201cattenuated\u201d contacts.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Vons Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seabest Foods, Inc., supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 445, quoting <em>Burger King Corp. </em>v. <em>Rudzewicz </em>(1985) 471 U.S. 462, 475 [105 S.Ct. 2174, 2183, 85 L.Ed.2d 528].) This affords nonresidents some degree of predictability and certainty about when they will be subjected to the jurisdiction of the forum state. California\u2019s long-arm statute is intended to provide the broadest possible jurisdiction subject only to federal constitutional limitations. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 410.10; <em>Sibley </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 442, 445 [128 Cal.Rptr. 34, 546 P.2d 322].)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Cassiar\u2019s contacts with California do not appear to be so continuous and systematic as to establish California\u2019s general jurisdiction over any cause of action against Cassiar, regardless of its relationship with the forum. <em>(As You Sow </em>v. <em>Crawford Laboratories, Inc. </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1859, 1868 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 654].) A Canadian company headquartered in Vancouver, Cassiar had no offices, employees, bank accounts, or real property within the state. It did not advertise in any California trade journals or publications. It had no further contacts with California once it halted ordinary business operations in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">But that does not end our inquiry. Even if Cassiar had severed any California connections long before the time of suit, it still may be subject to the state\u2019s specific jurisdiction if it has (1) purposefully derived benefits from California activities, and (2) the subject lawsuit is \u201crelated to\u201d or \u201carises out\u201d of its California contacts. (See <em>Vons Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seabest Foods, Inc., supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 446.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">It is not true, as Cassiar has suggested, that jurisdiction is being sought merely because \u201cwe sold asbestos fiber anywhere in the world and it somehow wound up in California in some form, in some manner Cassiar had nothing to do with.\u201d Neither is jurisdiction invoked solely because of conclusory allegations in an unverified complaint. <em>(Goehring </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 894, 909 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 105].) \u201cMerely knowing the product will enter California\u201d does not comply with constitutional minimum contacts requirements; instead, the foreign defendant must have \u201csome control over [the] ultimate destination\u201d in California. (As <em>You Sow </em>v. <em>Crawford Laboratories, Inc., supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at p. 1869.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 declarations show\u2014and Cassiar does not dispute\u2014that Cassiar sold thousands of tons of raw asbestos fibers directly to California locations for some 38 years. Far from fortuitous or random connections, the record shows Cassiar purposefully directed raw asbestos fibers to these California sites. It was Cassiar, not plaintiffs, that formed a \u201csubstantial economic connection with this state.\u201d To require Cassiar to answer plaintiffs\u2019 complaint \u201cis not to allow a third party unilaterally to draw [Cassiar] into a connection with the state; rather it was [Cassiar and the California-based manufacturers] who established the connection.\u201d <em>(Vons Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seabest Foods, Inc., supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 451.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">In <em>As You Sow </em>v. <em>Crawford Laboratories, Inc., supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th 1859, 1869, the court relied upon evidence of 16 discrete sales by an Illinois paint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>manufacturer over a 6-year period as substantial evidence of purposeful availment in a Proposition 65 lawsuit regarding the adequacy of warnings of hazardous materials. Even though its California sales never amounted to more than 1 percent of its total sales, specific jurisdiction was established because the manufacturer \u201cpurposefully consummated business arrangements with California companies on 16 separate occasions so it could profit from the products\u2019 use in California.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1871.)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">It was equally foreseeable that asbestos fiber which was directed by Cassiar <em>to </em>California would be used <em>in </em>California and could give rise to tort litigation in California. Cassiar has \u201cknowingly avail[ed] itself of the benefits accruing from its activities within the forum . . . .\u201d <em>(Felix </em>v. <em>Bomoro Kommanditgesellschaft, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at p. 116.) We conclude from this history that Cassiar intended to serve the California market, thereby becoming subject to its specific jurisdiction for lawsuits having a \u201csubstantial connection\u201d with its forum activities. <em>(Vons Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seabest Foods, Inc., supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 452 [\u201c. . . as long as the claim bears a substantial connection to the nonresident\u2019s forum contacts, the exercise of specific jurisdiction is appropriate\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Cassiar attacks plaintiffs\u2019 showing of a \u201csubstantial connection\u201d between its California asbestos sales and plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. According to Cassiar, \u201cyou can only have specific jurisdiction if the cause of action arises out of those contacts with the state. If [it does] not, the state case has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>specific jurisdiction. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical they come up with some evidence to show that Cassiar\u2019s sales into the State of California have something to do with these plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">For jurisdictional purposes, we find no legal support for Cassiar\u2019s insistence upon (as counsel urged during oral argument) a \u201cplaintiff-specific link\u201d between its California sales of raw asbestos and the underlying litigation. Indeed, <em>Vons, </em>the leading California authority, expressly rejected similar efforts to impose such strict requirements in specific jurisdiction cases. In its place, the Supreme Court chose a \u201crelaxed, flexible standard, rather than one requiring that the plaintiff\u2019s claim arise out of the forum contact in any narrow sense. . . <em>(Vons Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seabest Foods, Inc., supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 455.) A unanimous court stated, \u201c. . . the defendant\u2019s forum activities need not be directed at the <em>plaintiff </em>in order to give rise to specific jurisdiction. . . . [T]he nexus required to establish specific jurisdiction is between the defendant, <em>the forum, </em>and the litigation [citations]\u2014not between the plaintiff and the defendant. . . . [T]he relevant contacts are said to be with the <em>forum, </em>because it is the defendant\u2019s choice to take advantage of opportunities that exist in the forum that subjects it to jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 457-458.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><em>Vons </em>involved an E. coli outbreak at various Jack-in-the-Box restaurants in the Pacific Northwest allegedly caused by contaminated hamburger patties from a Vons meat packing plant in El Monte. Vons, which became embroiled in litigation in California, sought indemnity from WRMI, a Washington State franchisee, for mishandling the meat, which WRMI purchased and cooked in Washington. WRMI challenged Vons\u2019s efforts to bring it into a California forum because Vons failed to demonstrate that its tort liability had anything to do with its contacts with the California-based franchiser. According to WRMI (and the Court of Appeal), \u201c. . . unless the forum contact <em>proximately caused </em>the occurrence that injured the plaintiff,' the connection between the contacts and the claim is insufficient to permit the exercise of specific jurisdiction.\u201d (14 Cal.4th at p. 461.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The Supreme Court rejected a mechanical proximate cause test for evaluating the connection between a nonresident defendant\u2019s forum activities and a plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. <em>(Vons Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seabest Foods, Inc., supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 463.) The court stressed that the relevant standard was painted in \u201crelatively broad terms\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 468) and formulated in the disjunctive: the cause of action either must \u201c \u2018arise out of <em>or </em>be \u2018related to\u2019 the defendant\u2019s forum activity in order to warrant the exercise of specific jurisdiction . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 451, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Instead of a bright-line rule, the Supreme Court chose the amorphous \u201cgoal of fairness\u201d <em>(Vons Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seabest Foods, Inc., supra, </em>14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Cal.4th at p. 468), recognizing \u201c \u2019 \u201cfew answers will be written \u2018in black and white. The greys are dominant and even among them the shades are innumerable.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 475.) There is a sliding scale or continuum between the defendant\u2019s contacts and the plaintiff\u2019s claim \u201cso that the greater the intensity of forum activity, the lesser the relationship required between the contact and the claim.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 453.)</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The connection between plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and Cassiar\u2019s forum-based activities meets the <em>Vons </em>relatedness test. Plaintiffs who were exposed to asbestos fibers within California are suing Cassiar only because it purposefully sold asbestos fiber in this state. Cassiar\u2019s obligations (if any) to plaintiffs are connected to its California-based activities. The goal of fairness to defendants is met by extending the burdens of California jurisdiction over a defendant who purposefully availed itself of the benefits of selling asbestos fibers within the state. Since plaintiffs were harmed \u201c \u2018while engaged in activities integral to the relationship [Cassiar] sought to establish, we think the nexus between the contacts and the cause of action is sufficiently strong to survive the due process inquiry at least at the relatedness stage.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Vons Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seabest Foods, Inc., supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 470.)</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Our conclusion does not necessarily mean, as Cassiar contends, that it will be subject to jurisdiction in California in all asbestos cases, even those that do not involve plaintiffs exposed to fiber from Cassiar\u2019s California sales. (Cassiar gives, as an example, a plaintiff who was exposed to asbestos in Chile but who subsequently moved to California where he got sick and died.) According to the continuum described in <em>Vons, </em>\u201c \u2018as the relationship of the defendant with the state seeking to exercise jurisdiction over him grows more tenuous, the scope of jurisdiction also retracts . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Vons Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seabest Foods, Inc., supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 448.) Unlike the proffered analogy of a foreign defendant, a foreign sale and a foreign exposure, the instant case involves California contacts, California plaintiffs, and a California exposure. Plaintiffs have shown the requisite connection between their causes of action and Cassiar\u2019s sales of asbestos fiber to California.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">In insisting these 10 plaintiffs provide facts at the jurisdictional stage directly linking their claims with its asbestos sales, Cassiar ignores the Supreme Court\u2019s caution against mixing tort concepts with jurisdictional ones because the two are \u201centirely unrelated.\u201d <em>(Vons Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seabest Foods, Inc., supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 464.) A foreign defendant who has voluntarily chosen to affiliate itself with a forum \u201creasonably must anticipate exposure to litigation in the forum beyond claims that are in a narrow sense proximately caused by forum activities.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Other courts agree. For example, in <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>CSR Ltd., supra, </em>279 Ill.App.3d at page 1046 [666 N.E.2d at page 10], an Australian supplier of raw asbestos fiber challenged Illinois\u2019 jurisdiction because of the plaintiff\u2019s failure \u201cto show that its blue fiber, and not that of another corporation, is responsible for [his] injuries and death . . . .\u201d The court tersely responded the supplier had \u201cconfused jurisdictional issues with causation and proof issues. The jurisdictional issue before us is preliminary to, and independent of, any determination of the merits of [plaintiff\u2019s] claims.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As one commentator observed, \u201cWe must avoid a \u2018mini-trial\u2019 on the jurisdictional issue.\u201d (Weintraub, <em>A Map Out of The Personal Jurisdiction Labyrinth </em>(1995) 28 U.C. Davis L.Rev. 531, 547.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Concerns about plaintiffs\u2019 deficiencies of proof should be addressed through the substantive law of torts. If, as Cassiar contends, plaintiffs lack substantial evidence that their injuries were caused by exposure to its asbestos fibers, then Cassiar may have a way out before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Where, as here, plaintiffs have established sufficient minimum contacts to pass constitutional muster, the burden shifts to Cassiar to make a compelling case as to why jurisdiction is unreasonable. <em>(Vons Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seabest Foods, Inc., supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 449.) Cassiar has not done so. California has a strong interest in providing a forum to the 10 California residents who experienced occupational exposure to asbestos on California jobsites. Cassiar is not a stranger to California litigation <em>(Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Cassiar Mining Corp., supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th 148) and has agreed to forum jurisdiction over asbestos-related claims arising from its California-based sales. It makes little sense to require these plaintiffs to pursue the vast bulk of this complex asbestos litigation against 161 defendants in California, but to file a separate lawsuit against Cassiar, the 162nd defendant, in British Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">This is not <em>Asahi Metal Industry Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>480 U.S. at page 106 [107 S.Ct. at page 1029], where a Taiwanese manufacturer of a motorcycle tire tube sought indemnity in California from a Japanese manufacturer of its valve assembly. Cassiar already has anticipated being called into account in California for the consequences of sales of asbestos directed to this state. In light of these factors, it is reasonable to assert specific jurisdiction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The petition for writ of mandate is denied. Exercising our discretion per California Rules of Court, rule 56.4, we decline to immediately award costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>in this interim proceeding; however, such costs may be awarded to the party ultimately prevailing in the discretion of the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Sills, P. J., and Bedsworth, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Other state courts have stressed this point in declining to extend jurisdiction over foreign mining companies who shipped raw asbestos ore into the national stream of commerce outside the forum state. (See, e.g., <em>In re Minnesota Asbestos Litigation </em>(Minn. 1996) 552 N.W.2d 242, 247 [\u201c. . . the plaintiffs must show that CSR intended to directly or indirectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>market its product in Minnesota or that CSR delivered its asbestos into the stream of commerce with the expectation that it would be purchased by customers in Minnesota\u201d]; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>(R.I. 1997) 694 A.2d 701, 703 [\u201c. . . there are no allegations or other evidence in the record to suggest that CSR purposefully availed itself of the privileges, benefits, and protections of doing business in Rhode Island\u201d (italics omitted)]; <em>CSR Ltd. </em>v. <em>Link </em>(Tex. 1996) 925 S.W.2d 591, 596 [\u201c. . . the record contains no evidence that CSR took any act purposefully directed toward selling or distributing the raw asbestos fiber in Texas. Absent such a purposeful act, foreseeability alone cannot create minimum contacts between CSR and Texas\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"A1n\">That, of course, is not our case. As discussed above, the record shows Cassiar purposely directed its activities and products toward California by selling raw asbestos to \u201cdiscrete locations\u201d within the state. Direct sales of raw asbestos to the forum satisfies specific jurisdiction even under the \u201cstream of commerce plus\u201d view adopted by a plurality of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Asahi Metal Industry Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1987) 480 U.S. 102, 112 [107 S.Ct. 1026, 1032, 94 L.Ed.2d 92] (plur. opn. by O\u2019Connor, J.); see <em>Felix </em>v. <em>Bomoro Kommanditgesellschaft </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 106, 117 [241 Cal.Rptr. 670, 69 A.L.R.4th 1]; <em>As You Sow </em>v. <em>Crawford Laboratories, Inc., supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th 1859; and <em>W.R.
