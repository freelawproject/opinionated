Stat. (1983) (landlord and tenant proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-17\">Dade County contests neither the dismissal nor the amount of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>fee award, but suggests that because Malloy was represented by Legal Services of Greater Miami, Inc. (Legal Services) without charge, any fee award would constitute reversible error. Dade County argues that <em>Florida Patient\u2019s Compensation Fund v Rowe, </em>472 So.2d 1145 (Fla. 1985) mandates (at page 1151) that \u201c . . . in no case should the court-awarded fee exceed the fee agreement reached by the attorney and his client.\u201d Since Malloy\u2019s agreement with Legal Services was for the legal representation to be gratis, Dade County should incur no obligation in excess of that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">We do not adopt that reasoning. <em>Rowe </em>deals with the issue of <em>how much, </em>not <em>whether. </em>Reexamining and clarifying <em>Rowe, </em>the Florida Supreme Court in <em>Standard Guaranty Insurance Co. v Wuanstrom, </em>\u2014 So.2d \u2014 (15 FLW 523) (Fla. 1990), established three categories of attorney\u2019s fee cases. The matter before us falls into the category of public policy enforcement cases, under which twelve factors are to be considered, only one of which is the fee arrangement. The Court in <em>Quanstrom </em>agreed with the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Blanchard v Bergeron, </em>109 S.Ct. 939 (1989) as to public policy enforcement cases, and stated (at 15 FLW 525, and referring to <em>Blanchard): </em>[:Q]</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">There, the Court held that a contingency fee arrangement between a plaintiff and his counsel is only one factor to be considered and cannot, standing alone, limit the trial judge\u2019s discretion in setting a reasonable fee. The Court expressly held that the contingency fee agreement does not serve as a cap in determining a reasonable fee, stating: The trial judge should not be limited by the contractual fee agreement between plaintiff and counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The Florida Supreme Court went on to observe that public policy attorney\u2019s fees actions are design \u201c ... to encourage individuals to institute actions because such private litigation would substantially benefit society.\u201d Citing a commentator, the Court noted that private enforcement would be unlikely if individuals lacked the funds to retain counsel. Fee awards, therefore, help to implement legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">We add that there would be less incentive to avoid violation of public policy enactments if there were no exposure to an adverse fee award simply because the aggrieved citizens happened to be represented pro bono.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">We therefore hold that an attorney\u2019s agreement to represent a client without charge or obligation in a public policy enforcement case, does not prevent an award of statutorily authorized attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
