He signed a document acknowledging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>he had been advised of his right to counsel and that he intended to employ his own attorney. He also signed a written Waiver of Jury Trial form, which states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-3\">\u201cMy right to a jury trial having been first duly explained to me, I hereby waive my right to trial by jury and request that I be tried by the court without a jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">On that date the case was set for trial on January 9, 1989. On November 30, 1988, counsel filed a praecipe of appearance and demanded trial by jury. The State furnished discovery, pursuant to counsel\u2019s demand. The case was set for trial in the South County Courthouse, where there are no jury trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">It should be noted that counsel has practiced criminal law in Palm Beach County for many years and should be aware of the fact that there are no jury trials in the South County Courthouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">On January 9, 1989, appellant showed up for trial, accompanied by counsel. Counsel stated he did not know his client had waived jury trial, that the case had \u201ckind of snuck up on\u201d him. The Court responded by stating that on November 15, 1988, Bivona told the court that counsel would represent him and had instructed him what to do. The State had produced its witnesses and was ready to proceed to trial. The trial court denied the Motion for Jury Trial and ultimately found Bivona guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Appellant argues that since he was unrepresented at the time he executed the Waiver of Jury Trial, the waiver is a nullity. This is patently absurd. One need not have the advice of counsel in order to waive jury trial, <em>United States v Tobias, </em>662 F.2d 381. The eleventh hour assertion of right to jury trial is nothing more than a blatant attempt to delay justice and to frustrate the State\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">That an attorney as experienced as defense counsel filed a praecipe and demanded discovery, but was unaware of the waiver of jury trial, strains credulity. For now we are willing to grant the benefit of the doubt. But there is a limit to our endurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">COHEN, COLBATH, JJ. - concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
