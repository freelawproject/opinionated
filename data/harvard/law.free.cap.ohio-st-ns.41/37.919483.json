See 74 Ohio Laws, 168. This statute is remedial, and should be liberally construed. Dwarris\u2019 Statutes, 615; <em>Chateau </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>2 Ohio St., 114; <em>Thomas v.

But it is claimed that public policy requires that our courts should give a restrictive construction to this statute so as to relieve railroads from its operation. &gt;</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-7\">We maintain that such argument has no force and should not prevail. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>La Crosse &amp; M.

The statute regarding liens upon buildings, bridges, etc., which was in force when the bridges in question were erected (74 Ohio Laws, 168, \u00a7 1), and which the Revised Statutes re-enacted (\u00a7 3184 <em>et </em>seq.), in plain and unqualified terms provides for such liens. It applies to <em>all </em>bridges. It enacts that any person who shall perform labor, or furnish machinery or materials for erecting <em>any </em>bridge, by virtue of a contract with the owner, shall have a lien, etc. There are no words of restriction or limitation in the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>It does <em>not </em>provide that any person who shall perform labor or furnish materials for erecting a bridge by virtue of a contract with a natural person, shall have a lien, etc. On the contrary, the language is \u201c by virtue of a contract with <em>the owner.\u201d </em>It does <em>not </em>provide that any person who shall perform labor or furnish materials for erecting a bridge by virtue of a contract with the owner, <em>unless such owner shall \u25a0be a railroad </em>company, shall have a lien, etc. On the contrary, the provision is as unlimited and comprehensive as to the persons, whether incorporated or unincorporated, <em>for </em>whom a bridge may be erected, as it is as to the person <em>by </em>whom it may be erected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-4\">Such statutes are remedial in their character. Their 'principles are believed to be founded in natural justice and equity, in that he who should have enhanced the value of the real estate by his labor, or by the materials supplied in its erection, shall have a preferred claim on the property to 'secure the payment for such labor or materials.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-5\">If the legislature had intended that so important a limitation upon the plain and comprehensive terms used in the statute, viz., \u201c bridges,\u201d \u201cbuildings,\u201d \u201c owners,\u201d as that which would exempt from its operation all buildings and all bridges that may be erected or repaired by every railroad company in the state, it would not have been left to judicial construction. It would have been a very easy matter to have expressed such limitation. By section three of the act of May 1, 1871 (68 Ohio Laws, 107), \u201cpublic property\u201d was expressly exempted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-6\">The statute is, in every respect, as comprehensive concerning liens on bridges as it is regarding liens on buildings. Undoubtedly, if the statute applies to buildings which may be erected or repaired by a railroad company, it in like manner and by force of the same language applies to bridges which may be erected or repaired by a railroad company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-7\">Now, that such statutes give a lien upon buildings of a railroad company, for work done or materials furnished in their erection or repair, has been decided. These decisions rest upon the most satisfactory and conclusive reasons; they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>demonstrate that a building for a railroad company is as clearly within the letter and spirit of such statutes as any other building. <em>Botsford </em>v. <em>New Haven ete.

Now, the amended petition contains a description of the railroad and also of the particular parts of land on which the bridges stand. The averment quoted by counsel is in a subsequent paragraph. Taking all these allegations together, and fairly construing them, the averment means that the affidavit contains a description of the railroad as well as of the particular parcels of ground on which the bridges stand. But it is immaterial, so far as the validity of the lien is concerned, whether such is the fact, or the affidavit described only the railroad or only the particular parcels of land on which the bridges stand; and this for several reasons. In the first place, if too much ground is covered by the affidavit or claim, the lien will be restrained to and enforced against the proper amount, upon the hearing of the petition for its enforcement. In the second place, the court will, as in the case of a vendor\u2019s lien upon a part of the right of way of a railroad, order the whole road to be sold. <em>D., H. &amp; B. R. R.

The contract was not entire but severable and the lien was therefore void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-6\">It appears from the contracts set forth in the petition of the plaintiff in error:</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-7\">1st. That by the terms of the contract each bridge to be built was a separate and distinct structure, having a separate and distinct location.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-8\">2d. That the material for each bridge was to be carried by the railroad company for the plaintiff in error to a different place.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-9\">3d. That a distinct and different time was provided for the construction of each bridge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-10\">4th. That each bridge had its own, and a different price.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-11\">5th. That each bridge was to be settled for on completion, and separately paid for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-12\">Now it cannot be successfully claimed that the plaintiff in error did not have a right to demand settlement under the contract for each' bridge so soon as it was completed, and that independently of the state of the work upon any of the other bridges.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-13\">The fact that the contract for each bridge was contained in one and the same writing is an immaterial circumstance, so long as the writing contains a separate contract for each structure. 2 Parsons on Contracts (2d ed.), 29, and cases there cited; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>10 Ohio St., 333; <em>Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>Wakefield, </em>121 Mass., 92; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>5 Met., 452.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-14\">Inasmuch, therefore, as the contract was a several one for each bridge, the plaintiff could not take one mechanic\u2019s lien upon all the bridges for the amount due him, nor datft his lien from the beginning of the work on the first bridge ; and his lien is, we submit, therefore, invalid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-15\">2d. Did the right to a mechanic\u2019s lien exist in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>plaintiff in error upon the railroad, or any part thereof, even though the part upon which the lien was sought was a structure formed like a bridge ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-5\">The original cross-petition of the plaintiff in error alleged that the lot of land which the plaintiff described in the affidavit filed to secure its lien, was the railroad itself. The amended petition sets forth that each bridge stands upon a <em>parcel </em>of land, which is described as co-extensive with each bridge; and then avers that said several parcels of land, on which said respective bridges are situated, are parts and parcels of the Springfield, Jackson &amp; Pomeroy R. R., and then gives a general description of the railroad.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-6\">The amended petition then avers that the affidavit filed for the lien contained \u201c a description of the lands on which said bridges stand and were erected.\u201d So that, we submit, it is fairly to be inferred that the only description contained in the affidavit of the \u201c lot of land \u201d on which the bridges stood was a description of the railroad.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-7\">If the term \u201c lot of land \u201d can be fairly applied to any part of the line of a railroad it could only refer to the right-of-way upon which its entire line was located and constructed. The statute certainly never intended to give a lien to a mechanic upon that part only of the land of the owner which was actually covered by the structure, and sever it, irrespective of consequences, from the tract upon which the structure was situate, and in connection with which it was designed to be used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-8\">The portions of the railroad, upon which the plaintiff in error now claims to have a lien, are, when separated from the railroad, incapable of any use as bridges, or for any other purpose, and are of no value when thus separated, excepting for the purpose of being torn down and removed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-9\">We do not deny that the statute gave a lien upon a bridge, because there are plenty of such structures which are complete in themselves, and capable of valuable use as such. <em>McPheeters </em>v. <em>Bridge </em>Co., 28 Mo., 465.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-10\">Full effect, therefore, can be given to our statute without construing it so as to include a railroad, or any part thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>The mechanics building and furnishing the abutments of the bridges and the embankments which formed the approaches thereto, the ties and iron, and, indeed, all the work done upon the line of railroad, necessary to create a structure over which cars can be driven, have each alike contributed towards the building of the one entire structure, and under the decisions in Ohio <em>(Choteau </em>v. <em>Thompson, 2 </em>Ohio St., 127), all of them would have equal liens, if the mechanic\u2019s lien statute applied to a railroad or any part thereof, upon the structure which they had jointly created for the payment of their labor and materials.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-4\">A railroad is a distinct species of property. It is neither land nor a lot of land; but is a structure composed of many parts, constructed with a great variety of material, which, with the franchise with which the structure is inseparably connected, constitutes the railroad.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-5\">It is conceded that no mechanic\u2019s lien can be had upon the railroad, but the plaintiff in error claims that it has a lien upon a part of the railroad, which it calls \u201c a bridge.\u201d <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>44 Cal., 28.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-6\">Now, upon what shall the plaintiff in error have its lien, if not upon the railroad ? Shall it include, besides the particular material which plaintiff has furnished, the abutments built by another contractor? the approaches built by still another? that portion of the right-of-way over which the structure built by the plaintiff in error extends? Why extend its lien to the right-of-way ? Of what use is it to the structure of the plaintiff in error considered separately ? Neither the connecting embankment, nor the abutments, nor the right of way serve any useful purpose in connection with the work performed by the plaintiff in error, except some franchise be connected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-7\">The reason why our statute does not extend mechanics\u2019 liens to railroads is that, in the building of these great and beneficent public works, such large sums of money are required that it is necessary to authorize the corporation building them to mortgage their present, and <em>future to be acquired </em>property, together with their franchises and income, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>in order to secure the means necessary to pay the contractors who are to be engaged in the construction of the work.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-5\">If, now, the lien of this mortgage were to be made subject to a lien by the contractors engaged in building the road, it would simply be impossible ever to obtain the money to build a railroad, excepting through a capital stock ample for that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-6\">Now it is within the knowledge of every one that sufficient capital stock cannot be obtained to build a railroad, and the law, of necessity, therefore, gives protection to those furnishing the money on the faith of its mortgage bonds by omitting a mechanic\u2019s lien in favor of the contractor; because through these mortgages the funds are provided with which to pay the contractor for the labor and materials necessary in the construction of the road. <em>Rutherford &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Ry.

The law under which this lien is claimed reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">\u201c Any person who shall perform labor or furnish machinery or materials for constructing, altering or repairing any boat, vessel, or other water craft, or for erecting, altering, repairing or removing any house, mill, manufactory, or other building, appurtenance, fixture, bridge, or other structure, by virtue of a contract with the owner or owners, his or their authorized agents, shall have a lien to secure the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>ment of the same upon such boat, vessel or other water craft, or upon such house, mill, manufactory or other building, appurtenance, fixture, bridge or other structure, and the interest of said owner or owners in the lot of land on which the same shall stand or be removed to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">It will be observed that in describing the bridge, or kind of bridge upon which a lien may be had, the words \u201c any bridge\u201d are used. These words, if given their ordinary meaning include a railroad bridge. No restrictive words, excluding a railroad bridge from the operation of the statute, appear. The statute is so comprehensive that it includes all kinds of bridges.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">It has been suggested in argument that we may find that the General Assembly did not intend that a lien should extend to railroad bridges. This intent does not appear from the words of the statute. Indeed, they express an intent contrary to that which the defendant in error would have us find.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">We have been told that to place a lien upon railroad bridges would seriously interfere with the interests of traffic and trade; that it would be against public policy, as such action would impede the construction of railroads, and that such a lien would be difficult of enforcement. On account of these reasons it is said that the legislature could not have intended to fix this lien upon this class of bridges. These are arguments proper for the legislature to have considered prior to the act of 1874, and which it is presumed to have weighed. If the language used by the legislature in a statute is precise and unambiguous, we conceive it to be our duty to interpret the words in their natural and ordinary sense, although the result may conflict with our ideas of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The arguments which have been advanced, with force and skill, to exclude railroad bridges from the operation of this statute would apply with equal aptness to bridges owned by turnpike companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">A turnpike bridge is a part of an entire thing, to wit: the public road, owned by the turnpike corporation. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>subject such a bridge to mechanics\u2019 liens would seriously incommode the public and injure traffic and trade. Turnpike bridges belong to a distinctive class of bridges just as plainly as do railroad bridges. It makes a draft upon one\u2019s credulity, to believe that the legislature when it used the words \u201cany bridge\u201d intended to point out a turnpike bridge, but had no reference to a railroad bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Bridges constructed and owned in Ohio by corporations, organized for that sole purpose, invariably connect parts of a public highway. To subject them to a lien, to sell them and to take them away would seriously interfere with public interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Exempt all these bridges from mechanics\u2019 liens and all in the way of bridges left to be affected by the statute would be bridges constructed by private persons upon their lands. These are few in number and of little value. We cannot believe that it was the intention of the legislature to give a mechanics\u2019 lien upon these alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">It has also been said that the reason why our statute does not extend mechanic\u2019s liens to railroad bridges, is that in the building of great and beneficent public works \u2014 such as railroads \u2014 such large sums of money are required, that it is necessary to authorize the corporation building them, to mortgage their present and future to be acquired property, together with their franchises and income, in order to secure the means necessary to pay the contractors who are to be engaged in the work of construction; that if the lien of this mortgage was to be made subject to a lien by the contractors engaged in building bridges, it would be simply impossible ever to obtain the money to build a railroad, excepting through a capital stock ample for that purpose. It does not occur to us that this result would necessarily follow. In Ohio a railroad -company is required to have a capital stock, and in most cases it is very large. A railroad company is also authorized to issue bonds and mortgage its property in an amount not exceeding the amount of its capital stock. If the capital stock usually subscribed before the work upon a railroad is commenced is actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>paid, it would be sufficient to largely forward the work of construction when prudently expended. If this should be done and then a loan made upon mortgage bonds, money enough would be procured to easily complete the railroad and pay all engaged in its construction. The bond-holders would have behind them as security:</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">1st. The' work completed with the money procured by the stock subscriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">2d. The work, rolling-stock, equipment, etc., paid for with the money advanced upon their bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">3d. The liability which our constitution and statutes attach to the holders of stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Such is the theory of our law in regard to railroad building. The right of a mechanic or builder to have a lien upon a railroad bridge will not interfere with or embarrass companies, who propose to build railroads in this way. It may interfere with companies proposing to build railroads entirely upon borrowed money and without any paid up capital stock. If the giving of these liens will have a tendency to cause the theory of our statutes to be practiced, the statute giving the lien is in accord with sound public policy and is promotive of the value and permanency of railroad securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">In <em>Railroad </em>v. Lewton, 20 Ohio State Reports, 401, it was held that one who sold a strip of land to a railroad company to be used as a part of its right of way and roadbed, has an equitable lien upon the land so sold. And it was further held in the same case, that \u201c when the right of the public to maintain the continuity of a public highway precludes the right to sell a section of a railroad, a necessity arises to decree the sale of the whole road in order that equity may be done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">In this case, the right of the public to maintain the continuity of the Springfield, Jackson &amp; Pomeroy railroad, precludes the right to sell the section or sections of the railroad upon which these bridges are situated. It follows, then, that to protect the lien of the mechanic, the sale of the whole road must be decreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>It appears from the pleadings that under the contract the plaintiff in error built six bridges. Was this contract an entirety for the building of six bridges, or must it be treated as a several contract between the parties for the building of each of the six bridges ? As the most certain way of making the character of this contract known we have caused it to be given in full in the statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">We conclude that it must be treated as one contract and not as six contracts. When the bridge companj'- made this agreement in writing and agreed to its terms, it undoubtedly was influenced by the fact, that it was securing one job of work consisting of several bridges. The railroad company was also govered by the same consideration. The number of bridges to be built is not mentioned in the contract, but it provides for the building of all the bridges upon the line of the road between two specified points. It does not provide a price certain to be paid for each bridge, but this depends upon the length of the span. The object sought' to be accomplished by this contract was not to secure the construction of one bridge, or of two bridges, but of all the necessary bridges between two designated points, so that the road could be operated as a railroad. In its characteristics this contract does not differ from the one which was held to be an entire contract in <em>Steamboat Wellsville </em>v. <em>Geisse, </em>8 Ohio St., 333, and we conclude that the contract now in controversy was an entirety and so treat it.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b69-7\">Granger, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AO\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">When the decision in this case was announced on February 5, 1884, I concurred. Although I did not believe that the members of the legislature, in fact, intended to authorize a mechanic\u2019s lien upon a railroad bridge, it then seemed to me that they had so used the word \u201cbridge\u201d in the statute, that the courts must hold that, in law, the intent to create the lien existed. I then felt, as strongly as I do now, that the effect of such legislation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>unfair towards all who furnish material and labor for the construction of other parts of a railway; that it was contrary to the previous legislative policy that had never given such a lien for labor or material furnished in constructing a part of any structure without expressly extending that lien to the whole structure; and that it would greatly embarrass railroad companies in negotiating the loans so essential to the building of their roads. But I also believed that the legislature had the legal power to give a lien to the builder of a bridge, and to omit to give one to the builder of a railway embankment; to change its policy; to make unwise laws, and that the power of courts over statutes was limited to the enforcement of the legal meaning of their words construed in the light of subject matter and context.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">There remained upon the docket another cause between the Smith Bridge Company and another railroad company in which the same question existed. The importance and difficulty of the question justified the court in delaying the entry of judgment in this case until after full argument of the other. Such argument and my own study and reflection have convinced me that the word \u201cbridge,\u201d as ordinarily used, does not include a railroad bridge, and I was unable to concur in the judgment sustaining the lien in the second case. It is unnecessary to report both causes, and I therefore recall my concurrence in the decision announced in February, and here briefly present the reasons for my dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In its widest sense the word \u201cbridge \u201d applies to any sort of structure extending from one point of support across an open space to another point of s\u00fcpport, and of sufficient strength to permit the transit of some material object. But the usage of the people often takes charge of a word, and so applies it, that, when uttered, or written, without accompanying words, or context, the hearer, or reader, understands that the speaker, or writer, refers to one of a particular class of objects, instead of any one of many classes embraced by the fullest meaning of the word. Before any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>railroad was constructed the word \u201cbridge\u201d in connection with roads and highways had, by the people, been thus applied to structures across streams for the passage of travellers in ordinary modes. A road led up to each end of such a structure. The traveller left the road and entered upon the bridge, and again left the bridge and took to the road. Constructively, in a legal sense purely, the road sometimes crossed the bridge, and the bridge was, sometimes, in like manner a part of the road; but actually, in fact, the bridge was distinct froan the road. Popularly then the word \u201c bridge \u201d came to mean a structure whose <em>primary </em>object was the support of persons, animals and vehicles while crossing a stream or ravine. This meaning belonged to the word when the first railroad bridge was built. What is the <em>primary </em>object of such a bridge ? What is the thing being constructed while it is being built? A railroad is a structure consisting mainly of a track, on which trains of cars, drawn by movable steam power, carry freight, and generally passengers. This track is formed of iron rails laid upon cross timbers, and is so supported a^ to make the grades practicable for the traffic intended. This support varies with the character of that portion of the earth\u2019s surface traversed by the road. Sometimes it is solid rock cut down to grade, the bottom of a \u201c cut \u201d or \u201c tunnel\u201d; the name depending upon the absence or presence of a roof. At other points this track rests upon an embankment, or passes along the even surface of favorable ground. Where the earth has been cut into drains for the passage of water necessity has required supports of still different kinds; and such parts of the railroad are for convenience named culverts, trestle work, bridges. For various good reasons many of these supports called bridges are constructed with sides and tops. One reason for this is the greater strength supposed to result from this form ; another may be the better protection of the material from the influence of the weather.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">But the one thing made, built or constructed \u2014 the entirety \u2014is \u201c a railroad.\u201d The <em>primary </em>object of a railroad bridge is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>to enable a railroad to cross a stream, or ravine, and to support the railroad in position. The railroad crosses the bridge. Railroad passengers simply travel on the railroad. When two things are alike only in principle, or in their general purpose, ordinary language calls them by different names. I think that ordinary usage, long before the passage of the act before us here, spoke of all bridges on ordinary highways (whether public, or private, turnpikes, or dirt roads) as simply \u201c bridges,\u201d and of bridges under railways as \u201c railroad bridges,\u201d or so connected the word \u201c bridge \u201d with other terms as to indicate that a bridge on a railway was intended. In which sense did the legislature use the word \u201c bridge \u201d in the mechanic\u2019s lien acts ?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">It may be useful to trace the history of Ohio legislation upon the subject of mechanics\u2019 liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In 1823 (Chase, 2160), was passed \u201c An act to create a lien in certain cases.\u201d This authorized a mechanics\u2019 lien upon \u201c any house, boat, vessel, or other water craft, building or buildings, erected or constructed, after the taking effect of this act\u201d within Cincinnati. In 1833 this act was extented to Fulton township, Hamilton county.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The act of March 12, 1840, extended said act to the counties of Hamilton, Washington, Montgomery, Scioto, Muskingum and <em>Knox; </em>and so broadened it as to \u201c extend the lien to all mechanics, laborers and furnishers, for the value of their labor, skill and materials, jointly or severally, therefor, on contract with the owner or owners, for all repairs, additions, or improvements, upon any house, boat, vessel, or other water craft, building or buildings whatsoever.\u201d (38 Ohio Laws, 115, 116).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">On March 11, 1843, the first general \u201cmechanics\u2019 lien law \u201d was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">The first section of this act (Swan, 1854, p. 551), authorized a lien upon a \u201c house, mill, manufactory, or other building or appurtenance, and <em>the lot of ground upon which the same shall stand.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">The second section enabled one who did work or furnished material for a first contractor to secure a lien upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>the moneys coming to him under the contract by a notice to the owner. The marginal notes to the act call such persons \u201cmiddlemen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In May, 1871 (68 Ohio Laws, 107), this second section was so amended that such a \u201c middleman \u201d could, by notice to the owner, acquire a lien upon moneys due from him to the first contractor for work or material furnished for a <em>bridge, </em>road, turnpike, street, <em>railroad, &amp;o.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In March, 1875 (72 Ohio Laws, 166), the first section of the act of 1848 was amended by substituting the words \u201c for erecting, repairing, removing, raising or lowering,\u201d instead of the words \u201c for erecting or repairing,\u201d and by inserting after the words \u201c or appurtenance \u201d the words \u201c or any portion thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">At the same time said second section was again amended by introducing the words \u201cremoval, raising, lowering,\u201d and by substituting \u201c apparatus \u201d for \u201c appurtenance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The act of March 31st, 1874 (71 Ohio Laws, 50), entitled \u201cAn act to secure pay to persons performing labor or furnishing materials in constructing railroads,\u201d required railroad companies to provide, in the contract for the construction of a railroad, \u201c <em>or any part </em>thereof,,\u201d for the payment of the labor, materials, &amp;c., before any part of the contract price is paid to the contractor, and made the railroad company directly liable to the persons engaged under the head contractors in furnishing material, performing labor, furnishing board, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Although this act seemed to accomplish the intention expressed in its title, sections 3207 to and including 3210, Revised Statutes, are yet more comprehensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">But, prior to the enactment of the sections last named, the act of May 4, 1877 (74 Ohio Laws, 168), was passed. This was intended as a revision and amendment of prior mechanics\u2019 lien laws, and it repealed the acts of 1843, 1871 and 1875. In this act the word \u201cbridge\u2019\u2019made its first appearance in the first <em>section; </em>the section granting a lien to the first contractor upon structure and lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">The third section provided, \u201c That any person who shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>perform labor or furnish materials for constructing, altering, or repairing any street, turnpike, road, sidewalk, way or drain, ditch, or sewer, by virtue of a private contract between him and the owner or owners of lands abutting thereon, his or their authorized agents, shall have a lien \u201cfor the payment of the same against said lands,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">I remark, in passing, that while a railroad is \u201c a road,\u201d and in certain connections is, in speech and writing, called \u201c the road,\u201d it is apparent that the word \u201c road \u201d in this section, must be construed in its ordinary and popular sense, and that if the company happened to own any abutting land no lien thereon could be acquired under this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The rights of \u201c middlemen \u201d are provided for in the tenth section of the act, and no one is aided by it unless his sub-contract relates to the construction, alteration, removal .or repair of any property, appurtenance or structure, as described in the said first and third sections of this act.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">It should be noted that this act repealed (as already stated) the act of 1871, under which a sub-contractor on a railroad was treated as entitled to all the rights of a middleman. It <em>expressly </em>provided for all persons recognized by the act of 1871, either as lien holders or as middlemen, except those doing work or furnishing materials for \u201c a distillery\u201d or \u201ca railroad.\u201d It is possible that respect for the views of advocates of prohibition caused the omission of <em>express </em>protection to any contributor to the erection of a distillery, but no such reason can be supposed for the omission of \u201crailroad.\u201d I am satisfied that the legislative intent then was to treat the act of March 31, 1874 (71 Ohio Laws, 51), as sufficient for all \u201c persons performing labor, or \u201c furnishing materials, in constructing railroads, or any part thereof,\u201d and therefore no reference to. a railroad was made by the act of 1877.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">I think a careful review of this legislation justifies the following conclusions: -</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\"><em>(a) </em>The tendency has been to make no distinction between those contributing to the construction of anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>upon which a lien is given, except by placing original contractors in one class, and sub-contractors in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">(5) No lien upon a railroad has ever been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">(e) Unless the word \u201cbridge\u201d in the act of 1877, includes a \u201crailroad bridge,\u201d in no case has a lien been authorized upon a part of a structure unless under the like conditions, a lien upon the whole of that structure was expressly provided for.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Finding then that the word \u201c bridge,\u201d before and in 1877, was popularly used in different senses; that generally it did not include a railroad bridge unless that meaning was indicated by the context or the circumstances under which it was used, I now think that it falls within the power, and is a duty, of the court to determine in which sense the legislature used the word in 1877.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">In <em>Rutherford </em>v. <em>The R. R. Co., </em>35 Ohio St., 559, the supreme court decided that the act did not authorize a lien upon a railroad. The opinion of the majority of the court in this case well shows that a lien upon the bridges can only be enforced by treating it as, in effect, a lien upon the railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">The result of the holding determines that the legislature granted a special privilege to one class of persons furnishing labor and materials for the construction of a railroad. It seems to me that such a result is by itself sufficient to demonstrate that, if the word \u201cbridge\u201d as used in the act is fairly susceptible of either of two meanings \u2014 one of which escapes such a result, the General Assembly intended <em>that </em>use. Thus the real difference between the majority of the court and myself may be considered as limited to this single point: I hold that in 1877, the word bridge in ordinary parlance did not include a railroad bridge, and that the legislature used it in that ordinary sense. The majority think otherwise. While thus announcing my dissent, I do it with a strong sense of the difficulties that environ the question.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
