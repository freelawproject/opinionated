But that act was repealed, and the act of February 20th, 1874, was in force at the time the mortgage was recorded. But the Continental Life Insurance Company did not do a banking or other kind .of business in connection with insurance. The testimony shows that it is and was an insurance company, engaged exclusively in life insurance, and that under the powers contained in its charter it loaned its money as investments of its surplus capital. The statements made by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, in his brief, that it did .a banking business, are entirely without foundation, except in his own imagination. Therefore, this law does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-4\">But these laws do not declare that the acts done by such prohibited companies shall be void. They do no more than require that the insurance commissioner shall not give a certificate of authority to such' a company to do business in Ohio, or if such company is doing business, to require him to revoke the authority. If such company is doing business in the State, then all its acts are valid. <em>The Union Mutual Life Insurance Company </em>v. McMillan, 24 Ohio St., 67; <em>Lamb </em>v.

And the same principle applies, of course, to a contract of loaning money as to a contract of insurance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>The Continental Life Insurance Company is authorized by its' charter to invest its funds in loans upon mortgage securities, but there is no limitation as to the rate of interest for which it may contract. Therefore, under the terms of its charter, it may contract for any reasonable rate of interest. There is no prohibition as to the rate, and, therefore, so far as its charter is concerned, there can be no illegality in any contract it may make as to the rate of interest. 14 Ohio, 6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-5\">It will be noticed that all of the Ohio cases, in which the contracts of corporations are held void, turn on the <em>prohibition or limitation </em>contained in the charters. Had there been no prohibition, the reason of the decisions would have failed, and as there is no limitation or prohibition in the charter of the Continental Life Insurance Company, we submit that these cases are not in point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-6\">These Ohio decisions are against the prevailing authorities in the other States, and of the United States Courts; and the court, in <em>Rock River Bank </em>v. Sherwood, 10 Wis., 238, referring to the cases of <em>The Bank of U. S. </em>v. Owens, 2 Pet., 527; <em>Bank of Chillicothe </em>v. Swayne, 8 Ohio, 252 <em>; Creed </em>v. <em>The Commercial </em>Bank, 11 Ohio, <em>489; Spaulding </em>v. <em>Bank of </em>Muskingum, 12 Ohio, 544, and <em>Orr </em>v. Lacy, 2 Douglas, as cases holding that a usurious contract made by a corporation is void, says: \u201c I am not prepared to follow these decisions. In my judgment, the reasoning in these cases is clearly and successfully and completely answered by the opinions given in the <em>Commercial Bank of Manchester </em>v. <em>Nolan et al., </em>7 How. (Miss.), 508, and <em>McLean, as</em>signee, <em>etc. </em>v. <em>The Lafayette Bank et al., </em>3 McLean, 587.\u201d And, therefore, while these Ohio cases are the law of Ohio, they should be kept strictly within their limits, and should not be applied to the charter of corporations having no limitations or prohibitions. That the supreme court of Ohio recognizes this distinction between charters containing prohibitions and charters containing no prohibitions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>is, we. think, fully demonstrated-by the case of <em>Corwin </em>v. <em>Urbana and Champagne Ins. Co., </em>14 Ohio, 6, given above, and may also be seen by the language of, the court in the case of <em>Ehrman </em>v. <em>Insurance Company, </em>35 Ohio St., 337.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-4\">The loan and securities are .valid ,to -the amount, of the principal, with legal interest. <em>Farmers and Traders' Bank </em>v. <em>Harrison et al., </em>57 Mo., 503; Farmers' <em>Nat.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae\">The first section- of its, charter granted to the insurance company power to. possess and invest effects of every kind, and to su.e. and be sued in all courts of justice. This grant of power clothed the company with capacity to make the loan and take the mortgage and note from Roberts. Did section twelve take away, this capacity? The object of that section is plain. The safety of policy holders required safe investments by the company. This section was intended primarily-for the protection of policy holders and stockholders. No word in it. directly concerned either governmental policy, or community, or third parties; but, as .a whole,, it prevented the pompany from doing a banking business. ,Well-settled;rules require that the courts shall construe its provisions, so as to promote the legislative intent, if this can reasonably be done. The plaintiff in error, insists that because the officers of the company did not <em>literally </em>obey the- legislative direction, and take a <em>bond </em>instead of a. <em>note, </em>therefore the company cannot enforce any lien under the mortgage. This construction would souse a. section intended to secure policy holders and stockholders from loss, by reason of bad investments made by the officers of the company, as to make <em>sure </em>a loss of the .entire principal invested, because of an error in the form of the evidence.of invest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>ment taken by those officers. . Counsel support this claim by Ohio cases from <em>Bank of Chillicothe </em>v. Swayne, 8 Ohio, 280, to <em>Kilbreth </em>v. Bates, 38 Ohio St., 187. Ohio policy as to banks and their powers and privileges. is. clearly stated and enforced in these cases.- Peculiar dangers to the <em>community </em>were supposed to lurk in such corporations. But we can find no evidence of like fears touching insurance, companies that make no attempt to.-exercise banking powers. Legislation has labored to secure, .policy holders and stockholders from losses by the frauds and misconduct of company officers and agents-. It seems,to .us that this current of Ohio authority furnishes no reason for not applying to section twelve of this Connecticut charter the rule,of construction before stated; to wit, that which.will give effect to the legislative intent. -</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">We think that, by taking the note and mortgage, the company <em>substantially </em>complied with ..the charter.- The investment had nothing of the nature of a banking-transaction. Although the. note.was not under seal, it was so worded that, <em>prima </em>facie, it. imported a , consideration. Under Ohio practice and pleading, precisely the same form of petition, or cross-petition, enforces fore closure, or asks for a personal judgment on. the note, as would be used if a bond had been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">Since Judge Hitchcock decided <em>The Bank of Chillicothe </em>v. Swayne, a radical change has. occurred in the relation of corporations to the State and to the people. -Then, and theretofore, special charters granted to-persons.-named, -and to such others as they associated with themselves; gave special powers and rights, that, as a rule, were beyond legislative control: only in the rare cases .where the power to amend, alter, or repeal was expressly reserved,- could the legislature modify, limit, or take away power-once granted. In those days a- corporation <em>was </em>a monopoly. It was necessary to strictly construe the grants made, in order-to protect the interests of the State and of people generally. But now the legislature has far more power over .corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>tions than over individuals. It may alter, or repeal, all acts granting corporate power, it may impose new conditions of its exercise. It can mould the statutes as experience or legislative caprice may dictate. There is no longer reason to hesitate to apply to the language of acts of incorporation precisely the same rules of interpretation as are applied to like words in <em>any </em>contract or statute. -</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">This charter was granted in Connecticut. Counsel for the bank cite <em>N. Y. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. Ely, 5 Conn., 573. In that case the third, or granting, section authorized \u201c loans on bottomry, respondentia, or mortgage of real estate.\u201d The act there in question was a simple discount of a note. Moreover the sixteenth section of that charter expressly <em>prohibited </em>such transactions by the company. But years afterwards, in 26 Conn., 157, in <em>Vansands </em>v. <em>Middlesex County </em>Bank, the Supreme Court of Connecticut, applying a statute that declared \u201c no bank shall make any loan or discount on pledge of its own stock,\u201d say \u201c the directors of banks whose exclusive business it is to make loans and discounts, and perhaps the banks of which they are the agents, might be amenable to the courts for a violation of this law, if they should disregard its prohibition, as they clearly would be to the legislature; but there would seem to be no sufficient reason why the loan or pledge should be declared void. Especially is it questionable whether it can be \u2022 treated as invalid, in the absence of any provision in the act declaring that the loan or pledge shall be void, or imposing any punishment .for its violation. There is therefore much reason for the claim that the act is only directory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">Although the court did not in that case directly decide whether the words then under consideration were merely \u201c directory,\u201d the opinion plainly indicates that such a provision as the one now before us would not be so construed in Connecticut as to make void either mortgage or note.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Counsel upon both sides have industriously collated the authorities.- It is apparent that the modern cases do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>follow the harsh strictness of the earlier decisions. In different States different distinctions are drawn: the grounds of departure from the old rule are variously stated. For myself, I am content to say that the maxim, \u201c Where the reason of the law \u201d (the common law, \u2014 and our rules of construction are common-law rules) \u201cfails, the law fails,\u201d is a sufficient ground. The corporation of to-day in Ohio is so different from the corporation of Judge Hitchcock\u2019s day, that it would not be exaggeration to say that the two are wholly unlike; that is, in their relations to the legislative power.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">We think, then, that neither under the law*of Connecticut, nor under that of Ohio, is the note and .mortgage of the insurance company invalid because of the terms of the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Proceeding to the second objection, we find no provision in the charter limiting the rate of interest to be stipulated for, or received by, the company. The general usury law of Ohio applies alike to such artificial persons and to natural persons. The note is not void. Only legal interest can be collected upon it. It is unnecessary to cite cases on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">The third claim is based upon section two (2) of the Act entitled, \u201cAn act amendatory of and supplementary to an act entitled, \u2018An act to regulate insurance companies doing an insurance business in the State of Ohio\u2019\u201d (70 O. L., 153), as amended by the act of February 20, 1874 (71 O. L., 12). It reads thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-8\">\u201c Section 2. No company or corporation organized under the laws of any other State, or of the United States, or of any foreign government, doing a banking or any other kind of business in connection with insurance, shall do business in this State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">A note running for five years, drawing interest payable semi-annually, and secured by mortgage on real estate, made and given for a loan of money made by mortgagee to mortgagor, is not such a note as belongs to \u201c banking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>business.\u201d'- Owing to' circumstances a banking house sometimes may make such a loan, but when it does so it engages in a transaction outside of \u201cbanking business.\u201d This is too well known to require further remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">In making such 'a loan, did the company \u201c do any other kind of business \u201d within the purview of said section?</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">It is a necessary part of'insurance business to make payment of policies, when the money thereon becomes due. Would the'care of-that money be \u201cdoihg any other kind of business \u201d? '\u25a0 Would the deposit of that money in some bank, upon certificates of deposit drawing interest, be such \u201cother business\u201d? Is the placing of that money in the hands of the policy holder in his lifetime, upon his secured promise to pay interest thereon, \u201c such business \u201d ?</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Is not the care of the money required to pay policies a necessary part of the insurance business itself? Is not the lawful investment of that money* so'that its interest will pay taxes and commissions, and strengthen the company, <em>et </em>part of the insurance business itself?</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The act: containing' said section- 2' (see 69 O. L., 141), recognizes this fact. \u25a0' The first section authorizes the company \u201c to carry on the business of insurance.\u201d Under that simple general power, the legislature supposed that the company could make investments' of its capital. The act nowhere 'expressly <em>\"grants </em>power to invest. Section 6 recognizes the power as impliedly granted by section 1, and proceeds to limit it by making it \u201cunlawful to invest\u201d otherwise than said section 6 provides. This section is very similar to section 12 'of the Connecticut Charter. Is not this a legislative construction ? . \u201c To carry on insurance business \u201d implies the power to make investment of the moneys required to pay policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Moreover, section 18, of'the same act (69 O. L., p. 156) requires each'foreign company to'have at least $100,000 of its capital invested <em>in bonds and mortgages on unincumbered real estate in this </em>State, or in other, specified securities. If the making of loans and the taking of mortgages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>be \u201cany other kind of. business .in- connection with \u2018insurance,\u2019 \u201d section 2 seriously conflicts with section 18. We think this objection also unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u25a0 Under objections two and three, or under one of them, the bank urges that the rule of the company under which loans are made to policy holders only, invalidates this note or mortgage-. We are unable to understand why this should be so. Such a rule tends to increase the legitimate business of the company, and also to secure the loan itself. We think the judgment of the district court giving prior payment to the insurance' company was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b29-7\">Martin, J'., did not sit iii this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
