E. Ingalls was the duly appointed and acting receiver of the Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Lafayette Railroad Company. Stephen Eagan was his local ticket \u2022agent in Cincinnati. He had sole charge and control of dbe sale of passenger tickets issued for Ingalls\u2019 railroad, and sold at the local office in Cincinnati; but his authority was limited to sales for cash. Frank, the plaintiff in error, was a railroad ticket broker in Cincinnati, but did not know of the limitation put upon Eagan\u2019s authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-13\">Eagan and Frank had known and been acquainted with \u2022one Fordyce for nearly one year and a half prior to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>time. Fordyce had frequently purchased railroad tickets from Eagan to sell upon the street and to ticket brokers, and had received such tickets from him properly marked with the stamp of his office, but with the understanding that he would return the tickets or bring the money for them. This Fordyce did, except in the case now under consideration. During the period of their acquaintance Frank purchased from Fordyce tickets issued by Eagan to the value of some two thousand dollars, which had\u2018always been honored by the officers of the railroad. Mr. Ingalls never knew of, nor assented to, these transactions between Eagan and Fordyce.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-5\">On the 14th of February, 1879, Fordyce went to the ticket office and stated to Eagan that he had a customer for four railroad passenger tickets to Pueblo, Colorado, at the same time, showing a postal card purporting to be signed by one Bishop, and in which he ordered from Fordyce four tickets to Pueblo. Four tickets, of the value of $45.50 each were delivered by Eagan to Fordyce, properly stamped and ready for use, upon condition that they should be returned in the evening if not sold, or the money therefor ($182) if sold. The tickets contained these words: \u201c This ticket entitles the holder to one first class passage to Pueblo, Colorado.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-6\">On the same day Fordyce sold these tickets to Frank for the sum of $160. Frank purchased the tickets in good faith, and without knowledge of the circumstances under which they were held by Fordyce. Fordyce disappeared without paying the money to Eagan or to any one representing the receiver. The next day Ingalls, the receiver, commenced an action against Frank, and replevied the tickets from him. The court of common pleas found the ownership of the tickets in Frank, and rendered judgment accordingly. The district court reversed this judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b575-7\"><em>Alfred </em>Yaple, for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-8\"><em>First. </em>\u2014 A railroad passenger ticket which specifies that it entitles <em>the holder </em>to one first class passage from one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>place to another, is negotiable, and passes by mere delivery from the holder to a purchaser. 2 Daniels Neg.

In the case of <em>C. C. &amp; C. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Bartram, </em>11 Ohio St., 457, it is spoken of as \u201c a convenient symbol to represent the fact that the bearer has paid to the company the agreed price for his conveyance upon the road to the place therein designated.\u201d Again, in the case of <em>Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>36 Ohio St., 647, it is said that a railroad ticket \u201c is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>simply a voucher that the person in whose possession it is, has paid his fare.\u201d Lawson, in his work on \u201c Contracts of Carriers,\u201d \u00a7 106, p. 116, saj^s \u201c that a railroad or steamboat ticket is nothing more than a mere voucher that the party to whom it is given, and in whose possession it is, has paid his fare and is entitled to be carried a certain distance,\u201d and supports his definition by the citation of numerous decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">It thus seems to be well established that a railroad ticket is a receipt or voucher. It has more the character of personal property than that of a negotiable instrument. When the possession of such a ticket has been obtained by fraud the company has parted with the possession of it, but not with the title to it, and the person purchasing from the holder, although for value and without notice of equities, takes no better title than the party had who fraudulently obtained possession of it. We do not perceive that the holder of such a ticket is in any better position than the <em>bona jMe </em>purchaser of goods from one in possession, for a valuable consideration, and without notice of any defect in his vendor\u2019s title. Such a purchaser cannot be protected against the title of the true owner in a case where the vendor had fraudulently obtained his possession and without the knowledge or consent of the owner, although previous to such possession he had, by false and fraudulent representations, induced the owner to enter into a contract for the sal\u00e9 of the goods. <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>22 Ohio St., 388; <em>Hamet </em>v. <em>Letcher, </em>37 Ohio St., 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">From the facts found by the court below it appears that the possession of the tickets in controversy were obtained from Ingalls, receiver of the railroad company, by the fraud of Fordyee, and we conclude that Frank, the purchaser from Fordyee, obtained no title thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Eagan, the agent of the receiver, authorized to sell such tickets, and stamp and deliver the same upon receiving pay therefor, did not bind his principal when he stamped and delivered the tickets, without his knowledge or consent, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>a third person, to be sold by him, and to be paid for when sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">\n<em>\u2022Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
