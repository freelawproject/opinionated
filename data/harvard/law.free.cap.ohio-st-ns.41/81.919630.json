Reserved in the District Court of Ottawa County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-16\">In the township of Danbury, Ottawa County, Ohio, is a triangular body of water named \u201cEast Harbor.7\u2019 It is separated from Lake Erie partly by a narrow strip of land, described in a survey made in 1808, thus: \u201cThe dike, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>gravel bar, between the lake and marsh is from six to twelve rods wide, and about eight feet high,\u201d and partly by an island similar to the \u201cdike\u201d in composition, width and height. The island is a little more than two miles long; the \u201c dike \u201d about one mile.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-4\">The dike runs nearly west from the main land; the island runs northwesterly. Between dike and island is an inlet from the lake, about six rods wide and about eighteen feet deep. The western end of the island curves to the west and south, and there a narrow water passage connects \u201cEast Harbor\u201d with another like body called West Harbor. At the extremity of the island, another \u201cinlet\u201d connects West Harbor with the lake. In this case \u201c East Harbor \u201d is thus described:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-5\">The body of water is about two miles long east and west, and at the widest point is two miles north and south. It is an irregular triangular shape. The water varies in depth and rises and falls with the water in the lake.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-6\">There is a channel or current extending westerly from the mouth of East Channel, through about the central part of the harbor and northerly to West Harbor. The water is from five to ten feet deep in this channel, and increases in depth as it nears the mouth, and decreases in depth towards the shores on either side. The average depth of water in East Harbor is about six feet. Unaffected by the wind the current in the channel would be out and towards the lake all the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-7\">Boats drawing from four to six feet of water have entered East Harbor frequently through East Channel outlet, and occasionally through West Channel, and loaded wood, timber and sand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-8\">The shore around the greater part of East Harbor is well defined, and is not subject to overflow by the rising of the water in the lake or harbor, except at the west end where the harbor ends in a marsh, and a rise in water of a foot would cover several acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-9\">.

The state also directed a survey to be made at the expense of the grantees, to contain within its limits 500,000 acres, and for this purpose, a traverse was run along the shore of the lake. The grantees were then incorporated under the name of \u201c The Proprietors of the Half Million Acres of Land lying south of Lake Erie.\u201d The land was laid out into townships and sections, and the Township of Danbury was described as follows: Bounded on the north and east <em>by the shore of Lake </em>Erie, southerly and easterly by the shore of Sandusky Bay, and on the west by the United States land. Section Two, which contains East Harbor, was described as bounded on the north by <em>the shore of Lake </em>Erie, on the east by Section One, on the south by Sandusky Bay, and on the west by <em>the Third and Fourth Sections.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>In order to ascertain the proportions in which these lands should be held by the grantees, the loss of each individual was found in pounds, shillings and pence, and as considerable: time elapsed before partition was made, many of the sufferers assigned their claims, but instead of conveying any definite quantity of land, they simply conveyed values in pounds, shillings and pence.

Thus, while jurisdiction passed to the United States, ownership of soil \u2014 land and water \u2014 by express conveyance, sanctioned by the sovereign power, vested in the state, (represented by its governor) in trust for its grantees.

Its east and west lines were parallel running from Sandusky Bay to the main body of Lake- Erie. Actual surveys show that in the part of the section not covered by water, there are about 70 acres on the island; and about 3050 on the main land. Unless then the water of East Harbor, and the ground under it, be included, there is a deficiency of at least one thousand acres in the section. The actual area of the harbor is about 1145 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">On the 19th day of January, 1811, Franklin conveyed all his interest in the section to three grantees: To James Stevens one-half, and to Isaac Ambler and James Skelding one-fourth each.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">On the 28th day of February, 1811, Chappell conveyed all his interest in the section to five grantees, to wit: Seymour Jarvis, Frederick Scofield, William King, Azariah Scofield and Josiah Lockwood, Jr.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">The section was then owned by these eight in common, and, while so owned, the tillable land was laid off in lots numbered from one to twenty.

On the 10th of December, 1877, Thomas Hogg began a civil action, in Ottawa common pleas, against the heirs and grantees of Jacob Ramsdell, and the unknown heirs, grantees and devisees of Stevens, Ambler and others. His petition averred that plaintiff owned in fee simple one undivided fourth part of \u201cAll that part of said section two, (2) bounded on the north by the shore of Lake Erie, on the east by section one, (1) on the south by lots thirteen (13) to twenty, (20) inclusive, and on the west by the west line of said section two, (2) containing about fourteen hundred acres;\u201d that Jacob Ramsdell in his life time claimed to own 78 acres; that in 1846 he had conveyed the 25 acres to Lockwood who had held adverse possession for more than twenty-one years; that Ramsdell\u2019s heirs and their grantees claim the remaining 53 acres (of the 78); that the other defendants are entitled to shares in said premises. The prayer was to have plaintiff\u2019s one'full and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>equal one fourth- part set off to him in severalty; that in so doing due regard may be had to the 25 acres of Lockwood, and for such other and further relief as may be right and proper. The heirs of Ramsdell and their grantees answered claiming title in themselves to the entire premises, denying plaintiff\u2019s title, and setting up the 21 years\u2019 statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-4\">A reply traversed. all new matter in the answer. An amendment to the petition asked for an account of rents and profits by those defendants who had been in possession. To this said defendants answered thus: They deny the allegations of said amendment \u2014 except they admit that they have claimed and controlled so much of said premises as is capable of private ownership and occupation. And they aver that a good part of said premises as described in the petition consists of open and navigable waters, and is part of Lake Erie, being a mere arm .or bay thereof.

He appealed. The district court referred the case to E. B.. King, Esq., as referee. The case was heard before him and he found the facts to be as hereinbefore stated, and as matter of law reported thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-8\">That the original survey of said Sufferers\u2019 Land, and the - subsequent partition thereof, and the deeds from Chappell and Franklin and Schofield, and from Skelding\u2019s heirs to' plaintiff, included, by the intention of all parties thereto, that portion of East Harbor and bar adjacent, which is now in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-9\">I find that if East Harbor is capable of private ownership, the plaintiff is seized in fee, and entitled to an undivided one fourth (|-) part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-10\">That since 1847 said bar or island, excepting that portion' in section three (3), has been in the possession of Jacob <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Ramsdell till his death, and since his death, of the defendants Pettibone and Beerman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-5\">That their possession has been- open, actual, notorious, distinct, hostile and adverse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-6\">And that the non-residence in Ohio of plaintiff\u2019s grantors as herein before found, does not take the case out of the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-7\">I further find that East Harbor is a bay, arm or inlet of Lake Erie ; that it is not an inland river but a part of Lake Erie, and as such, the owners of land abutting thereon, are bounded bj1- the line at which the water usually stands when free from disturbing causes, and possess such riparian rights as are incident to such ownership, but have no title to or in the water of said harbor or land underneath.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-8\">That the court has jurisdiction in this case upon the pleadings to hear and determine the interests and titles of each of the claimants to this harbor and bar, or any part thereof, and the jurisdiction of the court is not ousted by the fact that the defendants in their answer deny that plaintiff has any title to the premises claimed by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-9\">I therefore find that plaintiff is not entitled to the partition of said premises, as prayed for in his petition, and that he ought to take nothing by this action, but the same should be dismissed at plaintiff\u2019s costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-10\">The plaintiff moved before the referee for a new trial, and took a proper bill- of exceptions showing all the evidence. He also filed, in court, exceptions to the report.

It was to \u201c run eastwardly along the shore of the lake, taking all the indents of the same,\u201d and it was to be a <em>boundary </em>of the lirelands, and it was. The half-million acres was included in a space, bounded by that traverse or the traverse made by Ruggles as one of its lines.

It was certainly the northern boundary of the section, and must have been supposed, at the time, to be the south and west shore of the lake. And we can see no reason, why the owners of the lots, (if the original proprietors, Franklin &amp; Chappell had made no other transfer of it,) would not be entitled to it by running their lines to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>lake shore, in accordance with the rules laid down in <em>Clark </em>v.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeG\">Did the denial of plaintiff\u2019s title oust the jurisdiction of the court? The claim that it did is based upon the theory that the issue so made is only triable by a jury. But equity courts have long exercised the power to decide finally upon the right of adverse claimants to real estate, where- the nature of the controversy properly called for the interference of a chancellor. A bill to establish and enforce a trust gave him jurisdiction to hear and determine its existence and extent, and to enforce it, in a proper case, by compelling a conveyance- by the defendant as trustee, notwithstanding his answer denied the entire title of the plaintiff. In this class of cases, as well as in a number of others, the fact that the decision of a judge, without a jury, might divest one in possession of the whole estate, does not affect the jurisdiction. The principle controlling is well known: where a party cannot have <em>adequate </em>and <em>complete </em>relief at law, he may apply in equity; and the chancellor, taking jurisdiction, retains it so far as may be necessary to furnish relief <em>adequate </em>and <em>complete. </em>A careful consideration of the position and relations of tenants in common of realty will satisfy the mind, that when a cotenant has gone into possession and refuses to recognize the title of the owners of the other undivided shares, an ordinary suit at law will not furnish to them adequate and complete relief. In the Ohio <em>statutory proceeding </em>for partition the court could not exercise chancery or equity powers, and was limited to the mode and extent provided by the statute. There would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>seem to be good reason for holding that those statutory powers could only be exercised on behalf of parties whose title at law was not disputed. But a civil action seeking equitable partition, together with an account of rents and profits, properly invokes the ordinary chancery powers of the court, and therefore upon the principle hereinbefore named, an answer denying plaintiffs title could not oust the jurisdiction. So it was well held in <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Richardson, 27 </em>Ohio St., 110. And the referee was right in so holding in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Is East Harbor capable of private ownership ? An absolute sovereign, holding both ownership and jurisdiction of land and water, may vest in a private grantee such portions of either, as the grantor may determine. A sovereign whose powers are limited by constitutional provisions may do the like, so far as the grant does not contravene any constitutional provision or limitation. So long as navigable waters are left free to the public, for unembarrassed passages to and fro, we know of no reason why'the United States, or any state, holding ownership and jurisdiction of land and water, may not vest in a private grantee such a body of land, marsh and water as \u201c East Harbor.\u201d History is full of instances of the exercise of such power by governments, and instances in which the courts have protected such a grantee against intrusion are not rare.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The ocean, with its gulfs and bays, belongs to no nation. <em>Jurisdiction </em>is allowed to such a distance from shore as the protection of that shore requires. This distance was fixed as a marine league at a time when no gun could force a ball farther. But over inland waters the nations in which they lie may hold, both as sovereigns and as proprietors. A proprietor may convey all his rights to a grantee unless forbidden by some law to which he is subject. No one not possessed of some right in the thing granted should be heard in objection. Where the grantor is the government, the thing granted government property held by absolute title, and no use of the thing granted to which the public is entitled is taken away, we see no reason for denying to the grantee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>ownership of the thing granted. In <em>Lorman </em>v. Benson, 8 Mich., 32, Judge Campbell, speaking of Detroit river, says: \u201c Applying the principles of the common law to the tideless stream in question, we do not conceive what public interests would be subserved by placing it on the footing of tidewaters, when the rules applying to public fresh water streams provide amply for every common easement. The right of navigation, to which all others are subservient, is in no way injured or abridged by this holding, and the necessities of wharves, and other conveniences, which could not be made available at all in such a stream as this, unless owned by the riparian proprietor (because not accessible except over his grounds), would be an inducement to modify the common law, were it otherwise, rather than change it as it is now. * * * And we have no difficulty in holding that the plaintiff is entitled to every beneficial use of the property in question which can be exercised with a due regard to the common easement. The cutting of ice is the exercise of a valuable privilege, in securing that which has become stationary on the freehold, and we conceive of no reason which would'justify a denial of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In <em>Rice </em>v. Ruddiman, 10 Mich, 139, speaking of lake Muskegon, the court, after stating that the real question is not whether the outward limits of private ownership in the lake can be defined with precision, say, \u201cBut if the water continues so shallow as to render the lands under it susceptible of beneficial private use to the centre line of this narrow lake, then I have no hesitation, in saying that I think the riparian ownership extends to such centre line. * * * If the water becomes so deep * * * as to render the lands under it incapable of such individual use, the question of ownership beyond where it is available for such purpose becomes as barren as the use itself, and is of no practical importance whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">In <em>Delaplain </em>v. <em>Railway </em>Co., 42 Wis., 225, the court say: \u201c The question as to the ownership of the soil under the water, is one which each state is. at liberty to determine for itself, in accordance with its views of local law and public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>policy; and if it chooses to concede the right of the riparian owner to the centre of the stream, it is not for others to raise objections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In <em>Barney </em>v. Keokuk, 4 Otto, 338, the court say: \u201c If they (the states) choose to resign to the riparian proprietor, rights which properly belong to them in their sovereign capacity, it is not for others to raise objections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">In <em>Gavitt </em>v. Chambers, 3 Ohio, 497, the court said: \u201cIt is, we conceive, vitally essential to the public peace, and to individual security, that there should be distinct and acknowledged legal owners for both the land and water of the country. This seems to have been the principle upon which the common law doctrine was originally settled; that where a stream was not subject to the ebb and flow of the tide, it should be deemed the property of the owners of the soil bounding upon its banks. The reason upon which this rule is founded, applies as strongly in this country as in any other. And no maxim of jurisprudence is of more universal application, than that where the reason is the same the law should be the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">In the cases referred to, the courts were dealing with implied grants, resulting from bounding the premises granted by a stream, or other water. What they say applies with additional force when the state owning both the water and the land, by express terms includes within its grant the territory covered by the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">We think it was competent for Connecticut, with the-sanction of the United States, to vest in its private grantee-the ownership of East Harbor, subject to the public rights-of navigation and fishing. Did the state include East Harbor in its grant ?</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">As already stated it granted 500,000 acres to be bounded on the west by the west line of the \u201cReserve,\u201d south by latitude 41\u00b0, north by \u201c the shore of Lake Erie,\u201d and to extendi eastward for the quantity. What was \u201c the shore of Lake-Erie \u201d referred to in this grant? The same words described the north line of \u201c section two.\u201d Was the northern edge of' island and dike \u201c the shore of Lake Erie ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>In one sense all of its bays and harbors are parts of the lake. In another sense the name \u201cLake Erie\u201d embraces only the main water, excluding land-locked bays and harbors. In which sense were the words used as between the state and its grantees ?</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The map shows that the island is a continuance of \u201c the Dike,\u201d following the trend of the lake shore; that it is made an island because the action of the water has opened, or kept open, two narrow passages called \u201cinlets.\u201d A \u201c traverse \u201d of the lake shore was made prior to 1808, and its line followed the outer, or lake, side of both dike and island; the field notes styling East Harbor \u201c the marsh; \u201d and describing the eastern inlet as \u201c a good harbor for small boats and is about six rods wide, and deep.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">It does not appear that the state has ever asserted any ownership of the harbor since the grant of 1792. In the first partition its entire surface was certainly computed as part of section two, and aparted to Franklin and Chappell. Their deeds, as well as those of their grantees, assert title to \u201c the marsh.\u201d Under these facts can there be doubt that the state used the words \u201c shore of Lake Erie \u201d in the popular sense ? Her grant was 500,000 acres. In measuring off that quantity, section two was computed as 4120 acres. \u25a0 To now hold that the harbor was not granted is to deprive the grantees of the state of at least 1000 acres. To do so because the public has fished and hunted, <em>ad </em>libitem, on this marsh, or water, seems to us without warrant. As was held in <em>Sloan </em>v. <em>Biemiller, </em>34 Ohio St., 514, the right of fishing in Lake Erie and its bays is as open to the public as if they were subject to the ebb and flow of the tide. No mere grant of the land covered by such waters destroys this public right. The private grantee of the land cannot do anything that will interfere with the channel, or hamper the passage of water craft through it. But he may, without the limits of the channel, erect fishing houses or such other structures as his means and the depth of water will permit; he may convert shallow portions into cranberry patches; he may fill up other parts and make solid ground. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>such action by him may lessen the water surface available for the fishing boats, the fishermen cannot complain. Such public right to fish always yields to any permanent improvement by the owner of the land on which the water rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">How much of East Harbor can be advantageously used by its private owners the record does not tell. It is evident that parts of it may be so used. The private ownership subject to these public rights may be of small value. But it is of some value, and those who own it are entitled to have their respective shares set apart.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Jacob Ramsdell entered into possession of the island and of the 25 acres adjoining lot 18, of section three, in 1846, and he and his grantees have since held possession. But he entered under a deed which recited that so much of the premises granted as lay outside of lots 8, 9 and 20, was \u201c holden in common \u201d by his grantor with \u201c Isaac Ambler and others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">He had full right to so enter. Having so entered, his possession continued referable to that deed; continued to be that of one tenant in common, until by unmistakable acts of which his co-tenants had notice, or of which it was their duty to take notice, he disclaimed to hold as a tenant in common, and asserted ownership of the entire estate. Until 1877, he and those claiming under him were the only owners resident near the premises. He collected some rents; granted some permits; drove off some trespassers; and paid the taxes. All these were acts that as tenant in common in possession he had a right to do; all of them were perfectly consistent with his being only a tenant in common. Until they were informed that he claimed to be sole owner, his co-tenants might well regard his receipt of rents as merely compensation for looking after the property; or as a matter to be settled and adjusted between them. There is no evidence tending to show that, prior to 1877, any co-tenant had any information that their title was disputed by any adverse claim. Ramsdell\u2019s quitclaim of the 25 acres to Lockwood has resulted in enabling Lockwood by lapse of time to hold that tract as against plaintiff, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>a court of equity will treat that as so much of Ramsdell\u2019s share already set off to him, and diminish the quantity now to be set apart for his heirs and their grantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">We see no reason to disturb the findings of fact made by the referee as stated separately from his \u201cfindings,\u201d or conclusions of law. Giving to the evidence full faith and credit so far as it is favorable to the defense, we think it establishes the title of the plaintiff, and his right to an equitable partition and account. We sustain the exceptions to so much of the findings and conclusions of law set out in the report of the referee as conflict with our holding. The court, under section 5213 Revised Statutes, has the same powers in reviewing its decision as it has over the judgment of a trial court. Proceeding to render the judgment required by the record, we grant to the plaintiff a decree for such partition and account, and remand the cause to the common pleas for execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
