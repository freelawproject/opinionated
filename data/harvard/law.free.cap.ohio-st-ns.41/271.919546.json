Stat., sec. 5535; <em>Spinning </em>v. <em>Ins. &amp; Tr. Co., </em>2 Disney, 336; <em>Collier </em>v. <em>Bickley, </em>33 Ohio St., 523.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-12\">When the action was begun jurisdiction attached, and it was error to dismiss it for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-13\">2. This was a proceeding by attachment, and the court acquired jurisdiction by the issuing of process, predicated upon the requisite affidavit and the attaching of property. <em>Lessee of Paine </em>v. <em>Mooreland, </em>15 Ohio, 435; <em>Lessee of Cochran Heirs </em>v. <em>Loring, </em>17 Ohio, 409.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-14\">\u25a0 3. Sections 4987 and 4988 do not apply to this class of cases. Their application is expressly limited to Chapter 2, Div. 2, Title 1. They simply fix a period at which an action is deemed commenced, so as to save the running of the statute of limitation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-15\">4. Proof of publication was made on the 15th day of April, and the motion to dismiss was filed on the 20th day of May, 1881. So that if even service were necessary to complete the jurisdiction of the court, it had full jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of the action at the time the motion was filed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-16\"><em>John D. Sears, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Martin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-I\">In August, 1879, Bacher sued Shawhan, a non-resident, in the Common Pleas of Wyandot County for money paid; and at the same time an order of attachment was issued and levied on the defendant\u2019s land. The summons was returned \u201c not found.\u201d In March, 1880, an affidavit for publication was made, and service by publication was in due course completed. In May, 1880, the defendant appearing for the special purpose moved to dismiss the action, which was sustained for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The district court affirmed the judgment, and it is now sought to reverse the judgment of affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">It is suggested that these judgments rest on the assumption that under section 4988 Rev. Stats., the court lost jurisdiction, because the attempt to commence the action was not followed by service within sixty days. That section is found in the chapter providing limitations of actions and reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">\u201c Section 4988. An attempt to commence an action shall be deemed equivalent to the commencement thereof within the meaning of this chapter, when the party diligently endeavors to procure service; but such attempt must be followed by service within sixty days.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">It will be observed that the restrictive words \u201c within the meaning of this chapter,\u201d confine the operation of the section to matters concerning the limitations of actions. It seems to us that the legislative intent was to prevent parties from indefinitely prolonging a suspension of the statute by a mere attempt to sue. We thinlc this construction is in harmony with kindred provisions. Sec. 5560 Rev. Stats., found in the chapter on attachments, provides that from the time of the issuing of the order of attachment, the court shall be deemed to have acquired jurisdiction. And under Sec. 5055 Rev. Stats., when the publication is made the action is pending so as to charge third persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">We are not aware of any statutory provision ousting the jurisdiction for plaintiff\u2019s delay or neglect. The court has control over its docket and may dismiss for failure to prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>cute. This power of course is quite different from a mandatory duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In this case the action was dismissed before the expiration of rule-day for answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
