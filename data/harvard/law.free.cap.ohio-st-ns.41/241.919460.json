D. 1864, Martha, the widow, was dead ; so much of the \u201cresidue\u201d as\u2019was personalty had been consumed; Ann was living with her husband and was the mother of nine children. Six of these were minors. The only \u201c residue \u201d then remaining consisted of certain farming lands, and some lots in, or adjacent to Circleville. Part of this was not only unproductive, but had been, for twenty years, an expense to the estate; and the income from the whole of it was materially insufficient for the support of Ann and her children. Thereupon Ann, whose full Christian name was Elizabeth Ann, suing by her next friend, began a civil action in Pickaway common pleas making her husband, her children, and the persons who would be entitled to said residue in case of her decease leaving no child surviving her, defendants. Her petition, after stating the other material facts, and describing the remaining real estate, proceeded thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-10\">\u201cThe plaintiff says that on or about the third day of April, 1855, said Martha Darst died. That the plaintiff is the first devisee for life under said will, if she is not a: devisee in fee simple. That doubts have arisen as to whether your petitioner is entitled to a fee simple, or life estate in the said lands. And your petitioner being desirous of selling said lands is not able to do so on accouiit' of apprehension in the minds of some persons as to the title. The petitioner further says that a part of said real estate is unproductive, and has been an expense for twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>years. That there is no personal estate now remaining of said testator. That all his debts have been paid. That it is necessary to sell said-real estate in order to support said petitioner and her children; that said sale will be for the benefit of the petitioner and do no injury to the heirs in remainder, if there are any. Your petitioner prays that said will may be construed by the court, and the question determined whether she may under any circumstances, and if so, under what circumstances, sell said lands in fee simple; and that the court may order the same, to -be sold, or in case the court shall refuse to order and adjudge a sale under the aforesaid prayer, then your petitioner asks a sale of the same under the \u2018Act to-provide for the sale or lease of estates tail in certain cases,\u2019 passed April 4th, 1859, or for such relief as may be just and proper.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-4\">The summons for the minors and its return read thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-5\">Summons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-6\">\u2018\u2018 <em>State of Ohio, Pielcaway County, ss:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-7\">\u201c <em>To the Sheriff of said Piehaway County:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-8\">\u201c You are commanded to notify Lucy Bierce, Frank Bierce, aged 14 years, Harriet D.

Matthews </em>and <em>Matthews &amp; </em>Shoemaker, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-9\">That the intention of the testator was not to have the land sold, is evident from these considerations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-10\">First. The words of the will are not that all of the property remaining after the death of his widow shall be <em>turned </em>into a fund but that it shall <em>constitute </em>a fund, or in other words, shall <em>be </em>a fund.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-11\">The property is the parts, the fund is an aggregate, and when we say the several parts constitute the whole, we mean simply that they <em>are </em>the whole, the whole being merely the parts considered in the aggregate or in their totality.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-12\">If the land had to be sold before the fund could arise, it would be obviously incorrect to say that the land <em>constituted </em>a fund because, when one or more things constitute another, their cotemporaneous existence is necessarily implied, but in the case supposed, the one goes out of existence in order that the other may arise. I do not mean by this that the land is annihilated but <em>quoad </em>the estate of Darst and as a part of said estate it ceases to exist, and therefore cannot constitute a fund as to said estate. 2 Barb, ch. 22; <em>Baker </em>v. Lorillard, 4 Comst., 257; <em>Pruden </em>v. Pruden, 14 Ohio St., 251.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-13\">The testator describes the subject matter of the devise to. his daughter as the property and in providing for its going over to the children, he says the same shall be equally divided, etc. The same means the same property and nothing else, <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Poyner, </em>1 Drew., 174, and when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>makes provision for the case of the daughter\u2019s death without leaving children, he again calls it the property. The presumption is that he used the word property in the two places in the same sense as describing the same subject matter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-4\">Why did he not say the said fund shall be divided equally, etc., and the said fund shall go to the daughters of my brothers, etc. ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-5\">How can the property constitute a fund for the maintenance of Ann Bierce, etc., during her natural life, and the same go to her children, if any, thereafter, and if not the property to go to others, if Ann could sell the property or the same and spend the money without let or hindrance ? 2 Bigelow\u2019s Jarman on Wills, 61 <em>n.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-6\">You cannot reconcile the entire consumption of the estate with its continued existence at the death of Mrs. Bierce, implied from the devise to her children. How could the property constitute a fund <em>during </em>Mrs. Bierce\u2019s life in any other way than by limiting the maintenance to the income?</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-7\">In <em>Bradley </em>v. Peixoto, 2 Ves. Jr., 324, a condition repugnant to an estate tail was held void. And in <em>Mainwaring </em>v. Baxter, 6 Ves., 460, an express trust inconsistent with' a subsequent devise was held void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-8\">The property was to constitute a fund during the life of Ann Bierce. Constitute is to form or compose as an element. Worcester\u2019s Die. During means \u201cfor the time of the continuance of.\u201d Worcester\u2019s Die. By putting the definitions for the words themselves in the will it would read: \u201c All the property then remaining shall form or compose a fund for the support and maintenance of my daughter, Ann Bierce, and her children for the time of the continuance of her life.\u201d .Or, in other words, shall for the time of the continuance of her life, compose, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-9\">.The court is bound to give effect to every word of the will, without change or rejection, provided an effect can be given to it, not inconsistent with the general intent of the whole will taken together. Bigelow\u2019s Jarman on Wills, *page 472, note 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The argument that there is a trust, and yet that the mother could spend all the property is suicidal in its effect. <em>Pushman </em>v. <em>Filliter, </em>3 Ves. Jr., 7; <em>Malim </em>v. Keighley, 2 Id., 529 a.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-5\">That Mrs. Bierce could spend the fund negatives the idea of a trust. Can there be a trust to fritter away the trust fund? If there can be, what is the object of providing for children? If a testator forbids a sale, then the argument is that the children cannot be maintained. .If he provides that they shall be supported, then the parent can pocket the property. In either event what becomes of the children? <em>Jubber </em>v. Jobber, 9 Sim., 503; <em>Hubbard </em>v. Young, 10 Beav., 203.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-6\">There is no trust involved in Isaac Darst\u2019s will. There is no express devise to the daughter, but it was evidently intended that she should have a life estate. There is no disposition until her death. See Bigelow\u2019s Jarman on Wills, *557. The testator merely gives his reasons or motive for the gift, when he mentions maintenance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-7\">The following authorities sustain this proposition : <em>Gilbert </em>v. Bennett, 10 Sim.,371; <em>Crockett </em>v. Crockett, 2 Phil., 553.; <em>Scott </em>v. Key, 35 Beav., 291; <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>L. R., 7 Eq., 518; <em>Lambe </em>v. Eames, L.

Did she sue as trustee to obtain a construction of the will? Not at all. Who represented the trust estate in the suit below? Nobody.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-9\">It is a fundamental rule in the doctrine of parties, that they are such only in that character, which the statement of the pleadings attribute to them, and in no other. Calvert on Parties, 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-10\">If Mrs. Bierce was suing as trustee why use a next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>friend? The trust is nowhere mentioned in the record, except in the decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-4\">If Ann Bierce was a trustee with a power of sale, would she not, under the law, in case of a sale be obliged to invest .on good security? Could a court authorize her to do any less than her legal obligation ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-5\">The following cases support the positions taken in this brief in every particular: <em>Decker </em>v. Decker, 3 Ohio, 157; <em>Bigelow </em>v. Barr, 4 Id., 358; <em>Howe </em>v. Fuller, 19 Id., 51; <em>Worman </em>v. <em>Teagarden, 2 </em>Ohio St., 384 ; <em>Brasher </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>15 Id., 109; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>13 Id., 95; <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Bowyer, </em>19 Id., 498; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Boggs, </em>20 Id., 560; <em>Huston </em>v. <em>Craighead, </em>23 Id., 206; <em>Gillen </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>34 Id., 352; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>6 Peters, 68.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-6\">The court below also erred in rendering judgment against the infants, because they were not properly served with process.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-7\">Section 69 of the code of procedure provided: When the defendant is a minor under the age of 14 years, the service must be upon him and upon his guardian or father, or if neither of these can be found then upon his mother, or the person having the care or control of the infant, or with whom he lives.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-8\">The service below, even as amended, was not proper, but the court had no power to allow an amendment, as there was nothing in the record to amend by. <em>Doty </em>v. <em>Rigour, </em>9 Ohio St., 526.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-9\"><em>Henry F.

When all the debts are paid he is <em>functus officio. </em>The estate devised to Martha Darst was to be kept by her during her natural life. The testator made no disposition of the fee in direct and apt words. In such case it descends to the heir. In this case it descended to his only child, Ann Bierce, in trust for her and her children during her life, and after her death, to her children.

It required to be changed into money to constitute a fund for that purpose; which fund in whatever shape it might be put would be a trust fund.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-9\">The word \u201cfund\u201d implies a conversion into personal estate. The testator used it in that sense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-10\">The remainder of his estate was to be a common stock, or sum of money for a certain purpose. Unproductive real estate could not constitute a fund or sum of money for that purpose. I\u00f1 order to answer the purposes of the trust it must be sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-11\">\u25a0 Moreover, if the fund was exceedingly small, and wholly insufficient to maintain the said Ann and her children, for more than one year, she might absolutely consume the whole fund for that purpose. It was left to her in order- to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>support and maintain Ann and her children. That was the primary and grand object of the testator. Every other object was unimportant in comparison with this. Consequently, if the support and maintenance of herself and children required the use or total consumption of the fund, it might be so consumed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-4\">Did the testator say that Ann Bierce should keep this fund for her children? He directed that his wife should \u201c keep \u201d it for Ann, but in effect he directed Ann to use it for herself and children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-5\">It is true that the will provides that \u201c at the death of my said daughter, Ann, the same shall be equally divided between her children.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-6\">The word \u201c same \u201d in the sentence just quoted, implies that the fund is to go to the children of Ann Bierce after she and her family have had their support and maintenance out of it, after it has accomplished the first and great object of,the testator. This means what may remain after the fund has been used for the support and maintenance of the family.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-7\">The court is particularly requested to note the fact that the testator does not say, said real estate, said lots or said farm, shall go to the children of Ann Bierce, but he says \u201c the same,\u201d that is, the same \u201c fund.\u201d It is the same fund whether it has been increased or diminished in the life time of Ann Bierce.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-8\">As to amendment of return: The power to all our officers to make amendments is liberally exercised.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-9\">It has been permitted after twenty years, 4 Shep., 124, or as the court say in 7 Humph., 59, at any time. It has been permitted after the officer went out of office, or after he has been sued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-10\">In many of the following cases there -was nothing to amend by except the recollection of the officer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-11\">Parol evidence is allowed to amend a record, and why not a return of the sheriff? <em>Lambert </em>v.

The support and maintenance of Ann Bierce and her children was charged upon the property. The court had jurisdiction in equity to enforce the charge and to subject the property to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-9\">Second. The uncertainty as to the construction of the will and as to the rights of the parties under it, was a cloud on the title and rights of Ann Bierce, who w'as the tenant in possession, and who had therefore a right to come into equity to remove the cloud and to quiet her title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-10\">Third. Ann Bierce was a trustee for her children. She took the legal title by devise or descent, and held it and the property not for her sole benefit, but for the benefit of herself and others. She took and held them for the support and maintenance of herself and her children. This was not a mere passive trust, but was one imposing upon her the active duties of receiving, managing and applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the fund to the support and maintenance of all the beneficiaries.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-4\">The trustee being in doubt as to her power and duties, had the right to apply to a court of equity to define them, and give judicial sanction to her acts, and the court had jurisdiction to direct, assist and protect her in the administration of the trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-5\">The facts are set forth in the petition of Elizabeth Ann Bierce from which her character and capacity as trustee appear. It was unnecessary for her to aver the legal conclusion that she was a trustee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-6\">Mrs. Bierce being a married woman, it was proper that a next friend responsible for costs should be named.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-7\">No objection was taken to her petition for want of legal capacity to sue, or defect of parties.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b268-8\">Granger, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACZ\">The case has been fully and ably argued. Counsel have aided us by exhaustive citations from decided cases. After a full review we are satisfied that a careful reading of the will in the light of the circumstances of the testator and of his relation to the objects of his bounty, plainly indicates its true construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">\u201c The rest and residue \u201d of the estate \u201creal and personal\u201d was to he kept by the widow during her life time. In case, during the widow\u2019s life time, Ann should be deprived of the support of a husband, either by his death, his sickness, or otherwise, Ann could occupy the house and garden on lot No. 11, Circleville, free of charge. From and after the widow\u2019s death, all of the property then remaining, real as well as personal, was to \u201c constitute a fund for the support and maintenance of Ann and her children during her life.\u201d The words \u201c shall constitute a fund \u201d are full of meaning. The word \u201cfund\u201d savors of personalty; it means something that can be invested and reinvested. It included, as we think, the intent, that, if for the increase of income or the full and proper maintenance and support of Ann and her children, any sales of realty should become necessary, such sales could lawfully be made: \u2014 the proceeds taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the place of the lands sold as part of said fund. It was clearly the intent of Isaac Darst that his daughter and her children should be supported and maintained by said \u201c fund \u201d from Martha\u2019s death until Ann\u2019s decease. That support and maintenance was expressly charged upon this \u201c fund \u201d without any word indicating that the charge was to be limited to the income of the fund. In such a case if the income happens to be sufficient the principal must remain intact; but if the income becomes insufficient that cannot relieve the \u201cfund\u201d from its duty. The \u201cfund\u201d must furnish the support.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">But it is' claimed that because the will directs that at Ann\u2019s death <em>'\u2022'\u2022the same </em>shall be equally divided between her children; \u201d and that in case no child of hers survived her \u201c the property then shall be equally divided \u201d between certain nieces of the testator, the charge in favor of the support of Ann and her children ought to be limited to the-income of the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">If a specified parcel of land be devised to A., without further words indicating the estate so given, and the same land is devised \u201c upon the death of A. to B.,\u201d of course A. can hold only as tenant for life and cannot lessen the estate of the devisee in remainder. But \u201c a fund \u201d charged with the support of A. for her life, does not cease .to be \u201c the fund\u201d because some of its principal is necessarily consumed in supporting A. Hence the words \u201c the same \u201d are not so definite as to require, or even to justify, a denial of needed support to Ann and her children during her life, in order to pass to those children, or to her cousins at her decease, the unbroken \u201c residue.\u201d Considering the relation of the testator to Ann, the natural interpretation of his words treats that support as the primary, the paramount object in his mind. He used more words in providing for Ann and her children during her life, than in stating all of his other devises and bequests. The grant for her benefit, standing by itself, is full and complete. We have no right to limit it unless, without we do so, no reasonable construction. can be placed upon the subsequent clauses of the will. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>For myself, the correlation of the words incline me to think that the will as dictated read that \u201cthe property then remaining shall be equally divided between \u201d the nieces; and that by a <em>lapsus pennce </em>the word \u201c remaining \u201d was omitted. The word \u201c then \u201d was unnecessary as an indication of the time for the division. Without it the death of Ann leaving no surviving child determined the time. But treating this thought as of no moment, we regard the words \u201cthe property\u201d in this will as- too indefinite to justify a refusal to Ann and her children of any part of their needed support. The policy of Ohio law is unfavorable to entails. Is it not also so unfavorable to provisions \u201ctying \u201d up property that it will not by liberal construction create such limitations? We do not believe, and the words of the will do not make it our duty to hold, that if the income had been so small that it could not supply Ann and her children with ordinary food and clothing, none of the principal could be applied to preserve .their lives, or health, We may well think that Isaac Darst cared more for his grandchildren than for his nieces; yet the construction claimed by the plaintiffs in error .would, in the case supposed, hasten the death of Ann\u2019s children by exposure and lack of sustenance, in order to transfer to his nieces the fund upon which the support and maintenance of those grandchildren was the primary charge; and that too with the fact before us that the testator expressly preferred to give the whole of that fund to those grandchildren instead of to those nieces.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">It is urged that Ann\u2019s minor children were not properly served. The original return showed that a certified copy of the summons was handed to each minor and one also to their mother with whom they were living. It did not state affirmatively that a copy was left at the usual place of residence of their father. The decree included a finding by the court that all the defendants had been legally served. Oral proof that the mother was at her husband\u2019s home when the sheriff handed the copy to her did not contradict the return. After the formal finding by the court the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>sumption is that the fact was properly proved unless that presumption contradicts the return on the writ. We have no fault to find with the abundance of caution shown by the motion and order that resulted in the filing of the amendment to the return. We think the record shows that the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter and parties. While it was within the power of the trial court to require Ann and her husband before making sales to furnish security that they would properly hold, use and account for the proceeds subject to the control of the court, the omission to use that power was not error affecting the validity or legality of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqh\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
