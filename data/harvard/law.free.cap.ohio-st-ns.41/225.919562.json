Her husband and three children survived her. In 1876 the husband mortgaged his estate by the curtesy to secure his own' notes. The children are still living. The mortgagee by action seeks to sell their father\u2019s said estate and apply the proceeds on the mortgage. The children resist.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b239-8\"><em>Held: </em>Under section 1 of the act entitled \u201cAn act concerning the rights and liabilities of married women\u201d (58 Ohio L., 54), passed March 27, 1861, as amended March 23, 1866, (S. &amp; S., 391), the mortgage cannot be enforced so long as either of said children survives.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-9\">Ebbob to the District Court of Tuscarawas County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-10\">David Sliffe and Susanna Shutt intermarried in 1858. On April 14, 1863, Susanna inherited in fee simple a tract of land in Tuscarawas county, Ohio. She died August 7th, 1872, intestate, seized of the land, leaving surviving her husband, and Lewis, Amanda and Frederick B. Sliffe, issue of said marriage, her only heirs at law, all of whom are living, and to whom the land descended, subject to the dower estate of the widow of Jacob Shutt and the curtesyestate of said David Sliffe.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-11\">That said children were and are in possession of the land: by permission of their father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-12\">The plaintiff brought an action in the common pleas to enforce the lien of a mortgage of said real estate, made to him on the 31st day of August, 1876, by David Sliffe, to secure the payment of certain promissory notes, some of' which had become due, claiming that at the time of the making of the mortgage the mortgagor held an estate in the; land for the term of his own life.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>David Sliffe, the mortgagor, made no defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-4\">Lewis and Amanda Sliffe filed an answer containing two grounds of defense. The second set up the facts as above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\">The common pleas \u00f3verruled the plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to said second defense, and dismissed the petition at plaintiff\u2019s cost. The district court affirmed the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-6\">Harrison, <em>Olds &amp; </em>Marsh, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-7\">The only question is, can the owner of an estate by the curtesy, subsequently to the death of his wife, but during the lifetime of heirs of her body, execute a mortgage upon such estate to secure the payment of his debt ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-8\">The answer to this question depends upon the meaning of the last sentence of the first section of the Married Woman\u2019s Act, as the same was passed April 3d, 1861 (58 Ohio L., 54), and amended March 23, 1866 (S. &amp; S., 391).</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-9\">Prior to the taking effect of this act, the owner of an estate by the curtesy could convey or incumber his estate, without let or hindrance, during his wife\u2019s lifetime as well as after her death. This fact suggests the rule of construction by which the meaning of the act must be discovered. Inasmuch as the act operates, <em>to some </em>extent, as a limitation upon the power of the owner of an estate of freehold, to alienate or incumber it, and is, therefore, in derogation of the common law, it must be construed <em>strictly.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-10\">The act provides that. the owner of an estate by the curtesy shall not convey or incumber such' estate unless his <em>wife </em>shall join with him in such conveyance or incumbrance, in the manner prescribed by law in regard to her own estate. This provision presupposes that the wife is living and can join in such conveyance or incumbrance. The prohibition is, therefore, limited to the lifetime of the wife.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-11\">Upon the death of the wife, an estate for her surviving husband\u2019s life vests absolutely in him, in all the lands of which she died seized in fee simple. <em>Hall </em>v. Hall, 37 Ohio St., 184. Subject to such life estate, the fee vests either in the heirs or the devisees of the wife. The act under examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>does not provide for the assent of such heirs or devisees to any conveyance or incumbrance of the husband\u2019s life estate after the death of wife, when <em>she </em>cannot join therein. If the intention of the general assembly had been to prohibit the husband from conveying or incumbering his estate' by deed or mortgage executed after his wife\u2019s death and the estate had vested absolutely in him, unless, the owner of the fee in remainder joined therein, they would have expressly so provided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-5\">We do not believe this court can he persuaded that the legislature intended by this statute to innovate upon the settled policy of subjecting a debtor\u2019s real estate to the payment of his debts, and to provide in favor of <em>a class exemption of unlimited value, </em>several years before public sentiment was supposed to warrant even \u201ca homestead exemption.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-6\"><em>A. L. Neely </em>and <em>J. T. Holmes, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-7\">The several statutes relating to the question in the case are: the act of February 28, 1846 (44 Ohio L., 75) ; act of February 5, 1847 (45 Ohio L., 23); and the act of April, 1861 (58 Ohio L., 54) which last act controls the rights of the parties to this suit. For a construction of these several acts, see <em>Spinning </em>v. <em>Blackburn, </em>13 Ohio St., 131; <em>Lessees &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>4 Id., 232; <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>1 Disney, 265 ; <em>Jenney </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>5 Ohio St., 45; <em>Bruner, </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>39 Id., 478; <em>Leggett </em>v. <em>McClelland, </em>Id., 624; <em>Hershiser </em>v. <em>Florence, </em>Id., 516.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-8\">'Under the act of 1846 the interest of the husband, curtesy expectant or curtesy initiate, was not taken away. By the act of 1861, under the holding in <em>Leggett </em>v. <em>McClelland, </em>it was wiped completely out of existence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-9\">In the light of these decisions, and of the language of the section that gives rise to this controversy, the meaning, the intent, of the legislature ought not to be difficult to determine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-10\">\u201c This act shall not <em>affect the estate </em>by the curtesy of any husband in the real property of his wife <em>after her </em>decease.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>With the breath that gave life to the preceding portion of the section, the law-making power had blown awaj'- every vestige of curtesy interest, by whatever name it might be called,- <em>during the lifetime of the wife. </em>That interest had, from the act of 1846 down to 1861, been under the exemption, mentioned in <em>Bruner </em>v. Briggs, from process for the payment of the husband\u2019s debts, and from alienation by him without the joinder of the wife.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-4\">The language used in expunging it, like the act of 1846, was susceptible of being construed to reach beyond the purpose of the legislature, and was liable to give rise to controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-5\">\u201c Guarding against an improper construction,\u201d the general assembly at once, in this instance, said the <em>estate </em>after the wife\u2019s death was not affected by the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-6\">Continuing the quotation from the statute \u2014 \u201c but during the life of such wife, or any heir of her body, <em>such estate </em>shall not be taken by an3r process of law for the payment of his debts, or be conveyed or incumbered by him unless she shall join,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-7\">The \u201c interest \u201d in the husband is not affected \u2014 acted upon \u2014 but the <em>power </em>of creditors to reach it, and the <em>power </em>of the husband to alien or encumber it, are affected. These powers are no part of the \u201c interest \u201d or its definition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-8\">A man\u2019s title to his horse is perfect, although it ma}r be unlawful to race with that horse through the streets of a crowded city, or speed him over bridges making a part of the highway, or for a constable to seize and sell him on execution, despite the demand of set-off under the exemption laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-9\">The homestead cases of <em>McComb </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Roig </em>v. <em>Shultz, </em>just decided by the supreme court, afford an illustration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-10\">The inhibition of the statute against creditors taking away the title during occupan}\u2019- <em>as a </em>homestead, in no wise affects the title or estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-11\">To repeat, these limitations are upon powers, <em>not upon the estate. </em>Possibly the language'used in the section is not perfect. It is clear, however.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>If the doctrine of the <em>Leggett </em>v. <em>McClelland </em>case is sound, the husband has no estate during the life of his wife, and yet the language of the statute is that <em>during Tier life such estate shall not he taken.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-5\">There is no want of clearness. It must be remembered that there is a kind of <em>grouping </em>in two places, or clauses, in this part of the section. Let us see:</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-6\"><em>Such estate </em>shall not be taken <em>hy any process of law </em>for the payment of the husband\u2019s debts during \u2014 what ? \u2014 during the life of the wife, or any heir of her body.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-7\">Now, technically, that has in it a prohibition against an impossibility, for, during the life of the wife, by existing statutes, a husband has <em>no estate or interest </em>in the separate property of his wife; but, embracing the policy of the act of 1846 in that clause, it embraces the same policy in the next, and prohibits a possibility.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b243-8\">Granger, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKS\">In <em>Canby </em>v. Porter, 12 Ohio, 79, decided at December term, 1848, Lane, C. J., said: \u201c The interest of the husband is a legal estate: it is a freehold during the joint lives of himself and wife, with a freehold in remainder, for himself for life, as tenant by the curtesy, and a remainder to the wife and her heirs in fee. It is a certain and determinate interest, whose value may be easily ascertained by reference to well known rules. It is in every sense his <em>\u2018land' </em>within the meaning of the statute, and liable to respond for his debts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">This was the law until February 28, 1846, when \u201cAn act in relation to the interest of husbands in the estate of their wives \u201d took effect. I quote the first two sections of this act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">\u201c Section 1. That the interest of any married man in the real estate of his wife, belonging to her at the time of their intermarriage, or which may have come to her by devise, gift or inheritance during coverture, or which may have been purchased with her sole and separate money or other property, and during her coverture, shall have been deeded to her, shall not be liable to be taken by any process of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>or chancery for the payment of his debts during the life of the wife, or the life or lives of the heir or heirs of her body.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">\u201c Section 2. All conveyances and incumbrances of the husband\u2019s interest in the real estate of the wife, in the first section mentioned, shall be void and of no effect during the life of the wife, and during the life or lives of the heir or heirs of her body, unless an instrument of such conveyance or incumbrance shall have been executed, attested and acknowledged according to the laws of this state, for the conveyance or incumbrance of the estate of the wife in lands, tenements and hereditaments situate within this state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">This act was repealed' by the act of April 3, 1861, (58 Ohio Laws, 54,) of which the first section reads thus :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">\u201cAny estate or interest,legal or equitable,.in real property belonging to any woman at her marriage, or which may have come to her during coverture, by conveyance, gift, devise, or inheritance, or by purchase with her separate means or money, shall, 'together with all rents and issues thereof, be and-remain her separate property, and under her control; and she may, in her own name, during coverture, lease the same for any period not exceeding three years. This act shall not affect the estate by the curtesy of any husband in the real property of his wife after her decease; but during the life of such wife, or any heir of her body, such estate shall not be taken by any process of law for the payment of his debts, or be conveyed or incumbered by him, unless she shall join therein with him in the manner prescribed by law in regard to her own estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">It is urged that the words, \u201c This act shall not affect the estate by the curtesy of any husband in the real property of his wife after her decease,\u201d control the entire act, and that the only conveyances, or incumbrances, forbidden are those executed during the coverture, in which the wife is not a grantor. But those words do not constitute a complete and independent sentence. They form the first clause of a compound sentence, and are, <em>themselves, </em>limited and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>qualified by tbe words that follow \u201c but.\u201d It seems to us that this \u201c but \u201d means \u201c except that.\u201d Thus read the entire sentence declares that \u201c This act shall affect the estate by the curtesy of any husband in the real property of his wife after her decease no farther than this, to wit: during the life of such wife, or of any heir of her body, such estate shall not * * * be conveyed, or incumbered, by him unless she shall join therein with him in the manner prescribed bylaw in regard to her own estate.\u201d Under this construction full effect is given to all deeds and mortgages of her own estate legally made ; that is, duly executed and acknowledged by husband and wife. As the property is hers, the legislature does not attempt by new enactment to interfere with her control, farther than to provide a safe mode for ascertaining and attesting that it is <em>Tier </em>deed, or mortgage. The requirement that the husband should join in the conveyance is simply a repetition of a rule of law older than our state. But so long as the wife, or her child, survives, no act, or omission, of the husband alone shall enable a stranger to possess her land, as owner or incumbrancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">A comparison of section two (2) of the act of 1846 with section one (1) of the act of 1861, favors this construction. The former declared that all such conveyances and incumbrances \u201c shall be void and of no effect during the life of the wife and during the life or lives of the heir or heirs of her body, unless, &amp;c.\u201d It was possible to understand this language as applying only to conveyances, or incumbrances, made during the life of the wife. But the words \u201c during the life of such wife, or any heir of her body, such estate shall not * * \u00ae be conveyed, or incumbered, by him unless, &amp;e.,\u201d are unambiguous. .The time within which the husband is forbidden to convey is \u201c during the life of any heirs of her body,\u201d as well as \u201c during the life of such wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">This may be unwise legislation; with that we have nothing to do. The best way to get rid of an unwise statute is to enforce it according to the meaning of its words as used. The children being the persons for whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>protection the mortgage was prohibited, should be held sufficiently interested to be heard against the attempt to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b246-5\">Martin, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
