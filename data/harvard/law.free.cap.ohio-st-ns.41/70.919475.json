Stage made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors to Isaac E. Dresbach and Festus Walters, and the deed of assignment was at once filed with the probate court of Pickaway county, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Ohio. On November 12th the assignees filed a petition in the probate court asking that they be authorized to sell the real estate of the assignor, to which proceeding the assignor, his wife, all lien holders and other parties having an interest in the land, were made parties. The land was in two tracts, one of 591 acres in Walnut township and the other of 288 acres in Circleville township. Proper orders were after-wards made authorizing the sale of the land and the subdivision of the 591-acre tract into four parcels. Lot No. 1 of this sub-division is the one involved in this case. Prior to October, 1877, the assignees offered this lot No. 1 for sale four different times, but it remained unsold. On the 8th of October, 1877, the assignees asked the probate court for an order to sell this lot at private sale, which request was granted. October 12th the assignees reported to the probate court that they had sold these premises to David H. Stein and Wilson Dresbaeh at #50 per acre. The next day the sale was confirmed by the court and the assignees directed to make and deliver a deed to the purchasers. The terms of sale were one third cash, one third in one year and the remainder in two years. The premises were supposed to contain three hundred and sixty and acres. Stein was the purchaser of one half and Dresbaeh of the other half. S. &amp; D. sub-divided the premises and to secure the deferred payments each, with his wife, on the 20th day of October, executed and delivered to the assignees his mortgage.deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-5\">In January, 1880, the assignees instituted two suits in the court of common pleas of Pickaway county, one against Stein and wife and one against Dresbaeh and wife, asking for the foreclosure of the two mortgages and the sale of the mortgaged premises on account of the non-payment of the last installment of purchase money. As a defense the defendants averred that the parcel of ground sold to them by the assignees only contained 320-35B2g- acres, and that this mistake was made by the surveyor employed by the assignees to sub-divide the 591 acre tract. \u25a0 They therefore asked that this mistake be corrected by the surrender and cancellation of the notes and mortgages upon the full payment by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>them of the purchase money for 320-j^ acres at $50 per acre.

When a party has been induced to purchase land by the unintentional misrepresentation of the seller as to the quantity included in the boundaries, the deficiency being material, equity will rescind the contract, and this relief will be granted, though the complainant seeks relief on the ground of fraud. <em>Belknap </em>v. <em>Steeley, </em>2 Durer, 570; <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Garzo, </em>7 Tex., 60; 2 Russell, 570; <em>Post v.

Va., 347; <em>Fall </em>v. <em>McCurdy, </em>3 Met. (Ky.), 364; <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Stinestreet, </em>1 Md., 147.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>This mistake, whatever it was, was adopted by the court and assignees, and carried into all its proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-5\">If an individual had made a survey of land, and advertised it for sale, and shown the plat and survey to purchasers, and made as many representations as to quantity as the court did in this instance, we think there is no court of equity in the world that would not have' relieved the purchaser from the mistake.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-6\">If it never has been established by the decision of any court that a purchaser of land under a survey made by order of the court, and brought to his notice, may rely upon it as being correct, and as containing the truth, then it is time that such a decision was made, and this court has an opportunity to establish a principle in favor of honesty and justice, and one which will meet the approbation of the average conscience of men. If, on the other hand, the court feels bound to say that a survey made by its own officer, and adopted by the court, cannot be trusted, and that <em>caveat emptor </em>applies in this new class of cases, then the court will take a step backwards, without its being demanded by policy, convenience or justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-7\">The sale in this ease was on the personal representation of the assignees that the land had been surveyed by them and found to contain the exact amount of 360^^ acres. These representations were made by showing the plat returned by the surveyor, and his statements thereon as to the quantity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-8\">If relief is not granted upon the grounds first above stated, the defendants are entitled to it on the ground of mistake. This mistake was brought about by the direct action of the assignees themselves. If, after the matter had gone into their hands, the assignees had proceeded to sell the lands of Stage by the description contained in his deeds, without any survey and any statement as to quantity, it is probable the defendants would be without remedy. But the assignees went further, and surveyed the land, and made the sale by that survey. A further point to be considered by the court is that the probate court adopted the error of the surveyor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>and assignees, and carried the same through all its proceedings. This amounted to a representation by the surveyor, by the assignees and by the probate court that this tract of land contained the exact quantity of 360^j- acres.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-4\">Would not any man living, except, perhaps, some lawyers, have relied upon these representations, and believed that if they were not true he would be entitled to relief?</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-5\">Will a court of equity lend its aid to sanction and ratify an error which the court has committed ? For, taking the ground that this was a judicial sale, it may be confidently claimed that but for the action of the court itself this mistake would not have occurred, and the defendants would not have been deprived so unjustly of their money. See <em>Morris </em>v. Mowatt, 2 Paige, 586.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-6\">If the court intended to plant itself on the doctrine of <em>caveat </em>emptor, or if the assignees intended to shield themselves behind that doctrine, they should have sold the land by the description contained in Stage\u2019s deed. They should not have meddled in this matter by making a survey, and undertaking to furnish purchasers with a correct survey and statement of the exact quantity of land. We know of no law which required them to make that survey. They volunteered to do it, and to bring it before the public, and to make, as it were, personal representations that it was correct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-7\">What hardship is there in requiring the purchaser to pay for the exact quantity of land which the estate owned, and no more. The estate loses nothing, and the purchaser is not defrauded by such a course. If it was for the interest of the creditors that a survey should be made of the lands previous to a sale, it is for the interest of all creditors that such sales should be conducted with fairness and honesty.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b90-8\">Harrison, <em>Olds Marsh </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArC\">made same points as their co-counsel and commented on authorities cited by counsel for defendant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b90-10\">Nash, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJp\">We think it is reasonably certain that at the. time the sale took place, the assignees and Stein and Dres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>bacb, the purchasers, supposed that the premises sold contained three hundred and sixty and acres, and were without knowledge as to the deficiency of forty acres. Can this mistake be corrected in proceedings by the assignees to foreclose the mortgages given to secure the payment of the purchase money ?</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">To determine this, question we must first ascertain the character of the sale. It was conducted under section 5 of the act regulating the mode of administering assignments for the benefit of creditors. [58 Ohio Laws, 105.] The land had been surveyed, appraised and offered at public sale, but had not been sold for want of bidders. All these things were done under the supervision of the probate court and in the manner provided by the statute. Then application was made to the probate court for an order to sell at private sale. The court exercising a power conferred by section 5, above referred to, and being satisfied that it would be for the advantage of the creditors of the assignors, made the order. The assignees then sold the land to Stein and Dresbach, upon the terms and under the limitations authorized by the . court. The sale was reported to the court, confirmed by the court, deeds ordered by the court and made and delivered to the purchasers in pursuance of such order. In short the assignees acted as the agents of-the court in selling the land and simply obeyed its orders, made in accordance with powers conferred by the statute regulating assignments for the benefit of creditors. This was a judicial sale \u2014 a distinguishing feature of which is that it must be confirmed by the court before it will be complete. Freeman on Void Judicial Sales, 14; 1 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, 767; Rorer on Judicial Sales, chap. 1, p. 1, and the authorities therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">As this was a judicial sale, we are of opinion that in an action by the assignees against the purchasers to foreclose the mortgage given to secure the purchase money, the purchasers cannot be made whole as to the mistake of forty acres by being given a credit of $2,000. Stein and Dresbach were charged with the duty of ascertaining for themselves the character, condition and amount of the property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>Mechanics S. &amp; B. L. Association </em>v. <em>O' Conner, </em>29 Ohio St. 651. This could have been easily done. The surveyor employed by the assignees to subdivide and plat the land made correct returns of the length of the boundary lines, and if the purchasers had made a computation from these the mistake now complained of would have been discovered. The defendants before giving their mortgages and before the sale was completed, employed a surveyor for the purpose of dividing this parcel of land into two equal parts. This he attempted to do. From these circumstances it would seem that nothing less than great carelessness could have prevented them from discovering this error.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">If the purchasers had sought relief by resisting the confirmation of the sale and at a time when all parties could have been restored to their original position, it should have been granted. They do not now ask to have the original contract rescinded. It is impossible in this action to give the defendants any relief. <em>Okill </em>v. <em>Whittaker, </em>2 Phillips Ch. Reps., 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The cases under consideration were in the district court on appeal. That court without making any finding upon the facts, reserved the cases upon the law and the facts to this court. We render the decree in each case which the district court should have rendered and in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
