Wainwright, </em>738 F.2d 1173 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1667-24\">Jonas claims that he was subjected to double jeopardy because his presumptive parole release date was vacated and a new one set following his escape. The double jeopardy clause does not apply to parole revocation proceedings, <em>Garcia v. U.S., </em>769 F.2d 697-700 (11th Cir.1985), and for the same reasons it does not apply to vacation of a presumptive parole release date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1667-25\">The contention that changing the presumptive parole release date subjected Jonas to cruel and unusual punishment is frivolous. There is no constitutional right to parole in Florida. <em>Hunter v. Florida Parole &amp; Probation Commission, </em>674 F.2d 847, 848 (11th Cir.1982). The decision if and when to parole an inmate is left to the discretion of the Commission guided by its own administrative rules. <em>Moore v. Florida Parole &amp; Probation Commission, </em>289 So.2d 719 (Fla.1974); <em>see </em>Fla.Stat. \u00a7 947.18. After Jonas\u2019s escape he pleaded no contest to an escape charge, and the court entered a finding of guilt, withheld adjudication, and suspended sentence. That, based on the escape charge, Jonas\u2019s parole release date was changed does not make that action either punishment or cruel and unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1578\">*1578</page-number>The claim that the Commission did not abide by its own rules and regulations does not allege a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1668-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
