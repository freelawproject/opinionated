Henry (\u201cHenry\u201d) filed a Third Amended Complaint (the \u201cTAC\u201d) alleging that corporate defendant Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. (\u201cMMC\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), as well as various MMC directors (the \u201cDirector Defendants\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> violated section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) Rule 14a-9.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants have moved for dismissal pursuant to principles of res judica-ta, Rules 12(b)(6) and 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPSLRA\u201d). For the reasons that follow, the Court grants the defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion and dismisses the TAC with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">1. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">Familiarity with the general context of this litigation is presumed. <em>See generally In re Marsh &amp; Mclennan Cos. Sec. Litig., </em>501 F.Supp.2d 452 (S.D.N.Y.2006) <em>(\u2018Marsh </em>/\u201d); <em>see also In re Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Sec. Litig., </em>04 Cv. 8144(SWK), Dkt. No. 159 (explaining Henry\u2019s entry into the litigation). The Court limits its discussion here to those facts and circumstances pertinent to the instant motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">On February 10, 2005, Henry filed an action in this District on behalf of herself and derivatively on behalf of MMC, <em>see generally Henry v. Greenberg, </em>05 Cv.2020(RMB), Dkt. No. 1, averring federal securities law violations stemming from the New York State Attorney General\u2019s allegations that MMC had engaged in illegal bid rigging. <em>See Marsh I, </em>501 F.Supp.2d at 459, 461-65 (explaining factual allegations as related by securities litigation plaintiffs). The case was assigned to Judge Berman and was consolidated with the shareholder derivative litigation pending before him. <em>Henry v. Greenberg, </em>05 Cv.2020(RMB), Dkt. Nos. 3-4. Henry later amended her complaint to include claims against MMC\u2019s directors under sections 10(b), 14(a), and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act (the \u201cHenry Securities Claims\u201d). <em>In re Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Derivative Litig., </em>04 Cv. 8516(RMB), Conf. Tr., Mar. 16, 2005. On June 12, 2006, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Judge Berman severed the Henry Securities Claims from the shareholder derivative litigation pending before him so that those claims could be transferred to this Court for consideration in connection with the consolidated securities class action litigation then pending before it (the \u201cConsolidated Securities Litigation\u201d). <em>In re Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Derivative Litig., </em>04 Cv. 8516(RMB), Conf. Tr., June 12, 2006. As Henry\u2019s section 10(b) and 20(a) claims were directly subsumed by the Consolidated Securities Litigation, the Court ordered Henry to file an amended complaint solely addressing her section 14(a) claim by August 18, 2006. <em>In re Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Sec. Litig., </em>04 Cv. 8144(SWK), Dkt. No. 129. After a series of procedural missteps, <em>see In re Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Sec. Litig., </em>04 Cv. 8144(SWK), Dkt. No. 159, Henry eventually filed the TAC on March 13, 2007. <em>In re Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Sec. Litig., </em>04 Cv. 8144(SWK), Dkt. No. 165-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In the TAC, Henry alleges that MMC and the Director Defendants violated section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 by making false statements of material fact and fraudulent omissions in Proxy Statements disseminated on March 31, 2005, and March 30, 2006, in connection with MMC\u2019s Annual Meetings of Shareholders held on May 19, 2005, and May 18, 2006.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Pl.\u2019s Compl. \u00b6 128, 131.). The Proxy Statements pertained to voting concerning, <em>inter alia, </em>the re-eleetion of certain sitting directors; a proposed exchange, under the Company\u2019s Equity Compensation Plans, of \u201ccertain stock options held by the Company\u2019s employees that are 25% or more \u2018underwater\u2019 \u201d (the \u201cOptions Exchange\u201d) (Pl.\u2019s Compl. \u00b6 129); and the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP (\u201cD &amp; T\u201d) as Marsh\u2019s auditor. Henry identifies three disclosure failures that correspond with each of these votes. Specifically, Henry alleges that the 2005/06 Proxy Statements failed to disclose (1) the extent to which the entire Board of Directors was responsible for wrongdoing that caused the Company substantial financial harm; (2) that the Options Exchange would benefit many officers of the Company and its subsidiaries who were direct participants in the wrongdoing described in the TAC; and (3) that D &amp; T had failed to fulfill its professional duties as independent auditor of the Company\u2019s financial statements and had a long history of similar failures. (Pl.\u2019s Compl. \u00b6 131.)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">The defendants now move for dismissal on several grounds. The Director Defendants named in the Consolidated Securities Litigation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> argue that Henry\u2019s section 14(a) claims are barred by principles of res judicata. <em>See generally In re Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Sec. Litig., </em>04 Cv. 8144(SWK), Dkt. No. 172 (\u201cDefs.\u2019 2d Mot.\u201d). In the alternative, these defendants join remaining defendants MMC and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Michael G. Cherkasky in arguing that (1) the TAC fails under Rule 12(b)(6) to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the defendants were under no duty to disclose the information omitted from the Proxy Statements; and that the TAC does not satisfy the pleading requirements of Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA because it fails to allege adequately that (2) the defendants possessed scienter, and (3) the claimed omissions were misleading or fraudulent. <em>See generally In re Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Sec. Litig., </em>04 Cv. 8144(SWK), Dkt. No. 169 (\u201cDefs.\u2019 1st Mot\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">A. Henry\u2019s Claim is Not Barred by the Doctrine of Res Judicata</p>\n<p id=\"A7O\">The doctrine of res judicata presumes that \u201ca person should not be twice-vexed by the same claim, and that it is in the interest of society to bring an end to disputes.\u201d 18 James Wm. Moore, et al., <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 131.12[2] (Bd ed.2006). \u201cThe doctrine bars \u2018later litigation if [an] earlier decision was (1) a final judgment on the merits, (2) by a court of competent jurisdiction, (3) in a case involving the same parties or their privies, and (4) involving the same cause of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>EDP Med. Computer Sys. v. United States, 480 F.3d 621, </em>624 (2d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>In re Teltronics Servs., Inc., </em>762 F.2d <em>185, </em>190 (2d Cir.1985)) (brackets in original). The burden of establishing res judicata rests with the defendant. <em>Greenberg v. Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys., </em>968 F.2d 164, 170 (2d Cir.1992). Should the defendant meet that burden, the doctrine precludes claims based on \u201cissues actually decided in determining the claim asserted in the first action and issues that could have been raised in the adjudication of that claim.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd. v. United Techs. Corp., </em>706 F.2d 1254, 1259 (2d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The Court\u2019s dismissal of numerous claims asserted in the Consolidated Securities Litigation, <em>see In re Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos., Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>04 Cv. 8144(SWK), 2006 WL 2789860, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2006) <em>(\u201cMarsh II\u201d); Marsh I, </em>501 F.Supp.2d at 496, constitutes final judgments on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction. As a result of Judge Berman\u2019s transfer, certain of Henry\u2019s claims are subsumed in the Consolidated Securities Litigation. The parties mainly disagree as to whether claims in the Consolidated Securities Litigation and Henry\u2019s section 14(a) claim constitute the \u201csame cause of action\u201d for res judicata purposes. <em>See EDP Med. Computer Sys., </em>480 F.3d at 624.</p>\n<p id=\"AvW\">As an initial matter, however, it is not even clear that the Director Defendants have established privity between Henry and the class plaintiffs in the Consolidated Securities Litigation. \u201cThere is no bright line rule for determining when parties are in privity. Rather, privity is a legal determination for the trial court as to whether the relationship between the parties is sufficiently close to support [claim] preclusion.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., </em>750 F.Supp. 603, 607 (S.D.N.Y.1990). \u201cIn general, if the interests of a non-party are represented by a party to the litigation who is vested with the authority of representation, the non-party may be bound by the judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">The Director Defendants repeatedly assert that Henry is \u201ca party to the [Consolidated Securities Litigation].\u201d (Defs.\u2019 2d Mot. 2; <em>In re Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Sec. Litig., </em>04 Cv. 8144(SWK), Dkt. No. 179 (\u201cDefs.\u2019 2d Reply\u201d) 1.) Although the Court has consolidated the various securi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ties claims against the defendants and appointed lead plaintiffs pursuant to the PSLRA, <em>see In re Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos., </em>04 Cv. 8144(SWK), Dkt. No. 38, the standard for appointing lead plaintiffs under the PSLRA is more lenient than the standard for class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. In fact, in order to qualify as the \u201cmost adequate plaintiff\u2019 under the PSLRA, the movant must only make a preliminary showing that he or she satisfies some requirements of Rule 23(a). <em>Jolly Roger Offshore Fund LTD v. BKF Capital Grp., Inc., </em>07 Cv. 3923(RWS), 2007 WL 2363610, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 16, 2007) (quoting <em>Weinberg v. Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc., </em>216 F.R.D. 248, 252 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). \u201c \u2018[W]ide ranging analysis under Rule 23 ... [is] left for consideration of a motion for class certification.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Weinberg, </em>216 F.R.D. at 252).</p>\n<p id=\"AWsn\">The absence of class certification is not an automatic indicator of a lack of privity between purported lead plaintiffs and an absent class member. <em>See Ferris v. Cuevas, </em>118 F.3d 122, 130 (2d Cir.1997). Yet under the present circumstances,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and given the significant due process concerns at stake, <em>see Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, </em>472 U.S. 797, 812, 105 S.Ct. 2965, 86 L.Ed.2d 628 (1985), the Court concludes that appointment of lead plaintiffs under the PSLRA alone is insufficient to demonstrate privity for res judicata purposes. Because the Director Defendants have not provided an alternative basis for a finding of privity between Henry and the lead plaintiffs in the Consolidated Securities Litigation, <em>see, e.g., Hoblock v. Albany County Bd. of Elections, </em>422 F.3d 77, 90-91 (2d Cir.2005) (explaining \u2014 and noting controversial nature of \u2014 doctrine of \u201cvirtual representation\u201d); <em>Meza v. Gen. Battery Corp., </em>908 F.2d 1262, 1266 (5th Cir.1990), the Court concludes that they have failed to carry their evidentiary burden and declines to dismiss the TAC on res judicata grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Moreover, the unique and tangled procedural history of this case provides further justification for the conclusion that Henry\u2019s 14(a) claim is not precluded under res judicata. Henry first made her 14(a) allegations in August 2005, after Judge Berman granted her permission to file individually the federal securities claims that were not being pursued by the other shareholders appearing in the derivative action before him. <em>See In re Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Sec. Litig., </em>04 Cv. 8144, Dkt. No. 178 (\u201cPl.\u2019s 1st Opp\u2019n\u201d) 3. These claims, including the section 14(a) claims, were transferred to this Court because of their strong similarity to the claims advanced in the Consolidated Securities Litigation. <em>See In re Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Derivative Litig., </em>04 Cv. 8516(RMB)(DFE), Conf. Tr., June 12, 2006. Nevertheless the Court granted Henry permission to file a separate complaint containing only the 14(a) allegations and excluding the other claims under other provisions of the Exchange Act, which were originally raised before Judge Berman. <em>See In re Marsh &amp; McLennan Sec. Litig., </em>04 Cv. 8144(SWK), Dkt. No. 129. Having repeatedly instructed Henry to pursue her section 14(a) claims separately from the Consolidated Securities Litiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>tion, the Court will not now hold that those claims are barred because they \u201ccould have been raised\u201d in the consolidated action. <em>Cf. Allen v. Westpoint-Pepperell, Inc., </em>11 F.Supp.2d 277, 289-90 (S.D.N.Y.1997) (holding that res judicata is not applicable to plaintiffs\u2019 second suit when \u201cplaintiffs have always been prepared to litigate all their claims at one time,\u201d and suit had been parsed into multiple proceedings at defendants\u2019 request), <em>vacated in part on other grounds by Krumme v. WestPoint Stevens, Inc., </em>143 F.3d 71 (2d Cir.1998).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">B. Defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Although the defendants do not specify the procedural basis for their motion to dismiss for lack of a \u201cduty to disclose,\u201d the Court addresses this argument within the framework established by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>See, e.g., Resnik v. Swartz, </em>303 F.3d 147, 149 (2d Cir.2002); <em>In re Am. Express Co. S\u2019holder Litig., </em>840 F.Supp. 260, 268 (S.D.N.Y.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">1. Legal Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">In order to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, \u201cthe plaintiff must plead\u2019 enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ginsberg v. Gov\u2019t Props. Trust, Inc., </em>07 Cv. 365(CSH)(ECF), 2007 WL 2981683, at *17 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 11, 2007) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cWhile a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1964-65 (citations, quotation marks, and alterations omitted). The plaintiff must satisfy a \u201cflexible \u2018plausibility standard,\u2019 which obliges a pleader to amplify a claim with some factual allegations in those contexts where such amplification is needed to render the claim <em>plausible. </em>\u201d <em>Iqbal v. Hasty, </em>490 F.3d 143, 157-58 (2d Cir.2007) (emphasis in original). However, \u201c[ajsking for plausible grounds to infer [a violation of the securities laws] does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [the violation].\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"AjY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>In the context of a securities fraud complaint such as Henry\u2019s, there are additional pleading requirements. First, the PSLRA provides that a complaint alleging violations of section 14(a) of the Exchange Act \u201cshall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation ... is made upon information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u \u2014 4(b)(1); <em>see also In re AOL Time Warner, Inc.

Duty to Disclose</p>\n<p id=\"A1FT\">To state a claim under section 14(a), a plaintiff must allege that: \u201c(1) a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>proxy statement contained a material misrepresentation or omission, which (2) caused plaintiffs injury, and (3) that the proxy solicitation itself, rather than the particular defect in the solicitation materials, was an essential link in the accomplishment of the transaction.\u201d <em>See Bond Opp\u2019ty Fund, </em>2003 WL 21058251, at *3 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cOmission of information from a proxy statement will violate [Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9] if either the SEC regulations specifically require disclosure of the omitted information in a proxy statement, or the omission makes other statements in the proxy statement materially false or misleading.\u201d <em>Resnik, </em>303 F.3d at 151.

Rather, Henry alleges that the \u201comissions of the amply identified neutral facts make other statements in the proxy statements materially false and misleading.\u201d (PL\u2019s 1st Opp\u2019n 11.) The Court now addresses the defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion with respect to each of Henry\u2019s allegations. Ultimately, the Court concludes that the omissions could not render misleading any representation made by the defendants in the relevant Proxy Statements. Thus, the Court holds that Henry has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">a. Failure to Disclose Board Members\u2019 Responsibility for the Wrongdoing of Others</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">Henry\u2019s first allegation is that the Proxy Statements should have disclosed the extent to which the members of Marsh\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) were responsible for Marsh and MMC\u2019s illegal activities. Notably, although she does mention certain charges against MMC (see Pl.\u2019s Compl. \u00b6 8) and other investigations (see Pl.\u2019s Compl. \u00b6 116-17), Henry does <em>not </em>allege that the Proxy Statements failed to disclose any charged offenses<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or \u201cnon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>routine\u201d pending litigation involving the Director Defendants, Marsh, or MMC. <em>See Bolger v.

Sec. Litig., </em>733 F.Supp. 668, 675 (S.D.N.Y.1990); <em>see also Goldsmith v.

Instead, she argues that the omissions make misleading the \u201cimplicit endorsement\u201d conveyed by the proposal for the directors\u2019 re-election. <em>(See </em>Pl.\u2019s 1st Opp\u2019n 12.) Henry\u2019s argument thus runs counter to existing case law, which has premised liability on the link between an omission and a specific public statement. <em>See Menkes v.

Consequently, a plaintiff in a section 14(a) action must show that there was \u201ca substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the \u2018total mix\u2019 of information made available.\u201d <em>TSC Indus., </em>426 U.S. at 449, 96 S.Ct. 2126. \u201cThe \u2018total mix\u2019 of information may include data sent to shareholders by a company in addition to its proxy materials,\u201d as long as the relevant information is not \u201c \u2018buried\u2019 in unrelated discussions.\u201d <em>United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union v.

Here, the Annual Reports sent to shareholders along with the 2005 and 2006 Proxy Statements adequately and prominently disclosed the alleged misconduct of the Company and individual employees. The recitation of allegations in the 2004 Annual Report spans eleven pages. <em>See </em>Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc., Annual Report 2004 57-68, <em>available at </em>http://www.mmc.com/investors/Annual_ 2004.pdf (\u201c2004 Annual Report\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The 2006 Proxy Statement even directs readers to the relevant portion of the 2005 Annual Report. <em>See </em>Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc., 2006 Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 45, <em>available at </em>http://www.mmc.com/investors/ proxy2006.pdf (\u201c2006 Proxy Statement\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>The explanations of the allegations contained in the Annual Reports, though not verbatim recitations of the \u201cmaterial and neutral facts\u201d found in the TAC or the complaint in the Consolidated Securities Litigation, contain sufficient detail to allow an investor to factor the alleged wrongdoing into his decisions concerning director elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Additionally, when enumerating the work experience and qualifications of the current board members (including those who were nominated for re-election), the Proxy Statements indicated for how long each one had been a director of Marsh, <em>see </em>2006 Proxy Statement 14-18; Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc., 2005 Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 5-8, <em>available at </em>http://www.mmc.com/ investors/proxy2005.pdf (\u201c2005 Proxy Statement\u201d) \u2014 information that would, when read in conjunction with the Annual Reports, reveal to a shareholder that the nominees had been members of the Board when the alleged illegalities occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Therefore, although the Director Defendants\u2019 alleged mismanagement was arguably relevant to their re-election, there was no duty to disclose such information, and certainly no duty to provide any more information than the defendants offered. Consequently, Henry\u2019s first allegation fails to state a violation of section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">b. Failure to Disclose Effect of the Options Exchange on Non-Director Wrongdoers</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Henry next alleges that the defendants violated section 14(a) by failing to disclose that the proposed Options Exchange could benefit certain unnamed employees who had engaged in wrongdoing. For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that this allegation also fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Again, as with the general misconduct of directors, the misconduct of employees is arguably relevant to a vote to approve an employee compensation plan, because a reasonable investor might want to know whether the provision would accrue to the benefit of wrongdoers. <em>Cf. TSC Indus., </em>426 U.S. at 449, 96 S.Ct. 2126; <em>but see United Operating Co. v. Karnes, </em>482 F.Supp. 1029, 1031 (S.D.N.Y.1980) (describing as \u201cweak\u201d \u201cthe premise that stockholders would be so outraged by the unethical business practices of [corporate employees] ... that they would refuse to approve [their] compensation\u201d). There is, however, a critical difference between compensation provisions certain to benefit wrongdoers and provisions that benefit large groups of employees and are not in any way a reward for the behavior from which the wrongdoing stemmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">The Options Exchange was not a performance-based or otherwise discretionary reward. Rather, it applies to <em>any </em>employee holding stock options that exceeded a given exchange price. 2006 Proxy Statement 27 (\u201cOnly stock options that were underwater by 25% or more on the date the exchange was approved by stockholders were eligible for the MMC Option Exchange Program.\u201d). Moreover, participation in the program was entirely voluntary. <em>See </em>2005 Proxy Statement 33. Any benefit to an employee who participated in wrongdoing would be purely coincidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">The TAC does not name a single Marsh employee who engaged in wrongdoing and stood to benefit from the Options Exchange. Moreover, even if such employees were identifiable, it was not possible at the time the Proxy Statements were disseminated to know which employees would decide to participate in the Options Exchange should the shareholders approve it. Therefore, Henry\u2019s eonclusory allegation that the program \u201cwould\u201d benefit direct\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>but unnamed \u2014 participants in past wrongdoing fails to state a viable cause of action. (Pl.\u2019s Compl. \u00b6 131.) <em>See Lewis v. Valley, </em>476 F.Supp. 62, 65-66 (S.D.N.Y.1979) (finding alleged employee misconduct immaterial to vote on compensation plan when \u201c[t]here is no allegation of the extent to which any participant in the [alleged wrongdoing] derives benefits from the compensation plans approved\u201d). Henry\u2019s claim further fails because, even if it were possible to identify precisely the wrongdoers who would qualify for, and participate in, the Options Exchange, the benefit of the options exchange would \u201cnot accrue to them otherwise than as an across-the-board benefit to numerous employees of the same level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Additionally, because the Company\u2019s senior executive officers were ineligible for the Options Exchange <em>(see </em>PL\u2019s Compl. \u00b6 131), Henry cannot allege that the alleged misconduct on the part of the Director Defendants themselves was material to its approval. <em>Cf. Gen. Elec. Co. v. Cathcart, </em>980 F.2d 927, 931 (3d Cir.1992) (\u201c[A]bsent allegations of self-dealing, corporate directors have no duty to disclose mismanagement or breach of fiduciary duty in proxy materials.\u201d); <em>Fry v. Trump, </em>681 F.Supp. 252, 261 (D.N.J.1988) (finding that pending litigation against directors is material to proxy statement for vote on provision giving directors retroactive protection against personal liability for negligence in performance of duties). The vote on the Equity Compensation plan therefore cannot provide fodder for an actionable claim under section 14(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Finally, the omission of information concerning the possibility that certain, unnamed alleged wrongdoers could benefit from the Options Exchange did not make any particular statement about he Exchange false or misleading. The Proxy Statements contained no endorsement or representation of the quality of the performance of any employee or group of employees. They merely contained explanations that the Options Exchange would make the Company\u2019s compensation plan competitive with that of the industry. Therefore, for all of the reasons discussed above, Henry\u2019s allegation concerning the Options Exchange is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">c. Failure to Disclose Deloitte\u2019s \u201cLong History of Audit Failures\u201d at Marsh and Other Companies</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Henry\u2019s final allegation is that the defendants violated section 14(a) by failing to disclose D &amp; T\u2019s failure \u201cto fulfill its professional duties as independent auditor of the Company\u2019s financial statements,\u201d as well as its \u201clong history of audit failures of [other] public companies.\u201d (Pl.\u2019s Compl. \u00b6 131.) Again, Henry does not allege that the defendants failed to disclose any specific criminal charges or civil litigation. Therefore, even assuming, as is required when adjudicating this motion, that Henry\u2019s statements about D &amp; T\u2019s \u201clong history\u201d are true, the defendants had no general duty to disclose such \u201cunproven allegations.\u201d See <em>Ciresi, </em>782 F.Supp. at 823 (\u201c[A]n action under section 14(a) is not the proper avenue for a shareholder to challenge the Board of Directors\u2019 selection of an accountant.\u201d) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Nor did the omission of any allegations against D <em>&amp; </em>T render anything in the Proxy Statements false or misleading. As with her allegation concerning the re-election of certain directors, Henry identifies no particular statement that is made misleading but instead argues that, by asking shareholders to ratify the selection of D <em>&amp; </em>T as the Company\u2019s auditor, the \u201cdefendants are implicitly stating that [D &amp; T] has the requisite experience and is fit to carry out its obligations .... \u201d (PL\u2019s 1st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Opp\u2019n 12.) The <em>Ciresi </em>Court found no disclosure obligation under nearly analogous circumstances. <em>See Ciresi, </em>782 F.Supp. at 823 (rejecting argument that omission of allegations of accounting firm\u2019s prior audit failures rendered false and misleading defendant\u2019s statement that firm was an \u201cindependent auditor\u201d). Therefore, Henry\u2019s third allegation cannot survive the defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In sum, the Court concludes that each of Henry\u2019s accusations fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Henry has asked for leave to amend the TAC in order to correct any legal insufficiencies. <em>{See </em>PL\u2019s 1 Opp\u2019n 15.) Because, however, it is not possible to remedy the defects in the TAC by pleading with more particularity, the TAC is dismissed with prejudice. <em>See Ciresi, </em>782 F.Supp. at 823-24 (quoting <em>Luce v.

No. 161, but she does include him in one of her opposition documents, <em>see In re Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Sec. Litig., </em>04 Cv. 8144(SWK), Dkt. No. 178 (\"Pl.\u2019s 1st Opp\u2019n\u201d). Because the Court grants the defendants' motion to dismiss with prejudice, it need not address the permissibility under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) of amending the complaint at this late date to include Erburu.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b370-5\">. Henry avers that Lead Counsel in the Consolidated Securities Litigation do not wish to pursue any claims under section 14(a). (Pl.\u2019s Letter 2, Mar. 13, 2007.) Although a lead plaintiffs failure to pursue a claim advocated by absent class members will not automatically preclude class certification, <em>see, e.g., In re Univ. Serv. Fund Tel. Billing Practices Litig., </em>219 F.R.D. 661, 670 (D.Kan.2004), it is an issue into which the Court must inquire should this litigation reach the class certification stage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b371-8\">. Moreover, even if Henry's section 14(a) allegations pertaining to the 2005 Proxy Statement were barred on res judicata grounds, the actions giving rise to her claim regarding the 2006 Statement occurred after the filing of the complaint in the Consolidated Securities Litigation, and therefore res judicata does not apply to them. <em>See Waldman v.
