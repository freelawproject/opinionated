This is the original.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-16\">It was then read to the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-17\">\u201c We estimate the damage by fire to the timber, &amp;c., prepared for the vessels now building in the yard of Wm. H.

These capstans were partly made, and Mr. Mackay and myself appraised them at $215.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-22\">This last appraisement was then read in evidence as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-23\">\u25a0 \u201c In addition to the estimate furnished 11th inst., there was in the building six capstans partly finished, valued at two hundred and fifteen dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-24\">(Signed as before.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-25\">New York, April 12th, 1848.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The witness further testified, that ship builders have been in the practice of having their stock of timber in the street in the vicinity of the ship yards, as much so as in the yard. Such has always been the practice since the witness has known anything of ship building in this city, and that has been for about twenty-five years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-5\">This evidence of practice was objected to in due season by the counsel for the defendants as incompetent. The objection was overruled by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-6\">The witness further testified : Capstans are made of locust, sometimes they are made partly of mahogany, but the capstans in the plaintiffs yard that were damaged by the fire were of locust. The stock specified in our appraisement consisted of what was wrought and prepared by the workmen as timber and stock; and also of what was unworked. It was usual to store or keep in the yard and on the street, timber and plank indiscriminately. We keep the stock just where it is most convenient to place it; we frequently have the heaviest of the timber in the street; Mr. Webb\u2019s ship yard was not enclosed by any fence or enclosure. It had been enclosed at some period, but was not so then.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-7\">Ship yards are not usually enclosed. Mr. Webb\u2019s yard at some former period of time probably had been fenced in, because here and there were a few feet of old fence still standing. All of the timber that was burned, (and which is in dispute,) was on the side walks adjoining the yard on Lewis and Sixth streets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-8\">William Mackay, on the part of the plaintiff, testified, that he was one of the firm of Westervelt &amp; Mackay, ship builders of this city, and made the several appraisements with Mr. Bishop: that he has been engaged in the business of ship building for some twenty-five years past, and is acquainted with the course of business in this city. It is the practice of ship builders to keep their stock in their yards, and on the side walks, and in the street in the vicinity. Such has been the practice as long as the witness can remember.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-9\">(This evidence of practice was objected to as before.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-10\">Being cross-examined, he testified: the timbers, the damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>to which is valued at $1160, lay on the sidewalk in seventh street, and the ends of some of the timber laid in the yard and some projected over the side walk, part projected inside and part outside of the fence, (was partly in the yard.) Cannot now say what proportion of it did project in the yard. There was no fence; the timber that projected and which was on the side walk, did not form a fence or enclosure. It was part of the plaintiff\u2019s stock. The yard was not enclosed; there might have been a few boards nailed to posts here and there at intervals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-5\">William E. Kellogg, the secretary of the company, on the part of the defendants, testified, that Mr. Webb and the president of the company, adjusted the loss on the office which was burnt at $400. That Webb signed a paper indorsed by the witness on the first appraisement, in these words, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-6\">\u201c I hereby limit the loss under my policy for lumber in the yard, to five hundred and sixty dollars, having received from another source the difference between that amount and the twelve hundred and ten dollars claimed as loss for lumber in the yard as per the within appraisement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-7\">New York, May 18th, 1848.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-8\">That witness was present at the conversation between Mr. Webb and the president respecting this deduction of $650. Mr. Webb stated, that Howland &amp; Aspinwall had received payment from one of the Fire Insurance Companies damage claimed by them upon policies upon their two steam-ships which was then building for them, and that they had given to him a part of the amount so received by them; and he stated that the money so received from another source, and witness believed it was under or from Howland &lt;fc Aspinwall, had been to cover part of the items composing the sum of $1210. That of the damage of stock in the yard amounting to $1210, he had received $650 from Howland &amp; Aspinwall, and that he would only claim for the balance of that item, viz., $560. He withdrew his claims for the six capstans contained in that schedule. The only subject of dispute was the timber in the street; the other matters were all settled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Being cross-examined, the witness says : My impression was that Mr. Webb had procured payment for the damage to the six capstans from Howland &lt;fc Aspinwall, or the parties for whom he was building the steamers. I understood that the claim for the capstans was included in the $650, and that it was withdrawn by Mr. Webb. The president agreed to pay him for all his claim except the lumber in the street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-5\">Being shown the endorsement upon the appraisement by which the plaintiff limited his claim to $560 he says: My recollection is that the six capstans were included in the amount therein referred to as having been received from another source. I so understood it, and that it was a part of the $650, withdrawn from the claim of $1210.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-6\">Thomas W. Thorn, the president of the company, testified, on the part of the defendants, that Mr. Webb and he agreed upon the appraisers. After the appraisements were handed to witness, he had another conversation with Mr. Webb, who in the course of it said he had received from Howland &lt;fc Aspinwall a sum of money on account of the damage to their two steamers. Witness cannot say what the amount was, but it strikes him it was over $2000 from them. The result of the conversation was, that he agreed to deduct from the claim of $1210, the sum of $650. Witness understood he had received his pay from H. &lt;fc A. for the capstans and all the manufactured timber for those ships. He limited his claim for the balance to $560. He gave up the claim for the capstans. The only thing about which we differed was the timber on the street. He understood that the $650 covered all the work upon timber or lumber for the ships then building for H. &amp; A. After they had adjusted the other claims, witness told Webb that he would not pay him for the timber on the side walks in the street. Witness offered to pay Webb the sum of $2760, viz. for timber in the yard, $560; moulds and patterns, $300 ; treenails, $500 ; blocks, falls and tools, $500; office, $400; on his draughts, &amp;c., $500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-7\">It was then shown that the defendants tendered to the plaintiff the $2760, with interest, and the costs of suit, in September, 1848; and the plaintiff received the same on account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Joseph Bishop, being re-called by the plaintiff, testified (the counsel for the defendant objecting, and the objection being overruled,) that he and Mackay made a separate estimate of the various items of the damage forming the sum of $650, included in the $1210.

charged the jury that the principal question between the parties was whether the damage to the stock lying outside of the yard, and amounting to $1160, was covered by the policy, and for the purpose

The court instructed the jury that the policy did extend to and protect the capstans, and submitted to the jury the questions of fact, whether the damage to the capstans had been made good to the plaintiffs as insisted by the defendants. He directed the jury in case they found the question in favor of the plaintiff to find a verdict for the sum of $1500, otherwise to find a verdict for the sum of $1250. (The counsel on both sides having agreed to adjust the precise amount of the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>after the construction of the policy had been settled by the court.) The court further, at the request of the defendant\u2019s counsel, charged the jury that if, on the evidence, they believed the plaintiff withdrew his claim for the capstans, having received the value thereof under the policies effected by the owners of the vessels, though they were not included in the items making up the amount of $650, the plaintiff was not entitled to reassert his claim or to recover for them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for $1500 damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-6\">The defendants moved for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-7\"><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6D\">All the claims arising from this loss, were amicably settled between the parties, except the plaintiff\u2019s claim for the capstans and for the timber situated on the side walks adjacent to the premises called the ship yard. At the trial, the inquiry as to the capstans was two-fold; first, whether they were within the policy; and second, whether the plaintiff had been paid his loss in that respect by the owners of the ships which he was building, and for which the capstans were preparing. The judge held at the trial, that they were within the terms of the policy, as timber in process of being wrought into vessels; and this was undoubtedly correct. The question as to the plaintiff\u2019s having received his loss upon the capstans from another source, was submitted to the jury, who were instructed, in accordance with the defendants\u2019 request, that if he had so received it, he could not recover it from them. The jury found that the plaintiff had not received this portion of his loss from any quarter, and we see no reason to interfere with their conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">\u25a0 The main question in the case, arises on the other part of the claim, and is, whether the timber on the side walks was within the stock insured by the policy. \u2022 The defendants contend that the risk is confined expressly to timber in the yard as bounded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>by Sixth and Seventh streets, Lewis street, and the East river; and that the court is to consider the sides of the streets and the margin of the river, as having been deemed the boundaries of the yard, as if the words to be construed were found in a conveyance of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s premises were an unfenced yard. Some fence remained along portions of the yard adjacent to the street, while along other portions there was none. The plaintiff offered to prove, and did prove, that it was usual for the owners of ship yards in this city, to keep their stock of timber on the side walks and in the streets in the vicinity of their yards, as much so as within the yards. It further appeared that the ends of some of the sticks of timber, embraced in the appraisal as timber outside of the plaintiff\u2019s inclosure, in fact projected into the inclosure, and across the line where the fence had formerly been. This testimony was objected to by the defendants, but it was received by the judge, and it was properly admitted. The object of the evidence of usage, (as it is called,) in these cases, is to ascertain what is the meaning of the language used by the parties in their contract; whether by the words \u201c stock of ship timber in a ship yard,\u201d was meant a yard bounded by lines exactly defined, and limited by streets or other lineal land-marks, or a yard as it was in fact used by ship builders in conducting their business.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">There was no good objection to the evidence offered on this point; and it being uncontradicted, it was sufficient to establish the usage, and to prove that a ship yard embraces the ground adjoining the inclosure, so far as it is used for keeping the stock of ship timber there provided for use.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">There is another point of difficulty to the defendants, if the usage were excluded: viz,, whether the insurance is at all confined to stock in the plaintiff\u2019s yard. On reading the policy, it will be perceived that there is no such limitation in the clause relating to the stock of ship timber, &amp;.C., on which $3500 were underwritten ; and three new lines, with as many distinct subjects of insurance, intervene before the yard is mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">It is a serious question whether the yard, as thus mentioned, applies at all to the first subject insured, and if it were neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>sary to decide the point, we should be inclined to hold that it does not. We are satisfied, however, that the verdict should be maintained on the other ground, and the motion for a new trial must be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
