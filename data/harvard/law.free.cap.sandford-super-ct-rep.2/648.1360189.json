The defendant in time, served an answer, signed by their attorneys, and certified by a commissioner to have been verified before him by both defendants. Neither of toem, however, appeared to have signed the answer or the affidavit which the commissioner certified. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney, treating the answer as a nullity, and without communicating with the attorneys for the defendants, entered a default and perfected judgment against the latter.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b660-9\"><em>T.

Sandford, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap8\">The answer was unquestionably defective, in the omission of the signatures of the parties verifying it. The practice has long been settled and uniform, that an affidavit should be signed by the deponent. A deposition, taken down by the officer, stands upon a different ground. <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>3 Sand. Ch. R. 352,414.) But the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, instead of entering a default, should -have notified the opposing attorneys of the defect, and if they did not promptly obviate it, he might then have treated it as a nullity, and proceeded to enter his judgment. We find this practice was established several years since, in the supreme court, and it is so fair and reasonable that we adopt it without hesitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
