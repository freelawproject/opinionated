A large proportion of the crop is delivered in good order; but from the unavoidable effects of a storm, a small part is delivered in a damaged condition, and another small portion is lost. In an action by the carrier for the freight, he is entitled to recover under the common <em>indebitatus </em>count, the agreed price for the whole quantity so delivered or lost.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-11\">This was an action of <em>assumpsit </em>in the Circuit court of Goochland county by Peter J.

To the introduction of which testimony under the pleadings in this cause, the defendant by his counsel objected <em>; </em>but the Court overruled the objection and admitted the testimony; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-4\">After the evidence referred to in the first bill of exceptions had been introduced, which, with the bill of particulars, was all the evidence in the cause, the defendant by his counsel moved the Court to instruct the jury as follows: \u201c If, from the evidence, the jury shall 'believe that a portion of the wheat for which freight is charged was not delivered, and a part of it was damaged and delivered to the consignee in an unsound state, then the plaintiff is not in this cause entitled to recover the freight for wheat at the rate of 12\u00a3 cents per bushel, as claimed by him in the account filed in the cause.\u201d But the Court overruled the motion and gave the following instruction, viz : <em>\u201c </em>If, from the evidence, the jury shall believe that a portion of the wheat for which the freight is charged was not delivered, and a part of it was damaged and delivered to the consignee in an unsound state, then the plaintiff is not in this cause entitled to recover the freight for wheat at the rate of 12J cents per bushel, as claimed by him in the account filed in the cause, unless the jury shall believe from the evidence, that the loss and damage were occasioned by inevitable accident; and not by the negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>gence of the plaintiff. And if the jury shall believe from the evidence, that the loss and damage were occasioned by the negligence of the plaintiff, or could have been prevented by proper care and diligence on the part of the plaintiff, then the defendant is entitled to the full amount of the loss and damage by way of set off.\u201d To the opinion of the Court refusing the instruction asked, and giving the other, the defendant again excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-4\">There was a verdict and judgment in favour of the plaintiff for 172 dollars 72 cents, with interest thereon from the 22d of July 1839, till paid; and thereupon Galt applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b325-5\"><em>Stanard </em>and <em>Bouldin, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHd\">insisted, that in this case the special contract had not been completely executed; and therefore, that the plaintiff below was not entitled to recover upon it, under the common <em>indebitatus </em>coimt. <em>Hulle </em>v. <em>Heightman, </em>2 East\u2019s R. 145; <em>Algeo </em>v. <em>Algeo, </em>10 Serg. &amp; Rawle 235; <em>Donaldson </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>3 Id. 505; <em>Jennings </em>v.
