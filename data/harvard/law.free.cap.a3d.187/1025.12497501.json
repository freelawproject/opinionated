Initially, Licensees appealed from the May 31, 2017 decision as a final order (No. 828 C.D. 2017). Thereafter, Licensees became uncertain of the finality of that order. As a precaution, therefore, Licensees sought and obtained the July 3, 2017 order certifying the matter for immediate interlocutory appeal. They then filed a second appeal (No. 938 C.D. 2017). The two appeals have been consolidated for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Licensees brought a class action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ( \u00a7 1983 ),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking refunds of all fees and assessments paid to the Philadelphia Parking Authority (Authority) beginning in 2004, under a state law this Court later declared unconstitutional. On the Authority's motion for summary judgment, the trial court denied Licensees' refund claims. However, the trial court directed the Authority to provide a specified review process for putative class members to follow in challenging fees and assessments made under the unconstitutional statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Upon review, we quash the interlocutory appeal at No. 938 C.D. 2017.

The amendments provided legislative oversight and an administrative process for challenges to the Authority's fees and assessments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   53 Pa.

However, given this Court's invalidation of Amended \u00a7 5707, the remedy provision in \u00a7 5707.1 is ineffective unless the legislature further amends the statute to correct the constitutional infirmities of Amended \u00a7 5707.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2013, following this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    MCT\n   </em>\n   , Licensees filed a civil rights class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, under \u00a7 1983.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Z &amp; R Cab, LLC v.

Licensees were therefore the only plaintiffs throughout the pendency of this action in the trial court. Nonetheless, in its ruling on the Authority's summary judgment motion, the trial court directed the Authority to provide administrative relief to additional persons and entities, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   It is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DECREED\n   </strong>\n   that the [Authority] shall provide\n   <em>\n    the putative class members\n   </em>\n   with the following administrative protest procedure:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   1.

Was the trial court's May 31, 2017 order, which dismissed all claims of the parties but which nevertheless continued to bind the [Authority], a final order under [Pa.] R.A.P. 341?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Br. for Appellants at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Finality of the Trial Court's May 31, 2017 Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As a threshold matter, addressing Licensees' last issue first, this Court must determine the source of its appellate jurisdiction in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Licensees initially appealed the trial court's May 31, 2017 decision as a final order under Pa. R.A.P. 341. However, Licensees became concerned that the trial court's order might be interlocutory because it included a directive requiring the Authority to provide administrative review that would necessarily occur after the date of the trial court's judgment. In Licensees' view, the trial court's decision continued to bind the Authority after entry of judgment, so it could be construed as not disposing of all parties. Therefore, Licensees requested that the trial court certify its summary judgment decision for immediate interlocutory appeal. The trial court complied, and Licensees filed a second appeal. This Court must determine which of the two appeals is properly before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This Court directed the parties to discuss in their principal briefs whether the summary judgment order was final or interlocutory. However, neither party cited any applicable authority or offered any analysis of the issue. Licensees merely suggested \"it seems safer to assume\" the trial court's May 31, 2017 order was interlocutory, because the Authority's request for a stay of its duty to comply with the order suggested the order may not have disposed of all parties. Br. for Appellants at 35. In opposition, the Authority offered a bare assertion that the order was final because it \"disposed of all claims between the parties,\" in that the trial court entered judgment on Licensees' refund claims. Br. for Appellee at 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This Court is aware of no instance in which an otherwise final order was rendered interlocutory because it required one party to take some action after entry\n   of judgment. To the contrary, Pennsylvania courts regularly treat orders as final for appeal purposes, even where they mandate conduct necessarily occurring after the entry of the judgments.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Petition to Compel Cooperation with Child Abuse Investigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969851\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/875/365/\">\n    875 A.2d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Super. 2005) (order compelling submission to a home visit during investigation of child abuse allegations was final and appealable);\n   <em>\n    Sutton v. Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"896691\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/405/213/\">\n    405 Pa.Super. 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"896691\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/405/213/\">\n    592 A.2d 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991) (appeal from a final decree in equity compelling replacement of a fence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The trial court's order left no request for relief pending. When the trial court entered a final order without ruling on the motion for class certification, Licensees' requests concerning class certification and notice became moot. Similarly, once the trial court denied Licensees' refund claims, their related claims concerning costs, attorneys' fees, and the source of funding for the requested refunds also became moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Thus, the trial court's May 31, 2017 order was final, in that it disposed of all claims and all parties. Consequently, the trial court lacked authority to certify the decision for immediate interlocutory appeal by permission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore quash the appeal at No. 938 C.D. 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Licensees' Arguments on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Trial Court's Authority to Fashion Equitable Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Licensees assert that the trial court exceeded its authority by fashioning a remedy not requested by either party. They point out that their claim requested full refunds of all fees and assessments paid under Former \u00a7 5707(b). Neither Licensees nor the Authority requested any alternative relief. However, the trial court, while denying Licensees' refund claims, ordered alternative relief in the form of an administrative review process in which Licensees and putative class members could challenge the fees and assessments before the Authority. Licensees contend any alternative remedy was beyond the trial court's authority. The arguments posited by Licensees are addressed separately below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Purported Mootness of the Alternative Remedy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First, Licensees argue the trial court ended the case when it denied their refund claims in the first part of its order. Licensees contend the trial court then had no further jurisdiction over the case that would allow it to formulate an alternative remedy as part of its decision. Licensees cite no authority for this assertion and do not otherwise develop it. Therefore, it is waived.\n   <em>\n    Irey v. Dep't of Transp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7307064\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/72/762/\">\n    72 A.3d 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 2013) (\n   <em>\n    en\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    banc\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Further, this argument facially lacks merit. By logical extension of Licensees' reasoning, the trial court could have entered the alternative relief, had it done so earlier in its decision. Under Licensees' suggestion, the trial court's jurisdiction to order relief would depend on the order in which it grouped the holdings in its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We reject Licensees' argument that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to order relief in its order granting the Authority's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Absence of Class Certification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Second, Licensees contend the trial court's decision should be reversed because it denied due process to the putative\n   class members, by purporting to bind them without first certifying the class. Licensees again fail to cite any authority or develop this argument. Therefore, they have also waived this argument.\n   <em>\n    Irey\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Further, Licensees misstate the nature of the trial court's error. Unless and until the trial court certifies a class, only the named plaintiffs may participate in the action as parties. Pa. R.C.P. No. 1710(e) ;\n   <em>\n    Silver Spring Twp. v. Pennsy Supply, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 149 Pa.Cmwlth. 314,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1435259\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/149/314/\">\n    613 A.2d 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). The trial court lacks personal jurisdiction over putative class members prior to certification of the class.\n   <em>\n    Silver Spring\n   </em>\n   .

Judicial Legislation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Third, Licensees argue the trial court engaged in improper judicial legislation by substituting or rewriting an unconstitutional statute in order to create an administrative remedy. This argument lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As explained above, one reason this Court declared Former \u00a7 5707(b) unconstitutional in\n   <em>\n    MCT\n   </em>\n   was that there was no mechanism to challenge the Authority's fees and assessments. Licensees assert that only the legislature can provide standards for remedying that infirmity in the statute. In fact, the legislature attempted to do so after this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    MCT\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5707.1. However, the legislature did not purport to adopt a retroactive procedure to remedy past constitutional\n   infirmities resulting in denials of due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The judicial history of this litigation has provided extensive analysis that now constitutes the law of this case. The federal due process violation mandates a retroactive remedy to Licensees.\n   <em>\n    Z &amp; R I\n   </em>\n   .

Thus, under the law of the case, the trial court was authorized to fashion a remedy, subject to appellate review, at least as to Licensees (though not as to the putative class members, as explained in the previous section).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Accordingly, we reject Licensees' argument that the trial court could not fashion a judicial remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    d.

However, such relief must be appropriate to the case as pled and proven.\n   <em>\n    Ridley\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Here, Licensees' complaint included no general prayer for relief. It is also doubtful that the relief fashioned by the trial court related to anything pled or proven in the case. The trial court created a remedy not raised or addressed by either party, and did so at the summary judgment stage, without any hearing or other input from the parties on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Edward M.\n   </em>\n   , discussed above, the Superior Court observed that neither party requested the relief ordered by the trial court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1806055\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/515/542/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, no hearing was conducted before ordering that relief. Without a class certification, only the expungement requests were before the trial court. Thus, the court lacked authority to order different relief.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1806055\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/515/542/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Superior Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Edward M.\n   </em>\n   is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Here, Licensees sought refunds of the fees and assessments they paid under Former \u00a7 5707(b). Without a class certification, only Licensees' request for refunds of their own payments was before the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Licensees are therefore correct in arguing that the trial court lacked authority to order relief different from what either party requested, particularly where it did so without a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    e. The Trial Court's Characterization of Licensees' Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Fifth, Licensees argue the trial court improperly recharacterized their \u00a7 1983 claims as refund claims. Inasmuch as Licensees\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   seeking refunds, albeit under \u00a7 1983, the point of this argument is unclear. Although not well developed, it appears to be related to Licensees' prior arguments. That is, Licensees appear to assert that the trial court was not free to ignore their rights under \u00a7 1983 by denying their refund request. This argument adds nothing persuasive to Licensees' previous arguments. We therefore reject it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Constitutionality of the Ordered Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Licensees next assert that the administrative remedy created by the trial court was constitutionally infirm. Licensees point to\n   <em>\n    Germantown Cab\n   </em>\n   , in which\n   this Court held that Amended \u00a7 5707, like Former \u00a7 5707(b), is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, in that it still fails to provide adequate standards, guidance, and limits on the Authority's exercise of delegated power. Licensees contend that the administrative process set forth in \u00a7 5707.1 must also be unconstitutional. Licensees reason that without adequate legislative controls, the purported administrative remedy is illusory because the Authority is not required to generate financial information sufficient to allow a party asserting a fee challenge to prove the fee is excessive or otherwise improper. Licensees therefore contend that the administrative remedy imposed by the trial court is likewise unconstitutional, because it is illusory. They argue that there is no way for them to demonstrate that the fees and assessments at issue were excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   This argument has some facial appeal. However, based on this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Germantown Cab\n   </em>\n   , it lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Germantown Cab\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff argued the Authority failed to produce records sufficient to permit calculation of its actual costs. Like Licensees here, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Germantown Cab\n   </em>\n   asserted that without such information, it could not effectively challenge the Authority's assessments. The Authority countered that Amended \u00a7 5707 only required it to produce copies of the budget documents it submitted to the General Assembly. This Court did not need to resolve this issue, in light of its conclusion that Amended \u00a7 5707 was still unconstitutional. However, this Court observed that under Amended \u00a7 5707, \"[t]he Authority is required to maintain and make available for inspection records of the costs incurred in connection with its regulation of taxicabs ... and of the manner in which it determined the assessment ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 333. This Court concluded that the required information went beyond mere budget submissions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   This Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Germantown Cab\n   </em>\n   suggests that a claimant asserting a fee challenge would have a right to compel production by the Authority of cost information needed to support the challenge. Therefore, Licensees are apparently incorrect in arguing that they cannot obtain such information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Accordingly, we reject Licensees' argument that they would have no means to ascertain the propriety of the amounts of Authority's fees and assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Authority's Purported Lack of Fee-Setting Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Next, Licensees assert that the trial court ignored Former \u00a7 5707(b)'s unconstitutional failure to provide standards and limits for the Authority's exercise of legislatively delegated power. This assertion is incorrect. Further, contrary to Licensees' suggestion, the trial court did not determine that no retroactive remedy was required. Indeed, the trial court ordered the Authority to provide Licensees (and putative class members) with a retroactive procedure to challenge fees and assessments going back to 2004. Therefore, we reject this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Licensees' Entitlement to Monetary Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Licensees contend the trial court erred in declining to award monetary damages. Licensees argue the trial court improperly fashioned an equitable remedy in reliance on speculation by the federal district court in\n   <em>\n    Z &amp; R I\n   </em>\n   as to what retroactive remedy Licensees would be entitled to recover. Licensees appear to be correct in surmising that the trial court tried to follow the federal court's guidance in fashioning a remedy. However, that in itself does not necessarily constitute error by the trial\n   court. The federal court observed that state courts have discretion in fashioning retroactive remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Z &amp; R I\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Nonetheless, Licensees insist the trial court erred in fashioning an equitable order, because no remedy other than a refund was appropriate. Licensees assert that in\n   <em>\n    Z &amp; R Cab, LLC v. Philadelphia Parking Authority\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=616%20Fed.%20Appx.%20527\">\n    616 Fed.Appx. 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2015) (\n   <em>\n    Z &amp; R II\n   </em>\n   ), the Third Circuit Court of Appeals found that monetary damages are the only remedy available to Licensees. This assertion is misleading. The Third Circuit did suggest that monetary damages would be the correct remedy. However, the holding of the Third Circuit's decision was that it remanded to the district court for a determination of whether to exercise or decline jurisdiction based on principles of comity. Thus, the Third Circuit's analysis of what remedy would ultimately be appropriate was not necessary to its decision and was not part of its holding. Rather, the Third Circuit discussed the issue of monetary damages only in the context of analyzing how the nature of the available remedy might affect the district court's comity analysis on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In context, the Third Circuit actually observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Before describing the comity doctrine in some detail to illustrate why I believe applying it to this case would be a mistake, I stress that only one remedy is possible here: damages. The case before us concerns a procedural due process violation.... Although procedural due process is a flexible standard, the remedies for violations of it are straightforward: equitable relief where appropriate ( [Licensees] concede their request for such relief is moot), and damages if [Licensees] can prove, consistent with ordinary tort principles, that they in fact suffered compensable injuries.... [I]f [Licensees] lost money specifically because they lacked an opportunity to challenge the rates the [Authority] set, they can recover that amount of money.... The extent of the damages is open to debate; [Licensees] demand all the fees paid to the [Authority] over a decade, but it is not clear from the record before us that they will be entitled to nearly that amount of money. The causal relationship between the due process violation and the amount [Licensees] paid has yet to be established, and I note that any recovery may be affected by Pennsylvania's two-year statute of limitations for \u00a7 1983 actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    Z &amp; R II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=616%20Fed.%20Appx.%20527\">\n    616 Fed.Appx. at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Thus, although the Third Circuit did suggest monetary damages would be the proper remedy in Licensees' \u00a7 1983 action, the court also posited that recovery would be limited to the amount, if any, that exceeded what would have been paid if not for the constitutional violation, and also potentially subject to a two-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Licensees focus only on the Third Circuit's observation on the propriety of monetary damages, ignoring the rest of the discussion in\n   <em>\n    Z &amp; R II\n   </em>\n   concerning the limitations on that remedy. Licensees insist the trial court was required, as a matter of law, to award them a full refund of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   fees and assessments they paid from 2004 to 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   We have substantial doubt regarding Licensees' entitlement to the full refund they demand.

Division of Alcoholic Beverages &amp; Tobacco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121531\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/18/\">\n    496 U.S. 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121531\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/18/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121531\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/18/\">\n    110 L.Ed.2d 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990), the U.S. Supreme Court set forth permissible retroactive remedies for parties burdened by unconstitutional tax statutes. The tax statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    McKesson\n   </em>\n   improperly discriminated between different groups of taxpayers in interstate commerce. One available remedy was to refund the difference between the tax paid and the tax that should have been assessed had unconstitutional distinctions not been made.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121531\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/18/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Stated differently, one possible remedy was a refund \"of the excess taxes paid by petitioner ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121531\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/18/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121531\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/18/\">\n    at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121531\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/18/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Also, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    McKesson\n   </em>\n   observed that states may avail themselves of a variety of procedural protections against any disruptive effects of a tax scheme's invalidation, such as \"enforcing relatively short statutes of limitation applicable to refund actions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121531\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/18/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121531\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/18/\">\n    at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121531\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/18/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notably, the Third Circuit's observation in\n   <em>\n    Z &amp; R II\n   </em>\n   concerning the available remedy in this case was consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    McKesson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Locust Lake Village Property Owners Association v.

This Court concluded that the tax assessment challenge in that case entitled the successful claimant to a refund only of excess tax payments, not the entire tax paid. Further, this Court observed that retrospective relief may be limited in time, because the revenue base of taxing bodies should not be left open indefinitely to retrospective claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nextel Commc'ns v.

However, Licensees offer no persuasive reason to apply the analysis in\n   <em>\n    McKesson\n   </em>\n   so narrowly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Although we will not decide this issue now, by analogy to\n   <em>\n    McKesson\n   </em>\n   , and consistent with\n   <em>\n    Z &amp; R II\n   </em>\n   , Licensees could be entitled to recover only the portion, if any, of their fees and assessments that exceeded the amount the Authority would have assessed had it been subject to constitutional standards, guidance, and limits imposed by the General Assembly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The determination of the proper measure of damages is a matter for more complete argument by the parties and analysis by a court at a later point. Suffice it to observe now that this appears to be one of the most important points of disagreement between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The trial court apparently concluded that a full refund was not the appropriate remedy for Licensees, and it tried to formulate an administrative process that would allow Licensees to seek properly limited retroactive relief. However, as discussed above, the trial court lacked authority to impose the remedy it created in this action. As to the putative class members, they were not parties to the action, and the trial court's decision could not affect them. As to Licensees, they did not request relief other than a refund, and they did not plead a general prayer for relief that would have allowed the trial court to grant relief different in kind from what Licensees sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Summary judgment was not appropriate in this case, because fact issues remain to be determined. The trial court's formulated remedy itself anticipated fact determinations during the administrative review process; this demonstrates that questions of fact remain concerning the amount of any refunds Licensees may receive. There are also unresolved issues of mixed fact and law concerning how far back in time Licensees can reach in seeking relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   By simply denying all refund claims and directing an administrative review, the trial court abdicated its duty to resolve Licensees' claims under \u00a7 1983 and sought to transfer that responsibility to the Authority.
