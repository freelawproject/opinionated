Murray, J.\n   </em>\n   ) denying her motion to disqualify the State's attorneys from further participation in her prosecution for murder, 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 201(1)(B) (2017). Carrillo contends that the two Assistant Attorneys General representing the State should have been disqualified based on their access to privileged or confidential information obtained by the State's violation of the subpoena process. We dismiss the appeal as interlocutory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 2] On March 15, 2018, Carrillo was indicted for depraved indifference murder, 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 201(1)(B), in connection with the death of her ten-year-old daughter. Soon after, the State subpoenaed records relating to Carrillo from Carrillo's former school and former employer in New York. After concluding that the State had obtained the records through a violation of the subpoena process set out in M.R.U. Crim. P. 17A, the court granted Carrillo's request for a protective order and required that all documents produced in response to the subpoenas be surrendered to the court to be placed under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 3] Carrillo also moved to disqualify the State's attorneys from participating further in her prosecution on the ground that the prosecutors committed \"serious\n   and ethical violations\" in obtaining the subpoenaed information. After a hearing, by order dated April 12, 2018, the court denied the motion to disqualify, stating that \"disqualification ... is reserved for situations of prior representation, conflicts of interest, prosecutorial misconduct, and other unethical attorney behavior,\" and that it was not persuaded that the prosecutors' error rose \"to that level of behavior which would warrant the rather extraordinary remedy of disqualification.\" (Quotation marks omitted.) Carrillo instituted this appeal to challenge the court's denial of her motion to disqualify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 4] We first consider the State's motion to dismiss the appeal as interlocutory. \"It is well settled that appeals, in order to be cognizable, must be from a final judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Lemay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7936746\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/611/67/#p68\">\n    611 A.2d 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 68 (Me. 1992). There is no dispute that Carrillo's case is far from a final judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bond v. Bond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7280608\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/30/816/7280608/\">\n    2011 ME 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7280608\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/30/816/7280608/\">\n    30 A.3d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A judgment is final only if it disposes of all the pending claims in the action, leaving no questions for the future consideration of the court.\" (quotation marks omitted) ). Carrillo contends, however, that the matter qualifies for immediate review pursuant to the death knell exception to the final judgment rule, which applies \"when substantial rights of a party will be irreparably lost if review is delayed until final judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Markheim v. Markheim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8204690\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/957/56/\">\n    2008 ME 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8204690\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/957/56/\">\n    957 A.2d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted). It is Carrillo's burden, as the appellant seeking immediate review, to demonstrate that the exception to the final judgment rule applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanborn v.

We have also warned that \"a blanket exception to the final judgment rule allowing the denial of a motion to disqualify to be immediately appealed would allow any appellant to force us to prematurely review issues that would otherwise have to wait for the complete record that accompanies a final judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Such a practice would at once \"eviscerate\" the final judgment rule,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23, and allow motions for disqualification to be \"abused for tactical purposes,\"\n   <em>\n    Morin v.

In that case, the trial court denied a motion to disqualify the attorney for the opposing party in which the moving parties argued that the\n   attorney was \"privy to confidential information\" when he previously represented them in a \"substantially similar\" prior litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4, 10, 21.

Unlike the moving party in\n   <em>\n    Markheim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8204690\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/957/56/\">\n    2008 ME 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8204690\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/957/56/\">\n    957 A.2d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Carrillo has failed to articulate any irreparable loss of a right that she stands to suffer by allowing these prosecutors to continue to represent the State. She has argued that the prosecutors' knowledge of the records \"interferes with [her] right to testify at trial\" and \"taints the process\" because, \"[i]f she testifies at trial, ... she will know that these prosecutors have read private and sensitive personal information about her which she thought was confidential and secret.\" Carrillo has also argued that \"[e]ven if the prosecution was prohibited from using the information [obtained from the records] directly, they would be able to push and explore on cross examination-or through their own expert presentation further develop-aspects of different psychological background and cognitive functioning that they have learned about through the acquisition\" of the records at issue. Such general assertions, however, do not constitute the specific demonstration of irreparable loss that is required to abandon our otherwise well-settled application of the final judgment rule to denials of motions to disqualify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Subilia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7296954\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/974/918/\">\n    2009 ME 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7296954\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/974/918/\">\n    974 A.2d 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Markheim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8204690\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/957/56/\">\n    2008 ME 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 20-21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8204690\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/957/56/\">\n    957 A.2d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
