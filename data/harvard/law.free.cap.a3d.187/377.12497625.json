Despite the phrase's common usage relative to these two offenses, \"overt act\" does not mean the same thing when used in the context of an attempt as in the context of a conspiracy. \"[T]he slightest action on the part of a conspirator\" can constitute an overt act for purposes of a conspiracy charge.\n      <em>\n       State v.

The abandonment defense limits the substantial-step rule such that a preparatory act, like the collection of tools needed to commit a crime, is not criminalized when the actor abandons his or her intent to commit the crime, even if the actor retains the tools needed for the crime. Without the abandonment defense, the substantial-step analysis would permit the criminalization of an act much farther removed from the commission of the actual crime than Vermont's law allows, and effectively criminalize intent uncoupled with action.\n     </attorneys>\n    </footnote>\n    <div type=\"majority\">\n     <p id=\"p-5\">\n      <strong>\n       <em>\n        ENTRY ORDER\n       </em>\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-6\">\n      \u00b6 1. Defendant Jack Sawyer appeals the trial court's decision holding him without bail. Defendant is charged with four separate counts, each predicated on his alleged attempt to commit a crime, and three of which are punishable by life imprisonment. The sole question before this Court is whether the evidence of guilt is great that defendant attempted to commit any of the four charged crimes given the definition of \"attempt\" under Vermont law. We hold that the weight of the evidence is not great that defendant has committed any act or combination of acts that would satisfy Vermont's definition of an attempt to commit\n     any of the charged crimes. We reverse the trial court's hold-without-bail order and remand for further proceedings.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-7\">\n      \u00b6 2. Each of the four counts that defendant is charged with arises from his alleged attempt to commit a mass shooting at Fair Haven Union High School (FHUHS). The first count alleges that defendant attempted to cause bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon in violation of 13 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 1024(a)(2). The second count alleges that defendant attempted to commit first-degree murder in violation of 13 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 2301. The third and fourth counts allege that defendant attempted to commit aggravated murder in violation of 13 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 9, 2311(a)(3), and 2311(a)(7). The attempted aggravated murder counts are punishable by life imprisonment with no possibility of parole and the attempted first-degree murder count carries the potential for life without parole. 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 9(a) (\"If the offense attempted to be committed is murder [or] aggravated murder ... a person shall be punished as the offense attempted to be committed is by law punishable.\");\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      \u00a7 2303(a)(1)(A)-(B) (\"The punishment for murder in the first degree shall be imprisonment for ... a minimum term of not less than 35 years and a maximum term of life; or ... life without the possibility of parole.\");\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      \u00a7 2311(c) (\"The punishment for aggravated murder shall be imprisonment for life and for no lesser term .... A person sentenced under this section shall not be eligible for parole during the term of imprisonment imposed herein ....\").\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-8\">\n      \u00b6 3. Defendant was held without bail under 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 7553, which implements the Vermont Constitution's presumption that a person shall be released on bail, unless the person is charged with \"an offense punishable by death or life imprisonment ... when the evidence of guilt is great.\" Vt. Const. ch. II, \u00a7 40. Section 7553 states that \"[a] person charged with an offense punishable by life imprisonment when the evidence of guilt is great may be held without bail.\" In cases, such as this one, where a defendant is charged with an offense punishable by life imprisonment and the constitutional presumption in favor of release with bail or other conditions does not apply, \"the presumption is switched so that the norm is incarceration and not release.\"\n      <em>\n       State v.

Duff\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2406862\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/151/433/#p440\">\n       151 Vt. 433\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 440,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2406862\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/151/433/#p440\">\n       563 A.2d 258\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 263 (1989) (\"Accordingly, we adopt the standards under V.R.Cr.P. 12(d) as the correct standard of review under Ch.

Rule 12(d) permits dismissal of a charge when the State cannot provide sufficient evidence on each element of the charged offense such that a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. V.R.Cr.P. 12(d)(1) (\"The defendant may move for dismissal of the indictment or information on the ground that the prosecution is unable to make out a prima facie case against him.\"). Thus, a defendant may be held without bail under \u00a7 7553 when two requirements are met: (1) the defendant is charged with a crime carrying a potential sentence of life imprisonment, and (2) the State can present evidence that, \"taken in the light most favorable to the State and excluding modifying evidence, can fairly and reasonably show defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n      <em>\n       Duff\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2406862\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/151/433/#p440\">\n       151 Vt. at 439\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2406862\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/151/433/#p440\">\n       563 A.2d at 263\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (quotation omitted).

Applying the standard described above, we now discuss the facts of this case taken in the light most favorable to the State and excluding all modifying evidence.\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n      On February 14, 2018, the Fair Haven police department received a call from the Vermont State Police about a possible threat to FHUHS. Based on this reported threat, the Fair Haven police located defendant at the home of one of his friends. Police explained to defendant that they were there because a threat to FHUHS had been reported. Defendant responded that he had problems with the school when he attended, and that he was still kind of upset with the school but had moved past it. Defendant explained to police that he had been engaged in target practice, showed police the empty milk jugs he used for target practice, and said that he had recently purchased a shotgun at a local business after returning to Vermont from a program in Maine. Defendant also showed police the buckshot he was using at the time. The police did not detain defendant because, as the Fair Haven chief testified at the trial court hearing, they did not have probable cause to take any further action at that time.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      \u00b6 6. The next day, the Dutchess County, New York, sheriff's office contacted Fair Haven police regarding Facebook messages received by a Dutchess County student from defendant that suggested defendant was making threats against FHUHS. The messages were admitted at the trial court's weight-of-the-evidence hearing. In the messages, defendant writes \"[j]ust a few days ago I was still plotting on shooting up my old high school so it's not like I really wanted a future anyways.\" His messages also spoke approvingly of a recent school shooting in another state. The Fair Haven police chief reviewed the messages and concluded that police should question defendant again.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      \u00b6 7. The police detained and interviewed defendant. During this interview, defendant stated that when he attended FHUHS, which he left permanently in 2016, he had planned to commit a mass shooting at the school. He also stated that until about a week or two prior to the interview, he was still thinking about committing a school shooting at FHUHS, though later in the interview he also admitted to discussing school shootings a day or two earlier in the Facebook messages described above. He discussed the need to go to FHUHS before the shooting to observe the School Resource Officer's habits and pattern of behavior in preparation for any shooting because, as defendant noted, the Officer would likely be the only person in the school that could stop defendant\n     once a shooting began. Defendant had not yet gone to the school to observe the Officer. Defendant also told police that he planned to conclude any shooting in the school's library, in mimicry of the Columbine shooting, and discussed the kinds of guns and other items that he would want to have for a school shooting. Defendant told police that he had converted money from his bank account to Bitcoin, installed a browser that would allow him to access the dark web, and intended to purchase a handgun with Bitcoin on the dark web. He had been unable to purchase this handgun, which is included in the lists of needed equipment in defendant's journal as described below, because the value of defendant's Bitcoin had diminished. Defendant told the officers that he wanted to exceed the body count from the Virginia Tech shooting and that he had chosen his ammunition accordingly. Finally, defendant told police that he wanted to commit a mass shooting on the anniversary of the date of the Columbine school shooting but that FHUHS would not be in session at that time, and he instead would commit any shooting on March 14th.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      \u00b6 8. Police searched defendant's car after he was detained and found a shotgun and seventeen rounds of ammunition. Police also found four books related to school shootings, including the Columbine massacre, as well as defendant's journal. The journal was admitted into evidence at the trial court's hearing. Defendant had placed a label on the front of the journal, which read \"The Journal of an Active Shooter.\" In the journal, defendant expresses suicidal ideation and his desire to commit \"suicide by homicide.\" In an entry dated October 25, 2017, he writes that he wants to commit suicide \"in a bigger and better way than just the stereotypical suicide.\" Regarding his alleged plan to commit a mass shooting at FHUHS, in an entry dated November 29, 2017, he writes:\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      I've had a change in plans. The day will be coming much more sooner than previously thought. I've realized the huge importance of being able to kill the kids that I actually know vs. waiting a year or so until they're all gone. I'm aiming to kill as many as I can and whoever I can, but it'd also be more fun and satisfying to kill a lot of the dumb fucks that I actually went to school with, I know what they're like and how idiotic they are. With the sudden shift in plans, that also means that I need to prepare and gather supplies quicker. It shouldn't take too extremely long to buy the guns, but it'll be difficult to make the bombs since I don't really have a good place to practice detonating them, but I'll probably figure it out.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      By entry dated December 4, 2017, he writes: \"It would save me a lot more energy and hopelessness to take myself out now. But I also can't abandon my plan .... From the time I had the first initial thoughts of shooting up FHUHS, it was too late to turn back on it.\" Defendant's journal includes lists of materials, including several different kinds of guns, that defendant wanted to have for a school shooting, as well as possible dates for a school shooting according to the FHUHS calendar. The last entry in defendant's journal before he was arrested, which is dated February 3, 2018, describes his unsuccessful attempt to buy a shotgun in Maine. He indicates that he will take a \"low key trip to VT soon to get the shotgun and hopefully rifle.\"\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-16\">\n      \u00b6 9. After searching defendant's car, police went to defendant's father's house. Defendant's father gave police a second copy of the book about the Columbine school shooting found in defendant's car and a shotgun belonging to defendant. The shotgun had a modified stock and barrel,\n     such that the total size of the gun was shorter than a typical shotgun.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-17\">\n      \u00b6 10. On February 16, 2018, defendant was arraigned on the four offenses described above and held without bail pending a weight-of-the-evidence hearing. The trial court held a hearing over two days in late February and early March 2018. The trial court issued an order holding defendant without bail under \u00a7 7553 on March 19, 2018.

The evidence showed that the defendant made repeated aggressive sexual advances toward the complainant and did not cease until the defendant turned away from the complainant and she was able to run out of the room to contact police. Relying on treatises and caselaw from other states, this Court explained that a defendant's voluntary abandonment after an attempt to commit a crime does not eradicate guilt for the crime when the defendant has committed acts that progress beyond acts of mere preparation to acts in commission of the attempt.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 22 (\" '[A] voluntary abandonment of an attempt which has proceeded beyond mere preparation into an overt act\n     or acts in furtherance of the commission of the attempt does not expiate the guilt of, or forbid punishment for, the crime already committed.' \" (quoting\n      <em>\n       Wiley v.

In sum, if we adopted the State's argument that defendant's preparatory acts constituted an attempt to commit the crimes charged, defendant would have been unable to abandon his plan and could have been punished just as if he had completed it.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-29\">\n      \u00b6 20. The unavailability of an abandonment defense differentiates Vermont's law on attempt from the substantial-step analysis in the Model Penal Code, which permits abandonment as an affirmative defense.\n      <footnotemark>\n       3\n      </footnotemark>\n      \"When the actor's conduct would otherwise constitute an attempt ... it is an affirmative defense that he [or she] abandoned his [or her] effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevented its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.\" Model Penal Code \u00a7 5.01(4). In the absence of an abandonment defense to an attempt charge under Vermont's law, applying the substantial-step analysis rather than the\n      <em>\n       Hurley\n      </em>\n      standard would effectively result in the criminalization of an actor's intent.\n      <footnotemark>\n       4\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-30\">\n      \u00b6 21. The substantial-step analysis presents a lower bar regarding the kind of act required to show that a defendant has attempted to commit a crime: an act may be used to prove an attempt if the act is a \"substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in [the] commission of the crime,\" when the act is performed with the intent required to commit the attempted crime.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=207%20A.2d%20478\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      \u00a7 5.01(1)(c). This standard suggests that preparatory acts such as those rejected in\n      <em>\n       Hurley\n      </em>\n      could serve as the basis for an attempt charge under the Model Penal Code. Indeed, the Model Penal Code specifically provides that the \"possession, collection or fabrication of materials to be employed in the commission of the crime, at or near the place contemplated for its commission, if such possession, collection or fabrication serves no lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances\" may be \"strongly corroborative\" of the actor's purpose in\n     attempting to commit a crime.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=207%20A.2d%20478\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      \u00a7 5.01(2)(f). This rule is directly contrary to\n      <em>\n       Hurley\n      </em>\n      's clear statement that possession of the tools or materials necessary to commit a crime is not an attempt to commit the crime, but is merely a preparatory, and therefore not criminally culpable, act.\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4465942\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/79/28/#p31\">\n       79 Vt. at 33\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20A.%2078\">\n       64 A. at 79\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .

We conclude that defendant's actions do not meet the standard set out in\n      <em>\n       Hurley\n      </em>\n      and subsequent cases.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-32\">\n      \u00b6 23. The State's evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the State and excluding modifying evidence, showed the following facts.\n      <em>\n       Duff\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2406862\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/151/433/#p440\">\n       151 Vt. at 439\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2406862\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/151/433/#p440\">\n       563 A.2d at 263\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . Defendant purchased a shotgun and planned to purchase at least one more gun. He planned to conduct surveillance at FHUHS to determine when the School Resource Officer was not generally present. Defendant had not yet purchased another gun or conducted surveillance at FHUHS. He sent Facebook messages to the effect that he planned to commit a shooting at FHUHS, and he wrote at length in his journal that he currently planned to commit such an act at some future time. Defendant also kept lists of the items that he needed before actually committing a shooting at the school, many of which he did not have. He researched the FHUHS calendar to select an optimal date for the planned shooting.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-33\">\n      \u00b6 24. Just as the defendant in\n      <em>\n       Hurley\n      </em>\n      did not commit an attempt to break out of jail based on the mere possession of the hacksaws to saw through the jail window bars, defendant in this case took no action so proximate to the commission of the school shooting as to constitute an attempt. Each of defendant's actions was a preparatory act, and not an act undertaken in the attempt to commit a crime. Therefore, as a matter of law, defendant's acts did not fall within the definition of an attempt.

Under Vermont's law, as set forth in decisions of this Court, the State has not presented sufficient evidence to conclude that the \"evidence of guilt is great\" such that defendant may be presumed incarcerated rather than released prior to trial.

In closing, we note that the Judiciary's role is confined to the interpretation and application of the law as it currently stands. Beginning with\n      <em>\n       Hurley\n      </em>\n      over a century ago, this Court has consistently held that preparation alone does not satisfy the high bar required to prove an attempt. The Legislature is tasked with enacting\n     such laws as the people of Vermont think necessary. This Court is bound to apply the law in agreement with statute and this Court's own earlier decisions. The Legislature can, if it chooses, deviate from this long-established standard by passing a law revising the definition of attempt.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-36\">\n      <em>\n       Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision\n      </em>\n      .\n     </p>\n    </div>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
