Carter, appeals from the judgment of the trial court dismissing his action against the defendants, the attorney general for the state of Connecticut and four state\n   employees,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in their official and individual capacities, on the grounds of sovereign immunity, lack of personal jurisdiction due to insufficient service of process, and mootness. On appeal, the plaintiff asserts that the court erred in dismissing his action against the defendants in their official capacities because his allegations fall within (1) an exception to the doctrine of sovereign immunity and (2) the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception to mootness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts alleged in the complaint and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. In a complaint dated June 9, 2015, the plaintiff, then an inmate at Cheshire Correctional Institution in Cheshire, alleged that on July 17, 2014, he was subject to a random urinalysis test pursuant to Department of Correction Administrative Directive 6.8. The plaintiff was informed that his urine sample tested positive for amphetamines. According to protocol, a positive test result requires the sample to be sent to an outside laboratory for confirmatory testing. The plaintiff was placed in restrictive housing while awaiting the results of the confirmatory test. On July 22, 2014, correctional institution officials were informed that the plaintiff's urine sample tested negative for amphetamines and methamphetamines. More than twenty-four hours later, the plaintiff was still in restrictive housing. According to the administrative\n   directive, when the \"outside laboratory urinalysis results are negative ... the inmate's status prior to any administrative action taken shall be restored.\" The plaintiff alleged that, following the negative test results, \"he was not restored to his prior status as a ticket or trouble free inmate, nor his employment in the library area ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff averred that the defendants either were involved in a conspiracy to deprive or \"reckless[ly] disregard[ed] ... the plaintiff's due process rights afforded [to] him by administrative directive 6.8.\" For relief, the defendant sought monetary damages from the defendants in their official and individual capacities, a jury trial and \"[a] declaratory judgment declaring what [his] due process rights [were] or are.\" On August 7, 2014, approximately three weeks after the random urinalysis test was administered, the plaintiff was transferred to MacDougall-Walker Correctional\n   Institution in Suffield. The plaintiff subsequently was transferred to Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Institution in Uncasville.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendants were served with process on July 20, 2015, by a state marshal who left the writ of summons and complaint at the Office of the Attorney General. On August 12, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction, sovereign immunity, and mootness. On February 18, 2016, the court granted the motion to dismiss in part, stating that (1) sovereign immunity barred any claims for monetary damages against the defendants in their official capacities, and (2) claims against the defendants in their individual capacities were dismissed for defective service of process. The court denied the motion to dismiss as to the plaintiff's claim for declaratory relief. Subsequently, on August 16, 2016, the court granted the defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   motion to reargue and dismissed the plaintiff's complaint entirely, stating that the plaintiff's claim for declaratory relief was moot because he had been transferred out of the correctional institution at which the defendants were employed. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Our standard of review on a motion to dismiss is well established. \"A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.... [O]ur review of the court's ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [determination] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo.... When a ... court decides a jurisdictional question raised by a pretrial motion to dismiss, it must consider the allegations of the complaint in their most favorable light.... In this regard, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader.... The motion to dismiss ... admits all facts which are well pleaded, invokes the existing record and must be decided upon that alone.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Gold\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rowland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086348\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/296/186/#p200\">\n    296 Conn. 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200-201,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=994%20A.2d%20106\">\n    994 A.2d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We first address the plaintiff's claim that the court erred by dismissing his action against the defendants in their official capacities on the ground of sovereign immunity. The plaintiff argues that his complaint contained sufficient allegations to fall within an exception to the doctrine of sovereign immunity; specifically, that the defendants' conduct was in excess of their statutory authority derived from Department of Correction Administrative Directive 6.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Sovereign immunity relates to a court's subject matter jurisdiction over a case, and therefore presents a question of law over which we exercise de novo review.... In so doing, we must decide whether [the trial\n   court's] conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.... The principle that the state cannot be sued without its consent, or sovereign immunity, is well established under our case law.... It has deep roots in this state and our legal system in general, finding its origin in ancient common law.... Not only have we recognized the state's immunity as an entity, but [w]e have also recognized that because the state can act only through its officers and agents, a suit against a state officer concerning a matter in which the officer represents the state is, in effect, against the state.... Exceptions to this doctrine are few and narrowly construed under our jurisprudence....\n   \"[T]he sovereign immunity enjoyed by the state is not absolute. There are [three] exceptions: (1) when the legislature, either expressly or by force of a necessary implication, statutorily waives the state's sovereign immunity ... (2) when an action seeks declaratory or injunctive relief on the basis of a substantial claim that the state or one of its officers has violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights ... and (3) when an action seeks declaratory or injunctive relief on the basis of a substantial allegation of wrongful conduct to promote an illegal purpose in excess of the officer's statutory authority.... For a claim under the third exception, the plaintiffs must do more than allege that the defendants' conduct was in excess of their statutory authority; they also must allege or otherwise establish facts that reasonably support those allegations.... In the absence of a proper factual basis in the complaint to support the applicability of these exceptions, the granting of a motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds is proper.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Columbia Air Services, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Dept. of Transportation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146394\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/342/#p349\">\n    293 Conn. 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 349-50,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20636\">\n    977 A.2d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n   Our Supreme Court has held that the exception to sovereign immunity for individuals alleged to have acted in excess of their statutory authority applies only to actions for injunctive or declaratory relief.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"913381\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/265/301/#p321\">\n    265 Conn. 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 321,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=828%20A.2d%20549\">\n    828 A.2d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). \"The reason for this qualification was to protect the state from significant interference with its functions and to limit the rule to declaratory or injunctive suits, in which the trial court carefully can tailor the relief.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Columbia Air Services, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Dept. of Transportation\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146394\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/342/#p349\">\n    293 Conn. at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20636\">\n    977 A.2d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars the plaintiff's claims for monetary relief. This is our well established jurisprudence.

Because the doctrine of sovereign immunity applies, the court properly dismissed the plaintiff's claim for monetary damages against the defendants in their\n   official capacities for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Next, we address the plaintiff's argument that the court erred in dismissing his claim for declaratory relief on the ground of mootness, which was based on his assertion that his allegations fall within the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception. The plaintiff, in his brief, admits that \"[i]t is well established that an inmate['s] transfer from a prison facility generally moots claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against officials of that facility.\" Nevertheless, he contends that his claim is not moot because he could be subject to random urinalysis tests at any state correctional institution. Our only inquiry is whether the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception applies to the plaintiff's claim. We conclude that it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Mootness is a question of justiciability that must be determined as a threshold matter because it implicates this court's subject matter jurisdiction.... Justiciability requires (1) that there be an actual controversy between or among the parties to the dispute ... (2) that the interests of the parties be adverse ... (3) that the matter in controversy be capable of being adjudicated by judicial power ... and (4) that the determination of the controversy will result in practical relief to the complainant.... An actual controversy must exist not only at the time the appeal is taken, but also throughout the pendency of the appeal.... When,\n   during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Renaissance Management Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490771\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/168/530/#p685\">\n    175 Conn.

Under the first requirement, the length of the challenged action, he asserts that he was placed in restrictive housing from July 17 through August 7, 2014, when he was transferred to another facility, and that this \"duration was too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration ....\" Under the second requirement, the reasonable likelihood that the question will arise again, the plaintiff argues that \"there is a reasonable expectation that he will be subject to the same [random urinalysis testing] again\" at any correctional institution in the\n   state. The plaintiff did not allege that the third requirement is also satisfied, i.e., that his claims are a matter of public importance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A reasonable interpretation of the plaintiff's allegations is that he was aggrieved due to the delay in his release from restrictive housing after the correctional institution officials were informed that his urine sample tested negative for amphetamines and methamphetamines, and that his prior status was not fully restored because he lost his job in the library due to his transfer to a different correctional institution. Although the plaintiff alleged that he was placed in restrictive housing for a limited duration in this specific instance, there is no evidence of the challenged action having an\n   <em>\n    inherently limited duration\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    intrinsically limited lifespan\n   </em>\n   .
