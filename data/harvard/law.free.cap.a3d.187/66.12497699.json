We hold that jurisdiction under the UPPA is determined upon the filing of the petition and, barring a procedural default by the petitioner, is not defeated upon the petitioner's release from custody prior to completion of full review, including any appellate review, of the case. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, which came to the opposite conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Cecil County, Petitioner William Kranz was convicted of two counts each of first-degree assault and reckless endangerment. On July 31, 2009, the court sentenced Petitioner to ten years' imprisonment, five of which were suspended, and three years' supervised probation.

Following denial of relief by the post-conviction court, Petitioner filed, on June 19, 2013, an application for leave to appeal. On April 7, 2015, Petitioner completed his sentence, including the three-year probationary period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 31, 2016, more than three years after Petitioner filed the application for leave to appeal, the Court of Special Appeals granted the application and placed the case on its regular appeals docket. Petitioner briefed the merits of his claim that the State had committed a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation. The State, in addition to responding to the merits of that claim, included a motion to dismiss the appeal. In support of dismissal, the State made two arguments: First, Petitioner was no longer incarcerated, on parole, or on probation, and therefore was not \"in custody\" for purposes of CP \u00a7 7-101 of the UPPA, rendering the case moot; second, Petitioner's loss of \"in-custody\" status divested the Court of Special Appeals of jurisdiction to consider the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals issued a reported opinion granting the State's motion to dismiss the appeal.\n   <em>\n    Kranz v.

The intermediate appellate court opted not to address the State's mootness argument. The court instead rested its dismissal of the appeal on its interpretation of the UPPA, agreeing with the State that the court lost jurisdiction to entertain the appeal once Petitioner was no longer in custody.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490842,12314245\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/233/600/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490842,12314245\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/233/600/\">\n    at 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490842,12314245\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/233/600/\">\n    168 A.3d 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In reaching that decision, the Court of Special Appeals relied principally on\n   <em>\n    McMannis v.

Petitioner points out what he sees as a fundamental factual distinction between the two cases: Obomighie was in custody when he filed his petition for post-conviction relief, and McMannis was not. As a consequence, Petitioner argues, only Obomighie, but not McMannis, satisfied the in-custody \"jurisdictional\" requirement of the post-conviction statute. In Petitioner's view, the substantively identical language in Article 27, \u00a7 645A(a) that is now CP \u00a7 7-101, when read in conjunction with other provisions of the post-conviction statute, dictates that a court's jurisdiction over a post-conviction petition is controlled by the time of filing. Petitioner directs us to the holding of the\n   <em>\n    McMannis\n   </em>\n   Court: \"McMannis was not in the custody of the State of Maryland within the meaning of [former] Art. 27, \u00a7 645A(a) when this\n   petition was filed, and consequently the Circuit Court for Allegany County was without jurisdiction to entertain the claim for relief under the Post Conviction Procedure Act.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071733\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/534/\">\n    311 Md. at 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071733\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/534/\">\n    536 A.2d 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As Petitioner sees it, the Court of Special Appeals erred in\n   <em>\n    Obomighie\n   </em>\n   by drawing upon certain dicta in\n   <em>\n    McMannis\n   </em>\n   to reason that courts would be divested of jurisdiction to entertain an otherwise properly filed post-conviction petition when, at some point after filing, the petitioner was no longer in custody. For that proposition, Petitioner points to several provisions of the UPPA. He asks us to read them together so that no language or provision is rendered nugatory or contradictory to other provisions. He reasons as follows: CP \u00a7 7-101 establishes that the UPPA \"applies to a person convicted in any court in the State who is: (1) confined under sentence of imprisonment; or (2) on parole or probation.\" CP \u00a7 7-102(a), in turn, provides that a person who satisfies the custody requirement \"may begin a proceeding under this title in the circuit court for the county in which the conviction took place\n   ... if the person claims\" a constitutional violation in the conviction or sentence; lack of jurisdiction over the sentence; an illegal sentence; or that the sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack. There may be only one petition, CP \u00a7 7-103(a), which may be filed \"at any time,\" CP \u00a7 7-102(a), so long as the petitioner satisfies the custody requirement of CP \u00a7 7-101 and, absent \"extraordinary cause,\" the petition is filed within ten years from the imposition of sentence, CP \u00a7 7-103(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Petitioner also views CP \u00a7 7-109 as important to a proper interpretation of the UPPA. That section addresses appellate review of the post-conviction court's disposition of the petition and provides in subsection (b)(3)(ii) that \"[i]f the application for leave to appeal is granted,\" \"the Court of Special Appeals may [ ] affirm, reverse, or modify the order appealed from; or [ ] remand the case for further proceedings.\" Petitioner argues that \"[n]othing in the language of \u00a7 7-109 [ ] suggests that the right to apply for leave to appeal [and, if the application is granted, the right to pursue the appeal on its merits] is limited\n   to convicted persons who are still in custody\" when they pursue such relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Petitioner contests the Court of Special Appeals' analysis of the interplay between CP \u00a7\u00a7 7-101 and 7-109 : \"The reasoning of the Court of Special Appeals,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 'that the custody requirement of CP \u00a7 7-101 takes precedence over the appeals provisions of CP \u00a7 7-109,' overlooks the presumption that the General Assembly 'intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In Petitioner's view, those sections, as well as CP \u00a7\u00a7 7-102 and 7-103, read together and in harmony with one another, reflect the legislative purpose that, upon satisfaction of any conditions or limitations set forth in each relevant section or subsection, a post-conviction petitioner is entitled to pursue litigation of the petition until final disposition, including any appellate review of an adverse decision by a lower court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Petitioner further asserts that the UPPA is consistent in purpose with the federal habeas statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The State asserts two grounds, one of which-that the appeal is moot-was not considered by the intermediate appellate court. The State argues that Petitioner's case is moot because he has been released from custody. To support this contention, the State cites cases in which this Court held that petitions for post-conviction relief are moot where the petitioner was released\n   from custody prior to the completion of appellate proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tucker v. Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1937397\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/240/738/\">\n    240 Md. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=215%20A.2d%20476\">\n    215 A.2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966) (per curiam );\n   <em>\n    Noble v.

For reasons we shall explain, we dispose of that argument in short order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The State's second ground for affirmance, to which it devotes much of its attention, adheres to the intermediate appellate court's analysis. The State contends that the Court of Special Appeals properly determined, under the plain language of the UPPA, that it was divested of jurisdiction to consider Petitioner's claim. The State asserts that, by its terms, the UPPA \"applies to a person convicted in any court in the State who is: (1) confined under sentence of imprisonment; or (2) on parole or probation.\" CP \u00a7 7-101. At the time of his appeal, Petitioner was no longer subject to any of these conditions-imprisonment, parole, or probation-to which the remedies under the UPPA apply. Consequently, on its face, the statutory language excludes Petitioner from post-conviction relief, and the intermediate appellate court correctly concluded as much.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The State further argues that its plain language reading of the UPPA is consistent with the legislative history of the statute and case law interpreting the UPPA throughout its development. The State notes that Maryland's first post-conviction statute was codified in 1958 and sought to create a single statutory procedure for collateral attacks to replace the common law writs of habeas corpus and error\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   when a petitioner was in custody,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Instead, the custody requirement has survived in substantially the same form, even through the 2001 recodification of Article 27 into the Criminal Procedure Article. Moreover, the State claims, this Court has consistently-and from the outset-dismissed applications for leave to appeal where, as here, the applicant had been released from custody.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1937397\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/240/738/\">\n    240 Md. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=215%20A.2d%20476\">\n    215 A.2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Spencer v.

It defies logic to conclude that the General Assembly intended that a circuit court or, as here, an appellate court would lose jurisdiction to entertain the merits of a properly filed post-conviction petition solely because at some point during the still-live action, the petitioner's status changed from \"in custody\" to \"not in custody.\" Indeed, such an outcome borders on the absurd.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To best understand CP \u00a7 7-101, we must read it in the context of the overall legislative scheme that is the UPPA. That is particularly so, given the 2001 recodification of former Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 645A-J to what is now the UPPA. The Revisor's Notes to each of the new sections in Subtitle 1 of the Criminal Procedure Article make clear that they were recodified without substantive change. One need only compare the predecessor and current versions of the post-conviction statute to appreciate that, in the process of recodification, among other non-substantive changes, the text of \u00a7 645A was split into\n   various subsections that are now found within Subtitle 1 of the UPPA. Though one might be tempted to read each of the various sections of Subtitle 1 in isolation, the Revisor's Notes imply the opposite: Each section should be read in conjunction with the others to extract a meaning that harmonizes the various provisions. Certainly, any reader of the lengthy paragraph that was former \u00a7 645A(a) would have been inclined to do the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   When we read CP \u00a7 7-101 not in isolation but together with other sections of Subtitle 1, we are persuaded that Petitioner has the better part of the argument. The \"custody requirement\" set forth in CP \u00a7 7-101 -\"This title applies to a person convicted in any court in the State who is: (1) confined under sentence of imprisonment; or (2) on parole or probation\"-must be read in conjunction with CP \u00a7 7-102. That section grants a petitioner, who must then be in custody, the right to \"begin a\n   proceeding under this title in the circuit court for the county in which the conviction took place at any time.\" The petitioner must comply with certain conditions that are laid out in that same section. The petitioner's claim or claims must fall within the list of those permitted by CP \u00a7 7-102(a)(1)-(4) ; and, as provided by CP \u00a7 7-102(b)(1) and (2), the petitioner must \"seek[ ] to set aside or correct the judgment or sentence,\" and the alleged error must not have \"been previously and finally litigated or waived.\" Sections 7-101 and 7-102 must be read together with CP \u00a7 7-103, which prescribes the number of petitions (one) and the time within which the petition must be filed (within ten years after the sentence was imposed). The remaining provisions of Subtitle 1 further address, for example, the terms \"finally litigated\" and \"waived,\" CP \u00a7 7-106 ; provide the right to counsel and a hearing, CP \u00a7 7-108 ; and, of relevance here, provide the right to file an application for leave to appeal from a final circuit court order, CP \u00a7 7-109.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Reading Subtitle 1 as a whole leads us to conclude that the more reasonable construction of CP \u00a7 7-101 is to require the petitioner to be \"in custody\" at the time of filing and not, as the State would have it, to require the petitioner to remain in\n   custody throughout litigation of the petition, including the appeal, if any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We disagree with the State that even in the thirty years since\n   <em>\n    McMannis\n   </em>\n   was decided, this Court has consistently restricted post-conviction relief to those petitioners who remained in custody until full completion of litigation.

Moreover, not unlike the reopening provision of the UPPA- CP \u00a7 7-104, which grants courts discretion to reopen a post-conviction proceeding if the court decides that the action is \"in the interests of justice\"-the federal habeas statute directs a court to \"dispose of the matter as law and justice require,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202243\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, as in\n   <em>\n    Carafas\n   </em>\n   , our holding is broader: Whenever a timely petition for post-conviction relief is filed, absent the petitioner's procedural default at any point in the process, Maryland courts retain jurisdiction throughout consideration of the petition, including appellate review, notwithstanding any intervening release from custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Clarifying\n   </em>\n   McMannis\n   <em>\n    and Overruling\n   </em>\n   Obomighie\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We also take this opportunity to clarify the reach of our decision in\n   <em>\n    McMannis\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    McMannis\n   </em>\n   simply established the jurisdictional requirements of filing, which are satisfied if a petitioner is in custody at the time he or she files a petition for post-conviction relief. This Court's dicta notwithstanding, that case should not be interpreted to require custody at every stage of post-conviction proceedings or to divest a reviewing court of jurisdiction if the petitioner is released from custody. Accordingly, our holding today-that courts retain jurisdiction even if the petitioner is released\n   from custody after filing-is not in conflict with and does not require overruling that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Our holding today does mandate overruling the Court of Special Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Obomighie\n   </em>\n   . Obomighie filed his petition in circuit court while on probation. Seven days later, he completed his probation, and therefore was no longer in\n   custody, but the circuit court had not yet held a hearing on the petition.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3258530\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/170/708/\">\n    170 Md.
