The State contends that the court erred by concluding that the bail condition order prohibiting Blum from possessing a \"dangerous weapon\" issued by a New Hampshire bail commissioner is not a \"similar order issued by a court ... of another state,\" pursuant to section 4011(1)(A), and therefore the State could not prosecute Blum for an alleged violation of that order. We hold that the New Hampshire order is a \"similar order,\" vacate the judgment, and remand the case to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 2] On September 14, 2015, Blum was arrested and charged in New Hampshire with criminal threatening and domestic violence. He was released later that day on bail subject to a \"domestic violence/stalking criminal order of protection including orders and conditions of bail\" (Conditions Order), signed by a New Hampshire bail commissioner. The Conditions Order notified Blum that he had the \"opportunity to be heard before a judge on bail issues within 24/48 hours\"; that the \"order shall be enforced, even without registration, by the courts of any state\"; and that violations of the Conditions Order \"are subject to state and federal criminal penalties.\" The Conditions Order required Blum to \"refrain\" from, among other things, \"possessing a firearm, destructive device, dangerous weapon, or ammunition.\" Blum signed the Conditions Order acknowledging notice of the conditions and the potential penalties associated with a violation. Unless changed by another court order, the Conditions Order, with its prohibitions, was to remain in effect until Blum's arraignment, which was set for November 16, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 3] The State alleges that on September 18, 2015-four days after his arrest and the imposition of the Conditions Order in New Hampshire-Blum went to the Kittery Trading Post in Kittery, Maine, purchased a knife, and asked the store clerk if the store had any full-face masks resembling those used by \"SWAT\" teams. Concerned by Blum's behavior, the store clerk notified the Kittery Police Department. After learning that Blum was still subject to the New Hampshire Conditions Order that prohibited him from possessing a \"dangerous weapon,\" the police stopped Blum and found him in possession of three knives, including a large tactical knife he had purchased earlier that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4] Based on these allegations, a grand jury first indicted Blum on December 7, 2015, for violating a condition of release (Class C), 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 1092(1)(B) (2017) (Count 1), and violating a protective order (Class D), 19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 4011(1) (Count 2). Blum moved to dismiss the charges and, after a nontestimonial hearing, the trial court (York County,\n   <em>\n    O'Neil, J.\n   </em>\n   ) granted Blum's motion by order dated March 14, 2016. As to Count 2, the court first stated that \"[i]n Maine a protective order is defined and set out in 19 M.R.S. \u00a7 4007,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ,\" apparently intending to reference the Protection from Abuse Act, 19-A M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4001 - 4014 (2017). It then declared\n   that \"[n]o such order was issued in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 5] The court also referenced \"RSA 173-B:1,\" and observed that \"the applicable New Hampshire statutes\" established a process for obtaining a protective order in New Hampshire\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that was \"substantially similar\" to the process for obtaining a protection from abuse order in Maine.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.H.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20173\">\n    N.H.

Again, the court stated that no such order existed in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 6] Although the court acknowledged that the \"process for obtaining a temporary [protection from abuse] order has some similarity to a bail order in New Hampshire these are two separate processes with some different requirements.\" Because the Conditions Order was issued after an arrest and not pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.H.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20173\">\n    N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -B:1 to :26, the court concluded that it was not a \"similar order issued by a court ... of another state\" for the purposes of section 4011(1)(A) and dismissed Count 2 against Blum. The court denied the State's motion for reconsideration but clarified that the dismissal was without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 7] On January 4, 2017, a second grand jury indicted Blum for his September 18, 2015, actions, charging him with the same two counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Blum again moved to dismiss, arguing that any alleged violation of the Conditions Order in Maine could not subject him to prosecution because the order failed to meet the definition of a \"similar order\" of protection \"issued by a court ... of another state\" pursuant to section 4011(1)(A). After a nontestimonial hearing, by order dated August 14, 2017, the court (\n   <em>\n    Cashman, J.\n   </em>\n   ) granted Blum's motion to dismiss, and adopted the trial court's (\n   <em>\n    O'Neil, J.\n   </em>\n   ) previous order concluding that the Conditions Order was not a \"similar order\" of protection. With the approval of the Attorney General, the State filed this timely appeal challenging only the dismissal of Count 2, violation of a protective order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2115-A(1), (5) (2017) ; M.R.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 8] This case requires us to determine whether the Conditions Order controlling Blum's behavior on September\n   18, 2015, was a \"similar order issued by a court ... of another state.\" 19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 4011(1)(A).

The Conditions Order also notified Blum of his opportunity to be heard regarding the conditions of the order, stating that \"[t]he defendant is advised that he/she has the further opportunity to be heard before a judge on bail issues within 24/48 hours of the request being made to the court.\" Blum signed the Conditions Order that contained both the warnings about the consequences of a violation and the notice of his right to challenge the order's conditions. The warnings provided by the Conditions Order are \"similar\" to the warnings contained in temporary protection orders, and the notice to Blum that the Conditions Order could be challenged is \"similar\" to the notice provided on temporary protection from abuse orders that its terms could be dissolved or modified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 4006(7).
