(temporarily assigned).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Valerie Giarusso retained petitioner-appellant Carella, Byrne, Cecchi, Olstein, Brody &amp; Agnello, PC to represent her in certain post-judgment proceedings arising out of her divorce action against defendant William G. Giarusso. Pursuant to the written retainer agreement plaintiff signed, she agreed to pay petitioner an initial $5000 retainer and subsequent monthly invoices for services rendered. Although plaintiff paid the initial retainer, she did not remit any further payments to petitioner. Petitioner claims that plaintiff owes an unpaid balance of $99,356.10 plus interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Petitioner rendered the legal services to collect the alimony arrears, child support arrears, and equitable distribution owed to plaintiff by her ex-husband. After petitioner's representation of plaintiff ended, petitioner filed a post-judgment application in the divorce proceeding to: 1) determine and enforce an attorney's charging lien against plaintiff in the amount of $99,356.10 plus interest pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:13-5 ; and 2) enter judgment against plaintiff in the amount of the fee award. Petitioner sought to impose the lien against the alimony and child support arrears owed to plaintiff and plaintiff's equitable distribution share of various marital assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff opposed the petition on several grounds including that she disputed the amount owed, claiming the services performed could not justify the amount billed given the amount of the retainer paid. She also contended she never received notice of the right to seek fee arbitration of petitioner's bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Petitioner responded it had provided the fee arbitration pre-action notice required by\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:20A-6 and copies of each of the monthly invoices to plaintiff on March 7, 2013, some eighty-five days before filing the petition. The notice and invoices were sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and simultaneously by ordinary mail. The certified mail was returned unclaimed, but the ordinary mail was not returned as undeliverable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After initially imposing an interim charging lien, the trial court conducted a plenary hearing. Relying on two unpublished appellate decisions, the trial court issued a June 18, 2015 order and written decision discharging the interim charging lien, denying entry of a final charging lien, and denying entry of judgment against plaintiff. The trial court issued a subsequent September 29, 2015 order with an attached statement of reasons awarding petitioner attorney's fees in the amount of $50,000. Petitioner appeals from each of those rulings. We affirm the denial of a charging lien, reverse the denial of the entry of a judgment in favor of petitioner, and vacate and remand the issue of determining the appropriate amount of the award of petitioner's attorney's fees to the Family Part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Petitioner contends the trial court erred in ruling that the Attorney's Lien Act, N.J.S.A. 2A:13-5, (the Act) does not apply to legal services performed entirely post-judgment. We are unpersuaded by this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Charging liens are governed by the Act, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   After the filing of a complaint or third-party complaint or the service of a pleading containing a counterclaim or cross-claim, the attorney or counsellor at law, who shall appear in the cause for the party instituting the action or maintaining the\n   third-party claim or counterclaim or cross-claim, shall have a lien for compensation, upon his client's action, cause of action, claim or counterclaim or cross-claim, which shall contain and attach to a verdict, report, decision, award, judgment or final order in his client's favor, and the proceeds thereof in whose hands they may come. The lien shall not be affected by any settlement between the parties before or after judgment or final order, nor by the entry of satisfaction or cancellation of a judgment on the record.

We then explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   As between attorney and client, their agreement ordinarily controls unless it is overreaching or is violative of basic principles of fair dealing or the services performed were not reasonable or necessary. Thus, although the court has the power and authority to review the fairness of the agreement and the reasonableness of the fee charged, it should ordinarily defer to the parties' agreement and the fee charged thereunder if it appears, as here, that they meet a prima facie test of fairness and reasonableness, the client utterly fails to come forward with anything of substance to rebut that prima facie showing, and no expert is produced to challenge the bill rendered as unreasonable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 281 (citations omitted).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff did not dispute petitioner's hourly rates, which the trial court found to be commensurate with the rate charged by experienced counsel handling complex matrimonial matters. Rather, she challenged\n   the number of hours expended by her counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The evidence presented by petitioner included the monthly invoices for the unpaid services rendered from May 2011 to November 2012. Although the invoices set forth the date, type of service, identity of the person performing the work, time expended, and resulting amount, the invoices omit any description of the subject matter or purpose of the service rendered. For example, the invoices indicate the type of communication (telephone call or email) or conference with an individual without setting forth the subject matter. Moreover, while petitioner's bills totaled some $99,356.10, defendant testified he incurred only $13,000 or $14,000 in legal fees during the same time period. Given these circumstances, plaintiff's opposition to petitioner's invoices cannot be fairly characterized as conclusory or unsupported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The trial court afforded petitioner an opportunity to make the required showing during the plenary hearing but found the evidence insufficient. The court stated it was unable to discern the extent and complexity of the post-judgment motions, the reasonableness and necessity for the time expended by petitioner, or the result obtained by the rendering of particular services. As a result, the trial court found petitioner did not meet its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The trial court also noted defendant's counsel fees during the same period were only $13,000 but could not compare the respective fees \"without ... being able to delve into what each attorney was doing and why.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Taking into account the record before it, the trial court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The [c]ourt cannot make the determination of the reasonableness and necessity of the bills for legal services in the partial vacuum within which it must address the issue. I have considered the factors set forth in RPC 1.5(a) to the extent information has been supplied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Since [her counsel] has provided me with only half of the picture-the expended time, but not the description of the work being done or the reasons why so much time had to be committed to this matter, I will determine that half of his billed fees are to be awarded. Based on the limited record provided to the [c]ourt, I find a reasonable amount for legal services he rendered to plaintiff in the period of his representation to be $50,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To be sure, the billing records set forth the time expended by petitioner. But without a description of the work or an explanation for the amount of time expended, the judge could not determine the reasonableness of the hours actually expended, a critical determination in calculating the fee to be awarded. The judge characterized the records presented as being \"only half of the picture.\" On that basis alone, the judge reduced the fees sought by one-half without providing any further findings or explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"Trial judges are under a duty to make findings of fact and to state reasons in support of their conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    Heinl v.
