Jepsen and Beth Jepsen appeal from the declaratory judgment rendered by the trial court in this dispute regarding the modification of a beach deed. In this opinion, we address the plaintiffs' claims that the court improperly (1) concluded that the modification in question was properly enacted, (2) concluded that they had not met their burden in establishing slander of title, and (3) declined to render an award of attorney's fees in their favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the\n   plaintiffs' first claim and, accordingly, affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The relevant facts are gleaned from the court's memorandum of decision and the undisputed evidence in the record before us. The parties are numerous individuals and entities that, at relevant times, owned real property in a subdivision in New London created in 1954 by the Quinnipeag Corporation (subdivision).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The subdivision\n   plan filed on the New London land records depicts the location of various residential parcels, as well as a 250 foot strip of beachfront property commonly known as Billard Beach (beach). That area is designated as \"beach rights\" on the subdivision plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Each owner of real property in the subdivision is the holder of two deeds relevant to this dispute: a warranty deed that conveyed ownership rights in fee simple to his or her individual parcel of subdivision property (warranty deed) and a quitclaim deed that conveyed an \"undivided one-forty-eighth (1/48th) interest\" in the beach (beach deed).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This litigation concerns a purported modification of the beach deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Section 2 of the beach deed sets forth certain \"restrictions on the use\" of\n   the beach,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   known also as restrictive\n   covenants. \"A restrictive covenant is a servitude, commonly referred to as a negative easement .... A servitude is a legal device that creates a right or an obligation that runs with the land or an interest in land.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Grovenburg\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rustle Meadow Associates, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490258\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/165/193/\">\n    174 Conn.

[could] run with the land\" because \"the covenants were formally created as part of a transfer of land; they explicitly provide that they are 'binding upon the [g]rantee, its successors and assigns, shall inure to the benefit of the [g]rantor, its successors and assigns, and shall run with the land'; and they appear on their face to relate to the land and not to impose any conceivable\n   burden on the initial grantee independent of its ownership of the land\");\n   <em>\n    Bauby\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krasow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1533267\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/107/109/#p112\">\n    107 Conn. 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 112,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=139%20A.%20508\">\n    139 A. 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1927) (\"[i]f [a restrictive covenant] runs with the land, it binds the owner\");\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brush\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"526511\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/27/530/#p536\">\n    27 Conn. 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 536 (1858) (\"if the grantee accepts the deed he assents to the [restrictive covenant] in it\"). It is undisputed that all owners of property in the subdivision are bound by the restrictive covenants contained in the beach deed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Section 4 of the beach deed expressly provides a mechanism for the modification of the restrictive covenants contained in \u00a7 2 of the beach deed. It states: \"That the restrictions on the use of the [beach] contained in [\u00a7] 2 hereof may be modified by a majority vote in writing of the owners of the premises conveyed. Each owner, (or in\n   the case of joint ownership or ownership in cotenancy, such joint owners or owners in cotenancy together) shall be entitled upon any such vote to such number of votes as the numerator of their fractional interest in the premises conveyed, and upon any such vote, the majority shall be determined according to the sum of the votes so counted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For more than one-half century, owners of property in the subdivision enjoyed the use of the beach without incident. That changed after Craig Barrila moved into the subdivision in 2008. As the court found, \"[i]n 2008, [Barrila] purchased 755 Pequot Avenue, one of the forty-eight residential lots in [the subdivision], and although,\n   as he testified, he did not personally use the beach, he allowed his girlfriend and her three children to swim, hold campfires and party at the beach.... Barrila testified that initially no one objected to this conduct. However, he stated that in July, 2011 ... he received a telephone call from a representative of the [Billard Beach Association (association) ]\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating that these individuals could not use the beach without his being present.... Prior to the telephone call to Barrila, testimony and evidence received at trial does not indicate any significant concern being expressed about the use of or conduct on the beach by members of the [subdivision].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"In reaction to the use of the beach allowed by Barrila and what was perceived to be a lack of clarity in the deeds and [the association's] bylaws regarding allowable use of the beach, a group of residents including Garon Camassar,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   an attorney and husband of defendant Beth M. Camassar, in the summer of 2011, began to circulate a petition for a 'Modification of Covenants and Restrictions re Billard Beach, New London, Connecticut.' This modification (2011 modification)-which all parties now agree is of no force or effect-purported to supersede all covenants and restrictions contained in the [beach deed].\" (Footnotes added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The 2011 modification purported to revise the beach deed in three significant respects. First, it sought to modify the restrictive covenants governing the use of the beach contained in \u00a7 2 of the beach deed. Second, it revised the modification provision contained in \u00a7 4\n   of the beach deed to require the approval of 75 percent of owners instead of a simple majority. Third, the 2011 modification added a new section regarding the enforcement of the beach deed, which provided for an award of compensatory damages, punitive damages, costs and attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After learning of the 2011 modification proposal, Barrila sent an e-mail to approximately fifty e-mail addresses, the subject of which was \"Proposed Changes to Billard Beach Land Deed.\" In that September 24, 2011 e-mail, Barrila indicated that he had been provided a copy of the 2011 modification\n   earlier that day. He then stated that \"there is an effort underway to collect a majority of signatures to support a modification to our current [beach] deed.... I have reviewed the proposed document today and have some substantial concerns.... I want to reiterate that these are not the beach rules (which are guidelines). These are legally binding and enforceable changes to our current [beach] deed which will impact your future ability to convey your asset.... I'm willing to support whatever the majority of my neighbors believe to be fair regarding the rules. However, I want to ensure that appropriate process is followed to effect any proposed changes....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The very next day, Ronald E. Beausoleil replied to Barrila by e-mail and offered to meet privately with him and Garon Camassar. Beausoleil at that time was a member of the executive committee of the association\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and had collected signatures on the 2011 modification with Garon Camassar. Barrila responded to that e-mail hours later, stating that \"[w]ith all due respect the time for private meetings has passed. I'm advocating [for] a public meeting with all interested/impacted parties involved.\" Later that night, Barrila's attorney contacted Garon Camassar, who had drafted the 2011 modification and had solicited signatures thereon. In an e-mail sent on the evening of September 25, 2011, Attorney Michael W. Sheehan reiterated Barrilla's concerns and asked \"that nothing be implemented or recorded on the land records until all owners have been notified and been given the opportunity to meet and be heard.\" Despite that request, no meeting or vote of the owners transpired. Instead, the 2011 modification was filed on the New London land records the next morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 27, 2011, defendant Hope H. Firestone, a signatory to the 2011 modification acting in her capacity as president of the association, sent a letter to owners of property within the subdivision on association letterhead. That letter began by stating, \"Good News!! As of Monday morning September 26, 2011, the restrictive provisions of the original beach deed have been modified.\" Firestone then provided an overview of the principal changes contained in the 2011 modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court found that \"contrary to the requirements of the beach deed, no formal 'vote' was ever noticed or taken on the [2011] modification; rather, the circulators assumed that once they had obtained the signatures of a majority of lot owners, the deed was recordable.... [A] 'vote' requires more formality than just obtaining signatures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Black's Law Dictionary 10th Ed. (2009), defines a vote as '[t]he expression of one's preferences or opinion in a meeting or election by ballot, show of hands, or other type of communication.' Accordingly, the [2011] modification appears to have been a legal nullity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   No party has challenged the propriety of that determination in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the 2011 modification was filed on the New London land records, Anders B. Jepsen and Barrila commenced this declaratory\n   action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Their original complaint sought to have the 2011 modification declared null and void. They alleged, inter alia, that the 2011 modification \"was enacted without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiffs\"; that it \"was enacted without a full and fair opportunity to have a meaningful discussion between the owners [in the subdivision] and to voice opinion as to the merits of the [m]odification\"; and that \"the contents and meaning of the [m]odification was misrepresented to one or more of the signers ... and to others who were not given an opportunity to review the [m]odification prior to its enactment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As the court found in its memorandum of decision, \"[i]n response to the suit, the parties engaged in prolonged discussions, including mediation, seeking to resolve the issues raised in the legal action, while still trying to respond to the concerns of the [a]ssociation members regarding uncontrolled use of the beach.... In the course of these negotiations, the proponents of the modification, working with the Executive Committee of the Association, developed and proposed the 'Amended and Restated Covenants and Restrictions Regarding Billard Beach, New London, Connecticut' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (2014 modification).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 2014 modification contained an extensive revision of the restrictive covenants governing the use of the beach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   It removed the 75\n   percent super majority requirement imposed in the 2011\n   modification proposal, stating in relevant part that the restrictive covenants in the beach deed \"may be modified by a written vote of a majority of the [r]esidential [l]ot [o]wners ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 2014 modification also eliminated the enforcement provisions set forth in \u00a7 7 of the 2011 modification. See footnote 8 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On October 3, 2014, defendant Anne Marie Lizarralde, who at that time served as the secretary of the association, sent an e-mail to forty-one of the forty-eight owners within the subdivision notifying them that the association's annual meeting would be held on October 10, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that correspondence, Lizarralde stated: \"Billard Beach Members-The annual [association] meeting has been scheduled for Friday, October 10th at 7\n   p.m. in the New London Senior Center (120 Broad Street). Please find attached four documents to read carefully. If you are unable to open any of them, please let us know and we'd be happy to put a hard copy in the mail to you.\n   <em>\n    If you are unable to attend, please fill out the proxy and get it back to us as soon as possible so that you are represented\n   </em>\n   . You can either e-mail back the proxy to [Lizarralde] or drop it off at any of the board members' homes....\" (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Appended to that e-mail were four documents. The first was a copy of the 2014 modification. The second document was titled \"BILLARD BEACH ASSOCIATION BALLOT OR PROXY\" and purportedly permitted owners within the subdivision to vote by proxy on the 2014 modification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The third document, titled \"BILLARD BEACH ASSOCIATION NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING,\" was an agenda that set forth five items for business, including the \"vote upon\" the 2014 modification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The fourth and final document was a letter addressed to \"Billard Beach property owner\" from the \"Billard Beach Association Board,\" which provided an overview of the revisions contained in the 2014 modification. That letter indicated that \"[t]his version of the [c]ovenants was conceived and drawn as a final document, not subject to revision ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Two days later, on October 5, 2014, Beth Jepsen replied to Lizarralde and all parties copied on Lizarralde's October 3, 2014 e-mail. In that communication, Jepsen stated in relevant part that the plaintiffs \"object to both your improper Annual Meeting notice and to the [2014 modification] contained within it.\" After noting that \"[i]t would take far too long to cover each issue with [respect to] both the 'notice' provided or the new [2014 modification] in a single e-mail,\" Jepsen stated that \"there are too many issues and much of the legal language may be overly complicated for a ... late night association meeting with other topics on the agenda.\" She thus requested \"open discussion with the owners ... over a reasonable amount of time with proper notice ... in a much more respectful manner going forward.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The executive committee of the association held a meeting on the eve of the annual meeting on October 9, 2014. The minutes of that meeting, which were admitted into evidence, indicate that the committee had a \"discussion about the annual meeting that will take place tomorrow,\" at which a vote would be held on the 2014 modification. With respect to that vote, the minutes state that \"[o]nly property owners should be allowed to speak\" and \"[t]he plan will be to leave the vote open after the meeting for several weeks so that it will give those who are unable to attend the time to vote.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The association's annual meeting was called to order at 7:04 p.m. on October 10, 2014. The record indicates that the owners of fewer than half of the forty-eight properties in the subdivision attended that meeting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputed that, prior to the commencement of that meeting, several of the \"ballot or proxy\" forms contained in Lizarralde's October 3, 2014 notice were\n   submitted to the association either electronically or in person that night. The first item of association business discussed during the meeting, which had been designated as item \"b\" on the association's agenda; see footnote 17 of this opinion; was the 2014 modification. As the court noted in its decision, defendant Robert McLaughlin, Jr., who was the president of the association at that time, began the discussion by stating that the executive committee had agreed to hold open the time for collection of the proxy votes until November 1, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court found, and the testimony at trial reflects, that \"[t]he meeting became quite contentious.\" In particular, the court found that, when Beth Jepsen was speaking, some attendees interrupted her and attempted to cut her off. The official minutes of the association meeting, which were admitted into evidence at trial, likewise state that \"[s]everal people made rude comments that, in part, caused [the plaintiffs] to leave.\" Those minutes state that McLaughlin then \"attempted to regroup\" and \"again mentioned that the vote [on the 2014 modification] would remain open until November 1st.\" At that time, defendant Eric Parnes made a motion \"to move on with the rest of the annual meeting agenda,\" which was approved. Other association business then was conducted. Lizarralde and\n   McLaughlin both testified at trial that, at the conclusion of the October 10, 2014 meeting, a majority of owners of the forty-eight properties in the subdivision had not cast votes in favor of the 2014 modification, as required by \u00a7 4 of the beach deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The record likewise indicates, and the parties do not dispute, that owners of a majority of the forty-eight properties had not voted in favor of the 2014 modification by the November 1, 2014 deadline announced at the association's October 10, 2014 annual meeting. As the court found, \"[t]wenty-two votes in favor of the [2014] modification-not a majority of all lot owners-were officially received by November 1 ....\" The record nonetheless indicates that Lizarralde, on November 6, 2014, sent an e-mail to owners of fewer than thirty properties in the subdivision that stated in relevant part: \"Many thanks to everyone who voted yes to amend the [beach deed]. We received a majority of yes votes and so ... we now need to have each of you sign the official document that will be notarized....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her testimony at trial, Lizarralde admitted that, at the time that she sent that e-mail, owners of a majority of the forty-eight properties had not submitted written votes in favor of the 2014 modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Prior to trial, the plaintiffs served a request for production on the defendants, in which they sought, inter alia, \"[c]opies of all proxies submitted in conjunction with the 2014 Deed Modification.\" The defendants complied with that request, and produced copies of twenty-six proxy votes, which were admitted into evidence at trial. A total of twenty-four proxies contain votes in\n   favor of the 2014 modification, less than a majority of the forty-eight properties in the subdivision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On December 23, 2014, the 2014 modification was filed on the New London land\n   records. That instrument contained the signatures of owners of twenty-nine properties within the subdivision,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   including several who did not attend the October 10, 2014 annual meeting and did not at any time submit a proxy vote.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs thereafter amended their complaint to challenge the validity of that enactment. Specifically, they sought a declaratory judgment that the 2014 modification \"be declared null and void\" for multiple reasons, including that it \"was enacted without providing proper notice to the owners of the land lots ... without conducting a properly noticed meeting of the owners, without allowing for ample prior discussion or comment by the owners ... and without conducting a written vote of the owners....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A trial was held over the course of four days in December, 2015. The plaintiffs called nineteen witnesses and submitted sixty documents that were admitted into evidence. The defendants submitted three\n   exhibits, which were duplicative of documents already in evidence, but otherwise presented no documentary or testimonial evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the conclusion of trial, the parties, at the behest of the court, submitted posttrial briefs that outlined their respective positions on the issues presented at trial. In their brief, the plaintiffs argued, among other things, that \"the 2014 modification [is] invalid because it was not properly noticed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   did not receive the requisite number of votes and was not executed pursuant to proper procedure.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Footnote added.) In response, the defendants argued in their posttrial brief that \"[t]he Beach Deed does not require notice, a meeting, or discussion or comment of any kind in order to modify its terms.\" The defendants further claimed that the act of signing the 2014 modification qualified as the written vote of the owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court ruled in favor of the defendants on the slander of title counts of the operative complaint, finding that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated the existence of either a false statement, malice on the part of the defendants, or pecuniary loss to the plaintiffs. With respect to the plaintiffs' challenge to the 2011 modification, the court\n   noted that the defendants at trial had conceded that it was \"of no force or effect ....\" The court then explained that \"contrary to the requirements of the beach deed, no formal 'vote' was ever noticed or taken\n   on the [2011] modification; rather, the circulators assumed that once they had obtained the signatures of a majority of lot owners, the deed was recordable.\" The court flatly rejected that proposition, stating that \"a 'vote' requires more formality than just obtaining signatures.\" The court thus rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the first count of their complaint, declaring that \"[t]he 2011 modification by agreement of the parties is deemed null and void.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   With respect to the 2014 modification, the court disagreed with the plaintiffs' claim that the beach deed could not be \"altered without unanimous approval of all owners of the subdivided lots.\" The court also rejected the plaintiffs' claims that both the notice of the vote on the 2014 modification and the vote itself were improper. The court noted that, unlike the enactment of the 2011 modification, \"a formal 'vote' was noticed and conducted prior to recording\" the 2014 modification. The court emphasized, consistent with the stipulation of the parties; see footnote 3 of this opinion; that the association was a voluntary association that had no authority over owners within the subdivision, and further found that \"the portion of the [October 10, 2014 association] meeting dedicated to the beach use was not considered by any party to be an official meeting of the association.\" Nevertheless, with respect to the \"general standards of due process\" that it deemed applicable to the modification process, the court stated that the association was \"not held to the same 'due process' standards as a governmental authority\" and concluded that no impropriety transpired with respect thereto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although a majority of owners had not voted in favor of the 2014 modification by the November 1, 2014 deadline, the court found that \"seven more votes in favor, either in the form of proxies or signed documents, were\n   received and accepted in the weeks thereafter, representing twenty-nine of the forty-eight properties-a majority.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also found that the plaintiffs waived their right to object to any deficiency in the notice provided by Lizarralde's October 3, 2014 e-mail notice \"as a result of their awareness [of] and participation\" in the meeting. Accordingly, the court rendered judgment in favor of the defendants on the fourth count of the operative complaint, stating that \"[t]he 2014 modification is declared valid and in full force and effect.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The principal contention advanced by the plaintiffs is that the 2014 modification was improperly enacted. Specifically, they claim that the court improperly determined that (A) modification of the beach deed did not require the unanimous approval of all owners within the subdivision and (B) the 2014 modification was enacted in accordance with the strictures set forth in the beach deed.

In\n   <em>\n    Mannweiler\n   </em>\n   , this court held that \"when, as here, the owner of a tract of land sells lots with restrictive covenants ... and does not retain the right to rescind or amend them and\n   <em>\n    does not provide a method for terminating or amending them\n   </em>\n   , [the owner] has no right to do so without the consent of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the then property (lot) owners.\" (Emphasis added.)

Accordingly, when no provision for the modification of a restrictive covenant is contained in the operative instrument filed on the land records,\n   <em>\n    Mannweiler\n   </em>\n   instructs that such modification may only be accomplished through the unanimous approval of all property owners. That precept comports with the position adopted by the Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes, which recognizes that \"[a] servitude may be modified ... by agreement of the parties [or] pursuant to its terms ....\" 2 Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 7.1, p. 337. As a general matter, the Restatement notes that \"[w]here\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the parties interested in a servitude agree, they are free to modify\" the servitude. (Emphasis added.) Id., comment\n   (b), p. 339. The Restatement further indicates that \"[t]he terms of a servitude may include a provision that permits modification ... without the consent of all the parties.... [A] modification ... pursuant to such a provision is generally effective.\" Id., comment (c), p. 340. Absent such an express provision, \"[a] modification agreed to by some but not all of the parties is not effective ....\" Id. ; accord 9 Powell on Real Property (M. Wolf ed., 2000) \u00a7 60.08, pp. 112-13 (noting that \"absent express provisions to the contrary, amendments may only be effected by all of the owners of property burdened by the covenants\" and observing that \"[c]ovenants can also be modified ... where the covenants permit modification ... by a specified percentage of lot owners\").\n   It is undisputed that the beach deed in the present case contains a modification provision, which requires the written approval of the owners of a majority of the forty-eight properties in the subdivision to modify \"the restrictions on the use of the [beach]\" set forth in \u00a7 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because a method for amending the restrictive covenants contained in \u00a7 2 is expressly provided for in the beach deed, those covenants properly could be modified by the owners of a majority of the properties in the subdivision.

The commentary to \u00a7 4.1 specifically addresses the interpretation of expressly created servitudes, such as those contained in the beach deed. With respect to such expressly created servitudes, the Restatement notes that \"[t]he fact that servitudes are intended to bind successors to interests in the land, as well as the contracting parties, and are generally intended to last for an indefinite period of time, lends increased importance to the writing because it is often the primary source of information available to a prospective purchaser of the land. The language [in a deed] should be interpreted to accord with the meaning an ordinary purchaser would ascribe to it in the context of the parcels of land involved.

Section 4 of the beach deed provides: \"That the restrictions on the use of the [beach] contained in [\u00a7] 2 hereof\n   may be modified by a majority vote in writing of the owners of the premises conveyed. Each owner, (or in the case of joint ownership or ownership in co-tenancy, such joint owners or owners in co-tenancy together) shall be entitled upon any such vote to such number of votes as the numerator of their fractional interest in the premises conveyed, and upon any such vote, the majority shall be determined according to the sum of the votes so counted.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first sentence of that section sets forth three requirements for the modification of the restrictions on the use of the beach: (1) there must be \"a majority vote\"; (2) that vote must be expressed \"in writing\"; and (3) that vote must be among \"the owners\" of the properties in the subdivision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The second sentence in \u00a7 4 of the beach deed clarifies the nature of \"any such vote\" conducted pursuant thereto. That sentence memorializes the fact that, when a vote on a proposed modification transpires, the property owners in the subdivision are \"entitled upon any such vote\" to cast votes in proportion to their fractional interest in the beach. That sentence then concludes by instructing that \"upon any such vote, the majority shall be determined according to the sum of the votes so counted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the trial court concluded that the vote contemplated by \u00a7 4 of the beach deed \"requires more formality than just obtaining signatures.\" We agree. The plain language of \u00a7 4 not only requires a \"majority vote in writing,\" but twice qualifies that imperative with modifiers that are implicated \"upon any such vote.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plain language of \u00a7 4 also\n   mandates that the issue of whether a \"majority\" has been secured in favor of any proposed modification is to be determined in accordance with \"the\n   <em>\n    votes\n   </em>\n   so counted.\" (Emphasis added.) In this regard, we are mindful that every word and phrase of a deed is presumed to have meaning, and must be construed in a manner that does not render it superfluous.\n   <em>\n    Bird Peak Road Assn., Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Bird Peak Corp\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"130480\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/62/551/#p557\">\n    62 Conn.

The use of the plural \"votes\" in the concluding sentence of \u00a7 4 to determine whether a \"majority\" has been secured is strong evidence of an intent to establish a two-step modification process. Under the first step of that modification process, which involves a vote \"in writing of the owners of the premises conveyed,\" all owners of a fractional interest in the beach possess the right to participate in any such vote. Pursuant to the plain language of the concluding sentence clause of \u00a7 4, \"upon any such vote,\" the \"votes\" of those owners then are \"counted,\" from which it \"shall be determined\" whether owners of a \"majority\" of the properties in the subdivision favor the proposed modification.\n   That construction is one which we believe an ordinary purchaser of property in the subdivision would ascribe to it in the context of the parcels of land involved. See\n   <em>\n    Dent\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lovejoy\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3945040\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/85/455/#p463\">\n    85 Conn.

In this respect, we note the particular situation of the parties and the circumstances surrounding the enactment of the beach deed. The record reflects that the beach was an integral part of the subdivision when it was created in 1954. Each property is allocated an \"undivided one-forty-eighth (1/48th) interest\" in the beach, as memorialized in the beach deed. The subdivision plan filed on the New London land records describes the beach area as one subject to \"beach rights.\" Moreover, the restrictive covenants contained\n   in the beach deed are uniform covenants enacted by a grantor that divided its property into building lots under a general development scheme. Under Connecticut law, purchasers of those lots are presumed to have \"paid a premium for the property in reliance upon the uniform development plan being carried out.\"\n   <em>\n    Mannweiler\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    LaFlamme\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"286138\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/46/525/\">\n    46 Conn.

As the Restatement recognizes, \"the consideration paid for the servitude\" is a proper consideration in the construction of expressly created servitudes. 1 Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 4.1, comment (d), p. 499. The servitudes at issue in this case secured the right of property owners to \"use and have access to\" the beach. To paraphrase our Supreme Court, those servitudes constitute a \"property right which the parties to the original conveyance voluntarily created, which was and is of substantial benefit to the [property owners], and for which [they] paid.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pease\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1618929\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/135/535/#p541\">\n    135 Conn. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 541,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20A.2d%20590\">\n    66 A.2d 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1949).\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both the magnitude of\n   that right and the context in which it arose inform our construction of \u00a7 4 of the beach deed, and further explain why that modification provision memorializes the right of all owners of a fractional interest in the beach to cast a vote on any proposed modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In that vein, we emphasize that the present dispute does not involve a trivial dispute between neighbors. This case concerns the modification, and possible restriction, of an owner's right to use the beach. The law presumes that owners purchased their properties in this beachfront subdivision in reliance on the use rights memorialized in \u00a7 2 of the beach deed.\n   <em>\n    Mannweiler\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    LaFlamme\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"286138\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/46/525/\">\n    46 Conn.

Although that deed includes a mechanism for the modification of those use rights, we are convinced that purchasers in the subdivision would read those provisions, which mandate both a \"vote in writing of the owners of the premises conveyed\" and a determination of \"the majority\" view on any proposed modification based on \"the sum of the votes so counted,\" as requiring a formal vote, at which each owner of a fractional interest in the beach has the opportunity to cast a vote.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the\n   trial court rightly concluded in its construction of the beach deed, the mere act of collecting signatures on a written document does not suffice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The particular language employed in \u00a7 4 of the beach deed distinguishes this case from others in which the deed specifically provided that modification may be accomplished by the mere filing of a written instrument on the land records.

Interested members of the public may attend a zoning hearing, and participate in the public comment portion thereof, but they are not entitled to cast votes on the proposed zoning action. By contrast, the beach deed's modification provision expressly vests in owners of a fractional interest in the beach the right to vote on proposed modifications to the restrictions on its use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Schwartz\n   </em>\n   also is inapposite on a factual level, as the plaintiffs here did not appear at the October 10, 2014\n   meeting without objection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Beth Jepsen stated in her October 5, 2014 response to Lizarralde's notice of the vote on the 2014 modification, the plaintiffs \"object to both your improper Annual Meeting notice and to the [2014 modification] contained within it.\" Beth Jepsen reiterated those objections during her comments at the October 10, 2014 meeting.\n   <em>\n    Schwartz\n   </em>\n   , therefore, is both contextually and factually inapplicable to the present case. Far from intentionally relinquishing their objections to the October 10, 2014 proceeding, the record demonstrates that the plaintiffs endeavored to preserve those objections both prior to and during that proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The court, therefore, improperly concluded that the plaintiffs waived their objection to the adequacy of Lizarralde's October 3, 2014 notice. In light of the undisputed fact that notice of the vote on the 2014 modification was not provided to all property owners in the subdivision, we agree with the plaintiffs that the enactment of the 2014 modification did not comport with \u00a7 4 of the beach deed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We already have determined that the court properly concluded that the mere act of securing signatures on a modification instrument does not constitute the \"vote in writing\" contemplated by \u00a7 4 of the beach deed. In its decision, the court also determined that, unlike the 2011 modification, the 2014 modification was the product of a formal vote. Section 4 of the beach deed requires\n   a \"vote in writing of the owners\" on any proposed modification to the restrictive covenants governing the use of the beach. Section 4 further mandates that the determination of whether a majority has been secured \"shall be determined according to the sum of the\n   votes so counted.\" The question, then, is whether the record contains evidence to substantiate the court's finding that owners of a majority of the properties cast votes in writing that were in favor of the 2014 modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court found that a formal vote on the 2014 modification was scheduled for, and conducted at, the association's October 10, 2014 annual meeting. As the court found, Lizarralde provided notice of that vote to owners of forty-one properties. That notice, which was admitted into evidence at trial, included (1) a copy of the 2014 modification; (2) the October 10, 2014 meeting agenda, on which \"[t]o vote upon the [2014 modification]\" was the second item of business; and (3) a form titled \"BILLARD BEACH ASSOCIATION BALLOT OR PROXY\" on which owners could cast their written vote on the 2014 modification. See footnotes 16 and 17 of this opinion. The testimonial and documentary evidence in the record, including the minutes of the October 10, 2014 meeting\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Lizarralde's November 6, 2014 e-mail,\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   substantiates the court's finding that a formal vote on the 2014 modification transpired. The record indicates that several owners submitted written proxy votes at the October 10, 2014 meeting, while others submitted theirs in the ensuing weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   It is undisputed that a total of twenty-six proxy votes\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   were submitted by owners of properties in the subdivision, twenty-four of which were in favor of the 2014 modification-less than a majority of the forty-eight properties in the subdivision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record contains no other written votes on the 2014 modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   When a vote is held on a proposed modification of the restrictive covenants governing the use of the beach, \u00a7 4 of the beach deed plainly provides that the issue of whether a \"majority\" has been secured in favor of any such proposal \"shall be determined according to the sum of the votes so counted.\" The court found, and the record indicates, that a formal vote on the 2014 modification was held at the October 10, 2014 annual meeting, and that written votes were received at that time and in the weeks thereafter. Most significantly, the record before us indicates that only twenty-four written votes ultimately were submitted in support of the 2014 modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The court, therefore, improperly determined that the formal vote on the 2014 modification was approved by owners of a majority of properties in the subdivision. Accordingly, its declaration that the 2014 modification is \"valid and in full force and effect\" cannot stand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The plaintiffs also claim that the court improperly concluded that the plaintiffs had not met their burden in establishing slander of title. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \"A cause of action for slander of title consists of the uttering or publication of a false statement derogatory to the plaintiff's title, with malice, causing special damages as a result of diminished value of the plaintiff's property in the eyes of third parties. The publication must be false, and the plaintiff must have an estate or interest in the property slandered. Pecuniary damages must be shown in order to prevail on such a claim.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Elm Street Builders, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Enterprise Park Condominium Assn., Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"124082\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/63/657/#p669\">\n    63 Conn.

First, they have not demonstrated that the defendants, in filing the modifications on the land records, published a false statement. There is no suggestion that the substance of those written instruments was anything other than an accurate statement of their content-namely, that the signatories thereto wished to amend the beach deed in various respects. As the defendants concede in their appellate brief, those modifications may have been improper under the terms of the beach deed, as we have concluded in part I of this opinion, but they do not contain any demonstrably false statements about the plaintiffs' title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Second, the court's finding that the defendants did not act with the requisite malice is supported by the evidence in the record before us. The court found that the modifications were enacted in response to a concern \"about having the beach open to numerous unknown individuals and thus exposing the owners to possible tort claims in the event of accidents and injuries\" and that \"all disputed actions [by the defendants] were taken in good faith ... with the intention of clarifying appropriate uses of the beach and protecting [owners] from potential liabilities ....\" Testimony at trial by various signatories to the 2011 and 2014 modifications substantiates those findings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the court heard testimony indicating that the 2011 and 2014 modifications were enacted without any malice toward the plaintiffs. At trial, McLaughlin testified that those modifications were crafted to \"protect ourselves\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   and emphasized that \"[i]t was no malice toward anyone, it was just that we were concerned\" about liability for activities on the beach. Like others, Firestone in her testimony confirmed that the events that led to the enactment of those modifications had \"absolutely nothing to do\" with the plaintiffs. \"[I]t is well established that the evaluation of a witness' testimony and credibility are wholly within the province of the trier of fact.... Credibility must be assessed ... not by reading the cold printed record, but by observing firsthand the witness' conduct, demeanor and attitude.... An appellate court must defer to the trier of fact's assessment of credibility because [i]t is the [fact finder] ... [who has] an opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and the parties; thus [the fact finder] is best\n   able to judge the credibility of the witnesses and to draw necessary inferences therefrom.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    CHFA-Small Properties, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Elazazy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=157%20Conn.%20App.%201\">\n    157 Conn.

The court, as trier of fact, was free to credit that testimony, which supports its conclusion that the plaintiffs had not established malice on the part of the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Third, the record is bereft of evidence that the plaintiffs suffered pecuniary loss as a result of the filing of the 2011 and 2014 modifications on the land records. At trial, Beth Jepsen testified that she believed that the filing of those modifications created a cloud on their title that made their property less marketable. It nevertheless remains that \"a clouded title, alone, does not constitute damages per se.

Relevant to this appeal are two such requests. First, the plaintiffs asked the court to articulate whether \"the proxy/ballots collected constituted a majority written vote, which was later memorialized by signature on the 2014 Modification, and if so, what was the proper process that the court found to be undertaken in that vote.\" Second, the plaintiffs asked the court to articulate \"the basis for court's finding that 'seven more votes in favor ... were received and accepted in the weeks thereafter' and further articulate how many proxies/ballots were accepted in that time period as opposed to how many 'signed documents' were accepted.\" The court heard argument on that motion on October 28, 2016, and thereafter issued a two-page articulation of its decision that did not address either of those two requests. The plaintiffs filed a motion for review of that articulation with this court, in which it argued that the trial court had \"failed to articulate the factual and legal basis of its determinations that appropriate 'due process,' 'notice' and a 'vote' had occurred.\" This court granted that motion but denied the relief requested.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"28\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    Section 4 is one of five enumerated covenants in the beach deed.

The requirement of a formal vote at which all property owners are afforded an opportunity to vote on any proposed modification to their beach use rights, rather than an effort to simply secure a majority of signatures on a document, strikes us as far more conducive to neighborhood preservation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"39\">\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    As our Supreme Court has observed, \"[a]ctions may be held to speak louder than words ....\"\n    <em>\n     Malone\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Santora\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1618891\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/135/286/#p292\">\n     135 Conn. 286\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 292,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20A.2d%2051\">\n     64 A.2d 51\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1949). The construction advanced by the defendants is belied by the fact that the proponents of the 2014 modification deemed it necessary to both conduct a formal vote at the October 10, 2014 association meeting, and to materially alter the modification provisions of the beach deed. In part I A of this opinion, we concluded that those revisions to the modification provisions of the beach deed are invalid, as they were not enacted by unanimous consent of the owners of the forty-eight properties in the subdivision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    Significantly, the 2014 modification amended the modification provisions of \u00a7 4 of the beach deed in several crucial respects. First, \u00a7 7 of the 2014 modification replaced \"modified by a majority vote in writing of the owners\" with \"modified by a written vote of a majority of the Residential Lot Owners, in form suitable for recording in the New London Land Records.\" See footnote 14 of this opinion. Second, the 2014 modification eliminated altogether the requirement of \u00a7 4 that \"upon any such vote, the majority shall be determined according to the sum of the votes so counted.\" In contrast to \u00a7 4 of the beach deed, all that is required to modify the restrictions on the use of the beach under the 2014 modification is the filing on the land records of an instrument signed by the owners of a majority of the properties in the subdivision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    In addition, \u00a7 12 of the 2014 modification inserted new language regarding the manner in which such an instrument to modify the beach deed may be executed. That new section states that \"[t]his Amendment and Restatement may be signed by the respective Owners in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.\" \"In counterparts,\" known also as \"execution in counterparts,\" is a term of art that refers to the practice of compiling various documents and/or signatures to a contract and treating the combination thereof as a single agreement.

In the present case, the proponents of the 2014 modification utilized the very practice memorialized in \u00a7 12 of the 2014 modification in enacting the 2014 modification, as the signatures on that instrument appear on various documents bearing divers dates between November 9, 2014 and December 17, 2014.

See\n    <em>\n     NPC Offices, LLC\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Kowaleski\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20519\">\n     320 Conn. 519\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 534,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20A.3d%201144\">\n     131 A.3d 1144\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2016). In light of the trial court's declaration that the 2011 modification is null and void, and our conclusion that the 2014 modification likewise is invalid, further consideration of the plaintiffs' quiet title request is unnecessary. As a result of our decision today, title to the beach remains as it was prior to the enactment of the 2011 and 2014 modifications.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"50\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    For example, McLaughlin testified that the modifications were enacted to protect owners in the subdivision for liability and insurance purposes. Beausoleil testified that, despite his efforts, the association was unable to obtain insurance on the beach. Firestone similarly testified that the proponents of the modifications were \"afraid of insurance situations.... We were worried as homeowners\" about activity on the beach.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"51\">\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    At trial, Beth Jepsen was asked whether, \"[o]utside of the modification, has anyone in [the subdivision], an owner, a member of the board, a member of the association in any way interfered with your use of the beach?\" She answered, \"No. They didn't enforce their document.\" Beth Jepsen further testified that, since those modifications were enacted, no one had asked a guest of theirs to leave the beach.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"52\">\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    As two examples of the special defenses at issue, we note that the April 30, 2012 answer and special defenses filed by defendants Christine Synodi and Savas Synodi alleges in relevant part: \"Upon information and belief, the [p]laintiffs had notice of the [m]odification ... and refused any opportunity to review the same; therefore, [p]laintiffs must therefore be equitably estopped from claiming [that] 'The [m]odification was enacted without the knowledge and consent of the [p]laintiffs ....' \" The September 22, 2015 answer and special defenses filed by four dozen defendants similarly alleges that the plaintiffs \"had notice of the proposed modifications to the covenants and restrictions, but declined to participate in meaningful discussions regarding same. If they had any right to notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding said modifications, they have waived any such right that may exist.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"53\">\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 52-245 provides: \"In any case in which an affidavit has been filed by the defendant, or a statement that he has a bona fide defense has been made to the court by his attorney, and the plaintiff recovers judgment, if the court is of the opinion that such affidavit was filed or statement made without just cause or for the purpose of delay, it may allow to the plaintiff, at its discretion, double costs, together with a reasonable counsel fee to be taxed by the court.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"54\">\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    Practice Book \u00a7 13-25 provides: \"If a party fails to admit the genuineness of any document or the truth of any matter as requested herein, and if the party requesting the admissions thereafter proves the genuineness of the document or the truth of the matter, such party may apply to the court for an order requiring the other party to pay the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof, including reasonable attorney's fees. The judicial authority shall make the order unless it finds that such failure to admit was reasonable.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
