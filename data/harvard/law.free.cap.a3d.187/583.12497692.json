Facts relating to Avis's alleged damages are as found by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 3] On November 20, 2012, Burrill, a Maine resident, rented a 2012 Ford Mustang from an Avis location in Las Vegas, Nevada. Burrill executed a Rental Agreement and Addendum and declined the loss damage waiver protection that was offered to him. By declining the loss damage waiver, Burrill agreed to be responsible for \"all loss of or damage to the car regardless of cause, or who, or what caused it.\" That same day, the vehicle was damaged when it was involved in an accident in Las Vegas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 4] According to Avis, the accident caused damages to the vehicle totaling $15,342.57. Avis sent demands for payment to Burrill on January 16, 2013, April 3, 2013, and August 14, 2014, but Burrill failed or refused to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Avis filed a complaint against Burrill in the District Court on July 20, 2015, alleging breach of contract and negligence and seeking damages. On March 31, 2016, after discovery was concluded, Avis moved for partial summary judgment to establish liability on the claim for breach of contract. The court (\n   <em>\n    Fowle, J.\n   </em>\n   ) held oral argument on the motion on September 29, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 6] In its order granting Avis's motion for partial summary judgment, the court noted the parties' agreement that the case is controlled by Nevada substantive law and Maine procedural law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court then determined that there were no genuine issues of material fact that (1) the parties entered into a valid and enforceable rental contract; (2) Burrill breached that contract; and (3) \"although the parties do dispute the extent of the damages sustained during the course of the accident ... damages did indeed occur.\" As a result, the court concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact as to the elements of the claim for breach of contract and that Avis was entitled to partial summary judgment on the issue of liability as a matter of law. The court granted the motion on October 5, 2016, and ordered a hearing on damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 7] In dispute at the damages hearing on May 18, 2017, was whether the affidavit of damages executed by an Avis claims examiner included inadmissible hearsay. Several documents were attached to the affidavit: the rental agreement; a vehicle valuation report prepared for Avis by J.D. Power and Associates; a bill for towing the damaged vehicle; and a record of the vehicle's salvage value. Burrill objected to the admission of the affidavit on the ground that, other than the rental agreement, the attachments were not \"business records\" pursuant to the hearsay exception in M.R. Evid. 803(6). At the hearing, the court (\n   <em>\n    E. Walker, J.\n   </em>\n   ) accepted the affidavit with its\n   attachments\n   <em>\n    de bene\n   </em>\n   and did not then rule on its admissibility. Avis then called a witness to testify about the amount of damages, but Burrill objected because the identity of the testifying witness had not been disclosed prior to the hearing. Because the witness Avis had previously identified to Burrill was unable to attend, Avis brought a different witness to the hearing. The court declined to accept the testimony of the witness present. Before the hearing concluded, Avis offered a repair estimate as evidence of damages if the court determined that the attachments to the affidavit-specifically the vehicle valuation report-were inadmissible. Again, Burrill objected on the basis of hearsay, and again the court took the submission\n   <em>\n    de bene\n   </em>\n   , reserving its ruling on its admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 8] In its order on damages, the court determined that the attachments to the affidavit, although containing hearsay, satisfied the business records exception. The court devoted most of its discussion to the vehicle valuation report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The report was not prepared by the affiant, but instead by a third party, J.D. Power and Associates. The valuation report purported to provide the market value of the vehicle prior to the loss by taking into account the value of comparable vehicles with similar mileage located in a similar geographic area, as well as any damage to the vehicle prior to the loss. The affiant certified that the report was kept in the regular course of Avis's business, that the affiant maintained the report as part of her duties as a claims examiner for Avis, and that it was made reasonably soon after the incident. The court determined that there was sufficient foundation for the admissibility of the affidavit and all of the attachments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 9] Based on the information in the affidavit, the court concluded that the damages and fees claimed by Avis were reasonable and granted Avis its requested amount of $15,342.57. It also granted Avis attorney fees totaling $5,985.00 and costs in the amount of $433.24. The court declined to award Avis pre- or post-judgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 10] Burrill appealed, challenging both the grant of Avis's motion for partial summary judgment and the award of damages. Avis cross-appealed, challenging the court's failure to award it interest and costs in the amount it requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A. Breach of Contract\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b6 11] Burrill first challenges the court's grant of partial summary judgment on the issue of breach of contract. \"We review a trial court's grant of a summary judgment de novo, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonprevailing party. Summary judgment is properly granted if the record reflects that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Oceanic Inn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6820513\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/133/1021/\">\n    2016 ME 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6820513\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/133/1021/\">\n    133 A.3d 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 12] In order for a plaintiff to succeed in a claim for breach of contract, Nevada law requires a plaintiff to show \"(1) the existence of a valid contract, (2) a breach by the defendant, and (3) damage as a result of the breach.\"\n   <em>\n    Saini v.

Because Burrill admitted that the car was damaged in an accident while it was rented under his name in a contractual arrangement that made him responsible for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   damage to the car, and acknowledged that he refused to pay the amount demanded by Avis, there was no genuine issue of material fact that Burrill breached the rental agreement by failing to pay Avis after the car was damaged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b6 14] Because there were no genuine issues of material fact as to (1) the existence of a valid contract; (2) breach of that contract; and (3) some amount of damage as a result of the breach, we affirm the grant of Avis's motion for partial summary judgment as to liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 56(c) (\"A summary judgment, interlocutory in character, may be rendered on the issue of liability alone although there is a genuine issue as to the amount of damages.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B. Damages\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 15] Although there was no genuine issue of material fact that damage did indeed occur, the parties disputed the extent of the damages, prompting the court to order a hearing to determine the specific amount of damages. Burrill argues that the court erred and abused its discretion when it admitted, pursuant to the business records exception to the hearsay rule, the affidavit of an Avis representative and its attachments\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   as the sole evidence of the amount of damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.

However, because the affiant did not certify that she had any knowledge of J.D.

Although the rental agreement stated that the signatory to the agreement would be required to pay for such fees in the event of damage to the vehicle, none of the other attachments purported to provide a basis for the specific amounts of those fees.

The court rejected Burrill's contention that a conversation he allegedly had with an Avis clerk prior to renting the vehicle created genuine issues of material fact on the ground that evidence regarding the alleged conversation would be barred by the parol evidence rule.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Klabacka v.

This remains Burrill's main argument on appeal. It is a red herring, however. Even if Burrill's girlfriend was an authorized driver, he is still contractually responsible for the damage to the car.

Evid. 902(11) requires that the party seeking to certify business records in accordance with the rule must, before the trial or hearing, provide the adverse party with reasonable\n    <em>\n     written\n    </em>\n    notice of the intent to offer the record and must make the record and certification available for inspection. The purpose of the notice requirement is to ensure that the adverse party \"has a fair opportunity to object to the authenticity of the record or on the basis of hearsay.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    M.R. Evid. 902(11). There is no indication in the record whether notice was provided, but at the outset of the hearing, Burrill appeared to have been aware of Avis's plan to use the affidavit as proof of damages. Neither at the hearing or to us has Burrill objected to the affidavit based on lack of notice pursuant to M.R. 902(11); his objections were and are to the\n    <em>\n     attachments\n    </em>\n    to the affidavit. The rule provides that, \"[i]n the event of an adverse party's objection to a record offered under this paragraph, the court may in the interests of justice refuse to accept the certification under this paragraph and require the party offering the record to provide appropriate foundation by other evidence.\" M.R. Evid. 902(11).

The rental agreement, unlike the vehicle valuation report, the towing invoice, and the salvage proceeds documentation, was prepared by Avis and meets the requirements of Rules 803(6) and 902(11). Because it was not prepared by a third party and because the affiant laid the proper foundation pursuant to Rule 902(11), the rental agreement would be admissible. Although the rental agreement informs the signatory of the types of fees and costs he or she will incur in the event of damage to or loss of the vehicle, it does not provide the specific amounts of those fees and costs. The rental agreement alone therefore cannot provide a basis for the damages award sought by Avis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Therefore, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the affidavit-which provide the total amount of damages suffered by Avis and a list of fees and costs that comprise that total-are not certifications pursuant to Rule 902(11) and are thus inadmissible hearsay.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    M.R.

There was no reference to the repair estimate in the affidavit of damages, nor did an Avis representative testify to any personal knowledge of the business practices of the company that prepared the repair estimate.

Court's Opinion \u00b6 17 n.8. As the Court's opinion recognizes, Avis was prepared to present a live witness to support its damages evidence, but the live witness was, erroneously in my view, excluded by the trial court.

I respectfully dissent from that part of the Court's opinion holding that portions of the affidavit and supporting exhibits provided by the Avis claims representative, who was assigned to value the claim and be a custodian of the records related to the claim, do not qualify as business records pursuant to M.R.

Power report focused on by the Court. There is no dispute that the Avis representative assembled and possessed the business records and that she, herself, calculated the damages amounts asserted by Avis and found by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   [\u00b6 31] The Avis records include a copy of an invoice for $155 for towing charges incurred by Avis. A copy of that invoice is included in the appendix. Other than a generalized hearsay objection, there is no dispute indicated in the record that the towing charge was incurred, that Avis was billed for the charge, that the bill was paid, or that the bill was made a part of Avis's business records in the regular course of Avis's business. Accordingly, the towing charge being part of Avis's business records, there was no apparent basis to object to the trial court's use of the $155 towing charge in calculating the total damages amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   [\u00b6 32] There also appears to be no dispute about the calculation of the salvage proceeds for the vehicle in the amount of $6,905.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   [\u00b6 33] The primary dispute relates to the calculation of the fair market value of the vehicle at the time of the loss, which the claims representative asserted was $20,601.98. This claim is based on a J.D. Power/Mitchell Vehicle Valuation Report attached as Exhibit B to the Avis representative's affidavit. This report demonstrates that it is based on a review of documentary evidence, including vehicle valuations for comparable vehicles available for sale in the Las Vegas area. These valuations are drawn from AutoTrader.com, Cars.com and other sources, including dealer contacts. Most of the report appears to reflect document-based reviews, necessary considering the very fast time for preparation of the valuation report provided to the Avis claims representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   [\u00b6 34] The trial court found that the Avis representative reasonably relied on the J.D. Power report in reaching her conclusions regarding the vehicle valuation and that the vehicle valuation report was admissible as part of the Avis business records pursuant to M.R. 803(6) after finding that \"the Affidavit provide[d] a sufficient foundation for the reliability and trustworthiness of the report.\" The court based that finding on the following observations: the vehicle valuation report was made within two days of the accident; preparing and maintaining such a report would be in the ordinary course of business for a claims representative at a car-rental company, whose job it is to create a complete and reliable record of the damage to a car; and nothing indicated that the report was prepared in an unusual or untrustworthy way. The court also referenced the inclusion of J.D. Power's valuation methodology in the report, which the court found to be \"rigorously objective and mathematical, and transparent about its sources of information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   [\u00b6 35] In reality it appears that the valuation report damages number was determined largely by subtracting the undisputed salvage proceeds from the valuations of comparable vehicles offered for sale in the Las Vegas area, identified by an internet review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   [\u00b6 36] Burrill has not demonstrated that the trial court clearly erred in its findings. The Avis representative certified that the valuation report was \"prepared at the request of and on behalf of Avis\" and that the report was \"kept within the claim file for this incident; maintained as part of [her] duties as a Claims Examiner for Avis; kept in the regular course of Avis's business and part of its regularly conducted activity; that it was made at or reasonably soon after the incident; and that the copy is an exact duplicate of the original.\" Because the trial court did not err, and because the valuation report fits within this Court's articulation of the purpose of the business records exception to the hearsay rule, it was within the court's discretion to admit the affidavit in its entirety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316804\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/864/\">\n    2017 ME 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316804\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/864/\">\n    155 A.3d 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   [\u00b6 37] As the trial court stated: \"Avis may not be in the vehicle valuation business, but its car rental activities require reliable means of valuating cars,\" especially in instances where its rental cars sustain damage. The Avis claims examiner appropriately requested a third party in the vehicle valuation business to create a report on the vehicle's valuation prior to damage from an accident. The report was \"kept within the claim file for [each] incident\" and \"kept in the regular course of Avis's business and part of its regularly conducted activity.\" Although litigation may be possible in some instances of damage to Avis's rental cars, a vehicle valuation report commissioned immediately after a vehicle has been damaged cannot be considered to have been \"prepared in anticipation of litigation\" by an advocate in the same way that a forensic report prepared by an expert advocating for one party would be.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Power report, including the apparently undisputed $155 towing charge. Court's Opinion \u00b6 41. Thus, rather than nominal damages, damages of at least $155 are established without regard to the propriety, or impropriety, of the claims representative's utilizing the J.D. Power report in making her calculations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   [\u00b6 39] As to that report, the trial court correctly found that the Avis representative properly utilized that valuation report, with its method of calculation explicitly documented and based largely on documentary information available in business records, vehicle valuation reports, or on the internet through websites such as AutoTrader.com and Cars.com-material that appears to be regularly and widely utilized in calculating car valuations and car appraisals in today's internet age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   [\u00b6 40] Burrill does not challenge the amount of damages awarded; he only challenges the admission of the claims representative's affidavit in its entirety as a basis for the award. Because the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in determining that the affidavit and its attachments satisfied M.R. Evid. 803(6), this Court should affirm the award of damages in the amount of $15,342.57, or a lesser amount that includes the undisputed towing charge, and the undisputed salvage proceeds deducted from the comparable vehicle valuation based on apparently undisputed document reviews.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   [\u00b6 41] Burrill also challenges the court's award of attorney fees to Avis. He does not challenge the amount of the award but argues that because this Court should determine that the court erred in granting Avis's motion for partial summary judgment,\n   it should also vacate the attorney fees award as well. Because this Court should affirm the grant of partial summary judgment and the award of damages, it should also affirm the award of attorney fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Gagnon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186612\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/356/\">\n    2016 ME 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 15-16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186612\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/356/\">\n    147 A.3d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
