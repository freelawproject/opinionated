S.L. accused Petitioner of raping her on January 1, 2015, January 8, 2015, and February 2, 2015. In November 2015, Petitioner was tried in a consolidated jury trial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The jury found Petitioner not guilty of the January 1, 2015 charge, guilty of the January 8, 2015 charge, and a mistrial was declared regarding the February 2, 2015 charge. Petitioner was sentenced to a term of seven years incarceration and five years of supervised probation. The court suspended all but the 280 days time served. Petitioner also must register as a Tier II sex offender.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md.

Thereafter, Petitioner noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the trial court in an unreported decision.\n   <em>\n    Otto v.

Petitioner now asks this Court to consider whether the trial court erred in allowing the State to admit redacted portions of telephone calls Petitioner made to his mother while in pre-trial detention, but denying Petitioner's request to admit the remaining telephone transcripts pursuant to the common law doctrine of verbal completeness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For reasons to be explained, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioner and S.L. dated for several years and produced three children from the relationship. Petitioner and S.L. did\n   not live together and were not married at the time of any of the alleged rapes. S.L. lived with the three children in a two-bedroom\n   apartment in Montgomery County. S.L. did not speak English, and was not a United States citizen. Petitioner and S.L. discussed living together at Petitioner's home in Frederick County, Maryland; however, those plans were abandoned when S.L. learned that Petitioner was residing with another woman for the duration of S.L. and Petitioner's relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Between January 8, 2015 and February 2, 2015, Montgomery County police officers responded to S.L.'s apartment multiple times, where S.L. reported forcible sexual intercourse between her and Petitioner. On February 2, 2015, D.L., the seven-year old daughter of Petitioner and S.L., placed a 911 call stating that \"my dad is hurting my mom.\" Thereafter, police arrested Petitioner on February 3, 2015, and later charged him with three counts of second-degree rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the first day of trial, the State called D.L. to the stand, anticipating that she would testify that she witnessed Petitioner hurt S.L. Prior to trial, D.L. was interviewed by Maggie Newton, a forensic interviewer employed by Montgomery County Child Welfare Services. During the videotaped interview, D.L. described how she watched through a crack in the door as Petitioner hurt S.L. D.L. told Newton that her father hurt her mother on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding the recorded interview, D.L. testified that she could not remember telling Newton that Petitioner hurt S.L. To refresh her recollection, the State played recorded portions of D.L.'s 911 call, but D.L. indicated that she still did not remember speaking to Newton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The State showed D.L. a still image from the videotape of D.L.'s interview with Newton, which depicted D.L. sitting in an interview room with Newton. After seeing the videotape image, D.L. testified that she recalled sitting with a woman, but did not remember the conversation. Outside of the presence of the jury, the State played an hour of the videotape to refresh D.L.'s recollection. The jury re-entered the courtroom\n   and the State asked D.L. if she now remembered telling someone that Petitioner hurt S.L., to which D.L. replied, \"[n]o. My dad did not hurt my mommy.\" Thereafter, the State moved to have the entire video admitted into evidence as a prior inconsistent statement pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-802.1(a). Petitioner initially objected to the videotape's admission in its entirety. However, after hearing the testimony he withdrew his objection to the videotape's admissibility, maintaining objection to certain portions of the video recording being redacted as improper evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Rule 404(b). Ultimately, the videotape was admitted into evidence and played for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the second day of trial, Petitioner requested that S.L. assert her spousal privilege in front of the jury. Petitioner was released pre-trial with the condition that he have no contact with S.L. Petitioner, however, violated the no contact order and married S.L. prior to trial. At trial, S.L. took the stand and proclaimed, \"because of the fact that I am married to my husband, I can use that [marital] privilege and not to testify.\" Without S.L., the State offered various police officers as witnesses, who testified regarding the statements made by S.L. as a complaining witness, including S.L.'s original 911 call reporting a rape on January 8, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On the fourth day of trial, the State sought to admit excerpted portions of telephone calls that Petitioner made to his mother while he was in pre-trial detention. Consistent with common practice, these\n   calls were recorded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to trial, the State compiled a series of audio excerpts from the recorded calls and prepared a redacted paper transcript. Over Petitioner's objection, the trial court admitted the redacted paper transcript of the calls (\"the redacted call transcript\") into evidence as State's Exhibit 96 and the excerpted audio recording of the calls was played for the jury. During Petitioner's\n   case-in-chief, he sought to admit the non-redacted paper transcript of State's Exhibit 6 (\"the non-redacted call transcript\") pursuant to the doctrine of verbal completeness. For analytical purposes, the non-redacted call transcript is included below in italic and the redacted call transcript was admitted as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [PETITIONER]: All right.

Are you there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   [PETITIONER]: Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Yes, I am. Anyway, I'm very sorry you guys have put out so much and they stuck me right back in here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: You know, I don't think, I don't think the judge really heard that it was sort of a double jeopardy, that there was an error.

So it, it doesn't seem fair to punish you twice for the same incident, the same, you know-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   [PETITIONER]: No, because that was already litigated at the bond hearing the other day and my attorney didn't even point that out, you know?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: He mentioned it once because he did mention the high bail set because of it, but then the conversation just went in all these other directions and that didn't remain the focus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [PETITIONER]: No, no, he really lost it and I don't, I don't know what to do. And, you know, I'm sorry I'm-\n   Unidentified Speaker: What? You did what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   [PETITIONER]: Huh?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: I didn't hear what you said.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [PETITIONER]: I said he really, you know, lost it. He let the whole thing lose direction and he didn't, didn't keep it on focus and-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: He didn't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [PETITIONER]:-you know, instead of pointing out, you know, again and again how she wasn't supposed to be the one there, I didn't violate this intentionally, it was supposed to be her sister, you know, and, and the State's Attorney said that the detective said that they caught us together inside the CVS. That's not even true. As soon as they showed up, I was arrested right at my car and, by one of the detectives. By the time that female detective showed up, I was already in handcuffs by those other detectives. And, and-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: Yeah. Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   [PETITIONER]:-that one was gone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: Well, you see that-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [PETITIONER]: That woman never even saw us together. So that's, you know, and the CVS security footage would show we were never in that store together and that's perjury on the State's part.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: It sure seems like false, false statements in court. It's, it's unbelievable how bad the, your luck is on this. I just can't believe it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   [PETITIONER]: I know. I was talking to my attorney about me getting the CVS security footage or something because I mean that would prove the State lied on that and we weren't there together.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   [PETITIONER]: You know?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: I think, I think there's, you know, a lot of the things\n   that we can do on the 20th and we'll all\n   certainly be there to testify and hopefully this will get straightened back out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   [PETITIONER]: Yeah, I-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: But-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   [PETITIONER]:-I don't want to-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: Say it again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   [PETITIONER]: No, if I'm going to get out on the 20th, you know, I don't want to lose my home and stuff in the meantime. But if I don't get out on the 20th, then there's not going to be any point in maintaining things. But, in the meantime, I don't want to lose all my stuff. And if there is-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: Well, I was counseling your dad to, you know, hold everything until the 20th and I think he's, I think he's listened to that. I think he wants a plan on the 20th, but I think, I think he's going to hold together until then.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   [PETITIONER]: Yeah, he's, he's not wanting to help me very much. I don't know, I just don't know who else to turn to. But-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: What do you think is going to happen bill-wise between now and the 20th?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   [PETITIONER]: The rent is due on the 15th. That's 1,700. That's the only major thing. My electric bill at some point. I don't, I don't know. My cell phones, I guess, are due. And like I said, that, unfortunately, is a big bill this month just because there haven't been, you know, the last weekend in January before all this, you know, stuff even happened, I had gotten a new, a new cell phone and then I've had to get two new cell phones because of the, the police.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: Right. Well, I think it takes 30 days to evict, you know? So the, the rent, you know, they can't just on the 15th decide to evict. There is a process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   [PETITIONER]: No, but, you know, my landlord, you know, I've been there eight years. He's a very good guy to work with, but I hate to-\n   Unidentified Speaker: Can you call him and talk to him or no?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   [PETITIONER]: Not yet. I'd like the rent to be covered one more month, at least, at least if I'm going to get out on the 20th. If I'm not going to get out on the 20th, then I can start making plans to pack all my stuff up. But, you know, I told Maria in the meantime and my, she's helping my mom, my daughter's mom. I'm wanting to move her and the kid into my house if something-my best chance out of this is for my family to help her out because she, you know, if she helps recant all this stuff if, if, you know, she's left in an entirely abandoned position right now too, then she's just going to want to cooperate with the State to get the State's assistance and that's going to screw me. So-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: It sure is a, it's a, it's a cluster [explicative].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   [PETITIONER]: It is. But-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: The whole thing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   [PETITIONER]:-but my best chance is for her and the kid to move into my house at least for-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: But that can't happen because you're not allowed to have contact with her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   [PETITIONER]: Well, but I don't even know if I'm getting out on the 20th yet or not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: I, I think that the, there was an error made, like you said, and it, it just hasn't gotten, the court hasn't had any chance to hear your side of anything until your attorney\n   got five minutes yesterday it seems and he didn't do a very good job.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   [PETITIONER]: He didn't do a very good job.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: So the, you know, we, on the 20th you'll have a chance to at least begin to tell the court system what, you know, what, who you are and what you're about and that this is not you. I mean I, all night long I've been laying there thinking, oh my God, if I just stood up and took a chance and said this, that maybe he would have heard me or let me speak, but he wouldn't-\n   [PETITIONER]: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Unidentified Speaker:-he wouldn't, he was very much in control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   [PETITIONER]: Yeah. Yeah, the judge was very, very nasty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: And that he's a very hard judge. I mean we knew that as soon as we knew his name, Tom knew that I should say. And I think Tom as [sic] on the fence about whether to try something yesterday or get an extension, I don't know what that would have done, but you know we were convincing him that it's very, very simple and very clear and he tried and he made an effort, but-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   [PETITIONER]: Yeah, but he did a terrible job.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: And, yeah, I kind of agree with you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   [PETITIONER]: He didn't know the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: Right.

I think on the 20th, I think if we can all hold out until the 20th, maybe we can get this, at least this piece of it straightened out and I, I'm just praying they keep you at the detention center, but I don't know if they will or not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   [PETITIONER]: They're not.

I don't know. I really don't know. I think I'll get a lot less phone time then.

If you guys are, you know, I hate to keep leaning on you, but if you guys at least keep some of my stuff afloat for the next month, then if I find out what's, whether I get out or not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: How will we find out about the electricity? Will your mom be able to find the bill there in the mail pile?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   [PETITIONER]: Yeah, I guess so. When my attorney comes to see me, I'm going to have to write down. I guess passwords, how to get out, you know, I keep all my stuff on my AOL account, you know, under favorites and payable\n   stuff. So I have to write down my passwords.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: Right. Right. Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   [PETITIONER]: Right and on-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: Gosh, if only we're allowed to start writing things in there. I don't understand how that cannot be something you can do. Oh, I'm so sorry, you know? This is so unfair. I, I just can't imagine-and we're all struggling with how do we help her when she needs to feel the consequences of what, what she's done.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   [PETITIONER]: No, but at the same time if we don't, you know, I hate to say it, but if we don't, my friends and family don't help her out, she's going to, you know, turn back to the state which isn't going to be good for me. So I talked to Maria yesterday about-talking to her, about getting her into my house. One way or another, you know-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: I don't know why getting into your house is the answer. I mean she needs food and, and medicine. Where is she living?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   [PETITIONER]: In a, she's renting a room in Gaithersburg. I was just thinking, you know, I don't-\n   Unidentified Speaker: And you've been paying for this for how many years?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   [PETITIONER]: Since-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: Like what is, what is the support she's been used to?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   [PETITIONER]: I've probably given her 1,500 a month for the last, I guess since my daughter was born.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: I don't know how you manage it. Well, I think moving her into house is a big mistake, Al. I mean where are you going to live when you move out? Where, how-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   [PETITIONER]: I don't know. You know, her and, her-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: Does she-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   [PETITIONER]:-working on an affidavit so that we could be around to have contact and maybe that will be in place. I just-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: I'm not sure they're working on that. I tried to bring that up at lunch and I'm not sure-I'm not, I'm not sure how that's working. I don't know. Maybe the answer is to, to drop Tom and have Maria be your primary if that's possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   [PETITIONER]: Yeah, I don't know. And, see, Maria insisted on how much better Tom is and Tom didn't do a great job. I don't know. I feel like he's just, he's not into the case. You know, I asked him specifically before hiring him if he had time for this case and he's assured me it would be a priority for him, but all he keeps talking about is money. We have a specific payment agreement, but he made it sound like at the hearing yesterday like he wasn't going to want to continue to represent me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: Yeah. Yeah, that was very unfortunate and I, sadly, he, he's anticipating that you're not getting out and if that's the case, then how on earth, you know, can he get paid? But that's all, that's all, you know, down the road. That's after the 20th. We need to stay focused on the 20th and I wanted to tell you that I emailed Star, so don't worry about that, and there's something else.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   [PETITIONER]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: And-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   [PETITIONER]: They mailed me the bills, they're sitting there at my house.

Your dad was worried about you getting another hematoma. I mean are you-are you okay health-wise?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   [PETITIONER]: That would be [a] relief right now.

Hang in there. Let's, let's, let's aim for the 20th and we'll do everything we can for then. But I don't think you can possibly move her in your house. I think that's a bad, bad idea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   [PETITIONER]: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   Unidentified Speaker: And so does everyone else.

Although the entire jail-house telephone call transcript spanned roughly 150 pages, Petitioner averred that the non-redacted call transcript would illuminate that issue for the jury. The trial judge disagreed, and opined that Petitioner's focus was not on S.L. recanting for the bond hearing, but was rather concerned that if his family did not provide basic amenities and support for S.L., she would be more compelled to testify against him. The trial judge commented that Petitioner's goal was to marry S.L. so that she could assert her marital privilege, rendering her unavailable to testify. The court denied Petitioner's request to admit the non-redacted call transcript, and thereafter the defense rested. Following Petitioner's conviction, he noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Before the Court of Special Appeals, Petitioner raised three issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-235\">\n   (1) whether the trial court erred in admitting the videotape recording of D.L.'s interview; (2) whether the trial court erred by not admitting the full transcript of the recorded\n   jail telephone calls; and (3) whether the trial court erred by giving a jury instruction that [Petitioner] claims told jurors they could not ask questions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   <em>\n    Otto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202839150\">\n    2017 WL 2839150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. On the first issue, the Court of Special Appeals reasoned that Petitioner failed to preserve his claim on appeal because he withdrew his objection to the recorded interview at trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. However, despite waiving his hearsay arguments, \"the recorded interview was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement because it meets the requirements of [Maryland] Rule 5-802.1(b).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. Regarding the second issue, Petitioner asserted that after admitting the redacted call transcript, he should have been permitted to introduce the non-redacted call transcript into evidence pursuant to the doctrine of verbal completeness.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court determined that it was not an abuse of discretion to admit only a portion of the transcript where the trial judge construed the content of the redacted call transcript narrowly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. With regard to Petitioner's third issue, the Court determined that Petitioner failed to make a timely objection to the jury instructions, thus waiving his claim for appellate review. However, apart from the\n   waiver, the Court did not find an abuse of discretion with respect to the \"jury instruction because it was a correct statement of the applicable law and was not covered by the other instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. Accordingly, in an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Petitioner then noted the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   Once again, Petitioner argues that it was reversible error for the trial judge to deny admission of the non-redacted call transcript. We granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   to consider whether the trial court's exclusion of the entire jail call transcript violated the common law doctrine of verbal completeness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finding no such error, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Interpretation of the Maryland Rules presents a question of law, reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   to ascertain whether the trial court was legally correct in its rulings.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In Maryland, the doctrine finds its roots from two sources: the common law and Maryland Rule 5-106. The application of the common law doctrine of verbal completeness requires that \"[t]he offer in testimony of a\n   part of a statement or conversation, upon a well-established rule of evidence, always gives to the opposite party the right to have the whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Wood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774941\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/31/293/#p296\">\n    31 Md. 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 296-97 (1869). At common law, a party seeking to admit evidence pursuant to the common law doctrine of verbal completeness, could admit the remaining conversation or writing during the party's case-in-chief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Maryland Rule 5-106 partially codifies the common law doctrine of verbal completeness, but allows writings or recorded statements to be admitted earlier in the proceeding than the common law doctrine. Maryland Rule 5-106 states, \"[w]hen part or all of a writing or recorded statement is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.\" The rule does not allow evidence that is otherwise inadmissible to be admitted, and it does not change the requirements for admissibility under the common law doctrine. However, where the evidence sought to be admitted is not otherwise admissible, the evidence may be admitted, in fairness, \"as an explanation of previously-admitted evidence and not as substantive proof.\"\n   <em>\n    Conyers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"400101\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/345/525/#p543\">\n    345 Md. at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"400101\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/345/525/#p543\">\n    693 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   788 (citing Md. Rule 5-106, Committee Note.). Nonetheless, the codification in Rule 5-106 is largely \"one of timing, rather than admissibility.\" Md. Rule 5-106, Committee Note. Because Petitioner waited until presenting his case to submit the remainder of the telephone transcript, rather than contemporaneously as prescribed by\n   Maryland Rule 5-106, the common law doctrine of verbal completeness is the proper lens through which to analyze Petitioner's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   Petitioner asserts that once the State admitted the redacted call transcript into evidence, he should have been permitted to introduce the non-redacted call transcript pursuant to the doctrine of verbal completeness. By barring the non-redacted telephone calls into evidence, Petitioner alleges that the jury was presented with a misleading interpretation of his statements in the redacted telephone calls. Thus, Petitioner argues that the doctrine of verbal completeness required the trial judge to admit the remaining telephone transcripts to put the redacted telephone calls in context. Respondent counters that the non-redacted call transcript was properly excluded because those remaining calls did not aid in constructing or interpreting the admitted evidence. Controversy exists concerning the scope of the conversations that may be admitted pursuant to the doctrine of verbal completeness in Maryland. Thus, a resolution of the scope and limitations of the common law doctrine of verbal completeness must be addressed initially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   <em>\n    The Common Law Doctrine of Verbal Completeness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   The common doctrine of verbal completeness was first outlined by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Feigley v.

The redacted call transcript admitted by the State involved Petitioner's scheme to have his family take care of S.L. to convince her to recant her allegations. The remainder of the telephone call does not directly discuss the scheme, but references his finances, an upcoming bond hearing, and the presiding judge. Petitioner has not explained how his particular interest in the bond hearing explains or interprets his statements that helping S.L. and the children would motivate S.L. to recant her statements incriminating him. Even if Petitioner meant that helping S.L. would cause her to recant at the time of the bond hearing, his statement still supports the State's theory that he attempted to persuade a change in her testimony. The trial court reasoned that these were not the same subject and would not explain the admitted portions of the transcript, but rather, may tend to confuse the jury.

Md. May 25, 2017), an unreported opinion from the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, authored by Judge Paul W. Grimm.\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   endeavored to resolve the split in authority which arose in federal circuits regarding whether Federal Rule of Evidence 106 requires that evidence admitted under the doctrine of verbal completeness be independently admissible. Petitioner highlights that the noteworthy points that this Court should follow involve\n   <em>\n    Bailey's\n   </em>\n   premise that the common law completeness doctrine permitted introduction of otherwise admissible evidence, and a suggestion of a nine factor test on whether ordinarily inadmissible hearsay should be introduced under Federal Rule of Evidence 106.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202276849\">\n    2017 WL 2276849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3, *6. Contrasting this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Conyers\n   </em>\n   with\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   , Petitioner asserts that\n   <em>\n    Conyers\n   </em>\n   was not well-reasoned and that any discussion in\n   <em>\n    Conyers\n   </em>\n   about independently admissible evidence should be construed as\n   <em>\n    dicta\n   </em>\n   because it was not the primary issue before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   Petitioner's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   , and criticism of\n   <em>\n    Conyers,\n   </em>\n   overlooks the fact that the trial judge did not exclude the\n   remaining telephone calls in this case on the grounds of independent inadmissibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial judge's colloquy with counsel demonstrates a consideration of common law precedent requiring that evidence admitted pursuant to the doctrine of verbal completeness, aid in construing or explaining the admitted evidence. While discussing his reasoning, the trial judge explained that in State's Exhibit 96 the focus is that \"[Petitioner] wants her to recant so he can get out so this whole thing can get away-go away.... I don't believe he is talking about recant in any aspect other than getting her to recant her testimony that kicked this whole thing off.\" When addressing Petitioner's claim that the remaining telephone calls would aid in demonstrating to the jury that Petitioner was referring to an upcoming bond hearing, the trial judge reasoned Petitioner's comments were not made because \"[h]e is worried about the fact that she is going to testify [against] him and recant doesn't\n   mean anything other than recant what she said.\" The trial judge makes no reference to independent admissibility. Rather, the trial judge indicates that the remaining telephone calls do not illuminate Petitioner's statements regarding efforts to get S.L. to recant. When the State raised the issue of hearsay contained within the remaining telephone calls, Petitioner's counsel agreed that those statements could be redacted. Therefore, Petitioner's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   is\n   misplaced and is not persuasive on overcoming the common law precedent in this State regarding the common law doctrine of verbal completeness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   As illustrated\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , each decision analyzing the common law doctrine of verbal completeness subsequent to\n   <em>\n    Feigley\n   </em>\n   narrows the scope of the evidence that can be admitted. Contrary to Petitioner's contention, the right is not automatic, but must be considered in light of what has already been admitted. A party seeking to admit evidence pursuant to the doctrine of verbal completeness must still satisfy\n   <em>\n    Feigley's\n   </em>\n   foundational test. The trial judge in this case analyzed, on the record, that Petitioner's sentiment that he would be \"screwed\" if S.L. did not recant, were not clarified through admission of the remaining transcripts. Although the trial judge construed the subject and content of the non-redacted call transcript more narrowly than Petitioner proposes, it was not an abuse of discretion to exclude the remaining telephone calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS IS AFFIRMED.
