Caldwell Wood Products, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3929518\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/425/496/\">\n    425 N.J. Super. 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3929518\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/425/496/\">\n    42 A.3d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. Div. 2012), we imposed liability on the owner of a vacant, boarded-up building that had been used for commercial purposes. For the reasons that follow, we hold that a vacant church maintains its status as a noncommercial property, not subject to a commercial property's sidewalk liability. We reject any reading of\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   that imposes liability on owners of vacant residential or\n   noncommercial properties that have not been put to any commercial use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Timothy Ellis challenges the Law Division's orders denying his motion to classify the subject church as a commercial property and granting a cross-motion for summary judgment filed by defendants, Hilton United Methodist Church and the Board of Trustees of the Greater New Jersey Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts giving rise to plaintiff's claim are not in dispute. On August 27, 2015, plaintiff filed a complaint for damages arising from injuries he sustained when he slipped and fell on the sidewalk abutting defendants' premises on September 9, 2013. He claimed that he fell because the sidewalk was uneven and broken, and alleged negligence and other causes of action arising from the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before discovery concluded,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   plaintiff filed a motion on July 20, 2016, captioned \"Motion to Strike the Defense of Charitable Immunity and to Classify Defendant as a Commercial Landowner.\" Relying on\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   , he argued that because defendants' abandoned property had the \"potential to generate income,\" liability should be imposed on defendants. In response, defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment arguing that they were not commercial landowners, the church was no longer in operation, and they had no duty to maintain the sidewalk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of their cross-motion, defendants attached a certification stating that the church was not in operation at the time of plaintiff's accident, and that worship and other programs at the church ceased in June 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   There was no evidence in the record that defendants conducted or allowed others to conduct any commercial enterprises from the church. It was undisputed, however, that defendants maintained\n   premises liability insurance even though the church ceased operations at the location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After considering the parties' submissions and oral argument, the motion judge denied plaintiff's motion to classify defendants as commercial landowners and granted defendants' cross-motion for summary\n   judgment, dismissing the complaint with prejudice. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff contends on appeal that we should reverse the motion judge's entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants because \"[a]t the time of the accident, [defendants'] property was not used for any religious or charitable purposes and [therefore] it must be classified as commercial property.\" He argues \"[t]here is no authority to support the proposition that liability is imposed on commercial landowners[,] but not on noncommercial landowners. A property must be either commercial or residential.\" According to plaintiff, \"[t]he mere fact that the premises was abandoned should not free [defendants] from liability.\" He further claims that although \"there are no New Jersey cases involving a trip and fall accident that occurred on a sidewalk abutting a church that is no longer in operation[,]\" the logic this court used in\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   should apply, especially because defendants maintained liability insurance like the defendant landowner in\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   . Last, although not raised before the motion judge, plaintiff argues it was improper for the judge to consider defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment before discovery was complete. We disagree with all of these contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We review a trial court's order granting summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Conley v.

In determining that the property was subject to sidewalk liability, despite being put to no use at all, we relied upon the structure of the property being a \"commercial building [that] had the capacity to generate income and, had, in fact, generated income in the recent past.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3929518\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/425/496/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3929518\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/425/496/\">\n    at 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3929518\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/425/496/\">\n    42 A.3d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Here, defendants' church is not a commercial building. There is nothing in the record to indicate that it was ever operated for commercial purposes, and it was not open to the general public in any capacity once it stopped functioning as a church in 2011. Contrary to plaintiff's argument, the mere fact that defendants maintained liability\n   insurance like the commercial property owner in\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   does not convert the church to a commercial property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Similarly, plaintiff's argument that liability should still be imposed because defendants' facility could have been put to use to generate income is misguided. If we were to accept it, any noncommercial or residential property would be subject to sidewalk liability immediately upon it being vacated or abandoned because it had the potential to be converted to a commercial use. That result would go far beyond what\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   contemplated when it carved out the exception to the rule against a landowner's liability and imposed it only on owners of commercial properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We turn next to plaintiff's argument that it was error for the motion judge to consider defendants' motion for summary\n   judgment before discovery was complete. We decline to address that argument because plaintiff never raised it to the motion judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v.
