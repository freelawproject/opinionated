(UnitedHealthcare) petitions for review from two final determinations of the Pennsylvania Office of Open Records (OOR), which granted in part, denied in part and/or dismissed as moot in part UnitedHealthcare's appeals from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Human Services' (DHS) partial denial of its requests under the Right-to-Know Law (RTKL).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   UnitedHealthcare contends that DHS improperly withheld requested documents pursuant to the exemption set forth at Section 708(b)(26) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(26) (relating to offerors' proposals), even though the contract was \"awarded\" by the selection of successful offerors at the time the requests were made. In addition, UnitedHealthcare claims that DHS failed to provide an adequate basis to support its assertion that it properly withheld the requested documents where it did not produce an exemption log identifying the documents withheld and the basis for withholding them. Upon review, we hold that the selection of offerors does not constitute an \"award of the contract\" for purposes of Section 708(b)(26) of the RTKL and affirm OOR's final determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This matter stems from a request for proposal (RFP) conducted by DHS, pursuant to Section 513 of the Commonwealth Procurement Code (Procurement Code),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   known as Original RFP No. 06-15 and Reissued RFP No. 06-15 relating to the Physical HealthChoices Program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   UnitedHealthcare was one of eleven offerors that submitted proposals. However, DHS did not select UnitedHealthcare to enter into contract negotiations. UnitedHealthcare protested its nonselection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   UnitedHealthcare submitted two document requests pursuant to the RTKL. On November 21, 2016, UnitedHealthcare submitted its first request (No. 348 C.D. 2017) seeking records related to the submission of proposals in response to the Original and Reissued RFPs, the scoring of proposals, the selection and notification to offerors with regard to the results of the selection process, and protest documents related to the Original RFP before its reissuance. Reproduced Record (R.R.) 21a-23a. Specifically, it requested:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (a) All bids and proposals submitted by offerors in response to the Original RFP # 06-15 and Reissued RFP # 06-15;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (b) All records and documents, including any and all criteria, bid tabulations, individual scoring sheets and notes of members of the evaluation committee evaluating the Original RFP # 06-15 and the Reissued RFP # 06-15 proposals, including but not limited to the technical scores and the [small diverse business (SDB) ] submittals, records or evaluation sheets, regardless of physical form or description, prepared or produced by or on behalf of DHS, Bureau of Financial Operations, Division of Procurement and Contract Management; DHS Office of Long-Term Living; the Department of Aging; the Bureau of Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Small Business Opportunities (\"BDISBO\"), and/or any evaluation committee(s);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (c) All correspondence, regardless of physical form, received or produced by or on behalf of DHS and/or any evaluation committee(s) and the BDISBO regarding the Original RFP # 06-15 and the Reissued RFP # 06-15;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (d) All records related to the results of any evaluation committee's and BDISBO's report to the Issuing office regarding the Original RFP # 06-15 and the Reissued RFP # 06-15;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (e) All records related to the scores of all bidders, individually or combined, in connection with the final technical scores, the [SDB] scores, the price scores and any other relevant scores including the bidders' overall scores regarding the Original RFP # 06-15 and the Reissued RFP # 06-15;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (f) All memorandum [sic] including without limitation any selection memoranda, regardless of physical form, received or produced by or on behalf of DHS and/or any evaluation committee(s) and the BDISBO regarding the Original RFP # 06-15 and the Reissued RFP # 06-15;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (g) All recordings, regardless of physical form, received or produced by or on behalf of DHS or any evaluation committee(s) and the BDISBO regarding the Original RFP # 06-15 and the Reissued RFP # 06-15;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (h) All records related to the post-selection notification and evaluation processes, including any readiness review conducted by DHS regarding the Original RFP # 06-15;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (i) All protest documents, regardless of physical form, received or produced by or on behalf of DHS regarding the Original RFP # 06-15; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (j) All records related to the reissuance of RFP # 06-15, including\n   <em>\n    but not limited\n   </em>\n   to all versions and proposed versions, regardless of physical form, of the Reissued RFP # 06-15, all correspondence, regardless of physical form, received or produced by or on behalf of DHS related to the reissuance of RFP # 06-15, and all reports, memoranda, notes, charts or similar documents related to the reissuance of RFP # 06-15.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   R.R. at 22a-23a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On December 27, 2016, UnitedHealthcare submitted a second request (No. 543 C.D. 2017) seeking two categories of documents\n   relating to the rescoring of proposals and the reissuance of awards pursuant to the Reissued RFP. R.R. at 433a-36a. Specifically, it requested:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (a) All records related to the re-scoring of proposals conducted by [Department of General Services (DGS) ] pursuant to DHS's announcement of the same on December 14, 2016, including\n   <em>\n    but not limited to\n   </em>\n   all bids, SDB submittals, scoring sheets, charts, handwritten notes, evaluation memos and similar documents; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (b) All records related to the reissuance of awards under the Reissued RFP # 06-15 pursuant to the re-scoring, including\n   <em>\n    but not limited to\n   </em>\n   all correspondence (including emails); announcements, selection memos, news releases and similar documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   R.R. at 434a (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   DHS partially granted and partially denied the requests. With regard to the first request, DHS denied Items (a), (b), (d), and (e) in their entirety as exempt under Section 708(b)(26) of the RTKL. R.R. at 28a-30a. DHS explained that the proposal documents are exempt until the award of an agreement and that the evaluation committee documents are permanently exempt pursuant to the procurement exemption under Section 708(b)(26) of the RTKL. R.R. at 28a-34a. DHS granted in part Items (c), (f), (h), (i), and (j) and provided UnitedHealthcare over 300 documents, having redacted personal identification information, as permitted under 708(b)(6) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(6). R.R. at 29a-32a. DHS redacted certain information from records responsive to Item (h) under Section 708(b)(10) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(10) (predecisional deliberations). Finally, DHS responded that it did not have any documents responsive to Items (g) or part of (h). R.R. at 31a-32a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   With regard to the second request, DHS denied Item (a) and part of Item (b) as exempt under Section 708(b)(10) (predecisional deliberations), (12) (notes and working papers), and (26) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(10), (12), (26). R.R. at 441a-43a. DHS again explained that the proposal documents are exempt until the award of an agreement and the evaluation committee documents are permanently exempt pursuant to the procurement exemption of the RTKL under Section 708(b)(26) of the RTKL. DHS partially granted the request for Item (b) in response to the first request, with redactions. R.R. at 442a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   UnitedHealthcare appealed to OOR, challenging the partial denials and arguing that DHS failed to meet its burden of proving that the requested records are exempt under Section 708(b)(10), (12), and (26) of the RTKL. UnitedHealthcare also argued that, without the requested records, it will suffer prejudice in connection with its bid protests filed under the Procurement Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   OOR invited the parties to supplement the record and directed DHS to notify any third parties of their ability to participate in this appeal. DHS submitted position statements reiterating its grounds for denial. In support, DHS offered the affidavits of Erin Slabonik, DHS Division Director of Managed Care (Slabonik Affidavits); Barry Bowman, DHS Managed Care Operations Chief (Bowman Affidavit); and Andrea Bankes, DHS Open Records Officer (Bankes Affidavit). UnitedHealthcare also\n   submitted position statements and affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   OOR permitted offerors that had submitted proposals to participate and submit position papers. Those that participated argued that the RTKL protected the requested documents related to their proposals from disclosure under multiple exemptions, including the procurement and confidential, proprietary information exemptions under Section 708(b)(26) and (11) of the RTKL and offered affidavits in support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On February 23, 2017, OOR granted in part, denied in part, and dismissed as moot in part UnitedHealthcare's appeal pertaining to the first request. OOR Final Determination, 2/23/17, at 23 (OOR Dkt. No. AP 2017-0146). Specifically, OOR denied the appeal holding that DHS properly withheld proposal documents and evaluation committee documents under Section 708(b)(26) of the RTKL. OOR explained the proposal documents were exempt because no contract had been awarded under the Reissued RFP. Based on the selected offerors' submissions, OOR also concluded that the proposals were exempt under Section 708(b)(26) because they contain \"financial information of a bidder or offeror requested in an invitation for bid or request for proposals to demonstrate the bidder's or offeror's economic capability.\" OOR Final Determination, 2/23/17, at 8. However, OOR granted the appeal insofar as it found that DHS failed to prove application of the predecisional deliberation exemption, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(10), for records responsive to Item (h), and it directed the release of unredacted copies of those records. To the extent DHS provided documents responsive to the requests, OOR partially denied the appeal as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On April 3, 2017, OOR denied in part and dismissed as moot in part UnitedHealthcare's appeal pertaining to the second request. OOR Final Determination, 4/3/17, at 17 (OOR Dkt. No. AP 2017-0408). Again, OOR denied the appeal upon holding that DHS properly withheld proposal documents and evaluation committee documents responsive to Item (a) of the second request pursuant to Section 708(b)(26) of the RTKL. OOR Final Determination, 4/3/17, at 7. With regard to records responsive to Item (b) of the second request, OOR found that DHS provided responsive records and that UnitedHealthcare waived objections to redactions made thereto. OOR Final Determination, 4/3/17, at 3 n.3, 12. In reaching its decision, OOR considered and relied upon DHS's affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   UnitedHealthcare filed two petitions for review. Upon UnitedHealthcare's motion, this Court consolidated the matters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court granted intervention to offerors that participated in the OOR proceedings, namely: Pennsylvania Health and Wellness, Inc., Health Partners Plans, Inc., UPMC For You, Inc., Vista Health Plan, Inc., and Geisinger Health Plan, Inc. (collectively, Intervenors).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In this appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   UnitedHealthcare contends that DHS improperly withheld the requested documents pursuant to the exemption set forth in Section 708(b)(26) of the RTKL. According to UnitedHealthcare, once the selection of successful offerors\n   occurred, the contract was awarded and the documents requested no longer qualified for the exemption. In addition, it claims that DHS did not provide an adequate basis to support its assertion that it properly withheld the requested documents pursuant to Section 708(b)(26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procurement Exemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   First, UnitedHealthcare contends that OOR erred by determining that the procurement exemption under Section 708(b)(26) of the RTKL protected the requested proposals and related documents once DHS selected offerors. The selection of successful offerors in response to an RFP is the equivalent to an \"award of the contract\" for purposes of Section 708(b)(26) of the RTKL. An \"award of the contract\" does not mean the execution of the contract. The General Assembly certainly knew how to use the word \"executed\" if that was its intent, but chose not to. Moreover, such an interpretation is contrary to the purpose of Section 708(b)(26), which is to protect competitive bidding; competitive bidding is over once the selection for negotiation occurs. According to UnitedHealthcare, DHS's interpretation that an \"award\" equals execution, as opposed to selection, improperly preserves the secrecy of the documents until after they are no longer useful as a means for protesting an award. The RTKL must be interpreted to maximize public access. Consequently, Section 708(b)(26) of the RTKL is not an exemption that would support withholding the documents requested in these two matters. Moreover, there is existing case law in OOR establishing the effect of the selection of offerors with regard to documents sought pursuant to the RTKL. This Court should adopt OOR's analysis to permit access to the requested proposal documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   DHS and Intervenors counter that OOR correctly concluded that the procurement exemption of the RTKL exempts the requested proposals and related documents from disclosure because DHS has not awarded an agreement or contract. The selection of offerors to enter negotiations does not constitute an award of the contract because the terms of the contract are still being negotiated and a different offeror may obtain the contract if negotiations fail. DHS and Intervenors further contend that the need to protect competitive bidding remains until there is a contract with the selected offerors because the Reissued RFP could be rescinded and rebid. Prematurely granting access to proposal documents prior to the award of the contract could bestow an unfair advantage on competitors in any subsequent bidding. Although the RFPs included draft contract language, they contemplated post-selection negotiation of contract terms before any contract was finalized or executed, including negotiation of payment rates, and the RFPs stated that the draft contract terms are \"subject to change.\" R.R. at 345a, 372a, 747a. DHS presented sufficient evidence in the form of multiple affidavits to show that it had not awarded an agreement or contract, that it had only selected offerors to enter into contract negotiations, and that the selected offerors must participate in negotiations before DHS awards any contract or agreement. Thus, the requested proposal documents clearly fall within the exemption until the contract is awarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Section 708(b)(26) of the RTKL provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d), the following are exempt from access by a requester under this act:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (26) A proposal pertaining to agency procurement or disposal of supplies, services\n   or construction\n   <em>\n    prior to the award of the contract or prior to the opening and rejection of all bids\n   </em>\n   ; financial information of a bidder or offeror requested in an invitation for bid or request for proposals to demonstrate the bidder's or offeror's economic capability;\n   <em>\n    or the identity of members, notes and other records of agency proposal evaluation committees established under 62 Pa.

Section 708(b)(26) temporarily exempts offerors' proposals from disclosure until a contract is awarded or the procurement is canceled. 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(26) ;\n   <em>\n    Department of Transportation v.

Sections 512(g) and 512.1(g) of the Procurement Code, governing competitive sealed bidding and competitive electronic auction bidding, set forth the \"award\" of the contract as a step in the procurement process. 62 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 512(g) (\"Award.-The contract shall be awarded within 60 days of the bid opening by written notice to the lowest responsible bidder or all bids shall be rejected except as otherwise provided in this section.

C.S. \u00a7 513(g). The absence of the term \"award\" from Section 513 is not accidental. Prior to December 2002, former Section 513 referred to the selection decision as the \"award\" of the \"contract\" and provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (g) Award of contract.-The responsible offeror whose proposal is determined\n   in writing to be the most advantageous to the purchasing agency, taking into consideration price and all evaluation factors, shall be selected for contract negotiation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (h) Contract negotiation.-After selection, the purchasing agency shall proceed to negotiate a contract with the selected offeror.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Former\n   </em>\n   62 Pa.

The selection under Section 513 also differs from the award under Sections 512 and 512.1 in that the terms of the contract in Section 513 must still be negotiated after the selection, whereas the contract terms are already set by the invitation for bids and the successful bid when a Section 512 or 512.1 award is made.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   62 Pa.

This reliance is misplaced.\n   <em>\n    Balsbaugh\n   </em>\n   involved a Section 512 competitive sealed bidding, not a Section 513 request for proposals and selection of offerors for negotiation. In\n   <em>\n    Grant Street Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , there was no extended period of negotiation needed before a contract would be executed; the agency intended to complete execution of the contract within three days. Slip op. at 7. Moreover, that opinion was a single-judge unpublished opinion on whether a stay should be granted in a case in which the issue of what constituted an award of a contract was irrelevant and the Court merely referred to an award having been made without analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   UnitedHealthcare also argues that the interpretation of Massachusetts' public records statute, General Laws of Massachusetts Chapter 4, Section 7(26)(h), supports treating the selection decision as the event that terminates the exemption from disclosure. The language of the Massachusetts statute, however, is significantly different from Section 708(b)(26) of the RTKL; it exempts proposals from disclosure until \"the time for the opening of bids\" or \"the time for the receipt of bids or\n   proposals has expired\" and does not use the term \"award of the contract\" as an event that ends that exemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mass. Gen. Laws Chap. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(h) (exempting from disclosure \"proposals and bids to enter into any contract or agreement until the time for the opening of bids in the case of proposals or bids to be opened publicly, and until the time for the receipt of bids or proposals has expired in all other cases\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Based upon the foregoing analysis, we conclude that the General Assembly intended the phrase \"award of the contract\" for purposes of Section 708(b)(26) to mean the execution of the contract, not the selection of offerors. This interpretation is the most logical when read in conjunction with the relevant provisions of the Procurement Code. This interpretation also furthers the purpose of Section 708(b)(26) to foster competitive bidding until a contract is awarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Applying this interpretation to the facts presented here, when UnitedHealthcare made its RTKL requests and OOR ruled on the appeal, DHS had selected offerors for negotiations under Section 513(g) of the Procurement Code, which provides that \"[t]he responsible offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the purchasing agency, taking into consideration price and all evaluation factors, shall be selected for contract negotiation.\" 62 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 513(g). However, negotiations with the selected offerors had not commenced and no contracts had been finalized or executed. There is no evidence that DHS made any announcement of an award of contracts under Reissued RFP No. 06-15 in the period before OOR's decision. In fact, DHS submitted affidavits attesting that no award of any contracts or agreements under Reissued RFP No. 06-15 has occurred. R.R. at 71a, 501a (Slabonik Affidavits); R.R. at 65a (Bowman Affidavit). Because no contract has been awarded,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the requested documents pertaining to the RFPs continue to remain exempt from disclosure under Section 708(b)(26) of the RTKL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Next, UnitedHealthcare contends that DHS did not meet its burden of proving that the documents are not subject to production pursuant to Section 708(b)(26) because it failed to adequately identify the responsive documents by means of any kind of list or description that would allow this Court to assess the merits of the asserted grounds for exemption and non-production. Without a list or index, it is not possible to determine whether DHS's asserted exemptions apply to the documents requested. UnitedHealthcare requests this Court to order DHS to produce the withheld proposals immediately. Alternatively, it requests a remand for the production of an exemption list identifying the documents withheld and the basis for withholding them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Under the RTKL, an agency bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a record is protected from disclosure under one of the enumerated exemptions or contains privileged material.

To demonstrate that the procurement exemption applied to UnitedHealthcare's requests, DHS submitted affidavits. With regard to the proposals, the affidavits attest that DHS rescinded the Original RFP, reissued the Reissued RFP, and, although DHS selected offerors to enter into negotiations on the Reissued RFP, no actual contract or agreement has been awarded. R.R. at 65a-70a, 71a-76a, 501a-06a. As discussed above, until such time as a contract is awarded, the proposal documents remain exempt from disclosure under Section 708(b)(26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   With regard to the scoring records, the affidavits describe in detail the evaluation and scoring process of the evaluation committee. R.R. at 66a-67a, 72a, 74a-75a, 502a. The scoring records include score sheets, instructions, and a scoring matrix used by the evaluation committee to evaluate the technical submittals. R.R. at 68a-69a, 75a, 502a. Each member separately reviewed and preliminarily scored each technical submittal. R.R. at 69a, 75a, 502a. Afterwards, the evaluation committee met as a group to discuss the technical submittals and preliminary scoring. R.R. at 69a, 75a, 504a. Evaluation committee members could modify their scores after the meeting. R.R. at 69a, 75a, 504a. Scoring records include the evaluation committee's preliminary and final scores for each technical submittal. R.R. at 69a, 75a, 502a-03a. The affidavits prove that the scoring records are records of the evaluation committee relating to competitive sealed proposals, and thus, they qualify for permanent exemption under Section 708(b)(26), regardless of whether an agreement or contract is awarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Based on the affidavits, DHS met its burden of proving the records requested were exempt from disclosure under Section 708(b)(26) of the RTKL by a preponderance of the evidence. Because DHS sufficiently explained the basis for nondisclosure through affidavits, neither an exemption log nor\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the withheld documents was necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chambersburg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6927687\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/97/1281/#p1289\">\n    97 A.3d at 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In sum, we hold that the selection of offerors does not constitute an \"award of the contract\" for purposes of Section 708(b)(26) of the RTKL. Because there has been no award of the contract, the proposal documents remain exempt from disclosure under Section 708(b)(26). OOR properly concluded that DHS presented sufficient evidence in the form of multiple affidavits to support that Section 708(b)(26) exempted the documents requested, and it did not need to request an exemption log or conduct\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the withheld documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Judge Fizzano Cannon did not participate in the decision of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   AND NOW, this\n   <em>\n    31\n    <sup>\n     st\n    </sup>\n   </em>\n   day of\n   <em>\n    May\n   </em>\n   , 2018, the Final Determinations of the Pennsylvania Office of Open Records (OOR), dated February 23, 2017, at OOR Docket No. AP 2017-0146, and April 3, 2017, at OOR Docket No. AP 2017-0408, are AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Act of February 14, 2008, P.L. 6, 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.101 -67.3104.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Section 513 of the Procurement Code governs competitive sealed proposals. 62 Pa.
