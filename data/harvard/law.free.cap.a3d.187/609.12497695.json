The LLCs argue that the court erred by determining that the Sensible Transportation Policy Act (STPA), 23 M.R.S. \u00a7 73 (2017), affords them no private right of action. We affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 2] On February 14, 2017, the LLCs-four entities that own property in Wiscasset-instituted the present litigation in the Superior Court (Lincoln County)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   against the Department, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief regarding the \"Wiscasset Downtown Improvement Project\" (the Project) for the widening and alteration of Route 1/Main Street in Wiscasset.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   By amended complaint, the LLCs advanced nine counts claiming that the Department violated various constitutional, statutory, regulatory, and municipal provisions in planning and designing the Project. In particular, in Count 1, the LLCs alleged that the Department violated the STPA by failing to allow public participation in the planning and design of the Project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 3] The Department moved for a judgment on the pleadings pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 12(c), arguing that the complaint was nonjusticiable on a variety of grounds. By judgment dated September 11, 2017, the court granted the motion and entered a judgment on the pleadings in favor of the\n   Department on all counts. As to Count 1, the court concluded that the STPA affords no private right of action and that the LLCs were therefore precluded from seeking relief on that basis. The LLCs appeal from the denial of their motion for reconsideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 4] The LLCs challenge only that portion of the court's judgment determining that the STPA affords them no private right of action and entering a judgment on the pleadings as to Count 1 on that basis. When, as here, a motion for a judgment on the pleadings is filed by the defendant pursuant to M.R. Civ.

In short, the STPA has six primary components: it lists a series of \"[p]urposes and findings\" regarding transportation decisions; sets out seven policies to be integrated into transportation decisions; and requires the Department to adopt rules to implement the transportation policy, comply with the transportation policy and the rules implementing that policy, establish a priority system for state highway improvements, and report to the Legislature on a biennial basis regarding its progress and plans in meeting those goals. 23 M.R.S. \u00a7 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b6 9] As the LLCs concede, the plain language of the STPA unambiguously provides for no express private right of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The LLCs argue, however, that a private right of action is instead implied by the STPA. We discern nothing in the language of the STPA that implies the creation of a private right of action. Contrary to the LLCs' suggestion, the mere presence of the words \"must\" and \"shall\" in a statute does not mean that a private right of action exists to enforce it. In\n   <em>\n    Larrabee\n   </em>\n   , for example, one of the statutes at issue provided that \"[a]n employer shall\" complete certain acts or else be \"subject to a forfeiture of not less than $50 nor more than $500.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7908873\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/486/97/#p101\">\n    486 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   101 &amp; n.6 (quotation marks omitted).

They offer no authority for the proposition that a statute is a nullity unless it provides for a private right of action, however, and indeed, the STPA is similar in effect to numerous other statutory provisions that set out broad policy objectives,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 1 M.R.S. \u00a7 401 (2017) ; 9-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1-102(2) (2017) ; 18-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1-102(b) (2017) ; 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4050 (2017), or require an entity to promulgate rules and regulations to further effectuate statutory objectives,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 4 M.R.S. \u00a7 198 (2017) ; 10 M.R.S. \u00a7 2369 (2017) ; 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 2124 (2017) ; 32 M.R.S. \u00a7 13722 (2017). That the STPA contains few or no particularities on how its broad transportation goals and policies are to be executed also indicates that it was not intended to afford any private right of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barbuto v.

In 1991, \"An Act to Deauthorize the Widening of the Maine Turnpike and to Create a Sensible Transportation Policy\" was first presented to the Legislature. L.D. 719 (115th Legis. 1991). The bill proposed the enactment of the STPA as well as the amendment of several other existing statutes within title 23. L.D. 719 (referred to the voters, 115th Legis. 1991). The Legislature declined to enact it, 1 Legis. Rec. H-751 (1st Reg. Sess. 1991); 3 Legis. Rec. S-801 (1st Reg. Sess. 1991), and the statute was eventually enacted by citizen initiative\n   on November 5, 1991.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   I.B. 1991, ch. 1, \u00a7 1 (effective Dec. 20, 1991); L.D. 719 (referred to the voters, 115th Legis. 1991);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Me.

The Statement of Fact accompanying the legislation stated as much in declaring that the legislation would \"ensure that transportation decisions and the substantial commitments of public funds resulting from them are made in the context of a comprehensive, statewide transportation policy\"; deauthorize the widening of the Maine Turnpike between Exits 1 and 6-A; require the Turnpike Authority to obtain the Legislature's approval for any widening or expansion of the Turnpike;\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   require the Turnpike Authority to transfer surplus funds to the Department; and make the Turnpike Authority's budget and expenditures subject to Legislative approval.

It is notable in this regard that every portion of the bill except the one enacting the STPA worked amendments to title 23, chapter 24, the chapter dedicated to the Maine Turnpike.
