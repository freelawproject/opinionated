Stevens, Esquire, and Bruce Haines (Objectors) appeal from an Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County (trial court), which dismissed Objectors' appeal and affirmed a decision by the City of Bethlehem Zoning Hearing Board (ZHB) to grant a use variance to Morning Star Partners, LLC (Applicant). The trial court found that prior zoning decisions involving the same property did not bar Applicant from seeking this variance under the doctrines of res judicata or collateral estoppel. Moreover, the trial court found that Applicant established the necessary requirements for a use variance, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the existence of a hardship that was not self-imposed. We agree that res judicata and collateral estoppel do not bar this action. However, Applicant did not show the currently conforming single-family dwelling could not continue to be used as such, and, in the absence of evidence of an unnecessary hardship, we must reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This zoning appeal involves property located at 2 West Market Street, Bethlehem, Northampton County, Pennsylvania (Property).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Property measures 0.198 acres, or approximately 8276 square feet. It contains a large single-family residence located on the corner of West Market and New Streets; two smaller buildings that are connected, fronting New Street, which house retail space on the first floor and an apartment on the second floor; and a detached garage with an apartment above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Property is located in the RT-Residential Zoning District, which is high density residential. Retail is not a permitted use in the district, but because the retail uses predate the local zoning ordinance (Ordinance), they are considered lawful nonconforming uses. In addition, the lot size itself is also nonconforming. The minimum lot size for the existing uses on the Property is 15,500 square feet. The Property is adjacent to a commercial district on the north, and nearby are a Verizon store, a law office, the Moravian Academy, the Glemser office building, the Bethlehem Inn, a cemetery, and a mix of residential and commercial uses on Market Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Applicant purchased the Property with the intent of using it for its financial services office, which is a commercial use not permitted in the zoning district. To accomplish its goal, Applicant sought zoning relief on a number of occasions. Its first two attempts were unsuccessful. Because those attempts form the basis of Objectors' res judicata or collateral estoppel argument with the most recent zoning relief application, we briefly recount that history now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Prior Applications\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Applicant first sought a special exception and/or variance in 2013 (2013 Application).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, Applicant proposed converting the single-family residence into an office and maintaining the two retail spaces. (Nov. 27, 2013 ZHB Decision, Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 10a.) Applicant requested a special exception under Article 1304.04 of the Ordinance, entitled \"Reuse of Corner Commercial Uses,\" which was denied because the single-family residence did not qualify as the primary building with an existing storefront character. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Applicant alternately requested a use variance under Article 1325.06 of the Ordinance, which was also denied. The ZHB found Applicant did not meet its burden of showing a hardship. The ZHB noted the Property was only on the market for four months, undercutting a realtor's testimony that selling the Property is challenging because of its mixed use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13a.) The ZHB also found inadequate Applicant's explanation as to why the residence, which was a conforming use, could not remain residential. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It found that Applicant wanted to maximize profitable uses of the Property, which was insufficient for a variance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Applicant appealed the denial of its 2013 Application to the trial court, which affirmed. (May 20, 2014 Trial Ct. Opinion (Op.), R.R. at 28a-36a.) On appeal to our Court, we similarly affirmed denial of the variance.\n   <em>\n    Schadt v. City of Bethlehem Zoning Hearing Bd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6857769\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/119/439/6857769/\">\n    119 A.3d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015). This Court found that Applicant did not demonstrate an unnecessary hardship, noting that the single-family dwelling was used as a residence for more than a century.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6857769\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/119/439/6857769/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6857769\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/119/439/6857769/\">\n    at 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This, we held, \"belies the claim that the property cannot be used without a variance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6857769\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/119/439/6857769/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We also rejected Applicant's claim that the presence of the nonconforming retail spaces constitutes a unique physical condition that prevents use of the Property in conformance with the Ordinance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6857769\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/119/439/6857769/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6857769\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/119/439/6857769/\">\n    at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We echoed the trial court by saying that Applicant was not \"entitled to make the property\n   <strong>\n    more\n   </strong>\n   nonconforming by virtue of the existing non-conformance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6857769\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/119/439/6857769/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In April 2014, while the appeals were pending, Applicant submitted a second application (2014 Application), this time seeking a use variance and a dimensional variance. The ZHB denied the 2014 Application on the grounds of res judicata. (June 6, 2014 ZHB Decision, R.R. at 18a-26a.) This decision was not appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Present Application\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2016, Applicant submitted its third zoning application (2016 Application), which is the subject of this appeal. In the 2016 Application, it sought a special exception for the change of one nonconforming use to another or, in the alternative, a use variance to convert the existing residence and retail building into offices and one apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At a hearing on the 2016 Application, the Zoning Officer testified that this was\n   the first time the Applicant was before the ZHB for a proposed single-residential use and single-office use. She testified that the minimum square footage for the proposed uses under the Ordinance still exceeded the Property's lot size-9500 square feet (minimum) versus 8276 square feet (actual). Therefore, the proposed use would reduce the size of the lot nonconformity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Applicant's Engineer also testified at the hearing as to the specifics of the Property and the proposed use, as well as the adjacent uses. Because the retail space is less than 10 feet from the residence, according to Engineer, the Property cannot be subdivided. Engineer testified that under the plan, \"two uses [are] replacing five.\" (Hr'g Tr., Supplemental Reproduced Record (S.R.R.) at 24b.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Applicant also presented a pre-construction services witness (Contractor), who testified as to the scope and cost of renovations. Contractor explained the exterior of the residence would be unchanged to maintain its residential character. The residence would be painted, a wheelchair ramp installed, a porch reconstructed, sidewalks repaired, and landscaping completed. All changes would meet applicable Historic District guidelines. Interiorly, the first floor kitchen would be removed and replaced with a kitchenette. The front door and bathrooms would be made ADA-compliant. The second floor would have walls removed to allow for the creation of five offices. The third floor attic would also be renovated. Renovations would also be made to the buildings housing the retail space and the studio apartment above the garage. Total cost for renovations is approximately $722,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On cross-examination, Contractor acknowledged that the current nonconforming retail spaces \"[p]robably\" could be converted into residential space for the same amount. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69b.) When asked by a ZHB member what the extent of the renovations would be in order to maintain the single-family house as a residential unit, Contractor responded: \"If that were a residential [unit], somebody were to buy it as a house, we believe they would have to invest another $225,000 into the property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73b.) The retail buildings are \"prime candidates for razing,\" but Contractor acknowledged that given their historic nature, obtaining approval to do so would be difficult. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75b-78b.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A commercial loan officer also testified that financing was difficult to obtain because of the Property's mixed uses. A partner at Applicant testified the financial services office would have 14 employees, 11 of whom would be full-time and 3 of whom would be part-time. Only one to two clients would visit the office each day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Office hours would be Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. There would be no signage, except for an address plate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In addition, at the hearing, a number of Objectors testified in opposition to the project and a number of residents and business owners testified in support of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. ZHB Decision\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following the hearing, the ZHB voted 4-0 to deny the special exception request. The ZHB rejected Applicant's argument that the entire Property was nonconforming,\n   instead finding that only the two retail spaces were nonconforming. (July 15, 2016 ZHB Decision at 6-7.) It also rejected Applicant's argument that the dimensional nonconformities do not render the entire Property nonconforming. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Thus, the proposal did not involve a change from one nonconforming use to another.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The ZHB, however, voted 3-1 to grant the use variance under Article 1325.06 of the Ordinance, subject to certain conditions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ZHB found Applicant satisfied its burden of proof. With regard to the hardship element, the ZHB found the following physical hardships existed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 The Property is less than 9,000 [square feet] in area but contains a single-family residence, a garage with a second story apartment, and a third building with two retail units on the first floor and an apartment on the second floor. There is an existing parking area and little outdoor space to serve a residential use.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 The home on the Property dates to 1840 and is in need of significant renovation irrespective of whether the use is commercial or residential in nature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 The retail building dates to 1820 and is a former Moravian brass foundry. Applicant's expert testified that, in his opinion, it would be unlikely that the approvals necessary to raze that building to create open space on the lot to serve the residents and to remove the commercial component of the property would be approved, due to the historic nature of the building.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Converting the first floor of the retail building to residential use is difficult.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 The Property is located in an area that is mixed in character, with a significant presence of offices and institutional use. (While a majority of the offices are in an adjacent zoning district that permits commercial use, some of those offices are not.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 Because of the mixed use character of the Property, any sale of the Property would require a purchaser to obtain a commercial not residential mortgage on the lesser favorable terms associated with a commercial mortgage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 By reducing the number of uses on the Property, the nonconforming nature of the area of the lot is decreased, since the existing uses would require a larger lot area than the proposed uses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The ZHB further found that the \"proposed use is in harmony with the purpose and intent of the Zoning Ordinance and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) In support, it cited one resident's testimony that the proposed use is more beneficial than converting the residence to a seven- or eight-unit, multi-family use, which would be permitted under\n   the Ordinance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The ZHB called the Property \"unique\" in that it is a combination of residential use and commercial use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This uniqueness, the ZHB found, reduces the desirability of the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) According to the ZHB, the hardship is not general and shared by neighboring properties because those properties do not have the same combination of residential and commercial buildings dating back to the 1800s. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The ZHB concluded that a use variance would be the minimum required, and the proposed use is a reasonable use of the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, the ZHB found \"[t]here is no rule of law that would justify requiring a property owner to abandon the use of the commercial building on the Property,\" and that requiring the Property to be converted entirely to residential would result in a need to raze the commercial structure or leave its first floor vacant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Trial Court Decision\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Objectors appealed to the trial court, which did not take additional evidence. The trial court dismissed Objectors' appeal and affirmed the ZHB's decision. Before the trial court, Objectors raised the same issues they raise now. The trial court found res judicata and collateral estoppel did not bar the 2016 Application. The trial court found that \"[w]hile the 2013 [Application] involved the same [P]roperty and the same parties, and the request set forth in the [2016 A]pplication is similar, it is not the same, in that [Applicant] requested a special exception under a different article of the Ordinance ... and ... made a different request for relief.\" (June 14, 2017 Trial Ct. Op. at 9.) The trial court stated that Applicant now seeks to reduce the number of commercial spaces from two to one and maintain the residential space, whereas the 2013 Application sought three commercial spaces and no residential spaces.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The trial court also rejected Objectors' arguments concerning hardship, finding that case law did not support Objectors' claim that Applicant's purchase of the property with knowledge of the zoning restrictions resulted in a self-inflicted hardship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) The trial court also rejected Objectors' claim that Applicant failed to establish that the Property could not be developed in the absence of a variance or that the variance was the minimum required to afford relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) The trial court quoted\n   <em>\n    Marshall v. City of Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4254364\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/626/385/\">\n    626 Pa. 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6924546,4254364\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/97/323/\">\n    97 A.3d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), for the proposition that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   a zoning board's discretion is not so circumscribed as to require a property owner to reconstruct a building to a conforming use regardless of the financial burden that would be incident thereto. Especially is this true where the change sought is from one nonconforming use to another more desirable nonconforming use that will not adversely affect but better the neighborhood. Thus, economic factors are relevant, albeit not determinative, in a variance assessment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (June 14, 2017 Trial Ct. Op. at 12-13 (internal citations omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6924546,4254364\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/97/323/\">\n    97 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   330-31 ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The trial court stated that while the ZHB acknowledged that the Property could be converted entirely to residential in conformity with the Ordinance and such a change would not be cost prohibitive, the ZHB also recognized that denying the variance \"would belie the landowner's right,\n   running with the land, to continue a legal non[ ]conforming use.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) The trial court further concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   that the reduction in the non[ ]conformity of the [P]roperty, coupled with evidence that the proposed use would bring a very small number of visitors to the [P]roperty, would not require signage or parking relief, no exterior changes would be made to the residence to diminish its residential character, and it was not likely that any change of use would be readily apparent from the outside of the premises, resulted in the Board properly granting the required variance based upon substantial evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Objectors timely appealed to this Court. On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Objectors argue\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   that Applicant's most recent request for zoning relief is barred by the doctrine of res judicata and/or collateral estoppel based upon prior litigation involving earlier zoning requests concerning the same Property. Objectors note that there has been no physical change in the Property that would entitle Applicant to relief. Further, Objectors point out that this Court previously decided there was no hardship. Assuming the Court reaches the merits, Objectors argue the evidence presented at the most recent hearing does not establish a hardship, and even if one is found, it is self-inflicted. They argue that the evidence shows the Property can be used for a permitted use-a single-family residence-with less expensive renovations than the proposed nonconforming office use would require. Objectors claim Applicant knew of the zoning impediment when it purchased the Property and any claimed economic hardship is the result of Applicant's own desire to convert the Property from a residence to a commercial office use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Applicant argues\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   that res judicata and/or collateral estoppel do not apply because it is seeking relief for a different use and is proceeding under a different theory than the 2013 Application. It also argues that nonconformity is recognized as an unnecessary hardship as a matter of law, and thus, the ZHB did not abuse its discretion or commit an error of law in concluding that the nonconforming use at the Property constitutes an unnecessary hardship depriving Applicant of the Property's reasonable use. Finally, it points out that the ZHB did not find the cost of renovation to be a hardship. Thus, Objectors' argument of a self-inflicted hardship is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We will address Objectors' issues in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

We explained, in the first application, the applicants sought a variance to use their property for three dwelling units, whereas, in the subsequent application, the applicants sought to use the property for only two dwelling units and also sought to avoid the side yard, lot size, and parking requirements. Thus, the relief sought in each application was not identical, and res judicata did not apply.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=479%20A.2d%2071\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=479%20A.2d%2071\">\n    at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On the other hand, when the request is identical, we have held the doctrines of res judicata and/or collateral estoppel apply.

Variance\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We next determine whether Applicant has met the requirements for a use variance. Article 1317.28 of the Ordinance provides that an applicant may request a variance if compliance with the Ordinance would result in an exceptional hardship. The Ordinance further provides that in order to grant a variance, the ZHB must find:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (1) There are unique physical circumstances or conditions (including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of the lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property) and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this Ordinance in the neighborhood or\n   district in which the property is located;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (2) Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and a Variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (3) Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (4) The Variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (5) The Variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Ordinance, Art. 1325.06(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   A property owner seeking a variance bears a heavy burden.\n   <em>\n    Society Created to Reduce Urban Blight v.

Cmwlth. 2011) (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Here, the ZHB found a number of physical hardships existed because of the unique nature of the Property. Despite its small square footage, the Property contains a single-family residence, a garage with a second-story apartment, and a third building with two retail units on the first floor and an apartment on the second floor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (July 15, 2016 ZHB Decision at 9.) The structures, combined with an existing parking area, leave little open space to serve a residential use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result of the mixed character of the Property, only commercial mortgages, which offer less favorable terms, would be available. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) In addition, the structures are historic, making needed renovations significant and razing virtually impossible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) Based upon these findings, we agree that the unique physical characteristics of the Property are not common to the general area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   To be entitled to a use variance, Applicant must also show that there is no possibility of developing the Property in strict conformity with the Ordinance, such that a variance is required to enable its\n   reasonable use. Objectors argue the evidence shows that the Property can be completely converted into a single-dwelling residence, thereby eliminating any nonconformity-dimensional or otherwise. The ZHB, however, credited the Applicant's evidence that requiring the Property to be entirely residential would result in the need to either raze the retail spaces or leave that space vacant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) This finding supports the conclusion that the Property cannot reasonably be used\n   <strong>\n    solely\n   </strong>\n   as a residential property. In order to become fully compliant with the Ordinance, Applicant would have to abandon its lawfully existing, nonconforming use. Like the ZHB and trial court, we find no support for forcing Applicant to convert lawful, nonconforming uses into a residential, conforming one. \"We recognize our courts 'have never required demolition of a legally non[ ]conforming structure to afford the opportunity to bring the property into compliance with the relevant zoning code.' \"\n   <em>\n    Demko v.

Moreover, as Objectors point out, Applicant wants to do this at significantly greater cost than maintaining the conforming single-family dwelling as residential. The ZHB acknowledged that the house can still be used as a residence, including a multi-family residence as of right under the Ordinance; yet it concluded using it as commercial office space was more desirous.
