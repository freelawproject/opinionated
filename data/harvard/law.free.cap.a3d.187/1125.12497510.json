The District 5 Commission denied Korrow Real Estate, LLC's as-built application for an Act 250 permit to construct a barn on property alongside the Dog and Stony Brook Rivers, finding the project failed to comply with Act 250 Criteria 1(D) and 1(F). In doing so, the Commission construed key terms as defined by the Agency of Natural Resources (ANR). On appeal, the Environmental Division reversed the decision and remanded the matter to the Commission with instructions to grant an as-built permit for the project. The Vermont Natural Resources Board now appeals the court's decision, asserting that the court failed to accord proper deference to the ANR's statutory authority and expertise, and that the project fails to comply with the necessary Act 250 permitting criteria. We affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2. By way of background, appellee, Korrow Real Estate, LLC (Korrow), owns properties off Vermont Route 12A in the Town of Northfield, on either side of Stony Brook Road. On the northerly side of Stony Brook Road is an improved parcel of land that hosts offices for Gillespie Fuels and Propane, a business related to Korrow. In 2011, Korrow began constructing a large barn on a parcel of land on the southerly side of Stony Brook Road. Korrow intended to use the barn to house Gillespie propane trucks. As built, the barn is roughly 8000 square feet, and sits at the confluence of the Dog River and the Stony Brook River. After the project was complete\n   in the summer of 2012, Korrow brought dry pack onto the property to level the parking area inside the barn. Korrow also brought a small amount of earthen fill to level areas outside the barn. Portions of this fill were placed in proximity to the nearby rivers. Prior to building the barn and bringing in the fill, Korrow sought and received a municipal zoning permit. However, Korrow constructed these improvements without first obtaining an Act 250 permit, which is required for development of this kind. It was not asserted this omission was intentional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. In 1970, the Vermont Legislature passed Act 250 to protect and conserve Vermont's lands and environment, and to ensure that land use would not be detrimental to the public welfare and interests. 1969, No. 250 (Adj. Sess.) \u00a7 1; see generally 10 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 6001 - 6111. Act 250 requires a land-use permit before certain development can occur. 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6081(a) (\"No person shall ... commence development without a permit.\"). \"Development\" means, in relevant part, \"[t]he construction of improvements for commercial or industrial purposes on more than one acre of land within a municipality that has not adopted permanent zoning and subdivision bylaws.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6001(3)(A)(ii). Korrow's project is a \"development\" subject to Act 250 because it is a commercial project constructed on a 6.5-acre parcel in a municipality that has not adopted permanent zoning and subdivision bylaws. As such, the Korrow project requires an Act 250 permit to remain as built on the property site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4. When Act 250 applies to development, a permit can only issue if the project complies with all ten Act 250 criteria.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6086(a)(1) (outlining conditions and criteria necessary for project development). These criteria specifically address development on or near waterways and rivers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On appeal, the parties dispute whether the Korrow project complies with Act 250 Criterion 1(D), pertaining to development within the \"floodway\" and \"floodway fringe\" of nearby waters, and Criterion 1(F), pertaining to development on \"shorelines.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(D), (F). These provisions of Act 250 aim to protect Vermonters from the hazards of flooding and erosion, and to preserve the scenic and recreational features of rivers and their shorelines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   An applicant for an Act 250 permit, such as Korrow, bears the burden of proving compliance with both Criterion 1(D) and Criterion 1(F).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6088(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5. To determine project compliance with Criterion 1(D), the threshold question is whether the project is in the \"floodway\" or \"floodway fringe\" of a nearby waterway; if it is, then the applicant must prove that the project will not \"restrict or divert the flow of flood waters,\" and \"significantly increase the peak discharge of the river,\" and \"endanger the health, safety and welfare of the public or of riparian owners during flooding.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(D)(i), (ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. Similarly, Criterion 1(F) requires a threshold determination as to whether the project is located on a \"shoreline.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(F). If so, shoreline development \"must of necessity be located on a shoreline\" and must be conducted in a manner that \"will, insofar as possible and reasonable\": (1) retain shorelines and waters \"in their natural condition\"; (2) allow continued and recreational access to the waters; (3) provide screening between the development and the river; and (4) \"stabilize the bank from erosion, as necessary, with vegetation cover.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(F)(i)-(iv).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. Act 250 provides definitions for the terms \"floodway, \"floodway fringe,\" and \"shoreline\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (6) \"Floodway\" means the channel of a watercourse which is expected to flood on an average of at least once every 100 years and the adjacent land areas which are required to carry and discharge the flood of the watercourse,\n   <em>\n    as determined by the Secretary of Natural Resources\n   </em>\n   with full consideration given to upstream impoundments and flood control projects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (7) \"Floodway fringe\" means an area which is outside a floodway and is flooded with an average frequency of once or more in each 100 years\n   <em>\n    as determined by the Secretary of Natural Resources\n   </em>\n   with full consideration given to upstream impoundments and flood control projects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (17) \"Shoreline\" means the land adjacent to the waters of lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and rivers. Shorelines shall include the land between the mean high water mark and the mean low water mark of such surface waters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6001(6), (7), (17) (emphases added). These provisions expressly grant the ANR authority to define the scope of the \"floodway\" and \"floodway fringe.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6001(6), (7). If the ANR determines that a project falls within the \"floodway\" or \"floodway fringe,\" then the project must also comply with additional Criterion 1(D) specifications to receive permit approval. 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(D)(i)-(ii) (requiring project will not \"restrict or divert the flow of flood waters,\" and \"significantly increase the peak discharge of the river,\" and \"endanger the health, safety and welfare of the public or of riparian owners during flooding\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 8. The Natural Resources Board (NRB) has statutory authority to adopt rules pertaining to Act 250 permit applications. 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6025(b) (\"The Board may adopt substantive rules ... that establish criteria under which applications for permits under this chapter may be classified in terms of complexity and significance of impact under the standards of subsection 6086(a) of this chapter.\"). The NRB has adopted such a rule defining \"shoreline\" for the purpose of determining compliance with Criterion 1(F). Act 250 Rules, Rule 2(C)(20), http://nrb.vermont.gov/sites/nrb/files/documents/2015%20Adopted%20Rules.pdf [https://perma.cc/4G79-LLZY] [hereinafter NRB Rule]. NRB Rule 2(C)(20) defines \"shoreline\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   For purposes of 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(F), a project involves the \"\n   <em>\n    development or subdivision of shorelines\n   </em>\n   ,\" if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (a) the project involves construction on or the use of \"the land between the mean high water mark and the mean low water mark of such surface waters.\" 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6001(17), or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (b) the project, or an element of the project which is adjacent to the shoreline, has the potential for significant impact on any of the sub criteria specified in 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(F)(i)-(iv).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 9. With these definitions in mind, we return to Korrow's application to the District Commission for an as-built Act 250 permit. Applications for an Act 250 permit are filed with the District Commission to determine compliance with Act 250 criteria, including Criterion 1(D) and Criterion 1(F) discussed above. 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6083(a) (\"An application for a permit shall be filed with the District Commission as prescribed by the rules of the [Natural Resources] Board ....\"). In the application at issue, Korrow indicated the project involved \"development or subdivision on or near a river, lake, pond or reservoir shoreline.\" The Commission heard testimony from an ANR expert regarding the project's potential impacts on the Dog and\n   Stony Brook Rivers, and evaluated the project's compliance with Act 250 Criteria 1(D) and 1(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 10. Regarding Criterion 1(D), the ANR calculated the scope of the \"floodway\" and \"floodway fringe\" and determined that the Korrow project fell within the Act 250 \"floodway.\" To calculate the scope of the \"floodway,\" the ANR adhered to its \"Technical Guidance for Determining Floodway Limits Pursuant to Act 250 Criterion 1(D).\" Agency of Nat. Res., Technical Guidance for Determining Floodway Limits Pursuant to Act 250 Criterion 1(D) (October 9, 2009), http://www.docket7970.com/ANR/Attachment%20A.ANR.VGS.RTP.1-3%20(Nelson)/VT%20Technical%20Guidance%20for%20Determining%20Floodway%20Limits%20Pursuant%20to%20Act%20250%20Criterion%201(D).pdf [https://perma.cc/3YXE-NQAL]. These guidelines, originally issued in 2003, were updated in 2009 to \"enhance understanding of the ANR Floodway Procedure\" and ensure \"clear, consistent, and broadly accepted [ANR] floodway determinations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. The document is public and provides general background on how the ANR determines the \"floodway\" and \"floodway fringe\" when considering Criterion 1(D). The guidelines recognize the role of erosion hazards in defining the Act 250 \"floodway,\" and require the ANR to \"consider both inundation and fluvial erosion hazards ... in the Act 250 regulatory process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The ANR has stated that the guidelines' procedure for determining the Act 250 \"floodway\" surrounding an area \"strikes an acceptable balance between having a consistent set of guidelines to reduce inundation and erosion hazards while allowing consideration of existing and future development ... [and] remaining consistent with the science-based stream equilibrium objective.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 11. The guidelines state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   For the purpose of determining the inundation floodway under 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6001(6), and the impacts of a project built in a floodway under Criterion 1(D), Agency technical staff will consider the regulatory floodway as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and [the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) ] regulatory standards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The guidelines clarify that the ANR may separately assess the geomorphology and erosion hazards of a project site to determine the \"fluvial erosion hazard\" (FEH) area. The ANR may also conclude that the FEH area applies \"to lands that lie outside\" the NFIP and FEMA designations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Since publishing the updated guidelines in 2009, the ANR has also issued a \"River Corridor Protection Guide,\" which provides a more detailed description of the methodology and data used to create the ANR FEH area. Both of these guidelines are instructive in understanding how the ANR calculates the FEH area for a project. Notably, the FEH area can be within, or less wide, than the inundation area mapped by the NFIP or FEMA, or it can be broader. \"Upon comparison\" of these measurements-the ANR's assessment of the FEH area and the NFIP/FEMA designated area-\"the Act 250 floodway limit shall be whichever laterally extends further from the stream.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Thus, the guidelines permit the ANR to expand the scope of the Act 250 \"floodway\" to align with the FEH area-even if the FEH area is broader than the NFIP or FEMA measurements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 12. Pursuant to these guidelines, the ANR construes the Act 250 \"floodway\" as encompassing the agency's assessment of the FEH area, the NFIP-mapped areas, and FEMA-designated portions of the Special Flood Hazard Area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 13. This construction by the ANR was critical to evaluating whether the Korrow project was within the Act 250 \"floodway.\" Here, the ANR determined that \"[m]uch of the existing barn, fill, and proposed drainage ... are located within the Act 250 Floodway\" because these portions of the project were constructed within the ANR's FEH area. The ANR determined the project was within the FEH area based on a geomorphic assessment of the project area, the project's proximity to the Dog and Stony Brook Rivers, and the potential for physical adjustments in the area. As noted above, the guidelines allow the Act 250 \"floodway\" to expand to match the ANR's definition of the FEH area. Therefore, although the barn was located outside the NFIP-mapped area and the FEMA-designated area, the Korrow project was within the ANR's FEH area, and thereby within the Act 250 \"floodway.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6001(6). After making the preliminary finding that the project was within the \"floodway,\" the Commission assessed project compliance with \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(D)(i)-(ii), and determined the project could not meet the Criterion 1(D) requirements as built. The Commission ordered that the project be removed and relocated to comply with Criterion 1(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 14. The Commission reached a similar conclusion regarding Criterion 1(F). Based on recommendations from the ANR and the Department of Fish and Wildlife regarding the preservation of riparian buffers-naturally vegetated areas bordering waterways-along the Dog River and Stony Brook River, the Commission found the Project was located on a \"shoreline,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6001(17), and required that the project be removed and relocated to comply with Criterion 1(F).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(F). Korrow appealed the Commission's order to the Environmental Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 15. While recognizing the deferential standard generally applied to agency interpretations of statutory provisions within their area of expertise, the Environmental Division found the ANR's construction of the \"floodway\" to be unreasonable in light of the project location and testimony presented at the evidentiary hearing. The court determined the project was not within a \"floodway.\" Despite this determination, the court made additional findings that the project would not cause the adverse impacts for development within a floodway prohibited by Criterion 1(D) even if the project was within the floodway. The court also found that the project was not constructed on a \"shoreline\" and complied with the criteria listed in 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(F)(i)-(iv). Ultimately, the court found that the project complied with Criteria 1(D) and 1(F), reversed the Commission's determinations, and remanded the proceedings to the Commission to issue Korrow's as-built Act 250 permit. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 16. On appeal, we address two issues: (1) whether the Korrow project complies with Act 250 Criterion 1(D), pertaining to the project's impact on the \"floodway\" and the \"floodway fringe\"; and (2) whether the project complies with Criterion 1(F), pertaining to development on a \"shoreline.\" 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(D), (F). The parties dispute whether the ANR appropriately calculated the scope of the \"floodway\" and \"floodway fringe\"; to what extent the court should defer to the ANR's definition of these terms; and whether the project was constructed on a shoreline and, if so, whether the construction \"of necessity\" occurred on the shoreline. We consider project compliance with Criteria 1(D) and 1(F) below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   II. Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 17. We review the court's factual findings for clear error and its findings\n   of law de novo.\n   <em>\n    In re Vill. Assocs.

Thus, we review the court's findings of fact-whether the project was within a \"floodway\" and/or on a \"shoreline\"-for clear error, and its legal conclusions-whether the project complied with Criteria 1(D) and 1(F) in light of its placement-de novo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   III. Project's Compliance with Criterion 1(D)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 19. Act 250 Criterion 1(D) requires applicants who are proposing project development within the \"floodway\" or the \"floodway fringe\" of a body of water to demonstrate compliance with certain requirements. See 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(D)(i) (explaining that applicant must show development within floodway \"will not restrict or divert the flow of flood waters, and endanger the health, safety and welfare of the public or of riparian owners during flooding\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787169\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/199/538/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(D)(ii) (explaining that applicant must demonstrate development within floodway fringe \"will not significantly increase the peak discharge of the river or stream within or downstream from the area of development and endanger the health, safety, or welfare of the public or riparian owners during flooding\").

Notably, the ANR has specific statutory authority to determine the area comprising a \"floodway\" or \"floodway fringe\" pursuant to 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6001(6) and (7), and thus whether a project falls within those areas.

Even though the court erroneously found that the project was located outside the \"floodway,\" there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that the project complied with Criterion 1(D). The court based this conclusion on \"undisputed evidence at trial,\" which was put into context for the court by a site visit conducted prior to trial, that the Korrow project was on \"a significant upward slope\" and therefore would not restrict or divert floodwater movement in a manner that would endanger others. The court found that \"the land rises\" from a \"relatively flat area beside the river\" up to the Korrow property. Witnesses at trial further testified that the Korrow parcel had not flooded in the past fifty years, despite significant storms that have caused recent flooding in the area, such as Tropical Storm Irene in 2011. One witness, who lives downstream from the project, expressly stated that the barn did not \"endanger\" his safety due to the project's location:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [Attorney:] Q.

Our first task is to clarify the definition of \"shoreline.\" Act 250 provision \u00a7 6001(17) defines \"shoreline\" as \"the land\n   <em>\n    adjacent\n   </em>\n   to the waters of lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and rivers. Shorelines shall include the land between the mean high water mark and the mean low water mark of such surface waters.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=998%20A.2d%20712\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6001(17) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Legislature also authorized the NRB to adopt additional rules interpreting Act 250 provisions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=998%20A.2d%20712\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6025(b). Pursuant to this enabling language, the NRB adopted rules which provide further interpretation of \"shoreline.\" NRB Rule 2(C)(20) specifies that \"[f]or purposes of 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(F), a project involves the 'development or subdivision of shorelines' \" if: \"(a) the project involves construction on or the use of 'the land between the mean high water mark and the mean low water mark of such surface waters,' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   or \"(b) the project, or an element of the project which is\n   <em>\n    adjacent\n   </em>\n   to the shoreline, has the potential for significant impact on any of the subcriteria specified in 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(F)(i)-(iv).\" NRB Rule 2(C)(20)(a), (b) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 32. Under the definitions of \"shoreline\" provided in \u00a7 6001(17) and NRB Rule 2(C)(20), a project constructed on land \"adjacent\" to a river is on a \"shoreline,\" and it will be subject to the stringent requirements\n   of \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(F). Thus, determining whether the Korrow project is \"adjacent\" to the Dog and Stony Brook Rivers is essential to finding whether the project is or is not on a shoreline and whether further analysis regarding project compliance with Criterion 1(F) is necessary. With this in mind, we turn to two remaining questions: (1) whether the Korrow project is on a \"shoreline\" pursuant to the definitions provided in \u00a7 6001(17) and NRB Rule 2(C)(20); and (2) if so, whether the project complies with Criterion 1(F), \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 33. Whether the Korrow project is on a \"shoreline\" is a finding of fact that this Court reviews for clear error. The court's determination will stand unless there is \"no credible evidence that a reasonable person would rely upon to support the conclusion[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    Zaremba Group Act 250 Permit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787169\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/199/538/\">\n    2015 VT 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787169\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/199/538/\">\n    199 Vt. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787169\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/199/538/\">\n    127 A.3d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 34. There are two flaws in the court's findings. First, although interpreting the scope of land \"adjacent\" to the rivers is essential to determining whether a project is on a \"shoreline,\" no definition of \"adjacent\" is provided by the trial court. Second, even applying the court's contextual, rather than distance-based, analysis of the project's location in relation to the Dog and Stony Brook Rivers, the court's conclusion that the project was not on the \"shoreline\" is based on insufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 35. First, the court's failure to construe the term \"adjacent\" leaves a hole in the analysis of the issue before us-whether the Korrow project was on a \"shoreline.\" While this Court has not defined \"adjacent\" in the context of an Act 250 proceeding, the Environmental Division has evaluated this term in the context of town zoning bylaws, which restricted project development on public waters.\n   <em>\n    In re Irish Constr.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Application\n   </em>\n   , No. 44-3 -08 Vtec.

The proposed project in\n   <em>\n    Irish Construction Application\n   </em>\n   was eighteen feet from the waterway at issue and was deemed \"adjacent\" to public water for the purposes of the zoning ordinance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 36. In contrast here, the court seems to be applying a functional application of \"adjacent\" by looking to the project's location within the riparian buffers of the Dog and Stony Brook Rivers and evaluating the project's impact on the four Criterion 1(F) subcriteria to determine whether the project is on a \"shoreline.\" Considering the parties do not dispute the definition of \"adjacent\" and the court does not engage with the issue, we decline to sua sponte construe the term here. Rather, we look to the record below to support the court's finding that the project was not on a \"shoreline.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 37. Second, based on the record below, even applying the court's functional, rather than distance-based, application of \"shoreline,\" there was insufficient evidence for the court to determine that the Korrow project was not on a shoreline. The court never clearly defined the scope of the shoreline; instead, the court measured the project's compliance with Criterion 1(F) based on evidence and testimony regarding the project's proximity to the riparian buffers along the Dog and Stony Brook Rivers and its compliance with the four\n   subcriteria outlined in \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(F)(i)-(iv).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 38. Riparian buffers are undeveloped, vegetated areas bordering waterways, which \"are important for [protecting] adjacent waters as well as downstream reaches.\" The ANR recommends that permit conditions require undisturbed, naturally vegetated buffers be maintained along streams, and \"the Department of Fish and Wildlife recommends maintenance of a minimum 50-foot undisturbed riparian buffer along Stony Brook ... [and] a 100-foot minimum undisturbed riparian buffer between the development and the top of the Dog River riverbank.\" The Korrow project placed a small amount of fill within the Stony Brook River's 50-foot buffer during construction. Although the project's \"as-built location\" is \"approximately 130 feet\" from the Dog River, a small amount of fill was also placed within the Dog River's 100-foot buffer during construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 39. The evidence regarding the project's location in relation to riparian buffers between the Korrow project and the rivers does not justify the court's finding that the project was not on a shoreline. To the contrary, this evidence indicates that part of the fill associated with the project was within the riparian buffers of the Dog and Stony Brook Rivers. The court appears to apply the following logic: A project is on a shoreline if it is developed on land adjacent to a river; land is adjacent to a river if it is within the riparian buffer; the project here is only partially within the riparian buffer; therefore, the project is not adjacent to the river and is not on the shoreline. Even if we accept this logic and construe the term \"adjacent\" as synonymous with \"within the riparian buffer,\" as the trial court seems to have done, then the undisputed fact that portions of the project were within the riparian buffers of both rivers and the impact that fact has on the \"shoreline\" determination are not addressed in the court's findings. Thus, the findings are insufficient to determine that the project was not on a shoreline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 40. The court further states that, even if the project was on a shoreline, it complies with the four subcriteria in \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(F)(i)-(iv) and thus meets the shoreline requirements of Act 250. However, the court fails to consider the full requirements of \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(F)(i)-(iv) by not assessing, if the project is within the shoreline, whether the project was \"of necessity\" located within a \"shoreline.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 41. Criterion 1(F) requires the Environmental Division to \"make its own determination that a development need be located on the shoreline.\"\n   <em>\n    In re McShinsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8544061\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/153/586/#p591\">\n    153 Vt. 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 591,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8544061\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/153/586/#p591\">\n    572 A.2d 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 919 (1990).

The court did not do so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 42. Considering the court's failure to adequately define the scope of the \"shoreline\" along the Dog and Stony Brook Rivers, the court's analysis of the project's compliance with Criterion 1(F), even when viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, is insufficient to justify its conclusions. Further, should the project\n   fall within the \"shoreline,\" the court must then further consider whether it must, of necessity, be located there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 43. Based on the record below, we cannot determine whether the project is constructed on a \"shoreline\" as defined in \u00a7 6001(17), an assessment that may or may not require ANR expertise, and, if so, whether the project complies with the subcriteria required by \u00a7 6086(a)(1)(F). As such, the Environmental Division's conclusion that the project complied with Criterion 1(F) is reversed and this issue is remanded to the court for further findings consistent with this opinion.
