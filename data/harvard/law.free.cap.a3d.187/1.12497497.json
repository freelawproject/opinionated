Although the parents do not challenge the court's conclusion that they are unfit within the meaning of 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4055(1)(B)(2)(b) (2017), they contend that the court erred by determining that termination is in the children's best interests,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4055(1)(B)(2)(a) (2017), because the court also ordered a permanency plan that includes either adoption or a permanency guardianship. Given the court's findings regarding the circumstances and best interests of the children, the court did not err by terminating\n   the parents' rights to them while also approving a permanency guardianship as a possible permanency plan. We therefore affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 2] The following facts, which are supported by the evidence, are drawn from the court's judgment and the procedural record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dominyk T.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12349950\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/1065/\">\n    2017 ME 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12349950\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/1065/\">\n    173 A.3d 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 3] The Department of Health and Human Services became involved with this family in January of 2016 when one of the children was rushed to the hospital after suffering seizures. Ultimately, that child and one of the other children were diagnosed with \"failure to thrive\" as a result of the parents' life-threatening failure to feed them adequately. Several weeks after the first child was hospitalized, the Department filed a child protection petition as to all three children, and in late February, the three children were placed with their paternal grandmother pursuant to a safety plan. In April of 2016, with the agreement of the parents, the court entered a jeopardy order placing the children in the Department's custody and ordering that the children continue to live with the grandmother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 4] Both parents have learning disabilities, and the mother also has cognitive impairments and suffers from depression. Neither parent has meaningful insight into the reasons why the children are in foster care, nor has either parent adequately participated in court-ordered diagnostic and therapy services or in their children's doctor appointments. The parents initially missed so many visits that the visits were suspended for a time. When visits eventually resumed, the quality of the parents' interactions with the children was concerning until the last few weeks before the termination hearing, when the visits went better. The parents love their children and want to reunite with them, but their personal difficulties have contributed to their failure to \"understand, let alone provide[,] the steps necessary to foster a home environment that eliminates the threat of jeopardy and support[s] the nurturing and well-being of their children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Since coming to live with the grandmother, the condition of the two children who had failed to thrive improved \"spectacularly,\" and all three children are doing very well in her care. The grandmother supports the parents' continued involvement with the children and is willing to either serve as the children's permanency guardian or adopt them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 6] A year after the children came into its custody, the Department filed a petition to terminate the parents' rights to the children, and in May of 2017, the court held a three-day consolidated hearing on the termination petition and on a permanency plan for the children. The next month, the court issued a judgment terminating both parents' parental rights. The court found by clear and convincing evidence that both parents are unfit because they are unable or unwilling to protect the children from jeopardy and would not do otherwise within a time reasonably calculated to meet the children's needs; they are unwilling or unable to take responsibility for the children within a time reasonably calculated to meet the children's needs; and they did not make a good faith effort to rehabilitate and reunify with the children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4055(1)(B)(2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 7] The court also concluded that termination is in the children's best interests because of the stability and care provided to them by the grandmother as well as her \"tireless\" advocacy for their interests. In making these best interest determinations, the court considered the children's greatly\n   improved condition while in the grandmother's \"excellent care\"; the successful integration of the children into the grandmother's family, which includes four other children; and the grandmother's effectiveness in assisting the parents to \"maintain their attachment to the children\" and her continued willingness to do so. The court also credited the strong support from the children's guardian ad litem for continued placement with the grandmother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 8] In its judgment, the court also established the permanency plan for the children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4038-B (2017). After recognizing the policy found in statutes and case law that favors permanence for children, the court stated that it had \"no difficulty in finding that the plan of either permanency guardianship or adoption is clearly in the best interest of [the children] so that they may have permanency with their paternal grandmother in the stable and nurturing environment where they have been placed during the pendency of this action.\" The court recognized that the grandmother had applied with the Department to be licensed as a foster parent but that the application was denied because of the Department's concerns with the grandmother's domestic partner. The court stated that it was not bound by that administrative decision, however, and found explicitly \"that continued placement with [the grandmother] is in the best interest of these children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 9] Both parents appealed from the termination order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. App. P. 2(b)(3) ; 2(b)(5) (Tower 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 10] On this appeal, the parents do not contest the court's determination that they are unfit as the children's parents. Rather, they challenge only the court's determination that termination is in the children's best interests, given the court's finding that their best interests would also be served if they continued to live with the grandmother as a permanency guardian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 11] Because the predicate of the parents' challenge to the termination order is the permanency plan that would provide for either a permanency guardianship\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   an adoption, the scope of this appeal must be established with clarity. Although an appeal can be taken from a termination order, a permanency plan order is treated by operation of statute as an interlocutory order and is therefore not itself appealable. 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4006 (2017). Consequently, the parents' appeal cannot be used as a vehicle to directly challenge the permanency plan ordered by the court. Rather, the cognizable question presented here is whether one of the necessary predicates to a termination order, namely, that termination is in the best interest of the child,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4055(1)(B)(2)(a), is compatible with a determination that a permanency guardianship also is in the child's best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 12] \"We review the court's factual findings related to the child's best interest for clear error,\"\n   <em>\n    In re Thomas H\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8992397\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/889/297/\">\n    2005 ME 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8992397\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/889/297/\">\n    889 A.2d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and its \"ultimate conclusion [regarding the child's best interest] for an abuse of discretion, viewing the facts, and the weight to be given them, through the trial court's lens,\"\n   <em>\n    In re Cameron B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12324183\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1199/\">\n    2017 ME 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12324183\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1199/\">\n    154 A.3d 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted). \"Upon review for an abuse of discretion, we ask three questions: (1) whether factual findings, if any, are supported by the record pursuant to the clear error standard; (2) whether the court understood the law\n   applicable to its exercise of discretion; and (3) given the facts and applying the law, whether the court weighed the applicable facts and made choices within the bounds of reasonableness.\"\n   <em>\n    Hutt v.

When a court creates a permanency plan for a child, the court \"must determine whether and when, if applicable,\" one of five plans will be implemented.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186568\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/352/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4038-B(4).

The court explicitly framed that plan in terms of \"permanency\n   <em>\n    with ... [the] grandmother\n   </em>\n   in the stable and nurturing environment where [the children] have been placed during the pendency of this action.\" (Emphasis added.) This specific and essential aspect of the court's best interest analysis requires us to consider how it interrelates with the court's concurrent determination that termination is in the children's best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b6 15] As a general matter, a \"central tenet\" of the child protection statutes \"is the importance of permanency for children subject to child protection proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    In re David W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7287065\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/8/673/\">\n    2010 ME 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7287065\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/8/673/\">\n    8 A.3d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted). Permanency planning is integrally connected to the best interest determination that a court is called upon to make in a termination proceeding. As we have held, \"[p]ermanency planning and the best interest determination made in a termination proceeding cannot be divorced from one another because a best interest decision necessarily requires the court to consider the long-term living arrangement that will best serve a child's needs. The court's permanency plan for the child is an inextricable part of that decision.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Thomas H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8992397\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/889/297/\">\n    2005 ME 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8992397\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/889/297/\">\n    889 A.2d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As was true here, a termination hearing is often consolidated with a permanency planning hearing because the resulting record is the \"single body of evidence\" on which the court rests its best interest analysis that bears on both the issue of termination and the formulation of a permanency plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b6 16] Here, the first of the two alternative permanency plans set out by the court is adoption.

Therefore, in a consolidated proceeding where the court addresses a termination petition and establishes a permanency plan, while the court may determine that as a general matter adoption is in the child's best interest and will be the permanency plan, the court would overreach if it were to designate the adoptive party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Kenneth S\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316594\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/244/\">\n    2017 ME 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316594\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/244/\">\n    157 A.3d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unlike with a permanency plan of adoption, where the court may not properly address the question of who is an appropriate adoptive party, establishing a permanency guardianship requires the court to identify a person who will serve as the permanency guardian based on the particular attributes of the prospective guardian.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4038-C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b6 19] Another difference between an adoption and a permanency guardianship is that the latter, \"[w]hen it is appropriate, ... allows parents whose children cannot be returned to them to have a meaningful opportunity to maintain a legal relationship with their children and to have the court determine their rights to have contact with their children.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Cameron B\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12324183\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1199/\">\n    2017 ME 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12324183\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1199/\">\n    154 A.3d 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This opportunity is recognized in the law, however, only where a parent's rights to the child have not been terminated because a parent whose rights have been terminated has no legal relationship with the child except that the child's right to inherit from the parent remains intact. 22 MRS \u00a7 4056(1) (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b6 20] This does not mean that the court may order a permanency guardianship\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   when parental rights have not been terminated. The statutory authorization for a permanency guardianship contains no\n   such limitation, and none is implied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4038-C. Although there are certain circumstances where the court is no longer required to hold periodic permanency planning hearings, the issuance of a termination order by itself does not have that effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12324183\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1199/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4038-B(2), (3).

Several of those stated purposes make clear that a permanency guardianship plan could be created even after a termination order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12352971\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/1264/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For example, the Director stated that a permanency guardianship would be an \"effective alternative that will honor the needs of older children currently in foster care who express a desire not to be adopted ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12352971\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/1264/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By casting a permanency guardianship as an alternative to adoption, it is evident that the permanency guardianship was intended to be available to the court even after a termination order had been issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b6 22] Additionally, as the Director testified, adding a permanency guardianship to the roster of permanency plans would avoid the situation where a guardianship would have to be imposed in a proceeding that is separate from the child protection action-i.e., in a Title 18-A guardianship proceeding in a probate court-where a different judge who may well be less familiar with the child's circumstances would be\n   called upon to adjudicate the question of whether a guardianship should be imposed and who the guardian should be.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12352971\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/1264/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With the availability of a permanency guardianship plan within the child protection case itself, a District Court judge-who should be the same judge who is already presiding over the child protection proceeding-would make that determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The rationale for creating this pathway for the judge in the child protection case to also adjudicate the guardianship issue is not diminished after a termination order has been issued; even if the child protection case is in a post-termination posture, the benefit of allowing the same judge to preside over the child protection case and the guardianship issue is no less important than it would be before any termination order is issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b6 23] We also note that, unlike in a Title 18-A guardianship, a permanency guardian appointed in a child protection case pursuant to section 4038-B(4)(A)(3) is eligible for a guardianship subsidy in some circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 MRS \u00a7 4038-D (2017). A parent's obligation to pay child support often ends when that parent's parental rights are terminated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12352971\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/1264/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4056(1);\n   <em>\n    Guardianship of Anthony J.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297745\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/980/1250/\">\n    2009 ME 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297745\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/980/1250/\">\n    980 A.2d 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the \"only exception\" to the rule that a terminated parent \"has no duty to provide ongoing support for the child\" is that a court may, pursuant to 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4056(5) (2017), \"order a parent who was convicted of a crime against the child prior to the termination of parental rights to pay a lump sum as child support\"). The provision for a guardianship subsidy is therefore an important possible feature of a permanency guardianship that can be even more important after termination than before termination, when the parents are required to pay for the children's material needs.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297745\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/980/1250/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4036(1)(G) (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b6 24] For these reasons, we conclude that a permanency guardianship is not necessarily incompatible with a court's determination that a termination of parental rights is in the child's best interest. To be sure, because a permanency guardianship may result in less permanency than adoption and therefore, to that extent, may be less effective in achieving the \"central tenet\" of permanency for children,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re David W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7287065\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/8/673/\">\n    2010 ME 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7287065\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/8/673/\">\n    8 A.3d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted), there will be only limited countervailing circumstances where a court will terminate the parental rights of both parents and also approve a permanency guardianship. The legislative history described above proposes one situation where those determinations could overlap-where an older child does not want to be adopted but whose best interest will be served by the measure of stability and security that a permanency guardianship can provide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b6 25] Given the court's factual findings, this case provides another such example. By all accounts, the grandmother has provided the three children with exemplary care, support, and advocacy, and the\n   court found, with considerable support in the record, that the children unquestionably should continue to live with her. That result would be subject to some uncertainty if the court established a permanency plan limited to adoption, because, as discussed above,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17, the court would act beyond its authority in the child protection proceeding if it were to designate the grandmother as the adoptive parent. That level of uncertainty is enhanced to some degree because the Department had denied the grandmother's application to be licensed as a foster parent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court therefore designated alternative post-termination permanency plans that would ensure that, in the end, the children remained with the grandmother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that way, the court legitimately viewed that outcome as being at least as important as the process used to achieve that result and the nature of the grandmother's ultimate legal relationship with the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b6 26] The parents argue that the availability of a permanency guardianship with the grandmother establishes that termination was not necessary to promote the children's best interests because the children could continue in the grandmother's care without terminating the parents' parental rights. This contention, however, does not account for the prospects of impermanence in a permanency guardianship-despite the contrary implication of that statutory term-particularly when a parent's parental rights have not been terminated, because the parent is statutorily authorized to petition the court not only to determine rights of contact but even to terminate the permanency guardianship itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4038-C(3), (6) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Haylie W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12324050\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/167/576/\">\n    2017 ME 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12324050\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/167/576/\">\n    167 A.3d 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b6 27] For the reasons we explained at the outset of our discussion, this appeal is not from the permanency plan of adoption or a permanency guardianship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Rather, given the restricted scope of this appeal, the parents' argument is limited to an assertion that the court's approval of a permanency guardianship as a way to protect the children's best interests necessarily undermines the conclusion that termination is in the children's best interests. The court explained, however, that either a permanency guardianship or an adoption would allow the children to \"have permanency with their paternal grandmother in\n   the stable and nurturing environment where they have been placed during the pendency of this action.\" The court's goals therefore were to ensure that the children would have the permanence that comes with a termination of parental bonds and also that the children would be placed with the grandmother. This is a sufficient basis for the court's decision to terminate parental rights while leaving available the option of placing the children in a permanency guardianship, because the termination order and either permanency plan will allow the children to move forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\u00b6 28] We therefore conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, termination of parental rights is not inconsistent with a permanency guardianship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    This appeal was filed before September 1, 2017; therefore, the restyled Maine Rules of Appellate Procedure do not apply.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    M.R.

For at least two reasons, it is self-evident that this will not be possible for a person whose parental rights have been terminated. First, reunification may be pursued only by a \"parent,\" 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4041(1-A)(B) (2017), and a person whose rights to a child have been terminated is no longer a \"parent\" for purposes of the child protection laws,\n    <em>\n     see\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6818621\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/132/174/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 4002(7) (2017).
