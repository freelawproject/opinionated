Bourgoin was issued a certification to use medical marijuana as a result of chronic back pain. He successfully petitioned the Workers' Compensation Board for an order requiring his former employer, Twin Rivers Paper Company, LLC, to pay for the medical marijuana. On this appeal from the decision of the Appellate Division affirming that award, we are called upon for the first time to consider the relationship between the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and the Maine Medical Use of Marijuana Act (MMUMA). We conclude that in the narrow circumstances of this case-where an employer is subject to an order that would require it to subsidize an employee's acquisition of medical marijuana-there is a positive conflict between federal and state law, and as a result, the CSA preempts the MMUMA as applied here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20903\">\n    21 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LEXIS through Pub.

By agreement of the employer, Bourgoin was placed on total disability as a result of the injury. On three occasions, Twin Rivers filed a petition seeking a reduction in Bourgoin's incapacity, but each petition was denied, and he remains on total disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 5] As a result of his workplace injury, Bourgoin suffers from severe chronic pain syndrome. Bourgoin consulted with a number of pain management specialists and attempted a variety of treatments, including opioid medications, for his pain. Due to adverse side effects of his continued use of opioids, and on the recommendation of his primary care physician, Bourgoin stopped using narcotic medications. In January of 2012, Bourgoin obtained a medical marijuana certification and since then has used medical marijuana to manage his chronic pain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2421 to 2430-B (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 6] In February of 2012, Bourgoin filed a \"petition for payment of medical and related services\" with the Workers' Compensation Board seeking payment from Twin Rivers for the cost of the medical marijuana. Twin Rivers opposed the petition on the ground, among others, that an order requiring it to pay for Bourgoin's medical marijuana is barred by the CSA even if his use of medical marijuana were permitted by the MMUMA. Following a hearing, the hearing officer granted Bourgoin's petition in a written decision issued in March of 2015. Twin Rivers appealed to the Appellate Division, which affirmed the hearing officer's decision in August of 2016. We then granted Twin Rivers' petition for appellate review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 322 (2017) ; M.R.

Preemption Principles\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 8] The preemption analysis must begin with the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, which \"unambiguously provides that if there is any conflict between federal and state law, federal\n   law shall prevail.\"\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v. Raich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208788\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/1/#p29\">\n    545 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208788\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/1/#p29\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208788\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/1/#p29\">\n    162 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2 (\"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land.\"). There are two \"cornerstones\" that guide our preemption analysis: first, \"the ultimate touchstone in every pre-emption case\" is Congress's purpose in enacting the federal law; and second, \"in all pre-emption cases, and particularly in those in which Congress has legislated in a field which the States have traditionally occupied, we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal [law] unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Wyeth v.

That Congress did not add \"willful\" to section 2(a) in 1951 does not mean that Congress intended to eliminate the specific intent or \"willfulness\" for section 2(a) liability; indeed, the opposite conception of the rationale underlying the omission is stronger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Baruch Weiss,\n   <em>\n    What Were They Thinking?: The Mental States of the Aider and Abettor and the Causer Under Federal Law\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20Fordham%20L.%20Rev.%201341\">\n    70 Fordham L.

The Court does not analyze how the government would be able to meet its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the employer itself actually\n   <em>\n    desired\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    wished\n   </em>\n   that Bourgoin be successful in committing the underlying federal offense; I do not agree that mere knowledge is sufficient.

To support this proposition, the Court cites to, among other sources of law,\n   <em>\n    Rosemond v.

The\n   <em>\n    Rosemond\n   </em>\n   Court discussed the type of activity that would not give rise to the requisite specific intent: \"A hypothetical case is the owner of a gun store who sells a firearm to a criminal, knowing but not caring how the gun will be used.

Contrary to the Court's conclusion, I do not agree that mere knowledge constitutes active participation in the commission of a crime, the effective accomplishment of which the accomplice himself or herself must\n   <em>\n    wish\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    desire\n   </em>\n   to bring about in order to establish the requisite specific intent that the offense of aiding and abetting demands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   [\u00b6 47] In fact, the existence of this litigation vitiates the specific intent element that the government would have to prove if it even decided to prosecute the employer. Regardless, whether the government would be able to prove the requisite mens rea beyond a reasonable doubt is speculative, and because speculative conflicts and hypotheticals do not give rise to preemption,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Exxon Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178010\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/117/#p131\">\n    437 U.S. at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178010\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/117/#p131\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , reliance on the doctrine of aiding and abetting to declare that it was Congress's manifest purpose to preempt the WCB from ordering reimbursement is far too tenuous. In sum, I do not agree that the employer would commit an offense against the federal government by reimbursing Bourgoin for his valid medical expenses pursuant to the WCB\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   order, especially in light of the strong presumption against preemption in this state-controlled area of workers' compensation-a domain that has traditionally been regulated under the police powers of the states.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ciampi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7858283\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/681/4/#p8\">\n    681 A.2d at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   [\u00b6 48] The Court also discusses the employer's offense of aiding and abetting in a vacuum, devoid of any mention of the substantive offense, which would be Bourgoin's state-law-compliant use and possession of medical marijuana. The Court points to no federal prosecution of possession of medical marijuana, let alone a federal prosecution of aiding and abetting a singular person's simple possession of medical marijuana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because proof of the existence of a substantive crime is also an element of an aiding and abetting charge,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indelicato\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"470070\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/611/376/#p385\">\n    611 F.2d at 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court cannot reach the conclusion that the employer has aided or abetted Bourgoin's use or possession of marijuana without similarly declaring that Bourgoin's use or possession of marijuana constitutes a federal offense. This omission allows the Court to avoid a discussion that would necessarily be required to include the preemptive effect of the CSA on Bourgoin's state-law-compliant use and possession of medical marijuana. The Court uses the doctrine of aiding and abetting as the vehicle to declare that the MMUMA is preempted by the CSA in this case, but because the government would not be able to prove that the employer has the specific intent to aid or abet Bourgoin's state-law-compliant use and possession of medical marijuana, the Court's reliance on the aiding and abetting doctrine is misguided. The employer also acknowledged at oral argument that despite the fact that the first state medical marijuana law was enacted more than two decades ago in 1996,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the fact that twenty-nine states, two territories, and the District of Columbia now have laws in effect that allow for the use of medical marijuana,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   it could not point to\n   any federal prosecution against a medical provider for authorizing a patient to use marijuana for medicinal purposes, much less to an employer or insurance carrier providing reimbursement for authorized medical marijuana treatment. It is speculative to anticipate a federal prosecution of an employer who reimburses an employee for medical expenses pursuant to a WCB order mandating it to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   [\u00b6 49] Because I would hold that there is no positive conflict between the CSA and the MMUMA in this case, I address the remainder of the employer's arguments on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   C.

The hearing officer found that strong narcotic medications \"have already been tried and they have failed Mr. Bourgoin miserably.\" As a result, and after consultation with his psychiatrist, his primary doctor recommended ceasing narcotic medications, and in January of 2012, Bourgoin obtained a medical marijuana certification from a physician.

I would decline to adopt this argument and would conclude that medical marijuana was reasonable and proper here based on the particular facts of Bourgoin's own case, as established by the record before us. Specifically, the severity and chronic nature of his pain, his many and varied attempts to try different treatments, none of which were effective, and the ultimate effectiveness of medical marijuana for his particular situation, show that the medical use of marijuana was reasonable and proper in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   E.

Although a hearing officer's decision \"on all questions of fact is final,\" a hearing officer's conclusion that an employee satisfied his or her burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the independent medical examiner's findings should be rejected is a conclusion of law that is subject to appellate review. 39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 318 (2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In such a case, \"we determine whether the hearing officer could have been reasonably persuaded by the contrary medical evidence that it was highly probable that the record did not support the IME's medical findings.\"\n   <em>\n    Sprague v.

Specifically, the hearing officer was persuaded by the testimony of Dr. Sulak regarding the benefits of marijuana for the treatment of long-term, chronic pain, and Bourgoin's own testimony regarding the effects of marijuana on his level of pain. The hearing officer found this evidence to be more persuasive than the IME's findings. The IME concluded that, because medical marijuana had no currently accepted medical use under federal law, it was not a reasonable and proper treatment for any patient, regardless of its efficacy in a given circumstance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   [\u00b6 62] Because the record contains (1) numerous examples of the ways in which medical marijuana has reduced Bourgoin's chronic pain since beginning the regimen of medical marijuana use; and (2) evidence of traditional opioid medication's failure to reduce his chronic pain, I would hold that the hearing officer could have been reasonably persuaded by the contrary medical evidence, and, as a result, that he did not err when he concluded that it was highly probable that the record did not support the IME's medical findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   [\u00b6 63] Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the Appellate Division.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Twin Rivers also challenges the Appellate Division's decision on several alternative grounds: (1) that Twin Rivers is a \"private health insurer\" and therefore is not required to reimburse an employee for medical marijuana treatment pursuant to 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 2426(2)(A) (2017) ; (2) that medical marijuana is not a \"reasonable and proper\" treatment pursuant to the Maine Workers' Compensation Act, 39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 206 (2017) ; and (3) that the hearing officer erred by rejecting the findings of the independent medical examiner,\n    <em>\n     see\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210004\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/957/969/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 312(7) (2017).

The Court's opinion rejects the Appellate Division's findings and, based on its speculation that federal enforcement practice might change, the Court holds as a matter of law that the Appellate Division erred in approving the certificates and reimbursements for Mr. Bourgoin. Court's Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 26-30. In this, the Court is reaching too far, speculating about the future rather than looking at the present, as was properly addressed by the Appellate Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   [\u00b6 68] From that result, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
