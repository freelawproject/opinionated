After failing to seek leave to appeal his conviction following his guilty plea and failing to obtain requested postconviction relief, Mr. Tate requested that his postconviction matter be reopened pursuant to Section 7-104 of the Criminal Procedure Article of the Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.) (\" Crim. Proc. \u00a7 7-104\"). Mr. Tate alleged that this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Daughtry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698562\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/419/35/\">\n    419 Md. 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698562\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/419/35/\">\n    18 A.3d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011), required, in the interests of justice, that the postconviction hearing judge reconsider his decision to deny Mr. Tate relief. The postconviction hearing judge reopened the case and, thereafter, vacated Mr. Tate's\n   guilty plea. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals reversed that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This Court granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   and now affirms the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. The record of the plea hearing alone demonstrates that Mr. Tate entered his guilty plea knowingly and voluntarily. Additionally, the postconviction hearing judge reopened the proceedings and vacated the guilty plea based on this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   . Procedural distinctions preclude\n   <em>\n    Daughtry's\n   </em>\n   application to the present case. Believing that\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   had changed the law and, thus, it was in the interests of justice to reopen Mr. Tate's postconviction proceedings and set aside his guilty plea, the postconviction hearing judge erred and abused his discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Brian Arthur Tate pleaded guilty to first-degree murder based on the following statement of facts. On February 24, 1992, Mr. Tate engaged in an altercation with the victim on or near Summit Drive in Annapolis, Maryland. Eventually, Mr. Tate dragged the victim's body behind a nearby shed. Then Mr. Tate left the scene. An autopsy conducted by the State's medical examiner revealed that the victim had endured 24 stab wounds and slashes to multiple parts of his body, including the back, lungs, liver, neck, arms, and hands. Additionally, the victim suffered blunt force trauma to the head which caused various bone fractures. The police recovered a broken knife, the suspected murder weapon, at the scene of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As a result of investigation, Anne Arundel County Police learned from various witnesses that Mr. Tate had threatened the victim several times prior to the altercation because the victim had begun to date Mr. Tate's former girlfriend. One such threat included that Mr. Tate planned to dress in dark clothing to catch the victim by surprise, stab him, cut his throat, and after the victim died, Mr. Tate would continue to physically assault the victim. Another such threat indicated that Mr. Tate had been sharpening his knife in preparation for the assault. Witnesses also admitted to seeing a knife and sharpening stone in Mr. Tate's bedroom prior to the homicide as well as seeing Mr. Tate with brass knuckles on the day of the homicide. After the police conducted a search of Mr. Tate's home, they recovered a blood-stained black ski jacket. A DNA test established that the victim's DNA was on the jacket. Lastly, as a result of the search, police uncovered brass knuckles and the victim's wallet in Mr. Tate's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Plea Hearing and Sentencing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 16, 1992, a grand jury in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County indicted Brian Arthur Tate in case number K-92-862 for: first-degree murder, armed robbery, attempted armed robbery, robbery, assault with intent to commit robbery, and theft. In an unrelated case, case number K-92-863, Mr. Tate was charged with several counts of attempted murder, arson, burning the personal property of another, and reckless endangerment. Mr. Tate pleaded guilty to first-degree murder on November 2, 1992 in exchange for the State entering a nolle prosequi (\"nol pros\") to the remaining charges contained in indictment number K-92-862, as well as charges in indictment number K-92-863. The State agreed to withdraw its request for a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. The State also agreed not to oppose Mr. Tate's request for admission to the Patuxent Institution. The State and the defendant expressed, in general terms, that they agreed to the conditions, including Mr. Tate pleading guilty to first-degree murder that occurred in the way expressed in a detailed statement of facts. Thereafter, the Honorable Raymond\n   G.\n   Thieme, the plea hearing judge, directly addressed the voluntariness of Mr. Tate's decision to plead guilty:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE COURT: Ha[ve your attorneys] gone over [t]his letter of October 30, 1992[,] with you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, [they have].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE COURT: Ha[ve they] read to you, or have you read the statement of facts that are attached thereto?\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT: Ha[ve they] told you the consequences of coming in here pleading guilty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, [they have], Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   THE COURT: Told you what rights you are giving up?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, [they have].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE COURT: Do you understand the maximum penalty could be up to life?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE COURT: Now, other than what has been set forth in this letter, have there been any other inducements or\n   promises of any type to get you to come in here and plead guilty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   MR. TATE: Not that I am aware of, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE COURT: Has anyone threatened you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   MR. TATE: No one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   THE COURT: Are you under the influence of any alcohol, drugs, narcotics, or other pills?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   MR. TATE: No, I'm not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Notably, Judge Thieme inquired into Mr. Tate's educational level, his mental health status, and his prior criminal record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: How far did you go in school?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   MR. TATE: Halfway through my junior year, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: Now, other than this case, where I know you have been examined by various mental health individuals, before this case have you ever been under the care of a psychiatrist or in a mental institution?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE COURT: How long ago?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [MR. TATE'S ATTORNEY]: Your Honor, if it pleases the Court, some months before the incident in question, Brian, after a series of difficulties at home and school, was presented by his parents in the offices of a Dr. Steven Lasht, who I believe is a licensed social worker, perhaps [a] psychologist, for some counseling sessions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   I have seen some statements, very brief statements, coming out of those interviews, and it does not appear that there was anything suggested in that counseling that would indicate that Mr. Tate, Brian Tate, did not understand the nature of the proceedings before the Court today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   THE COURT: Mr. Tate, is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, it is, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   THE COURT: Are you now on parole or probation for anything?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   MR. TATE: No, I am not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Then Judge Thieme assessed Mr. Tate's understanding of his decision to plead guilty to first-degree murder:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE COURT: Were you given a copy of the charges?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   THE COURT: Have you read it and discussed it with your attorney[s]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   THE COURT: Do you understand what you are charged with?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE COURT: Do you understand what you are pleading guilty to?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE COURT: Now, I am telling you, these charges aren't evidence. They are only accusations. You have a right to plead not guilty. If you plead not guilty[,] [ ] you could be found [not] guilty, the charges have to be proved by evidence, which convinces a jury, or a [c]ourt, if you want, that you are guilty to the exclusion of a reasonable doubt, and to a moral certainty. Do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A part of Judge Thieme's assessment included questions regarding Mr. Tate's belief in the competence of his defense attorneys as well as their advice:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   THE COURT: Did you tell your attorneys all the facts about this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   MR. TATE: Excuse me, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   THE COURT: Did you tell your attorneys all the facts about this case as best you know them[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes[,] I have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   THE COURT: Did they tell you what you can do in court?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   THE COURT: Is there anything you wanted them to do that they haven't done?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   MR. TATE: No, there isn't. They've done everything they can.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   THE COURT: Are you satisfied with the services of your attorneys?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   THE COURT: Do you believe they are competent?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Notwithstanding Mr. Tate affirming that his attorneys explained to him the consequences of a guilty plea, Judge Thieme also explained the ramifications to Mr. Tate on the record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   THE COURT: I am telling you, even though in fact you may be guilty of this offense to which you are pleading guilty, you have a right to plead not guilty. You are entitled to a speedy public trial by either a jury or Court, whichever you want, and you have a right to have your attorney with you throughout your trial. Do you understand you are giving up those right[s]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   THE COURT: Do you understand you are giving up your right to a trial by jury?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   THE COURT: Now, I am telling you, a jury consists of 12 people selected at random from this county, each of them at least 18 years of age. To find you guilty[,] all 12 have to say you are guilty upon evidence that satisfies them of your guilt to the exclusion of a reasonable doubt, to a moral certainty. Do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   THE COURT: Do you understand you are giving up that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   THE COURT: Have you discussed that right with your counsel[ors]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   THE COURT: I am telling you, when you plead guilty, you are giving up your right to see, hear and question the State's witnesses. You are giving up your right to call witnesses or present any evidence [o]n your behalf. Do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   THE COURT: And you are giving up your right to remain silent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   THE COURT: I am telling you, you are presumed innocent, and this presumption continues throughout your trial until overcome by proper evidence proving you are guilty to the exclusion of a reasonable doubt. Do you understand you are giving up the benefits of what I just said?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   THE COURT: Are you pleading guilty of your own free will?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   THE COURT: Are you pleading guilty because you are guilty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   MR. TATE: -\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   THE COURT: I am telling you, when you plead guilty you are giving up your right to complain about any defects, mistakes, errors or irregularities in the State's case, and these in part go to the motions that your attorneys have filed on your behalf. And amongst other things, these motions go to the question of any invalid search and seizure, and invalid warrant, and any invalid arrest. Do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   THE COURT: Do you understand you are giving up your right to proceed further with those motions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Finally, Judge Thieme discussed ancillary ramifications of Mr. Tate's plea:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   THE COURT: Have you made any statements to the police or any public official? If[ ] for any reason you feel that they weren't freely or voluntarily made, you are entitled to a separate hearing, either before your trial or during your trial to have me decide[ ] whether they were freely and voluntarily made, they can't be used against you. Do you understand you are giving up your [right] to proceed further with this?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   THE COURT: If I accept your guilty plea, you lose your automatic right to appeal. If I sentence you, you have 30 days to ask the [h]igher [c]ourt to let you appeal. If they let you appeal, the only points you could raise would be the jurisdiction of this [c]ourt and the validity of the sentence, the voluntariness of this plea, and the competence of your attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   All that means is if the State proves the crime occurred in Anne Arundel County, and you challenge my right to try you on appeal, you would lose. Do you understand?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   THE COURT: Do you understand that if the record shows that you are [ ] intelligently, voluntarily, and knowingly pleading guilty, and you challenged your guilty plea on appeal, you would lose. Do you understand?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   THE COURT: If I give you any sentence within the limits prescribed by law, and you challenge that on appeal, you would lose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   And lastly, if you claimed that your attorneys didn't represent you properly, unless you could prove that on appeal, you would lose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   MR. TATE: I understand, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   THE COURT: Is there anything about what I have questioned you [that] you don't understand?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   MR. TATE: None, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   THE COURT: Do you want to ask me any questions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   MR. TATE: No, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   THE COURT: You still want to go ahead with this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   THE COURT: The Court is satisfied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   After Judge Thieme expressed his satisfaction with the defendant's response to the questions posed, one of Mr. Tate's attorneys followed with additional questions regarding the context of Mr. Tate's knowledge and voluntariness with regard to the guilty plea:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   [MR. TATE'S ATTORNEY]: Mr. Tate, you are under 18, is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   [MR. TATE'S ATTORNEY]: And when we began to discuss the possibility of this plea, and once it reached the form that you have heard given to the Court, [co-counsel] and I have met with you in [the] Anne Arundel County Detention Center in the company of both of your parents, is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, sir, it is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   [MR. TATE'S ATTORNEY]: And that was in person, and not through windows, and we discussed for over an hour this plea negotiation, is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   [MR. TATE'S ATTORNEY]: And [co-counsel] and I refrained from making any recommendation at that time, did we not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   [MR. TATE'S ATTORNEY]: And did you have an opportunity to discuss this fully with your parents as well?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   [MR. TATE'S ATTORNEY]: Now, also to ensure that this is your decision and not your parents' decision, I followed up and saw you very early the next morning, is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, it is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   [MR. TATE'S ATTORNEY]: And you indicated to me at that time that that was also your decision as well, is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   [MR. TATE'S ATTORNEY]: And you discussed this further with other relatives and an attorney in New York as well, is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   [MR. TATE'S ATTORNEY]: Okay. Now, one thing I want to make absolutely clear and the Judge did tell you about this, but you remember that hearing we had in here for a number of days where we very heatedly argued against the finding of the wallet in your bedroom?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   [MR. TATE'S ATTORNEY]: Do you understand you are giving up your right to appeal [the judge's] decision that that should be admitted into evidence in the proceeding in this matter. In other words, once everything is said and done here, and at your sentencing, you can't come back afterwards and say, \"Hey, I want to appeal the issue of whether that wallet should have been entered into evidence.\" Do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   MR. TATE: -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   [Mr. Tate's Counsel]: Do you have anything you would like to ask of myself or [co-counsel] at this time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   MR. TATE: -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   THE COURT: You still want to go ahead?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   MR. TATE: Yes, I do, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   At the conclusion of defense counsel's questioning, Judge Thieme again expressed his satisfaction with the response. The statement of facts was read into the record, and the State proffered to Judge\n   Thieme that it had multiple witnesses to testify to the veracity of the statement. After hearing no objection from Mr. Tate's attorneys, Judge Thieme found Mr.\n   Tate guilty of first-degree murder, and the case was set in for sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Mr. Tate was sentenced on January 18, 1993. The State called two witnesses who were members of the victim's family. Mr. Tate called two licensed psychiatrists to support his request to receive psychological treatment at the Patuxent Institution. Ultimately, Judge Thieme sentenced Mr. Tate to life in prison with the possibility of parole and recommended Mr. Tate for treatment at Patuxent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <em>\n    Request for Postconviction Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Mr. Tate filed a Petition for Postconviction Relief in September 2005, at which time the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County took no action. Mr. Tate filed an Amended Petition for Postconviction Relief in January 2006. In his Amended Petition, Mr. Tate, in part, argued that he did not fully understand his guilty plea, including the nature of the charges and possible defenses as well as that there was no discussion on the record regarding his intent, the differences between premeditated and felony murder, and that there was no factual finding that he knowingly and voluntarily entered the plea, all of which rendered his guilty plea a nullity. For reasons not entirely clear from the record, the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Howard County in July 2006. In February 2007, the Circuit Court for Howard County stayed proceedings with regard to the Amended Petition for Postconviction Relief to permit Mr. Tate to file a belated application for leave to appeal his conviction, which the Court of Special Appeals denied in May 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The Circuit Court for Howard County resumed proceedings in the postconviction case and held a hearing in September of 2009. Mr. Tate raised two different allegations of error in his request for postconviction relief: that his guilty plea was invalid, and that his trial counsel was ineffective.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The postconviction\n   hearing judge weighed the \"very thorough colloquy\" as well as evidence that was not before the plea hearing judge\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and concluded that Mr. Tate's guilty plea was valid and that he did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to the guilty plea. The postconviction hearing judge found that \"there was [an] abundan[ce of] objective evidence of premeditation presented\" and that the facts read into the record \"crystallized the basic elements or components of premeditated [f]irst-[d]egree [m]urder.\" Additionally, the postconviction hearing judge found, based upon testimony from one of Mr. Tate's attorneys,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the attorneys discussed the plea bargain comprehensively and, as a part of that conversation, the\n   attorneys would have discussed with Mr. Tate the facts as well as \"the nature of the plea.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The postconviction hearing judge determined that Mr. Tate failed to prove he was entitled to postconviction relief on each of his additional claims as well, apart from his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on his request for a three-judge panel. Because Mr. Tate testified both that he requested his counsel to file for review by a three-judge panel and that his attorneys ignored his request, with no testimony to the contrary,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the hearing judge granted Mr. Tate the right to file a belated application for review by a three-judge panel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Mr. Tate filed his Application for Review of Sentence in June 2010 and the Circuit Court for Howard County granted his request for review by a three-judge panel. At that time, Mr. Tate also filed an Application for Leave to Appeal the postconviction hearing judge's denial of the requested relief. The three-judge panel reviewed Mr. Tate's sentence in November 2010 and determined that Mr. Tate's sentence should remain unchanged, which Mr. Tate appealed and which the Circuit Court consolidated with his then pending application for leave to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <em>\n    Request to Reopen Postconviction Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   In September 2011, Mr. Tate filed a motion entitled, \"Motion to Reopen Postconviction Case\" in which he argued that the recently decided case,\n   <em>\n    State v. Daughtry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698562\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/419/35/\">\n    419 Md. 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698562\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/419/35/\">\n    18 A.3d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011), required reopening his case in the interests of justice. In December 2012, new counsel for Mr. Tate filed supplemental briefing to support his argument to reopen postconviction proceedings. The Circuit Court for Howard County held the motion\n   <em>\n    sub curia\n   </em>\n   pending a decision by the Court of Special Appeals on Mr. Tate's application for leave to appeal. In June 2013, the Court of Special Appeals denied both applications for leave to appeal. The Circuit Court for Howard County thereafter set a hearing on the postconviction matters, and the hearing judge reopened proceedings in September 2014. Specifically, the hearing judge reopened proceedings to consider: \"Did [Mr. Tate] knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily enter his guilty plea when there was no on-the-record confirmation that he understood the elements of the crime to which he pled?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The postconviction hearing judge granted the requested relief by vacating the judgment entered pursuant to the plea agreement. He reasoned that \"\n   <em>\n    Daughtry's\n   </em>\n   on-the-plea record hearing requirements, when read closely and applied, using the 'totality of the circumstances [analysis],' to the unique facts of this case, require the plea and the bargain supporting it to be set aside.\" The basis of his decision was that\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   required Mr. Tate to receive an explanation at the plea\n   hearing of the complexity of first-degree murder. Specifically, the hearing judge noted in his written discussion of his basis for ruling to vacate the guilty plea that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   neither the plea judge [n]or trial counsel ever explained the nature or the elements of the offense of\n   <em>\n    premeditated\n   </em>\n   first-degree\n   murder and its complexities in express terms at the plea hearing. No expressed differentiation of the specific intent to commit that crime of aggravated murder, either in technical legal or layman's terms was placed on the record\n   <em>\n    at the plea hearing\n   </em>\n   . No expressed differentiation of\n   <em>\n    premeditated\n   </em>\n   first-degree murder versus first-degree felony murder, which he could have been found guilty of, given the simple form of the first-degree murder count under which he was charged and the robbery count in the indictment, was placed on the record. Nor was there an expressed differentiation of the other degrees of murder,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , second degree,\n   <em>\n    explained or set out on the record at the plea hearing\n   </em>\n   , nor were the words \"feloniously, willful, deliberate, premeditated, malice of forethought[,]\" [ ] the formal legal description of first-degree murder as charged in his indictment pursuant to former Article 27, \u00a7 407 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, the statute under which he was charged, ever uttered at the plea hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The postconviction hearing judge expressed his concern that Judge Thieme \"never made a finding that Mr. Tate knowingly, freely and voluntarily entered the plea.\" The hearing judge distilled from\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   that \"the record of\n   <em>\n    the plea hearing\n   </em>\n   must contain some evidence that proves the defendant possessed the necessary knowledge of the crime's elements[,]\" and that it was \"no longer sufficient to presume that a defendant understands such things merely because he is represented by counsel.\" The hearing judge found that \"[i]n the present case, this [c]ourt now finds the\n   <em>\n    plea record\n   </em>\n   lacks any expressed exposition of the nature or elements of the crime,\n   <em>\n    premeditated\n   </em>\n   first[-]degree murder, to which [Mr. Tate] pled guilty as required by\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   , other recent guilty plea appellate rulings cited herein, and Rule 4-242.\" Therefore, the hearing judge set aside Mr. Tate's guilty plea and remanded\n   the case to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The State filed an application for leave to appeal the postconviction relief granted and requested a stay of further proceedings in October 2014. The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County granted the State's motion to stay pending the outcome of the application for leave to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals heard the State's appeal. In an unpublished opinion, the intermediate appellate court first denied Mr. Tate's motion to dismiss and held that the State properly filed for leave to appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Mr. Tate presented the Court with the following question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   Was Brian Tate's guilty plea record sufficient to conclude he understood the nature and elements of first-degree murder, despite the fact that he was a minor with diminished mental capacity and no one addressed the nature and elements of the crime on the record?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   We answer in the affirmative that the guilty plea record was sufficient for Judge Thieme to conclude that Mr. Tate understood the nature and elements of first-degree murder. Upon our review of the jurisprudence of this Court with regard to the validity of guilty pleas and the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that nothing about the\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   case changed the determination initially made by Judge Thieme and then later affirmed at the\n   postconviction hearing. The hearing judge misinterpreted our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   and\n   abused his discretion when he used the case as the basis for reopening Mr. Tate's postconviction proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Our primary task is to determine whether Mr. Tate's guilty plea was valid. This case also raises further questions of whether the\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   opinion applies to the facts of Mr. Tate's postconviction case as well as whether Mr. Tate's postconviction case should have been reopened at all. Mr. Tate contends that, at his plea hearing, neither Judge Thieme nor Mr. Tate's counsel explained sufficiently on the record the nature or elements of premeditated first-degree murder. According to Mr. Tate, that deficiency alone would merit, under\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   , vacating the guilty plea. Mr. Tate maintains that, when coupled with his age and his mental status, the totality of the circumstances would demonstrate that the inquiry on the record was insufficient. Mr. Tate urges this Court to reconsider our guilty plea jurisprudence with an understanding that the United States Supreme Court, as well as other courts, have created distinct criminal procedures for juveniles due to certain scientific evidence that has shown juveniles face disadvantages in criminal proceedings. Finally, Mr. Tate argues that the Court of Special Appeals should not have disturbed the findings made by the postconviction hearing judge without concluding that the findings were clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   To the contrary, the State argues that\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   did not alter the legal landscape for what constitutes a defective guilty plea. In terms of where Mr. Tate's plea fits on the spectrum of guilty plea cases, the State contends that this case is more similar to\n   <em>\n    Priet\n   </em>\n   than\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   . Additionally, the State does not contest that Mr. Tate's youth and mental status are factors that a hearing judge should consider, but rather the State does contest Mr. Tate's characterization that those factors were not considered in this case based on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   We first turn to whether the postconviction hearing judge's conclusion to set aside Mr. Tate's guilty plea was\n   correct. When an appellate court reviews the application of the law to the facts of a case, a trial court receives no deference.\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698562\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/419/35/\">\n    419 Md. at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698562\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/419/35/\">\n    18 A.3d at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The postconviction hearing judge determined as much in 2010 when he denied relief to Mr. Tate. Nothing in the law changed between 2010 and 2014 to warrant further postconviction relief in Mr. Tate's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The record of the guilty plea hearing confirms that Mr. Tate knowingly and voluntarily pleaded guilty to first-degree murder. The State announced that Mr. Tate would plead guilty to first-degree murder as a necessary condition of the bargain, and the State would, in turn, nol pros the other charges. Mr. Tate discussed those terms, as well as the facts read into the record regarding the crime, with his counsel. Mr. Tate, when asked by Judge Thieme, said that he had read and discussed his charges with his attorneys. Mr. Tate confirmed for the court that he understood the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Mr. Tate also affirmed that he told his attorneys the facts of the case and that he believed that they had \"done everything they c[ould]\" under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Judge Thieme carefully reviewed the rights Mr. Tate waived as a result of his decision to plead guilty. Mr. Tate confirmed that he understood he was giving up his right to a jury or court trial, and that his right to trial had been discussed with his attorneys. He stated that he understood he was giving up his right to present evidence and call witnesses, the presumption of innocence, his right to raise Fourth Amendment defects with regard to his search and seizure, his right to possible Miranda violations based on the possible involuntariness of statements made to police, and his automatic right to appeal. In addition, he affirmed his understanding that if \"the record shows that [he was] intelligently, voluntarily,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   and knowingly pleading guilty, and [he] challenged [his] guilty plea on appeal, [he] would lose.\" Judge Thieme took care to ask if Mr. Tate had any questions or failed to understand any aspect of the proceeding, and Mr. Tate affirmed that he wanted to go forward with the guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Judge Thieme had, on the record before him, sufficient facts to fairly conclude that Mr. Tate understood that he was charged with the premeditated and deliberate killing of the victim with malice. The facts on the record showed that Mr. Tate planned and rehearsed the murder. He stabbed and slashed the victim twenty-four times across the victim's body, broke parts of the victim's face, and hid the body. The police recovered the body where Mr. Tate hid it. Multiple witnesses corroborated the motive for the crime as well as the pre-meditation:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   that Mr. Tate planned to kill the victim, that he planned to ambush the victim at night in the dark, that he planned to use a knife, that he planned to continue to assault the victim after the victim died, and that Mr. Tate in fact had a knife, a sharpening tool, and brass knuckles prior to the murder. The victim's DNA was found on Mr. Tate's jacket, and brass knuckles as well as the victim's wallet were found in Mr. Tate's home. Without leaving room for interpretation, the detailed statement of facts captures the essence of first-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Mr. Tate now contends that his youth at the time of the plea, the complexity of first-degree murder, and the lack of information on the record regarding the nature of the charges require this Court to determine that his guilty plea was defective. We agree that Mr. Tate's youth, the complexity of the charges, and the extent of the plea colloquy are relevant considerations for a hearing judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Priet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2093705\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/289/267/#p276\">\n    289 Md. at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20A.2d%20349\">\n    424 A.2d at 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, Judge Thieme considered those factors at the plea hearing. He questioned Mr. Tate about his educational level, and Mr. Tate explained that he had attended school through half of his junior year in high school. Additionally, Judge Thieme asked if Mr. Tate had received prior psychiatric treatment, to which Mr. Tate's attorney responded that Mr. Tate had received counseling from a social worker or\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   psychologist, but nothing that materialized from those sessions should have led Judge Thieme to find that Mr. Tate did not understand the nature of the proceedings. Judge Thieme asked Mr. Tate to confirm the accuracy of his attorney's representations to the court, which Mr. Tate did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   After Judge Thieme expressed his satisfaction with Mr. Tate's responses to the questions raised, Mr. Tate's attorney chose to ask additional questions related to Mr. Tate's age. Mr. Tate confirmed that he was under the age of eighteen. Mr. Tate's attorney delved into a meeting at the Anne Arundel County Detention Center where Mr. Tate and his counselors had discussed the plea negotiations for over an hour, which Mr. Tate agreed was accurate. Mr. Tate then agreed with his attorney's representation that he had the opportunity to discuss the plea bargain with his parents. Mr. Tate agreed with his counsel that the decision to proceed was his own decision. Mr. Tate also confirmed that he had spoken with other members of his family as well as another attorney about his plea bargain. After Mr. Tate's attorney finished questioning Mr. Tate, Judge Thieme again expressed his satisfaction with the responses. Based on the totality of the circumstances, Mr. Tate entered his guilty plea knowingly and voluntarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Mr. Tate next contends that when reviewing courts assess the knowing and voluntary nature of adolescent guilty pleas, they must consider the age of the defendant as well as \"related characteristics\" to determine if the defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered a guilty plea. Mr. Tate directs us to consider various cases from the United States Supreme Court, which treat juveniles differently than adults with regard to life sentences, as well as cases from Maryland which treat juveniles differently than adults with regard to Miranda violations. Mr. Tate fails to direct this Court, however, to any case in our jurisprudence, or elsewhere, which treats juvenile guilty pleas differently from adult guilty pleas. As this Court has previously held, a hearing judge should consider age and related characteristics such as educational level.\n   <em>\n    Priet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2093705\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/289/267/#p276\">\n    289 Md. at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20A.2d%20349\">\n    424 A.2d at 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Mr. Tate also contends that the complexity of first-degree murder required a greater showing than what was present on\n   the record for the court to accept Mr. Tate's guilty plea as knowing and voluntary. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Tate asks that we adopt a standard for crimes that are not easily understood that requires some degree of greater explanation, on the record, in order to show that a defendant understands the nature of the charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698562\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/419/35/\">\n    419 Md. at 72-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698562\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/419/35/\">\n    18 A.3d at 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that not all crimes or elements of crimes are self-explanatory). According to the record before Judge Thieme, it was clear that Mr. Tate was admitting guilt to first-degree murder in exchange for a life sentence. Mr. Tate admitted to reading the charging document as well as the detailed letter containing the plea conditions. Mr. Tate admitted to discussing those charges not only with his counselors for his plea hearing, but also with another attorney. Mr. Tate stated that he understood the charge and to what he was pleading guilty. Mr. Tate explained that he told his attorneys the facts of the case, that he read the statement of facts, and that he discussed the statement with his attorneys. Mr. Tate agreed that he had discussed with his attorneys various strategies for how to proceed in his case. He confirmed for the court that he understood the charges and was choosing, voluntarily, to proceed with pleading guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Mr. Tate and the postconviction judge used the same example to support their conclusions that Mr. Tate may not have understood the nature of the charges to which he pleaded guilty. According to Mr. Tate and the postconviction hearing judge, Mr. Tate may have confused pleading guilty to premeditated first-degree murder with felony murder. This confusion seems unlikely, as the State announced at the outset that the agreement was conditioned upon Mr. Tate pleading guilty to \"Count No. 1 ... murder in the first degree.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Tate admitted to reading the charging document, discussing the\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   charges with his counsel, and understanding the charges and to what he was pleading guilty. In addition, Mr. Tate could have raised an objection to the statement of facts if he disagreed with them, but instead he decided against doing so. In opting not to do so, Mr. Tate agreed that he had committed first-degree murder. Clearly, the statement of facts can be reasonably interpreted as the factual basis to support the elements of premeditated first-degree murder and not felony murder. The State emphasized that it had witness statements related to Mr. Tate's intent and preconceived plan to murder the victim, as opposed to emphasizing evidence of Mr. Tate committing robbery or any other specific felony. The facts were not framed in such a way that the State could have proven Mr. Tate committed felony murder. Therefore, the facts underscore the nature and elements of the crime of first-degree murder, namely premeditation and deliberation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Mr. Tate proposes that this Court consider establishing a rule where, for juveniles particularly, the elements and nature of the charges are explained on the record in non-legal language such that the hearing judge can ensure that the defendant understands the nature of the charge. At this time, we do not adopt this rule. The case law does not support the adoption of this rule, and in particular, the\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   opinion does not support the adoption of this rule either. Although\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   held, in part, that first-degree murder was complex,\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   did not depart from prior\n   case law.

In his order to vacate the guilty plea, the hearing judge explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-205\">\n   This Court notes Tate purports\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   to be a change in the law. That is true in [an] overall sense, but, in a more technical legal sense it is not, since the Court of Appeals ruled it had to be applied retroactively because it did not ultimately change applicable guilty plea law.

Mr. Tate affirmed, on the record, that he had received a copy of the charges, that he read the charges, that he had discussed the charges with his attorney, that he understood the charges, that he understood what he was pleading guilty to, that he told his attorneys all the facts about the case, that they told him what he could do in court, and that they had done everything they could in his defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Focusing solely on what Mr. Daughtry actually said, we concluded that Mr. Daughtry never affirmed that he read, discussed, or understood the charges.

The hearing judge explained that what distinguished the outcome of Mr. Tate's second attempt at postconviction relief from the first resided in the diminished weight the hearing judge afforded to the evidence outside the plea hearing record. Additionally, the hearing judge reconsidered Mr. Tate's personal characteristics with \"added weight\" when said characteristics militated against the knowing and voluntary nature of his guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    Daughtry\n   </em>\n   , however, does not discuss the weight afforded to evidence on the record versus extrinsic evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the instant case, no\n   new evidence was presented to the hearing judge that he had not previously considered at the postconviction hearing.

Therefore, the hearing judge should not have afforded additional weight as a matter of law to Mr. Tate's personal characteristics, and in particular his age and alleged diminished mental capacity.

In Mr. Tate's case, it cannot be said that the only basis for acceptance of the guilty plea was the\n    <em>\n     Henderson\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     /\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Priet\n    </em>\n    presumption, and therefore,\n    <em>\n     Daughtry's\n    </em>\n    retroactive application could not justify reopening Mr. Tate's postconviction proceedings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-270\">\n    The only passage from\n    <em>\n     Daughtry\n    </em>\n    that the hearing judge could have referenced with regard to \"additional weight\" for the personal characteristics of the accused is as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-271\">\n    Instead of merely informing practitioners and judges what conduct merely will\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    pass muster under Rule 4-242(c) (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    the mere fact of representation alone and that the defendant discussed the plea with his or her attorney), we shall elaborate somewhat on what factors can and should aid a trial court in determining whether to accept a guilty plea.\n    <em>\n     Priet\n    </em>\n    provided a starting point, when we stated that \"the required determination can only be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account ... among other factors,\n    <em>\n     the complexity of the charge, the personal characteristics of the accused, and the factual basis proffered to support the court's acceptance of the plea\n    </em>\n    .\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-272\">\n    <em>\n     State v.

The\n    <em>\n     Daughtry\n    </em>\n    Court discussed each factor in turn and stated that \"the personal characteristics of the accused are important, as one with a diminished mental capacity is less likely to be able to understand the nature of the charges against him than one with normal mental faculties.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 73,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698562\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/419/35/\">\n     18 A.3d at 83\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing\n    <em>\n     Henderson v.

The statement that the Court made regarding the importance of considering diminished mental capacity refers to the necessity with which the Court may consider it as a factor, not that it receives \"additional weight.\" In\n    <em>\n     Henderson v. Morgan\n    </em>\n    , Mr. Morgan's \"unusually low mental capacity,\" when weighed with the totality of the circumstances, required vacating the guilty plea as unknowing and involuntary.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181278\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/637/#p646\">\n     426 U.S. 637\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181278\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/637/#p646\">\n     96 S.Ct. 2253\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 2259,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181278\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/637/#p646\">\n     49 L.Ed. 2d 108\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 116 (1976). No such comparable facts were before Mr. Tate's postconviction hearing judge, on the record or otherwise; nonetheless, the hearing judge did consider Mr. Tate's personal characteristics when he assessed whether Mr. Tate entered his guilty plea knowingly and voluntarily.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
