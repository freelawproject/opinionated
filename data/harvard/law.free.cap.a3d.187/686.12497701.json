Maryland's statute of repose, codified at Md. Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 5-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\"CJP\"), bars certain claims relating to injuries caused by improvements to real property. CJP\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00a7 5-108(d)(2) lists several exceptions to the statute of repose. Subsection (d)(2)(i) provides that the protections of the statute shall not apply if the \"defendant was in actual possession and control of the property as owner, tenant, or otherwise when the injury occurred ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The remaining subsections, (d)(2)(ii)-(iv), eliminate the statute's protection for certain defendants in cases where a claimed injury was caused by exposure to asbestos. In this case, we must determine whether the possession and control exception opens defendants to liability even in cases that do not involve asbestos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 13, 2012, Sean McLaughlin arrived at the Chuck E. Cheese restaurant located at the Festival at Riva Shopping Center in Annapolis, Maryland to repair the HVAC unit on the restaurant's roof. McLaughlin placed a ladder on one of the restaurant's exterior walls that he presumably thought led up to the building's roof. The wall enclosed an open-air garbage area typically occupied by dumpsters or trash compactors. After McLaughlin climbed the ladder, he mounted the wall\n   and fell 20 feet to the concrete pad on the other side. McLaughlin sustained severe injuries and died 12 days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Respondents Moreen Elizabeth Gilroy and McLaughlin's other survivors\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a wrongful death action in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against Petitioners SVF Riva Annapolis, LLC (\"SVF\"), the owner of the shopping center in which Chuck E. Cheese was located, and Rappaport Management Corporation (\"Rappaport\"), the shopping center's property manager. In federal court, SVF joined the tenant and restaurant operator, CEC Entertainment, Inc. (\"CEC\"), in a third-party complaint. Gilroy amended\n   her federal complaint to include CEC. The federal court dismissed the complaint without prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because the parties lacked complete diversity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Gilroy refiled the complaint against SVF, Rappaport, and CEC in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The complaint alleged, in negligence and premises liability claims, that all three defendants failed to warn McLaughlin that the wall had no roof access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   SVF and Rappaport filed separate motions for summary judgment and CEC filed a motion to dismiss. SVF and Rappaport both contended that the statute of repose barred Gilroy's claims because the building was completed in 1990, beyond the 20-year limit imposed by the statute, and because the possession and control exception applied only to asbestos cases. Additionally, Rappaport argued that as the property manager, it was not in \"possession and control\" of the property, and therefore not subject to liability. CEC moved to dismiss on the grounds that McLaughlin was contributorily negligent, and the action was untimely under Maryland's Wrongful Death Act, CJP \u00a7 3-904(g)(1). CEC also incorporated SVF's arguments regarding the statute of repose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After a hearing, the Circuit Court, ruling that the statute of repose applied, granted the motions for summary judgment and motion to dismiss and explained that the possession and control exception only applies to asbestos-related claims. The judge explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [T]he Court notes that subsection (d), while it has the language the plaintiff has pointed out, all relates to asbestos. And in this section it appears that the [L]egislature was clearly trying to create the carve out or the exception for the asbestos cases. And to read this otherwise would render the statute of repose, basically meaningless, and there would be no statute of repose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals reversed-holding that the possession and control exception is not limited to asbestos cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gilroy v.

In analyzing the operation of the statute of repose, we discussed CJP \u00a7 5-108(d) only in passing, in a footnote, and said: \" Section 5-108(d) provides an exception to the twenty-year period set forth in subsection (a) and the ten-year period set forth in subsection (b) for certain actions based on\n   <strong>\n    injuries arising from exposure to asbestos products.

Petitioners claim that this bolded language limits the (d)(2) possession and control exception to only asbestos cases. But we do not think the Court, while focusing on a different issue-whether the statute of repose defense applied to a contract claim-intended to establish a rule at odds with the plain language of subsection (d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Circuit Court, recognizing the existence of the disparate characterizations in\n   <em>\n    Hagerstown Elderly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rose\n   </em>\n   , explicitly indicated it relied upon\n   <em>\n    Hagerstown Elderly\n   </em>\n   partially because that case came after\n   <em>\n    Rose\n   </em>\n   . But neither case involved express consideration of the meaning of the possession and control exception. Instead, both cases included only a fleeting mention of the exceptions in CJP \u00a7 5-108(d). For this reason, we do not find either\n   <em>\n    Hagerstown Elderly\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Rose\n   </em>\n   to be particularly helpful in our analysis of the language of the possession and control exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Despite its proximity to three additional exceptions relating to asbestos, the possession and control exception makes no mention of asbestos. Furthermore, the exceptions are joined by the disjunctive \"or.\" This suggests that the provisions listed in CJP \u00a7\u00a7 5-108(d)(i)-(iv) set forth four independent exceptions to the statute of repose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thanos\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2079837\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/282/709/#p716\">\n    282 Md. at 716-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=387%20A.2d%20286\">\n    387 A.2d 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Burnett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12170868,12487750\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/230/24/\">\n    230 Md.

That exception unambiguously states that \"[t]his section does not apply if: [t]he defendant was in actual possession and control of the property as owner, tenant, or otherwise when the injury occurred.\" CJP \u00a7 5-108(d)(2)(i). For these reasons, we conclude that the possession and control exception applies even when\n   the claimed injury does not result from exposure to asbestos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We are not persuaded otherwise by Petitioners' argument that this interpretation nullifies the statute of repose for most classes of defendants. Our interpretation of the exception does not expand liability for builders, contractors, sellers, or others involved in the construction of improvements of real property. The possession and control exception, as the language indicates, only applies to those in possession and control of the real property as an owner, tenant, or otherwise.

This time, the Governor proposed two bills, Senate Bill 335 and House Bill 496. The purpose of these administration bills was to \"clarif[y] that a manufacturer or supplier of articles containing asbestos or other material which is reasonably dangerous that is part of an improvement to real property is not exempt from liability for damages or injury under certain conditions.\" Fiscal Note for S.B. 335, 1991 Leg., 405th Sess.

The Legislature passed, and the Governor signed, this legislation which amended the statute of repose to the form it appears today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The legislative history of the 1991 amendments to CJP \u00a7 5-108 in\n   <em>\n    Rose\n   </em>\n   makes no mention of any legislative debate regarding the possession and control exception at issue here. Indeed, a careful review of the Bill Files for both S.B. 335 and H.B. 496 shows no consideration of limiting the exception. Instead, the legislative history indicates that the General Assembly only intended to\n   <strong>\n    broaden\n   </strong>\n   -not limit-the exceptions to the statute of repose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   At oral argument, Petitioners asserted that the possession and control exception was first moved to subsection (d) in 1991, with the asbestos amendments. In fact, the possession and control exception was moved to subsection (d) in 1979 when the Legislature created a shorter limitation for architects\n   and engineers at subsection (b).\n   1979 Md. Laws, ch. 698. Even still, Petitioners provide no support from the legislative history for the assertion that the possession and control exception applies only in asbestos cases. Indeed, no such support exists-there is\n   <strong>\n    no\n   </strong>\n   discussion of the possession and control exception in\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   of the legislative history for the asbestos amendments. Petitioners maintain, however, that the Legislature's inclusion of the asbestos amendments in subsection (d) somehow meant that it intended to modify a core exception to the statute of repose that has existed since the statute's creation. We refuse to make such an interpretive leap.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Warden v.
