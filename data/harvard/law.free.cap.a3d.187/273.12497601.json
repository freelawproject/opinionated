The sole issue before the Court is whether Employer is entitled to subrogation of Claimant's third-party recovery. After review, we reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Claimant is employed as a patrol officer in Employer's police department. On November 30, 2013, Claimant was injured as a result of a work-related motor vehicle accident that occurred while Claimant was on duty and driving Employer's police vehicle. Employer issued a Notice of Temporary Compensation Payable (NTCP), thereby accepting Claimant's injury as compensable. The NTCP converted to a Notice of Compensation Payable (NCP) by operation of law. Claimant returned to work on January 10, 2014 with no loss in earnings. Employer is self-insured for Heart and Lung and WC benefits and has a separate account for each. For his period of disability, Claimant was paid benefits totaling $9,110.47 under what is commonly referred to as the Heart and Lung Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Employer also paid WC indemnity benefits pursuant to the NCP. Claimant signed the WC indemnity checks and returned them to Employer as required by law. In addition, Employer paid medical benefits for Claimant's work injury under the NCP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As a result of the November 30, 2013 work injury, Claimant filed a claim against a third-party motor vehicle policy. Claimant also made a claim against Employer's insurance policy for underinsured motorist benefits (UIM policy). Claimant settled these claims for $50,000.00. However, to obtain the settlement, Claimant incurred $16,601.42 in attorney fees and $195.85 in associated costs. Therefore, Claimant's net third-party recovery was $33,202.73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 13, 2015, Employer filed its Modification and Suspension Petitions, wherein it alleged that Claimant had returned to work and Employer was seeking subrogation reimbursement from Claimant's third-party recovery. The WCJ held hearings on February 2 and June 8, 2015. On September 22, 2015, the WCJ granted Employer's Petitions and ordered Claimant to pay Employer $5,137.83 to satisfy Employer's subrogation lien. Claimant appealed to the Board. On November 8, 2016, the Board affirmed the WCJ's decision. Claimant appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Initially, Section 1(a) of the Heart and Lung Act provides that a police officer injured in the performance of his duties and temporarily incapacitated from performing his duties by that injury, \"\n   <strong>\n    shall be paid\n   </strong>\n   \" his full rate of salary until the incapacity has ceased, as well as\n   <strong>\n    \"\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    a\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    ll medical\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    and hospital bills\n   </strong>\n   [ ] incurred in connection with any such injury[.]\" 53 P.S. \u00a7 637(a) (emphasis added).

However, Employer contends that, since it paid Claimant indemnity and medical benefits from its WC account, it is entitled to subrogation from Claimant's third-party recovery for those benefits. Claimant argues that because he was entitled to Heart and Lung Act benefits, it is irrelevant that Employer chose to pay Claimant's benefits from its WC account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This Court addressed a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania State Police v.

Employer responds that because the NCP issued to Claimant did not reference the Heart and Lung Act and because Employer kept the salary payments (under\n   Heart and Lung Act benefits) separate from medical benefits (under WC Act benefits), this case is distinguishable from both\n   <em>\n    Stermel\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bushta.\n   </em>\n   However, the Court in neither decision relied on the wording of the NCP to make its determination. In both cases, the employers were self-insured and argued that because they treated the medical payments as WC, they were entitled to subrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court in both decisions rejected this argument on the basis that the employers were going beyond the MVFRL by treating Heart and Lung Act benefits as WC benefits when the Heart and Lung Act specifically encompasses wages and medical benefits. It appears Employer is seeking to use its accounting method of separating the Heart and Lung benefits from the WC benefits as the basis to establish subrogation rights. However, the Heart and Lung Act expressly provides for wages and medical benefits, and, therefore, both are statutorily \"require[d;]\" thus, Employer's separate WC account does not entitle it to subrogation under the WC Act.\n   <em>\n    Bushta,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124242\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/149/118/\">\n    149 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   122 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   53 P.S. \u00a7 637(a). This fact is especially true here, where Employer required Claimant to endorse his WC checks to Employer. Contrary to Employer's argument, Employer appears to be the party seeking double recovery by requesting subrogation of these same payments. Accordingly, we hold that Claimant's third-party recovery is not subject to subrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For all of the above reasons, the portion of the Board's order directing Claimant to pay Employer $5,137.83 to satisfy Employer's subrogation lien is reversed.
