The trial court held that because the School Districts contracted with a private entity to collect delinquent real estate taxes under what is commonly referred to as the Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act (Tax Liens Act),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the delinquent amounts owed to the School Districts were not entitled to distribution as \"taxes\" under Section 205(d)(2) of the Real Estate Tax Sale Law (Tax Sale Law).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, they were to be assigned a fourth priority status as \"liens,\" to be paid only after all prior claims were paid in full. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties stipulated to the following facts. At all relevant times hereto, the School Districts contracted with Portnoff Law Associates (Portnoff) to collect delinquent real estate taxes owed to the School Districts, using the procedures authorized by the Tax Liens Act. On November 6, 2015, the Bureau exposed the following three properties to judicial sale: (1) tax parcel number 83-35-B71, located at 426 Jamestown Road, Mahoning Township, Carbon County; (2) tax parcel number 70C-12-72, located at 1100 and 1096 Main Road, Franklin Township, Carbon County; and (3) tax parcel number 123A-24-J33, located at 4 West Abbott Street, Lansford, Carbon County. Stipulation of Facts \u00b6 4; Reproduced Record at 130a, 132a, 134a (R.R. __). The judicial sale was conducted in accordance with the Tax Sale Law, and all three properties were sold to the highest bidder. Following the sale, the School Districts submitted a claim for their share of the proceeds for delinquent real estate taxes due on each property plus commissions, attorney fees, and other costs and expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stipulation of Facts \u00b6 5; R.R. 131a, 133a, 135a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 29, 2016, the Bureau filed petitions for confirmation of the judicial sales along with proposed schedules of distribution of the proceeds of the sales. Each distribution schedule included the county and the township's property tax claims but not the School Districts' tax claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The School Districts filed exceptions to the Bureau's petitions for confirmation of distribution, contending that proceeds generated by a sale under the Tax Sale Law must be distributed \"to the respective taxing districts in proportion to the taxes due\n   them.\" Exceptions to Bureau's Petition for Confirmation of Distribution, \u00b6 10; R.R. 31a, 41a, 51a. By not treating the delinquent amounts owed to the School Districts as taxes, the proposed schedules of distribution violated Section 205(d) of the Tax Sale Law. Alternatively, the School Districts argued that the face amount of the tax, penalty, and interest plainly constituted \"taxes,\" even if attorney fees and commissions did not qualify as such. The School Districts provided an itemized breakdown for the delinquent balances for each of the properties, including \"face/penalty, commission, interest, attorney's fees, costs, and notice expense.\" Exceptions, \u00b6 6; R.R. 30a, 40a, 50a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Bureau responded that the School Districts opted out of the Bureau's collection of real estate taxes under the Tax Sale Law when they hired Portnoff to collect delinquent taxes under the Tax Liens Act. The \"unavoidable consequence,\" the Bureau maintained, was that the School Districts' \"[Tax Liens Act] liens-which also include Portnoff Law Associates' commissions, legal fees and costs-do not qualify as taxes under [the Tax Sale Law], and therefore, are not payable as second-priority\n   <em>\n    taxes\n   </em>\n   under [Section 205(d)(2) of the Tax Sale Law].\" Bureau's Response to School Districts' Exceptions at 3; R.R. 92a (emphasis in original). The Bureau contended that the School Districts' claims are payable only \"to the extent that there are any excess funds available for payment of fourth-priority\n   <em>\n    liens\n   </em>\n   under [Section 205(d)(4) of the Tax Sale Law].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original). In support, the Bureau pointed to Section 102 of the Tax Sale Law, which defines \"taxes\" as \"all taxes, with added interest and penalties, levied by a tax district upon real property, including improvements.\" 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.102. The definition does not include commissions, attorney fees, and costs. To give the School Districts' \"inflated liens\" the priority of \"taxes\" under Section 205(d)(2) of the Tax Sale Law, the Bureau argued, would cause the county and the township \"to subsidize the additional costs of [the School Districts'] independent collection efforts under [the Tax Liens Act] by reducing their shares of the excess proceeds by the amount of [Portnoff's] various additional commissions, attorney fees, and costs under that statute.\" Bureau's Response to School Districts' Exceptions at 4; R.R. 93a. The Bureau maintained that such distribution would cause \"a fundamental unfairness\" upon the county and the township.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Court Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties stipulated to the material facts, and on November 18, 2016, the trial court heard oral argument. By opinion and order dated June 20, 2017, the trial court denied the School Districts' exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court acknowledged that the tax collection scheme set forth in the Tax Sale Law was optional, not mandatory, for the School Districts. However, it concluded that once they elected to \"opt out of the Bureau's collection services [under the Tax Sale Law],\" the Bureau \"is not authorized to act as the School Districts' agent for tax collection purposes.\" Trial Court op. at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The trial court also concluded that the School Districts' delinquent balances against the three properties were not \"tax claims\" because the commissions, attorney fees, costs and expenses included therein are not \"taxes\" under Section 102 of the Tax Sale Law. The trial court noted that Section 1 of the Tax Liens Act defines \"taxes\" to include \"reasonable attorney fees.\" 53 P.S. \u00a7 7101. Nevertheless, the trial court reasoned that this definition had no application to a judicial sale conducted under the Tax Sale Law. Trial Court op. at 11 (citing\n   <em>\n    Gordon v.

R.A.P. 1925(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The School Districts filed the statement on August 8, 2017, asserting that the trial court erred in holding that the School Districts' decision to collect real estate taxes under the Tax Liens Act \"transformed [their] taxes into something\n   <em>\n    other than taxes\n   </em>\n   for purposes of second priority status\" under Section 205(d)(2) of the Tax Sale Law. School Districts' 1925(b) Statement at 1-2 (emphasis in original). The School Districts further argued that the trial court ignored their alternative argument that, to the extent the commissions, attorney fees, and costs are not \"taxes,\" the remainder,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the face amount of the tax, together with penalties and interest, must be given second priority status under Section 205(d)(2) of the Tax Sale Law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. To hold otherwise would not \"effectuate a just and equitable result.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court issued an opinion pursuant to PA. R.A.P. 1925(a)(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   reiterating that the taxes owed to the School Districts, along with penalties and interest, were not entitled to distribution as tax claims under Section 205(d)(2) of the Tax Sale Law. Emphasizing that the School Districts chose to retain Portnoff to collect their delinquent real estate taxes, the trial court explained that \"[w]ithout the authority that is granted when a taxing district elects to utilize a tax claim bureau, the bureau could not collect any amount of tax for the School Districts on those properties.\" Trial Court 1925(a) op. at 10 (citing\n   <em>\n    City of Allentown v. Kauth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8951347\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/874/164/#p168\">\n    874 A.2d 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 168 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2005) ). The trial court held that the School Districts' claims must take fourth priority status under the Tax Sale Law as \"liens,\" for which funds were not available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On appeal to this Court, the School Districts argue that the trial court erred. They argue that their decision to collect delinquent taxes under the Tax Liens Act did not deprive them of their right to distribution of the proceeds realized by a judicial sale under the Tax Sale Law. For purposes of this appeal, the School Districts have decided to \"forego\" the argument that the commissions, costs, and attorney\n   fees incurred under the Tax Liens Act are also entitled to second priority status under the Tax Sale Law.

The Tax Liens Act was enacted in 1923 and governs,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the methods for levying and preserving municipal tax liens and the effect of judicial sales on liened property. In pertinent part, Section 1 of the Tax Liens Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides that \"all taxes\" imposed on real property by municipalities, including school districts,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   are \"a first lien\" on such property, subordinate only to tax liens imposed by the Commonwealth. 53 P.S. \u00a7 7102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Tax Sale Law was enacted in 1947 for the purpose of providing \"speedier and more efficient procedures for enforcing tax liens and to improve the quality of titles obtained at a tax sale.\"\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania Land Title Association v. East Stroudsburg Area School District\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8440643\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/913/961/#p968\">\n    913 A.2d 961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 968 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2006). The Tax Sale Law creates tax claim bureaus in each county (other than counties of the first and second class) and gives \"taxing districts,\" such as counties, townships, and school districts, the opportunity to return delinquent taxes to the bureaus for collection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Notably, the Tax Sale Law did not repeal the Tax Liens Act \"because it was not intended to be a substitute for the Tax Liens Act and did not establish a uniform and mandatory system of tax collection.\"\n   <em>\n    Pacella v.

Section 301 of the Tax Sale Law, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.301. Section 205(d) of the Tax Sale Law further provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (d)\n   <em>\n    It shall be the duty of the bureau to distribute all moneys collected as the result of any tax sale conducted under the provisions of this act, less the deductions authorized by subsection (c), in the following manner and according to the following priority\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (1) First, to the Commonwealth, by payment to the State Treasurer through the Department of Revenue, for satisfaction of tax liens of the Commonwealth only if the total amount of such liens or such portion thereof have been included in the purchase price and paid by the purchaser or the property is sold at judicial sale pursuant to this act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    Second, to the respective taxing districts in proportion to the taxes due them.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (3) Third, to taxing districts or municipal authorities for satisfaction of municipal claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (4) Fourth, to mortgagees and other lien holders, in order of their priority, for satisfaction of mortgages and liens as they may appear of record, whether or not discharged by the sale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (5) Fifth, to the owner of the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.205(d) (emphasis added). School Districts argue that Section 205(d)(2) of the Tax Sale Law required the Bureau to distribute the proceeds of the judicial sales proportionately to satisfy the tax delinquencies on the properties. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Section 205(d)(2) requires distribution to the \"respective taxing districts in proportion to the taxes due them.\" 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.205(d)(2). Section 102 of the Tax Sale Law defines \"taxing district\" as including \"any county, city, borough, incorporated town, township, home rule municipality, optional plan municipality, optional charter municipality,\n   <em>\n    school district\n   </em>\n   , institution district or any similar general purpose unit of government which may be created or authorized by statute....\" 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.102 (emphasis added). Section 102 further defines \"taxes\" as \"all taxes, with added interest and penalties, levied by a taxing district upon real property, including improvements.\" 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.102. Section 102 could not be any clearer: the School Districts are \"taxing districts\" and the real estate taxes owed to them, \"with added interest and penalties,\" are \"taxes\" for the purposes of the Tax Sale Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In holding that the School Districts' tax claims took fourth priority under the Tax Sale Law, the trial court erred. Both the Tax Liens Act and Tax Sale Law provide that \"all taxes\" imposed on real property by taxing districts, including school districts, are \"a first lien\" on real property, subordinate only to tax liens imposed by the Commonwealth. Section 1 of the Tax Liens Act, 53 P.S. \u00a7 7102 ; Section 301 of the Tax Sale Law, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.301.
