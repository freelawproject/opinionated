Count two sounded in unjust enrichment and was premised on the defendant's failure to reimburse the town for its expenditures in caring for the seized animals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly (1) applied an incorrect legal standard in deciding the motion to strike; (2) struck count one of the complaint on the bases that \u00a7 53-247 did not establish a duty or standard of care for purposes of maintaining a negligence per se action and that the plaintiffs are not among the class of persons protected by \u00a7 53-247 ; and (3) struck count two of the complaint on the basis that General Statutes \u00a7 22-329a (h) provides the exclusive remedy for the damages alleged by the plaintiffs,\n   thus precluding an action for unjust enrichment, and did so without considering and addressing the plaintiffs' argument that the defendant had stipulated in a prior action that the plaintiffs were entitled to seek damages without regard to \u00a7 22-329a. We disagree and affirm the judgment of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts, taken from the complaint, and procedural history are relevant to our consideration of the plaintiffs' claims. The plaintiffs received numerous complaints between July and November,\n   2015, that animals at the defendant's rescue facility were being abused and neglected. Weinhofer and an assistant animal control officer investigated the complaints, visiting the facility on several different dates. They observed that the facility was filthy and smelled overwhelmingly of feces and urine. Many cats and dogs were being kept in cages for extended periods under unsanitary and unhealthy conditions, and without proper access to food and water. Many animals could not stand up or turn around in their cages. The animals generally appeared to be in poor health and in obvious need of medical care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pursuant to a signed criminal search and seizure warrant, Weinhofer seized twenty-three cats, twenty dogs, one rabbit and one hamster from the defendant on December 1, 2015. The animals were evaluated by veterinarians. The majority of the animals had matted and unkempt coats, fleas, or other medical conditions, some requiring hospitalization. The town, in addition to paying for the animals' medical care, provided them with food, water, and shelter at the town's expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 17, 2015, the plaintiffs commenced an action in the Superior Court by verified petition in accordance with \u00a7 22-329a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petition sought an\n   order determining the legal status of the animals in the town's possession and requiring the defendant to reimburse the town for its expenses in caring for the seized animals. See\n   <em>\n    Plainville\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Almost Home Animal Rescue &amp; Shelter, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of New Britain, CV-15-6031669-S.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to a trial on the petition, however, the parties reached a stipulated agreement regarding custody of the seized animals, which was discussed at a hearing on January 22, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The stipulation was filed with the court on February 2, 2016. The agreement provided for the adoption of the seized animals by a number of interested third parties but contained no provision addressing reimbursement by the defendant to the town. On the day it was filed, the court,\n   <em>\n    Abrams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , accepted the stipulated agreement, made it an order of the court, and dismissed the action. As the court indicated on the record at the January 22, 2016 hearing, because the parties had agreed not to proceed with a hearing on the merits of the plaintiffs' petition, the court made no findings, either express or implied, that the seized animals had been abused or neglected by the defendant. Accordingly, it lacked the authority to order the defendant to reimburse the plaintiffs for any costs incurred in treating or boarding the seized animals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 8, 2016, the plaintiffs commenced this action. Both counts of the two count complaint sought\n   recovery from the defendant for expenses incurred by the\n   town in caring for the seized animals. As previously indicated, count one advanced a theory of common-law negligence based on the defendant's alleged violation of \u00a7 53-247 (a). Count two alleged that the defendant had been unjustly enriched as a result of the unreimbursed expenditures by the town in caring for the seized animals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 14, 2016, the defendant filed a motion to strike both counts of the complaint, arguing that each count failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. With respect to count one sounding in negligence per se, the defendant argued that the plaintiffs could not establish liability because the plaintiffs were not within the class of persons that \u00a7 53-247 (a) was intended to protect, nor had they suffered the type of injury the statute was designed to prevent. With respect to the unjust enrichment allegations in count two, the defendant argued that \u00a7 22-329a (h) provides the town an adequate remedy at law, and, therefore, the plaintiffs could not recover under the common-law principle of unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiffs filed a memorandum of law in opposition to the motion to strike in which they argued that \u00a7 53-247 (a) establishes a standard of care that applied to the defendant and that a violation of the statute constitutes negligence per se. The plaintiffs also argued that it would be improper for the court to decide by way of a motion to strike whether the plaintiffs are within the class of persons protected by the statute. With respect to the unjust enrichment count, the plaintiffs argued that the stipulated agreement that led to the dismissal of their previous action against the defendant included an understanding that the plaintiffs were not waiving any right to seek damages in a separate subsequent legal action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court,\n   <em>\n    Swienton, J.\n   </em>\n   , heard argument on the motion to strike on August 8, 2016. On August 18, 2016, the court issued a memorandum of decision granting the motion to strike as to both counts. With respect to count one, the court concluded that \u00a7 53-247\"fails to establish any kind of duty or standard of care, but instead provides for criminal penalties for violation of said statute.\" The court explained further that \u00a7 53-247 does not impose liability on a person who has engaged in animal cruelty to another person, entity, government, or the general public. Finally, the court indicated that to prevail on a claim of statutory negligence or negligence per se, the plaintiffs needed to demonstrate that they fell within the class of persons protected by the statute and that they were unable to do so in this case. Regarding the second count, the court reasoned that \u00a7 22-329a (h) provides the exclusive remedy for the damages sought by the town and recovery pursuant to the equitable doctrine of unjust enrichment is available only if there is no adequate remedy at law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiffs did not replead the stricken counts. On September 6, 2016, the defendant filed a motion for judgment on those counts in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 10-44. The court granted the motion on October 3, 2016, and rendered judgment in favor of the defendant. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiffs first claim that the court applied an improper legal standard in ruling\n   on the defendant's motion to strike. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that the court's decision rested on three factual conclusions\n   that required the court to impermissibly look beyond the pleadings themselves. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Whether the court applied the proper legal standard in ruling on the motion to strike presents a question of law over which we exercise plenary review. See\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4040713\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/103/69/#p74\">\n    103 Conn.

The legal standard applicable to a motion to strike is well settled. \"The purpose of a motion to strike is to contest ... the legal sufficiency of the allegations of any complaint ... to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.... A motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading, and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court....

Absent some clear indication to the contrary, we presume that the court properly applied that standard. See\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Firtel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147594\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/515/\">\n    293 Conn. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 532 n.17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=978%20A.2d%20487\">\n    978 A.2d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (declining to assume court applied different legal standard from that cited in decision). Furthermore, to the extent that the plaintiffs argue that the court somehow engaged in impermissible fact-finding rather than limiting its review to those facts alleged in the pleadings, we are not persuaded. What the plaintiffs refer to in their brief as the court's \"findings\" are actually legal conclusions germane to the court's evaluation of the legal sufficiency of the complaint. See discussion in parts II and III of this opinion. To the extent that the plaintiffs intended to raise a different claim, it is not readily discernible from their brief, and, therefore, we decline to engage in further review on the basis of an inadequate brief. See\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dept. of Public Utility Control\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2635515\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/266/108/#p120\">\n    266 Conn. 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 120,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=830%20A.2d%201121\">\n    830 A.2d 1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) (\"[a]nalysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to\n   brief the issue properly\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plaintiffs next claim that the court improperly struck count one of the complaint alleging negligence per se. The plaintiff advances two arguments in support\n   of this claim. First, according to the plaintiffs, the court incorrectly determined that \u00a7 53-247 did not establish a duty or standard of care for purposes of establishing negligence per se. Second, the plaintiffs assert that the court improperly determined that the plaintiffs were not among the class of persons protected by \u00a7 53-247, an inquiry that the plaintiffs maintain was not properly considered by the court in deciding the legal sufficiency of count one. We conclude that the court properly determined that the plaintiffs were not among the intended beneficiaries of \u00a7 53-247 and that that determination alone was a sufficient basis on which to strike count one. Accordingly, we do not reach the remainder of the plaintiffs' claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Because our review of a trial court's ruling on a motion to strike is plenary; see\n   <em>\n    Himmelstein\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Windsor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064864\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/116/28/#p33\">\n    116 Conn.

Specifically, the court was obligated to determine whether, as a matter of law, the plaintiffs had pleaded facts that, if proven, would demonstrate that they fell within the class of persons the statute is intended to protect.

The statute criminalizes a number of acts as constituting cruelty to animals and provides for the imposition of jail time or fines for any person who engages in such acts. There is absolutely no language in the statute, however, that discusses costs regarding the care of animals subjected to acts of abuse or neglect or whether violators of \u00a7 53-247 have any obligation to compensate a municipality or other party if they should provide assistance to the affected animals. As set forth in part III of this opinion, those issues are addressed in \u00a7 22-329a (h), which provides a direct remedy for a municipality seeking reimbursement for care that it provides to animals adjudicated as abused or neglected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We conclude, on the basis of our review of the statutory language, that \u00a7 53-247 was intended only to protect abused or neglected animals and to criminalize misconduct by their caretakers. The plaintiffs are not abused animals or the perpetrators of criminal conduct. Accordingly, the court properly determined that the plaintiffs fell outside of any class protected by or directly affected by the statute. Therefore, as a matter of law, the plaintiffs could not rely on \u00a7 53-247 as a basis for maintaining a negligence per se action against\n   the defendant. The plaintiffs have not cited to any specific language in the statute, other legal authority, or a factual allegation in the complaint that they contend could support a finding that they fall within the class of \"persons\" the statute was intended to protect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Furthermore, to the extent that the plaintiffs argue that they had no notice that the trial court would engage in this particular analysis in considering whether to grant the motion to strike, that argument is fully belied by the fact that the defendant raised this issue in its memorandum of law in support of the motion to strike. In sum, we conclude that the court properly granted the motion to strike count one of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, the plaintiffs claim that the court improperly granted the defendant's motion to strike count two of the complaint, which sounded in unjust enrichment, because it incorrectly determined that \u00a7 22-329a (h) provides the exclusive remedy for the damages alleged by the\n   plaintiffs and failed to consider and address the plaintiffs' argument that the defendant had stipulated in a prior action that the plaintiffs were entitled to seek damages later without regard to \u00a7 22-329a. For the following reasons, we reject the plaintiffs' claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"The right of recovery for unjust enrichment is equitable, its basis being that in a given situation it is contrary to equity and good conscience for the defendant to retain a benefit which has come to him at the expense of the plaintiff....

In\n   <em>\n    National CSS, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court held that an action for unjust enrichment could not be maintained by a taxpayer seeking a refund of personal property taxes because there was a statutory procedure available that was \"more than sufficient in providing the [taxpayer] a method by which a refund could be obtained. The [taxpayer] simply failed to take advantage of this statutory remedy in a timely manner, and now seeks to circumvent the state taxation scheme by way of the common law. The [taxpayer]'s failure to show that the existing remedy could not in itself have afforded [it] a refund, however, precludes it from now resorting to the common law.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=489%20A.2d%201034\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The plaintiffs' attempts to distinguish the present case from\n   <em>\n    National CSS, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Section 22-329a provides a remedy for a municipality seeking to recoup costs expended in caring for animals it has seized as a result of abuse and neglect. Subsection (h) of \u00a7 22-329a provides: \"If the court finds that the animal is neglected or cruelly treated, the expenses incurred by the state or a municipality in providing proper food, shelter and care to an animal it has taken\n   custody of under subsection (a) or (b) of this section and the expenses incurred by any state, municipal or other public or private agency or person in providing temporary care and custody pursuant to an order vesting temporary care and custody, calculated at the rate of fifteen dollars per day per animal or twenty-five dollars per day per animal if the animal is a horse or other large livestock until the date ownership is vested pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (g) of this section shall be paid by the owner or owners or person having responsibility for the care of the animal. In addition, all veterinary costs and expenses incurred for the welfare of the animal that are not covered by the per diem rate shall be paid by the\n   owner or owners or person having responsibility for the animal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The plaintiffs filed an action in accordance with \u00a7 22-329a but voluntarily agreed to settle that action prior to the court having adjudicated the animals either neglected or cruelly treated. The plaintiffs' choice to proceed in this manner precluded an order by the court directing the defendant to reimburse the plaintiffs pursuant to the statutory scheme. Accordingly, like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    National CSS, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   it was the plaintiffs' own actions that prevented them from recovering in accordance with the available statutory remedy. The plaintiffs advance no argument that the statutory scheme for reimbursement provided for in \u00a7 22-329a (h) is in any manner inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The plaintiffs nevertheless argue that \"the defendant agreed by stipulation that the plaintiffs would not be precluded from seeking additional avenues of recovery as part of a stipulation entered into by the parties and adopted by the court.\" That argument, however, lacks merit. Our review of the written stipulation that was filed and signed by the parties and made an order of the court contains no express agreement by the defendant regarding the plaintiffs' right to pursue other legal\n   actions against it. The plaintiffs appear to be relying on the trial court's statement at the January 22, 2016 hearing that preceded the filing of the stipulation, in which the court indicated its understanding that the plaintiffs were not waiving their right to pursue reimbursement by way of a separate action. The trial court never indicated, however, what type of action it believed the plaintiffs could pursue, and we construe the court's statement as simply an indication that the plaintiffs could attempt to pursue other legally appropriate actions, if any existed. Certainly, the trial court had no authority to sanction the filing of a cause of action that cannot be pursued as a matter of law. Because the plaintiffs cannot avail themselves of an action sounding in unjust enrichment in light of an adequate statutory remedy, the trial court properly granted the motion to strike count two of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The plaintiffs inadvertently included Meda Talley, the defendant's owner and operator, in the case caption of their complaint as if she were an additional party defendant. Both counts of the complaint, however, contained allegations directed at the defendant only and do not mention Talley. Shortly after the action was commenced, the plaintiffs filed a motion for correction of the case caption in which they clarified that it was not their intention to name Talley as a party defendant and that her name was included only because she was the defendant's agent for service of process. They requested that the court order the case caption changed to reflect the actual identity of the parties. The court granted that motion, and, therefore, we utilize the corrected case caption.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 22-329a (b) authorizes a municipal animal control officer to \"take physical custody of any animal upon issuance of a warrant finding probable cause that such animal is neglected or is cruelly treated ....\" Section 22-329a (c) provides in relevant part that, after taking custody of an abused animal pursuant to a valid warrant, \"[s]uch officer shall file with the superior court which has venue over such matter ... a verified petition plainly stating such facts of neglect or cruel treatment as to bring such animal within the jurisdiction of the court and praying for appropriate action by the court in accordance with the provisions of this section.
