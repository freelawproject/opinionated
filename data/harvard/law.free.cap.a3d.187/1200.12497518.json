We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In March, 2016, more than four years after he was sentenced, as aforesaid, for murder, the defendant filed three motions to dismiss the information under which he was convicted of that offense. In his first motion to dismiss, which he titled \"Motion Challenging Original Subject Matter Jurisdiction,\" the defendant alleged that the original trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his murder prosecution because the warrant under which he was arrested was based on evidence seized illegally pursuant to an invalid and illegally executed search and seizure warrant. In his second motion to dismiss, he alleged that the state had violated his right to a fair trial by obtaining without a warrant, and later using against him at trial, detailed\n   information concerning his trial strategy, which its agents had recorded on twenty-two CDs of his telephone conversations with others while he was in jail awaiting trial. In his third motion to dismiss, he alleged that the state had violated his rights to due process and a fair trial under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed. 2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963), by failing to disclose to him or his counsel exculpatory information concerning the arrest of the state medical examiner who had performed the autopsy\n   on the victim in his murder case. On July 6, 2016, the defendant also filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which he later amended on July 28, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court,\n   <em>\n    Clifford, J.\n   </em>\n   , heard argument on the foregoing motions, then ruled on them from the bench, on August 4, 2016. Initially addressing the defendant's three motions to dismiss, the court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over such motions because they did not fall within any of the narrow exceptions to the general common-law rule that a trial court loses jurisdiction over a criminal case after the defendant has begun to serve his sentence therein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, it\n   ordered that\n   each such motion be dismissed. Then, addressing the defendant's amended motion to correct an illegal sentence, the court first noted that, although a trial court retains jurisdiction over a criminal case, after the defendant has begun to serve his sentence in that case, to decide a proper motion to correct, under Practice Book \u00a7 43-22, in which the defendant challenges either the legality of his sentence or the legality of the manner in which that sentence was imposed, it has no jurisdiction under that rule to adjudicate any challenge to the legality of the underlying conviction on which the challenged sentence was imposed. To the extent that the motion to correct challenged the legality of the underlying conviction, the court ordered that that motion, like the defendant's three postjudgment motions to dismiss, must also be dismissed. Finally, the court turned to the one claim raised in the defendant's motion to correct over which it found that it had jurisdiction, to wit: that the trial court, in passing sentence on the defendant, had improperly relied on inaccurate information concerning his criminal record. The court rejected that claim on the merits, finding that the defendant had not proved either that materially inaccurate information had been presented to the trial court in\n   relation to his sentencing for murder or that the court had relied on such information in imposing sentence on him. With respect to that final aspect of the defendant's motion to correct, the court ordered that the motion be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant's first claim on appeal is that the trial court erred in dismissing\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   his first postjudgment motion to dismiss challenging the original trial court's subject matter jurisdiction over his murder prosecution. We conclude that the court correctly determined that it\n   lacked jurisdiction over this motion, and thus affirm its judgment dismissing the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"We have long held that because [a] determination regarding a trial court's\n   subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brundage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20740\">\n    320 Conn. 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 747,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20A.3d%20697\">\n    135 A.3d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"It is well established that under the common law a trial court has the discretionary power to modify or vacate a criminal judgment before the sentence has been executed....

Thus, violating the [defendant's] right to be sentence[d] by a judge relying on accurate information ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Citations omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The trial court acknowledged that it had jurisdiction over the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence on the basis of his claim that he had been sentenced on the basis of materially inaccurate\n   information. The court denied the motion because it found that the defendant failed to satisfy his burden of proving that the information was inaccurate or that the sentencing judge gave the allegedly inaccurate information explicit attention and that it affected the defendant's sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We agree with the court's conclusion that the defendant's claim is belied by the record. Our review of the August 26, 2011 sentencing transcript reveals that the court explicitly referenced only the defendant's pending charges for interfering with a police officer and illegal use of a firearm, and in fact that the court gave the defendant a degree of credit in sentencing because of his lack of a criminal record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, our review of the report reveals that the defendant's pending charges were\n   listed as violations of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-167a and 53-206d (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Last, we note that at the time of sentencing before the original trial court, when the defendant was asked if he wanted to make any changes to the report after having had an opportunity to review it with his trial\n   counsel, he requested no changes and otherwise raised no issue as to the accuracy of the report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the trial court reasonably determined that the sentencing court did not rely on inaccurate information in sentencing the defendant, and thus that the defendant's sentence was not imposed in an illegal manner. We conclude, on that basis, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying that limited portion of the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence over which it had subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The defendant alleged multiple grounds for the illegality of his sentence, including that the sentencing court relied on inaccurate information because the charging document, which was incorporated into the presentence investigation report (report), was based on a search warrant that was not properly executed; that the sentencing court considered inaccurate information in the report in the matter of two witnesses, Jennifer Matias and Christopher Benjamin; that the state's failure to disclose the twenty-two CDs was structural error because he was not able to use the information to argue in mitigation of his punishment; that the sentencing court's impartiality was called into question after the judge listened to the content of the twenty-two CDs, some part of which included comments about the judge; that the state's failure to disclose the arrest of the state medical examiner was structural error because he was not able to use the information to argue in mitigation of punishment; and that the sentencing court considered and relied on inaccurate information in the report, in particular, a pending felony charge.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    In the amendment, the defendant alleged that the trial court and the prosecutor had never sworn an oath of office, which omission he claimed constituted structural error, and rendered the sentence void and divested the court of jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Regarding the defendant's first motion, the court stated: \"[T]he law in Connecticut is that once the court sentences someone, which Judge Fischer did ... the trial court loses jurisdiction. We've now turned you over to the Department of Correction or, Judge Fischer did.... And the law is that the only way we can have further jurisdiction is if it's been conferred by the legislature or by our Practice Book .... But without a legislative or constitutional grant of jurisdiction, the court lacks it, except in the area of a motion to correct an illegal sentence under certain grounds. But that's not what's being claimed. This is a separate motion ... challenging original subject matter jurisdiction. Issues about arrest warrants being based on a search warrant that's not valid or fourth amendment and due process, this court has, you know-a motion to correct an illegal sentence is geared toward the, you know, toward the sentence and not even how you were convicted. There are other remedies for that. Direct appeals, potential habeas, et cetera. So, I'm-I have no jurisdiction, actually, to rule on your motion challenging the original subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Regarding the defendant's second and third motions, the court stated: \"Now, you have two motions to dismiss, which, I'm just warning you, I'm going to have a similar problem ...

I think there's things you claim in the presentence report that the court said something about you having a knife with a four inch serrated blade, but you indicate no knife was found and the [state medical examiner] could not say how long the-the blade was.
