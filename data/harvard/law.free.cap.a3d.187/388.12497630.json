The trial court concluded that the plaintiff had established aggrievement under General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   because the town\n   overvalued its property. The court then found a new valuation for the subject property and ordered the town to provide the plaintiff with the appropriate reimbursement or credit for any overpayment plus interest. In addition, the trial court also determined that the town's assessment was not manifestly excessive under General Statutes \u00a7 12-119.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the present appeal, the plaintiff claims that, although the trial court correctly determined that the plaintiff had established aggrievement by showing that the town's valuation of the property was excessive, it incorrectly (1) determined the true and actual value of the subject property, and (2) concluded that the town's valuation of the subject property was not manifestly excessive. We disagree and, accordingly,\n   affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following relevant facts and procedural history are set forth in the trial court's memorandum of decision. \"The subject property is a 1.45 acre improved parcel located [at] 940 South Quaker Lane in the town. The property abuts another parcel to the south, with which it was once merged, near the intersection of South Quaker Lane, which is to the west, and New Britain Avenue, which is to the south, in the Elmwood section of the town.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"The improvement on the subject property is a 12,805 square foot building originally constructed in 1949 as a movie theater. In 2003, a developer, Nixon Plainville, LLC, purchased the subject property and the adjoining property to the south for $2,500,000, formally subdivided them, and began to convert the building on the subject property into a Walgreens pharmacy. In appraisal terms, the property was of the 'build to suit' type.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The developer entered into a 'triple net' or 'NNN' lease with the plaintiff under which the plaintiff was responsible for the payment of all insurance, maintenance, and property tax expenses. The lease commenced in December, 2004, but the pharmacy did not open until 2006. The lease runs for seventy-five years, but the plaintiff can terminate it after twenty-five years and every five years thereafter. The rent is fixed at $430,000 per year for the term of the lease plus a small percentage of the gross sales. This rate converts to $33.58 per square foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"In 2006, the developer sold the subject property to Maple West Hartford, LLC, which has been described as an investor, for $6,718,750. There have been no further sales of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The pharmacy now has parking space for approximately [seventy-five] cars. Some of the parking space is shared with Webster Bank, which occupies the property to the south. There is no drive-up service window for the pharmacy. Although the pharmacy is not on the exact corner of South Quaker Lane and New Britain Avenue, it is near the corner. There is a full, two-way auto[mobile] access from and to South Quaker Lane. From New Britain Avenue, cars going westbound can make a right turn into a driveway, marked by a Walgreens sign, that goes behind the bank on the corner and into the [plaintiff's] parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The pharmacy is visible from the road from all directions except westbound. The westbound view from New Britain Avenue is blocked by the bank and a tree. The intersection of South Quaker Lane and New Britain Avenue has high traffic volume and has a traffic light.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In accordance with the town's statutory obligation; see General Statutes \u00a7 12-62 (b) (1) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the assessor conducted a town wide revaluation of all real estate for the grand list of October 1, 2011, and determined that the subject property had a fair market value of $5,020,000 and an assessment\n   value of $3,514,000. The plaintiff challenged the valuation and appealed to the board pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-111 (a). The board upheld the assessor's valuation, and the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 12-117a and 12-119.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its appeal to the Superior Court, the plaintiff's complaint contained two separate counts. In count one, the plaintiff alleged, pursuant to \u00a7 12-117a, that it was aggrieved by the actions of the board because the assessor's valuation of the property exceeded 70 percent of its true and actual value on the assessment date. In count two, the plaintiff alleged, pursuant to \u00a7 12-119, that the valuation was \"manifestly excessive and could not have been arrived at except by disregarding the provisions of the statutes for determining the valuation of the property.\" The plaintiff thus sought a reduction\n   in the amount of the tax and the valuation on which it had been based.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At trial, the plaintiff presented the testimony of two appraisers, Anthony Barna and Richard Michaud, who both valued the property at $3 million. The town presented the testimony of two appraisers: John Leary, who performed the revaluation for the town, and Christopher Kerin, who valued the property at $4,900,000. The trial court credited Kerin's testimony and determined that the true and actual value of the property was $4,900,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the court concluded that the assessor had overvalued the property by assigning it a true and actual value of $5,020,000. Accordingly, because the true and actual value was less than the value assigned by the assessor, the court found that the plaintiff had satisfied its burden of proving\n   aggrievement, and, therefore, the court found in favor of the plaintiff on count one. Addressing count two, the trial court found that the plaintiff had not met its burden of establishing that the assessment was manifestly excessive under \u00a7 12-119. The court then rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff on its \u00a7 12-117a count and in favor of the town on the plaintiff's \u00a7 12-119 count. The plaintiff appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its appeal from the \u00a7 12-117a count, the plaintiff claims that, although the trial court correctly concluded that it had established aggrievement by proving that the assessor had overvalued its property, the relief awarded was insufficient because the trial court improperly determined the true and actual value of the subject property. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the trial court improperly (1) applied General Statutes \u00a7 12-63b (b), (2) valued the leased fee interest, rather than the fee simple interest, and (3) selected too narrow a highest and best use for the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We begin with the principles governing municipal tax appeals. \" Section 12-117a, which allows taxpayers to appeal the decisions of municipal boards of [assessment appeals] to the Superior Court, provide[s] a method by which an owner of property may directly call in question the valuation placed by assessors upon his property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ... In a \u00a7 12-117a appeal, the trial court performs a two step function. The burden, in the first instance, is upon the plaintiff to show that he has, in fact, been aggrieved by the action of the board in that his property has been overassessed.... In this regard, [m]ere overvaluation is sufficient to justify redress under [ \u00a7 12-117a ], and the court is not limited to a review of whether an assessment has been unreasonable or discriminatory or has resulted in substantial overvaluation.... Whether a property has been overvalued for tax assessment purposes is a question of fact for the trier.... The trier arrives at his own conclusions as to the value of land by weighing the opinion of the appraisers, the claims of the parties in light of all the circumstances in evidence bearing on value, and his own general knowledge of the elements going to establish value including his own view of the property....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Only after the court determines that the taxpayer has met his burden of proving that the assessor's valuation was excessive and that the refusal of the board of [assessment appeals] to alter the assessment was improper, however, may the court then proceed to the second step in a \u00a7 12-117a appeal and exercise its equitable power to grant such relief as to justice and equity appertains .... If a taxpayer is found to be aggrieved by the decision of the board of [assessment appeals], the court tries the matter de novo and the ultimate question is the ascertainment of the true and actual value of the applicant's property.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Konover\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    West Hartford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"69204\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/242/727/#p734\">\n    242 Conn. 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 734-35,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=699%20A.2d%20158\">\n    699 A.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the present case, the trial court found that the plaintiff met its burden of proving that the assessor's valuation was excessive and that the board's refusal to alter the assessment was improper. The court then proceeded to the second step in the \u00a7 12-117a claim, namely, determining the appropriate relief based on the\n   true and actual value of the applicant's property. The plaintiff now challenges the trial court's judgment on the ground that the\n   trial court's finding regarding the true and actual value of the subject property was excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"In a tax appeal taken from the trial court to the Appellate Court or to this court, the question of overvaluation usually is a factual one subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review.... Under this deferential standard, [w]e do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. Rather, we focus on the conclusion of the trial court, as well as the method by which it arrived at that conclusion, to determine whether it is legally correct and factually supported.... Additionally, [i]t is well established that [i]n a case tried before a court, the trial judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given specific testimony.... The credibility and the weight of expert testimony is judged by the same standard, and the trial court is privileged to adopt whatever testimony [it] reasonably believes to be credible.... On appeal, we do not retry the facts or pass on the credibility of witnesses.... Simply put, a trial court is afforded wide discretion in making factual findings and may properly render judgment for a town based solely upon its finding that the method of valuation espoused by a taxpayer's appraiser is unpersuasive....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Conversely, we review de novo a trial court's decision of law. [W]hen a tax appeal ... raises a claim that challenges the propriety of a particular appraisal method in light of a generally applicable rule of law, our review of the trial court's determination whether to apply the rule is plenary.... To be sure, if the trial court rejects a method of appraisal because it determined that the appraiser's calculations were incorrect\n   or based on a flawed formula in that case, or because it determined that an appraisal method was inappropriate for the particular piece of property, that decision is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.... Only when the trial court rejects a method of appraisal as a matter of law will we exercise plenary review....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Thus, the starting point in any tax appeal taken from the Superior Court, including the present appeal, is a determination as to whether the trial court reached its decision through (1) the exercise of its discretion in crediting evidence and expert witness testimony, or (2) as a matter of law.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis omitted; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Redding Life Care, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Redding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%2087\">\n    308 Conn. 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 100-102,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20A.3d%20461\">\n    61 A.3d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiff first claims that the trial court did not properly apply \u00a7 12-63b (b)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   in valuing the subject property because the court considered the actual rental income under the lease (contract rent) in calculating the true and actual value of the property. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the trial court improperly rejected the appraisals submitted by the plaintiff's appraisers because they did not include consideration of the contract rent. The plaintiff asserts that the language of \u00a7 12-63b (b) does not mandate that the assessor consider contract rents, and that contract rent in the present case was not relevant to establish the true and actual value of the subject property in 2011 because the lease had been negotiated in 2003.

More specifically, the plaintiff's claim is that the trial court rejected the plaintiff's method of appraisal as a matter of law because the plaintiff's experts failed to consider both contract rent and market rent in the portion of their appraisals based on the income capitalization approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we conclude that our review of the trial court's decision is plenary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The following additional facts are necessary to resolve the plaintiff's claim. All three appraisers and the trial court used the income capitalization approach and the comparable sales approach to value the subject property. The trial court found that the two appraisals prepared by the plaintiff's experts did not consider the contract rent in their calculations based on the income capitalization approach to value the subject property pursuant to \u00a7 12-63b, whereas Kerin, the town's expert, did consider the contract rent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court explained as follows: \"Barna and Michaud, the plaintiff's appraisers, determined that the market rent for comparable triple net retail properties, which included stores in in-line shopping centers, averaged $20 and $22 per square foot, respectively. They calculated the subject property's contractual rent at $33.58 per square foot. They declined to adjust the market rate for their analyses because the contract rate was above market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Kerin, looking at pharmacies only, found the average market rental rate to be $32.16 per square foot. Because the contract [rental] rate of $33.58 [per square foot] was similar, he used a rate of $32 per square foot for the income capitalization analysis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The trial court then concluded: \"The analysis of Barna and Michaud did not comply with the statutory command to 'consider the actual rental income ....'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   General Statutes \u00a7 12-63b (b).\" The court explained: \"The court cannot interpret this [statutory] phrase to be meaningless or superfluous.... Yet that is what Barna and Michaud have done. Their only 'consideration' of the actual rental income was to mention it in their reports. They automatically rejected further consideration of actual rental income because in their opinion it was above the market. They did not attempt to reconcile contract rents and market rents, as did\n   Kerin. Essentially, Barna and Michaud gave the contract rents no substantive consideration at all.... Accordingly, the court cannot accept their approach.\" (Citations omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   General Statutes \u00a7 12-63 (a) provides in relevant part that, with certain enumerated exceptions not relevant to this appeal, \"[t]he present true and actual value of ... property shall be deemed by all assessors and boards of assessment appeals to be the fair market value thereof and not its value at a forced or auction sale.\" Section 12-63b (a) specifies three different methods of calculation to produce a valuation of the true and actual value of the property: \"(1) Replacement cost less depreciation, plus the market value of the land, (2) capitalization of net income based on market rent for similar property, and (3) a sales comparison approach based on current bona fide sales of comparable property....\" Only the income capitalization approach is at issue in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Section 12-63b (b) explains the meaning of \"market rent\" as it is used in the income capitalization approach. Specifically, \u00a7 12-63b (b) provides: \"For purposes of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section and, generally, in its use as a factor in any appraisal with respect to real property used primarily for the purpose of producing rental income, the term 'market rent' means the rental income that such property would most probably command on the open market as indicated by present rentals being paid for comparable space. In determining market rent the assessor\n   <em>\n    shall consider the actual rental income applicable with respect to such real property under the terms of an existing contract of lease at the time of such determination\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Notwithstanding this statutory language, the plaintiff asserts that \u00a7 12-63b (b) does not require that contract\n   rents be considered by an appraiser. In particular, the plaintiff argues that if the contract is a long-term contract, as it is in this case, it does not reflect the current market rent for the property. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    First Bethel Associates\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bethel\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"740874\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/231/731/\">\n    231 Conn. at 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=651%20A.2d%201279\">\n    651 A.2d 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court considered and rejected a claim similar to the one raised in the present appeal. In that case, the defendant, the town of Bethel, claimed that the assessor must consider contract rent, but only if it is equivalent to the market rent, whereas, the plaintiff, First Bethel Associates, claimed that the trial court should have considered contract rent only, and not market rent, in its determination of the market value utilizing the income capitalization approach. Id., at 737-38,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=651%20A.2d%201279\">\n    651 A.2d 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This court rejected both of these contentions and, instead, concluded that \"the statute requires that, in determining a property's 'market rent,' the assessor and, therefore, the court, in determining the fair market value of the property, must consider\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   (1) net rent for comparable properties, and (2) the net rent derived from any existing leases on the property. This legislative approach makes sense because it reflects the reality that a willing seller and a willing buyer-whose ultimate judgments are what we mean by 'fair market value'-would themselves consider in arriving at a price for the property that is\n   subject to leases that do not closely approximate current rentals for similar properties.\" (Emphasis in original; footnote omitted.)

Such a construction, however, would mean that contract rent would factor into the analysis only if it had no effect on the overall valuation, rendering meaningless the direction of \u00a7 12-63b (b) to consider actual rental\n   income. Similarly, [First Bethel] Associates' argument that only contract rent should be considered ignores the statute's direction to take into account what the property would most probably command on the open market .... It is a well established rule of statutory construction that we will not read a statute in such a way as to render a portion of it superfluous.... Therefore, we reject the parties' proposed constructions because they each would render a portion of the statute mere surplusage.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)

The plaintiff claims that a long-term lease negotiated\n   eight years prior to the revaluation is irrelevant. We disagree. Neither the amount of time that has passed since the lease was negotiated nor the length of the lease is a factor contemplated in \u00a7 12-63b (b). To the contrary, \u00a7 12-63b (b) requires the consideration of \"the actual rental income applicable with respect to such real property under the terms of an existing contract of lease at the time of such determination.\" In the present case, the trial court relied on an expert who considered the contract rent due under a lease that existed in 2011. The plaintiff does not claim that the lease was not in effect in 2011, or that the amount Kerin used as the contract rent was incorrect. Therefore, in considering contract rent, the trial court complied with \u00a7 12-63b (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In sum, the trial court correctly concluded that \u00a7 12-63b (b) requires that a valuation based on the income capitalization approach consider both contract rents and market rents. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court correctly rejected the income capitalization analyses presented by the plaintiff's experts, who did not comply with \u00a7 12-63b (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The plaintiff also claims that the trial court improperly valued the leased fee interest in the subject property, rather than the fee simple interest. Specifically, the plaintiff asserts that the trial court \"erred as a matter of law by incorrectly characterizing the 'fee simple' interest [by] conflating the definitions of 'fee simple' and 'leased fee.' \" It contends that the trial court did not value the proper interest. The town asserts that the trial court did not value the leased fee interest of the subject property, but instead correctly applied the law to determine the \"true and actual value\" of the property. We agree with the town.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We begin with the appropriate standard of review. As we have explained previously in this opinion, \"when a tax appeal, like the present one, raises a claim that challenges the propriety of a particular appraisal method in light of a generally applicable rule of law, our review of the trial court's determination whether to apply the rule is plenary.\"\n   <em>\n    Breezy Knoll Assn., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3960413\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/286/766/#p776\">\n    286 Conn. at 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=946%20A.2d%20215\">\n    946 A.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The trial court explained that \"[t]he General Statutes do not specifically address the nature of the property interest that the town should assess, but instead only require an assessment of the 'true and actual value of real property ....' \" The trial court further explained that \"[b]oth parties to this case actually agree that the town should assess the fee simple interest in real property. They disagree, however, on the meaning of a fee simple interest.\" Ultimately, the trial court reasoned\n   that \"what the town really seeks to tax is not the actual value of the lease in place but rather the capacity or potential of the real property to be leased. That characteristic is not contractual or transitory but rather inheres in the property.\" Thereafter, the trial court engaged in an analysis of \u00a7 12-63b (b), which we discussed in part I A of this opinion, and concluded that both contract rents and market rents must be considered to determine the true and actual value of the subject property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The plaintiff does not clearly explain its claim that trial court improperly valued the leased fee interest. Nevertheless, after considering the plaintiff's brief in combination with its oral argument before this court, we construe the plaintiff's claim to be that the trial court's consideration of the actual rents when determining the true and actual value of the subject property led to an improper valuing of the leased fee interest, rather than the fee simple interest. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Before analyzing this claim, it is helpful to identify the distinctions between the fee simple interest, the leasehold interest and the leased fee interest. The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal defines \"fee simple interest\" as \"[a]bsolute ownership unencumbered by any other interest or estate, subject only to the limitations imposed by the governmental powers of taxation, eminent domain, police power, and escheat.\" Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal (6th Ed. 2015) p. 90.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Leasehold interest\" is defined as \"[t]he right held by the lessee to use and occupy real estate for a stated term and under the conditions specified in the lease.\" Id., p. 128. \"Leased fee interest\" is defined as \"[t]he ownership interest held by the lessor, which includes the right to receive the contract rent specified in the lease plus the reversionary right when the lease expires.\" Id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As we have explained previously in this opinion, General Statutes \u00a7 12-62a (b) requires the assessment to be based on the \"true and actual value\" of the plaintiff's property. The \"true and actual value\" is further defined as the \"fair market value.\" General Statutes \u00a7 12-63 (a). As we explained in part I A of this opinion, \u00a7 12-63b (b) requires the consideration of both contract rents and market rents to determine the fair market value under the income capitalization approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The plaintiff's claim in the present case is similar to the issue addressed by this court in\n   <em>\n    Sheridan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Killingly\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3667387\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/278/252/#p260\">\n    278 Conn. at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=897%20A.2d%2090\">\n    897 A.2d 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In other words, we recognized that a leased property might have a fair market value that exceeds the capitalized value of the actual rental income and that excess value may be taken into account in assessing the true and actual value of the property for purposes of taxing the owner, even though the tenant receives the economic benefit of that excess value. In taking that excess value into account, the town [of Killingly] does not thereby tax the property owner for a property interest that belongs to the lessee. Rather, [it] uses the excess value as an\n   <em>\n    indicator\n   </em>\n   of the true and actual value of the owner's interest.\" (Emphasis in original; footnote omitted.)

Therefore, the trial court's consideration of the value of the leasehold interest as one factor utilized to arrive at the true and actual value of the plaintiff's property is authorized and required by the statutory scheme. Furthermore, the trial court was able to consider the value of the leasehold interest in connection with the other substantial evidence regarding the true and actual value of the subject property. On the basis of all of the testimony and evidence presented at trial, the trial court determined the true and actual value of the subject property consistent with the statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Thus, on the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court properly considered the leasehold interest as one indicator of the true and actual value of the owner's interest in the subject property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The plaintiff asserts that the trial court incorrectly selected too narrow a highest and best use of the subject property.

Kerin was of the opinion that \"the highest and best use of the subject property as improved real estate is for continued present use of the subject property as a retail pharmacy.\" Kerin based that conclusion on the following: the fact that the property's improvements were designed and constructed to the plaintiff's specifications; the continued legal feasibility of the present use under West Hartford zoning laws; the continued physical feasibility of the present use because the subject improvements were in good condition; the continued financial feasibility of the present use; and the fact that their highest and best\n   use determination reflects that \"[t]here is no alternative use to which the subject property could be put [that] would yield a higher present value indication.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   By contrast, the plaintiff's appraisers, Michaud and Barna, reached a more generalized conclusion.

A review of the court's analysis demonstrates that it rejected the city's highest and best use determination because that determination allowed the city to violate a previous decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which had concluded in a previous case that \" 'the assessor must use the market rent, not the contract rent' \" to value retail property leased at above market rents.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207151754\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    quoting\n    <em>\n     Walgreen Co.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Madison\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8185463\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/311/158/#p198\">\n     311 Wis. 2d 158\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 198,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8185463\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/311/158/#p198\">\n     752 N.W.2d 687\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2008). Specifically, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals determined \"that where contractual rights inflate the value of leased retail property, assessors must look to the market to reach their valuations.

The plaintiff also cites to a similar case from Indiana,\n    <em>\n     Shelby County Assessor\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     CVS Pharmacy, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7096025\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/994/350/\">\n     994 N.E.2d 350\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Ind.

In that case, the Indiana Tax Court concluded that the Indiana Board of Tax Review correctly rejected an assessor's conclusion that the contractual rent of a stand-alone drugstore should be used in the income approach under Indiana law. Because Connecticut law requires the consideration of both market and contract rent for valuations pursuant to \u00a7 12-63b (b), we conclude that\n    <em>\n     Oshkosh\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Shelby County Assessor\n    </em>\n    are inapplicable to the present case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    The plaintiff asserts that a plenary standard of review should apply to the trial court's highest and best use determination because the trial court improperly valued the leased fee interest rather than the fee simple interest and this incorrect legal conclusion impacted its determination of the highest and best use. We disagree. It is well established that a trial court's determination of the highest and best use of property is a factual determination subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review. Furthermore, we conclude in part I B of this opinion that the trial court did not value the incorrect interest in the property. Instead, consistent with this court's analysis in\n    <em>\n     Redding Life Care, LLC\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Redding\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%2087\">\n     308 Conn. at 102\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20A.3d%20461\">\n     61 A.3d 461\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , we conclude that \"the trial court reached its decision [on the highest and best use of the subject property] through ... the exercise of its discretion in crediting evidence and expert witness testimony ....\" Accordingly, we conclude that the clearly erroneous standard of review is applicable to the plaintiff's claim regarding the highest and best use of the subject property.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Michaud's appraisal, citing a treatise authored by the Appraisal Institute, defined \"highest and best use\" as follows: \"The reasonably probable and legal use of vacant land or an improved property that is physically possible, appropriately supported and financially feasible and that results in the highest value.\" See Appraisal Institute, The Appraisal of Real Estate (13th Ed. 2008). Barna provided the exact same definition, but cited to a more recent edition of the same source. See Appraisal Institute, The Appraisal of Real Estate (14th Ed. 2013). Kerin, citing the Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal (5th Ed. 2010), used the following substantially similar definition: \"[T]he use that should be made of a property as it exists. An existing improvement should be renovated or retained as is so long as it continues to contribute to the total market value of the property, or until the return from a new improvement would more than offset the cost of demolishing the existing building and constructing a new one.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    In determining the highest and best use of the subject property, the trial court also explained that \"[p]roperties of this type tend to attract investors in 'like kind' exchanges.

We disagree with the plaintiff's contention. The trial court merely mentioned \u00a7 1031 as one factor in deciding the highest and best use of the subject property. The trial court's consideration of the attractiveness of the existing triple net lease arrangement of the subject property was not clear error. To the contrary, there was ample evidence in the record to support the trial court's finding regarding the marketability of these properties. Specifically, Kerin testified: \"The single tenant triple net property is very attractive to people who are doing \u00a7 1031 like kind exchanges. It's easy to identify properties. It's simple to understand ... there's not a lot of due diligence [that is] required, that may be required in a multi-tenant property. In a multi-tenant property, you've got to go through the whole shopping center to ... see what needs to be fixed up. On the single tenant [triple] net leased property, the tenant is responsible for the property. And, again, it's very simple to understand. You find a lot of \u00a7 1031 exchange buyers active in this national market.\" Accordingly, it was not clear error for the trial court to consider this evidence when determining the highest and best use of the subject property because it demonstrates what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
