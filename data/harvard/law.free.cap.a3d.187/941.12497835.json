(\"Appellee\"). After careful review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellee's Mother (\"Mother\") believed Appellee and his twin brother, D.B., had engaged in sexual misconduct involving a 9-year-old girl who lived in a neighboring apartment. On April 29, 2015, after confronting Appellee and D.B. about her suspicions, Mother reported the allegations to Appellee's school district because she was concerned about Appellee's inappropriate sexual behavior. Lieutenant Steve Caskey of the Bradford Police Department contacted Mother and asked her to bring Appellee and D.B. into the station for an interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mother complied and voluntarily brought 14-year-old Appellee and D.B. to the Bradford Police Department to be interviewed about the sexual misconduct allegations. Upon arriving at the police station, Lieutenant Caskey brought Mother, Appellee, and D.B., into an interview room and turned on recording equipment with Mother's permission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lieutenant Caskey read\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   warnings and explained that, while Mother could be present for the interviews, he preferred to interview the boys individually and alone. Mother agreed and Lieutenant Caskey first interviewed Appellee alone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellee fully complied with his Mother's instructions, confessed to numerous sex acts involving the nine-year-old girl, answered all of Lieutenant Caskey's questions, and agreed to speak with Lieutenant Caskey again if necessary. Lieutenant Caskey then questioned D.B. about the allegations, and D.B. similarly complied with his Mother's instructions, confessed to numerous sex acts involving the nine-year-old girl, and answered each of Lieutenant Caskey's questions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 16, 2015, the Commonwealth filed a written allegation of delinquency based on Appellee's confession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 1, 2015, Appellee filed a Motion to Suppress his confession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 17, 2016, the suppression court conducted a hearing at which Mother, Lieutenant Caskey, and Appellee testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mother described Appellee's developmental delays and constant difficulties in school. She described the circumstances of her report to police and how she brought Appellee to the police station to confess his crimes. She stated that she repeatedly told\n   Lieutenant Caskey that she wanted to get Appellee the help and treatment he needed, in addition to the consequences for his actions. Mother explained that she did not believe Appellee knew that he could refuse to answer Lieutenant Caskey's questions or leave the police station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellee testified that he was in 7th grade in 2015, that he was \"behind\" in school, and that he was older than most of his classmates. N.T., 2/17/16, at 48, 68. Appellee described the problems he was having in school, including difficulty paying attention, learning, and understanding his teacher's instructions.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 49.

Appellee also stated that he was receiving mental health treatment in school.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 48. Appellee also testified that, in 2015, he did not know anything about the legal system.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellee explained that he did not understand that he could refuse to answer Lieutenant Caskey's questions or leave the police station. Appellee claimed that he believed he had no choice but to comply with his Mother's instructions and confess his crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Lieutenant Caskey testified about the circumstances of Appellee's confession, including the oral waiver of rights by Appellee, his twin brother, and his Mother. Lieutenant Caskey explained that he recorded the interview with permission, and the Commonwealth introduced the recorded interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Lieutenant Caskey \"kept a rational, calm demeanor and was forthright with Mother, [Appellee], and [Appellee's] twin brother.\" Suppression Court Opinion, dated 3/14/16, at 5. Lieutenant Caskey did not yell at or threaten Appellee, and Lieutenant Caskey did not restrain Appellee in any way.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Although the door was closed during questioning, it was not locked.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 2.

In its accompanying Opinion, the trial court set forth its findings of fact and conclusions of law, before concluding that, based on the totality of the circumstances, Appellee had not waived his\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   rights knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently. Suppression Court Opinion, dated 3/14/16, at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 8, 2016, the Commonwealth filed a timely appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both the Commonwealth and the suppression court complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Commonwealth presents one issue for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Did the trial court [err] in granting [Appellee's] Motion to Suppress where [Appellee] consulted with his mother prior to police questioning, and where his mother voluntarily brought [Appellee] to the police station, and where [Appellee]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   and his mother were both read their\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   rights, with each indicating that they understood these rights?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Commonwealth's Brief at 5 (capitalization omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In its sole issue on appeal, the Commonwealth argues that the suppression court erred in granting Appellee's Motion to Suppress because the totality of the circumstances shows that Appellee confessed after a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his rights in his Mother's presence.

Suppression Court Opinion, dated 3/14/16, at 4-5. Because we are bound by the suppression court's credibility determinations regarding Appellee, we agree that Appellee did not knowingly waive his\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   rights.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re T.P.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7305446\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/78/1166/#p1169\">\n    78 A.3d 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1169 (Pa.

Appellee, a juvenile with developmental delays, did not attach any significance to these warnings, aside from his associating them with a familiar television show.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Throughout their time at the police station, Appellee's Mother instructed Appellee to \"be brave,\" \"tell the truth,\" and admit his crimes to Lieutenant Caskey. Appellee did not understand that he could refuse to answer Lieutenant Caskey's questions, leave the station freely, or request an attorney. N.T., 2/17/16, at 47-48, 50, 54-59. Appellee only participated in the interview because \"he believed he was forced to be there by his mother and that he was directed to confess.\" Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) Opinion, dated 7/1/16, at 4-5. This\n   finding is amply supported by the certified record and the totality of circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The suppression court afforded Appellee's testimony great weight and found Appellee credible. Insofar as the Commonwealth attempts to undermine various findings by referring to testimony as \"self-serving statements\" and \"bald assertions\" unsupported by documentary evidence,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Commonwealth's Brief at 18, such arguments conflict with our standard of review.

Lieutenant Caskey, who was wearing a police uniform, maintained a rational, calm demeanor during the duration of the interview; he did not yell at or threaten Appellee. Trial Court Opinion, 3/14/16, at 2-3. Prior to Appellee's interview, Lieutenant Caskey read\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   warnings to him, his brother and Mother; all three verbally assented to answering Lieutenant Caskey's questions. Lieutenant Caskey explained to Mother, in the presence of Appellee, her right to be present during the interview, but that he preferred to interview Appellee alone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lieutenant Caskey also informed Mother that the interview could result in the Commonwealth bringing charges against Appellee. Mother had many opportunities to confer with Appellee before his one-on-one interview with Lieutenant Caskey,\n   and Lieutenant Caskey did not bar her from returning to the office at any time. Lieutenant Caskey did not lock the office door. Appellee, at no point during his individual interview, asked to end the interview or to confer with his Mother or an attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Additionally, there was no indication from Appellee or Mother that he was not aware of his surroundings or that he did not understand what was occurring. Appellee, who was fourteen years of age at the time of the interview, had a normal physical appearance and was responsive to Lieutenant Caskey during the interview. Appellee did not appear to be under the influence of any substance that would alter his responses or otherwise inhibit his understanding of the situation. Furthermore, Mother never raised a concern regarding Appellee's alleged intellectual challenges and/or developmental delay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   At Appellee's suppression hearing, he and Mother testified that his intellectual challenges prevented him from knowingly and voluntarily waiving his\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   rights. However, the only evidence in the record suggesting Appellee suffers intellectual challenges is said testimony. Appellee did not present documentation that he had an Individualized Education Plan (\"IEP\") at school, testimony from an expert that had evaluated Appellee (e.g., school counselor, psychiatrist, etc.), documentation evidencing a formal diagnosis of developmental delay or other clinical diagnoses, and/or any other evidence establishing that Appellee is intellectual challenged. In fact, when asked about the subject at Appellee's suppression hearing, Mother conceded that Appellee had not been formally diagnosed with any intellectual or psychological impairments:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   COMMONWEALTH: Does [Appellee] have any issues you are aware of in terms of learning, mental health issues, anything of that nature?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   MOTHER: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   COMMONWEALTH: [W]hat kind of issues does [Appellee] have in terms of learning?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   MOTHER: I would[ ] [not] know the exact terms for them.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     He[ ] [is] still in the process of evaluations and being diagnosed\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and he's just always-he's always struggled. He's basically been behind.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   N.T. Suppression Hearing, 2/17/16, at 20 (emphasis added). Instantly, the only evidence of record that Appellee suffers intellectual challenges that render him incapable of understanding his\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   rights is his and Mother's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Assuming Appellee is in fact \"intellectually challenged,\" the Majority takes the position, which is unsupported by the record, that such challenges are determinative of an unknowing waiver of his\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   rights. The majority's determination is inconsistent with our Supreme Court's refusal to adopt a per se rule of inability to waive constitutional rights based solely on mental and physical deficiency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Specifically, the majority ignores that even a person of below average mental ability may knowingly and intelligently waive a constitutional right.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Rather, the Majority adopts a post hoc determination that Appellee's waiver of his\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   rights, relinquished in the presence of an interested adult, was somehow unknowing. I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Lastly, the trial court stated that the factor that weighed most heavily in determining that suppression was necessary was Appellee's \"own testimony that he believed he was forced to be there by his mother and that he was directed to confess.\" Trial Court Opinion, 6/1/16, at 4-5. In fact, the trial court \"found this factor to be the one that skewed the totality of the circumstances in favor of suppression.\" However, the fact that Mother encouraged Appellee to confess is of no consequence, as Mother's plea that Appellee tell the truth did not constitute state action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Under relatively rare circumstances, the actions of private citizens may be impliedly ratified with the authority of the state.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Even so, the mere use by police and/or prosecutors of the results of an individual's actions does not per se serve to \"ratify\" those actions as conduct of the state. The test by which we determine whether an action was \"under the color\" of state law is well settled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   First, the deprivation must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the state[.] ...

This diagnosis involves reconsideration following a phase of time.\" Global Developmental Delay DSM-5 315.8 (F88), Helen Okoye, MD, MBA, MS-Epi, https://www.theravive.com/therapedia/global-developmental-delay-dsm%C2%AD--5-315.8-(f88) (last visited 4/11/18).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Even assuming Mother were a state actor, the record does not support a finding that her directive that Appellee \"tell the truth\" amounts to intimidation, coercion or deception that would invalidate the voluntariness of Appellee's confession.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Knox\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    ,\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      supra.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    Simply encouraging a juvenile to tell the truth comports with the basic purpose of conducting an interview, and truthfulness is a fundamental tenet of the juvenile justice system.
