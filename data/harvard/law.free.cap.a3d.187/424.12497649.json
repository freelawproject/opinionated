Vega, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of the following six offenses: (1) murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a(a) ; (2) home invasion in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100aa(a)(2) ; (3) burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101(a)(3) ; (4) attempt to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49(a)(2) and 53a-54a ; (5) attempt to commit assault in the first degree\n   in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49(a)(2) and 53-59(a)(5); and (6) carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35(a). On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court (1) abused its discretion by admitting out-of-court statements as spontaneous utterances pursuant to \u00a7 8-3(2) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence ; (2) abused its discretion by excluding a letter that contained statements that were against the author's penal interest; and (3) improperly admitted hearsay statements from an unavailable witness in violation of his sixth and fourteenth amendment right to confrontation. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On the night of March 2, 2010, a group of people\n   gathered in an apartment located at 53 Prest Street in New London, a second floor apartment that belonged to Michael Ellis, Sr. (Ellis, Sr.), who resided there with Lisa DeMusis (L. DeMusis), Nicholas DeMusis (N. DeMusis), Michael Ellis, Jr. (Ellis), and Altareika Parrish. On March 2, present in the apartment in addition to those who resided there, were Rahmel Perry, Shariymah James, Alice Phillips, Jessica Winslow and Keyireh Kirkwood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Between midnight and 12:30 a.m. on the morning of March 3, 2010, Ellis, Perry, James, Phillips, Winslow, and Kirkwood left the apartment and went to a bar in New London called The Galley. While at the bar, Krystal Taylor and Tamika \"Missy\" Guilbert joined the group. Also present at the bar were the defendant and a few of his associates. Shortly after Ellis arrived at the bar, he was standing next to Kirkwood. Kirkwood and the defendant have a child together, but she is also a friend of Ellis and many of his associates. Soon after Ellis began standing next to Kirkwood, the defendant motioned toward Ellis to direct him to step away from\n   Kirkwood. When Ellis did not move away from Kirkwood, the defendant approached Ellis and punched him in the face. A fight then broke out in the bar between the two groups, during which Perry began punching and kicking the defendant. That fight was broken up and both groups exited the bar. The defendant was undoubtedly on the losing end of the fight. Outside of the bar, another altercation ensued between the two groups, which was quickly broken up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After both groups left the bar, Ellis, Perry, Parrish, Taylor, Kirkwood, Phillips, James, and Guilbert returned to the Prest Street apartment at approximately 1:30 a.m. Ellis, Sr., L. DeMusis, N. DeMusis, and Shauntay Ellis were also present at the apartment when the group returned from the bar. At approximately 2 a.m., the group heard a commotion at the back door, through which two men entered the apartment. They were armed, one with a revolver and the other with an automatic or semiautomatic handgun. Both men were dressed in all black clothing and had their heads and faces covered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant, who was the first intruder into the apartment, proceeded directly to the living room where Ellis and Perry were located. He pulled down his mask and ordered everyone in the room to get on the floor. Ellis and Taylor were standing close to a window in the living room. Upon hearing the men enter the apartment, Taylor jumped out the window. The defendant then fired toward the window, in Ellis' direction, but did not hit Ellis. He then fired two shots at Perry, who was on the couch. Both shots struck Perry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Meanwhile, Ellis ran out of the living room and toward the back door where the men had entered. He briefly scuffled with the second intruder, who appeared to reach for a gun. As Ellis was running down the stairs,\n   a shot was fired at him, but did not hit him. Ellis proceeded to run from Prest Street to Blackhall Court. The intruders left the apartment and chased Ellis, firing approximately four shots. Ellis was struck twice, once in the thigh and once in the back. Ellis proceeded to run onto Blackhall Street where he called 911. While he was on Blackhall Street, Ellis flagged down a police officer, Justin Clachrie, who was en route to the apartment at 53 Prest Street. Within minutes, an emergency medical services vehicle arrived and transported Ellis to Lawrence + Memorial Hospital (hospital).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the apartment, Phillips called 911 and stated that Perry had been shot. Those who remained at the apartment then carried Perry to Shauntay Ellis' vehicle. Shauntay Ellis and Phillips drove Perry to\n   the hospital in Shauntay Ellis' vehicle. Perry was unconscious when he arrived at the hospital, and medical personnel made efforts to resuscitate him. Those efforts were unsuccessful, however, and Perry was pronounced dead. An autopsy revealed that a gunshot wound caused Perry's death, and the medical examiner ruled his death a homicide. Although Ellis' injuries were life-threatening, medical personnel were able to stabilize him in the emergency department. He remained in the hospital for approximately one week and then was released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the police arrived at the Prest Street apartment, several people who were present during the shooting identified the defendant as one of the shooters. The police also learned of the fight between the defendant, Ellis, and Perry that had occurred at the bar earlier on March 3. As a result, various law enforcement agencies immediately made attempts to locate the defendant, and the police obtained a warrant for his arrest. The defendant was finally located approximately three and one-half months later on June 21, 2010, in Gwinnett County, Georgia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In July, 2010, Detective Sergeant George Potts and Detective Richard Curcuro travelled to Gwinnett County to speak with the defendant about the events that had occurred on March 3, 2010. During this interview, the defendant conceded that he was involved in a fight with Ellis and Perry at the bar, but denied that he was involved in the subsequent occurrence at the Prest Street apartment, on Blackhall Court, and on Blackhall Street. The defendant gave the detectives an alibi, which the investigators were not able to verify. When asked why he fled from Connecticut, the defendant answered that he saw his photograph on the news and was concerned that if he were found in Connecticut, he would be arrested for a parole violation that had occurred in New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 29, 2015, the defendant was charged by way of an amended information with the following eight offenses: (1) murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a(a) ; (2) felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c ; (3) home invasion in violation of \u00a7 53a-100aa(a)(1) ; (4) home invasion in violation of \u00a7 53a-100aa(a)(2) ; (5) burglary in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-101(a)(3) ; (6) attempt to commit murder in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49(a)(2) and 53a-54a(a) ; (7) attempt to commit assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49(a)(2) and 53a-59(a)(5) ; and (8) carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of \u00a7 29-35(a). A trial commenced in January, 2015 and continued into February, 2015. The trial ended in a hung jury and the court declared a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In January, 2016, a second trial commenced. In a substitute information, the defendant was charged with the following offenses: (1) murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a(a) ; (2) felony murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54c ; (3) home invasion in violation of \u00a7 53a-100aa(a)(2) ; (4) burglary in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-101(a)(3) ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (5) attempt to commit murder in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53s-49(a)(2) and 53a-54a ; (6) attempt to commit assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49(a)(2) and 53-59(a)(5); and (7) carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of \u00a7 29-35(a). The jury found the defendant guilty of all of those offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of seventy-five years of imprisonment. This appeal\n   followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   EVIDENTIARY CLAIMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We first address the defendant's evidentiary claims. On appeal, the defendant argues that the court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence certain out-of-court statements as spontaneous utterances pursuant to \u00a7 8-3 (2) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. Additionally, the defendant argues that the court abused its discretion in excluding a letter that Ellis allegedly wrote and delivered to the court regarding his refusal to testify at the second trial, which the defendant argues contained statements against Ellis' penal interest under \u00a7 8-6 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We begin by setting forth the relevant standard of review. \"As a general rule, hearsay is inadmissible unless an exception from the Code of Evidence, the General Statutes or the rules of practice applies.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185572\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/121/775/#p779\">\n    121 Conn.

For example, whether a challenged statement properly may be classified as hearsay and whether a hearsay exception properly is\n   identified are legal questions demanding plenary review. They require determinations about which reasonable minds may not differ; there is no judgment call by the trial court .... We review the trial court's decision to admit evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law, however, for an abuse of discretion.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

The state responds that each statement was properly admitted as a spontaneous utterance. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Our code of evidence defines a spontaneous utterance as \"[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the excitement caused by the event or condition.\" Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-3(2). \"[T]he commentary to \u00a7 8-3(2) provides: The hearsay exception for spontaneous utterances is well established...

Moreover, a statement made in response to a question does not preclude its admission as a spontaneous utterance. Id., at 376,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=908%20A.2d%20506\">\n    908 A.2d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Kirkwood's Statements\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The following additional facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this claim. The state presented\n   evidence that following the shooting, everyone who was present in the Prest Street apartment ran outside. Shauntay Ellis and Phillips drove Perry to the hospital, while the others remained outside of the apartment on Prest Street. Flynn was responding to the occurrence when he saw a male running in a direction that was taking him away from Prest Street. Flynn stopped this individual, obtained his identification, and determined that he was not related to the Prest Street shooting. Flynn then arrived at the Prest Street apartment and approached a vehicle that was attempting to leave the crime scene. Inside the vehicle were Taylor, Parrish, Guilbert, and James. Flynn briefly spoke to the individuals in the vehicle and learned that they were heading to the hospital to check on Perry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Flynn observed Kirkwood on Prest Street speaking on a telephone to someone she referred to as \"[m]om.\" Flynn walked toward where Kirkwood was standing so he would be able to speak to Kirkwood when she finished her telephone call. While speaking on the telephone, Kirkwood was emotional and visibly upset, and her speech had a staccato sound. During the telephone call, Kirkwood stated that \"Mikey shot them\" and that he had entered through the back of the apartment. Flynn overheard Kirkwood's exclamations that \"Mikey\" was one of the shooters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kirkwood then stated that \"the cop [is] here,\" and, \"I'm going to tell them that he did it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   After Kirkwood's telephone call, Flynn began speaking directly to Kirkwood. Although Kirkwood's responses were \"more guarded,\" she was visibly upset while talking to Flynn. During this conversation, Kirkwood reiterated the statements from her telephone call, identifying the defendant as one of the shooters. Taylor had returned to the scene after hearing sirens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Taylor was present for Kirkwood's conversation with Flynn,\n   and overheard her statements identifying the defendant as one of the shooters. On multiple occasions during this conversation, Kirkwood apologized to Taylor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At the second trial, Flynn testified outside the presence of the jury regarding what he overheard Kirkwood say on the telephone to the person she referred to as \"[m]om.\" The defendant objected, arguing that the statements were not excited utterances because they did not satisfy the fourth factor set out in\n   <em>\n    Kirby\n   </em>\n   , that \"the declaration is made under circumstances that negate the opportunity for deliberation and fabrication by the declarant.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kirby\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5729290\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/280/361/#p373\">\n    280 Conn. at 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=908%20A.2d%20506\">\n    908 A.2d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the defendant argued that the statements Kirkwood made over the telephone were not spontaneous utterances because Kirkwood \"wasn't screaming. She wasn't wailing. She wasn't moaning. She was talking to someone; clearly hearsay.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Following the state's proffer, the court found that \"the declarant was upset, very excited, very emotional, crying on the phone and had a sort of a staccato-type conversation or outburst, and it sounded to the court as though it does satisfy what's required for a spontaneous or excited utterance ....\" Flynn then testified before the jury regarding the statements that he overheard Kirkwood make during her telephone call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Taylor also testified regarding the statements that Kirkwood made directly to Flynn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant objected and again argued that these statements did not fall within the spontaneous utterance exception, and in support of his assertion cited the fact that Flynn\n   was questioning Kirkwood. The court disagreed and allowed Taylor to testify regarding Kirkwood's statements to Flynn under the spontaneous utterance exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The defendant argues that the court abused its discretion in admitting Kirkwood's statements as spontaneous utterances under \u00a7 8-3(2) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. The defendant maintains that several minutes had passed from the time of the shooting to the time of Kirkwood's statements over the telephone and to Flynn, and that as a result, Kirkwood had time to deliberate and think about the statements she was going to make. We disagree that the court abused its discretion in admitting Kirkwood's statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We first address the statements that Flynn heard Kirkwood make over the telephone to someone she referred to as \"[m]om.\" The parties did not dispute that the statements were made following a startling occurrence, i.e., the home invasion, the subsequent gunfire, and the shooting of Perry, that the statements referred to the startling occurrence, or that Kirkwood observed the occurrence. Therefore, the court had to determine only whether Kirkwood made the statements \"under circumstances that negate the opportunity for deliberation and fabrication ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kirby\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5729290\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/280/361/#p373\">\n    280 Conn. at 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=908%20A.2d%20506\">\n    908 A.2d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the statements that Kirkwood made over the telephone as spontaneous utterances. The fact\n   that Kirkwood was crying and had a \"staccato-type conversation or outburst\" supports the court's finding that Kirkwood was still experiencing stress and shock as a result of the occurrence. Although several minutes had passed between the startling occurrence and when Flynn heard Kirkwood make these statements, our Supreme Court has held that \"[w]hile [a] short time\n   between the incident and the statement is important,\n   <em>\n    it is not dispositive\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kirby\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5729290\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/280/361/#p373\">\n    280 Conn. at 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=908%20A.2d%20506\">\n    908 A.2d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stange\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"564765\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/212/612/#p618\">\n    212 Conn. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 618,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=563%20A.2d%20681\">\n    563 A.2d 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989) (\"A majority of jurisdictions that have addressed the issue of the effect of the time interval between the startling occurrence and the making of the spontaneous utterance have recognized that an acceptable time interval cannot be specified.

The state presented evidence that in the midst of the events at the Prest Street apartment, Ellis ran out the back door of the apartment, ran up Prest Street, then to Blackhall Court, and stopped when he reached Blackhall Street. While Ellis was running from the apartment, he was shot at four times, and hit twice. When Ellis stopped on Blackhall Street, he called 911. Within minutes, Clachrie arrived on Blackhall Street and Ellis flagged him down. Clachrie pulled over and Ellis approached his police cruiser, collapsing on the hood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Clachrie exited his vehicle and began speaking to Ellis. During this time, Ellis was moaning and yelling in pain, and told Clachrie that he had been shot. Clachrie lifted Ellis' shirt and confirmed that he had been shot. Clachrie asked Ellis if he knew who had shot him. Ellis\n   responded in the negative, but stated \"that it was a Puerto Rican male in black.\" Ellis also indicated that the shooting occurred at a house on Prest Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Within minutes of Clachrie's arrival, medical personnel arrived and began treating Ellis' injuries and preparing to transport Ellis to the hospital. At this time, Ellis continued to scream and yell in pain. He vomited while being treated on Blackhall Street and vomited again once he was inside the ambulance. Clachrie was in the ambulance with Ellis and attempted to ask him more questions about the shooting. Because Clachrie could smell alcohol on Ellis' breath, Clachrie asked Ellis whether he had been at a bar. Ellis responded that he had been at The Galley earlier in the night. When Clachrie asked Ellis whether the person who shot him had also been at the bar, Ellis responded in the affirmative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   It took approximately two minutes for the ambulance to transport Ellis from Blackhall Street to the hospital. When Ellis arrived at the hospital, he continued to scream and yell in pain. Within minutes, Clachrie was able to ask Ellis questions, and asked whether Ellis knew who shot him. Ellis responded that \"Mike\" had shot him. By this time, Clachrie had learned that the defendant was a suspect, so he asked Ellis if the individual who had shot him had a baby with Kirkwood. Ellis responded to that question by nodding his head up and down, as if answering the question in the affirmative. Soon after, Ellis was moved to the intensive care unit, and Clachrie was unable to continue questioning him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   At trial, the defendant objected on hearsay grounds to the admission of the statements that Ellis made to Clachrie. The defendant argued that the statements did not fall within the spontaneous utterance exception because Ellis had time to think about his responses to Clachrie's questions, and therefore, Ellis had time to deliberate and fabricate his statements. The trial court\n   disagreed and admitted the statements under the spontaneous utterance exception. In so doing, the court reasoned that the statement \"was made initially very close in time to the call from dispatch, [Clachrie] testified [that the statement was made] a very short distance away from the area. [Clachrie] responded immediately, and the events transpired very quickly thereafter. So, under the circumstances, [the] objection is overruled, and the evidence may be admitted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The defendant argues that the court abused its discretion by admitting Ellis' statements to Clachrie on Blackhall Street, in the ambulance, and at the hospital. The defendant argues that because Ellis initially told Clachrie that a \"Puerto Rican male in black\" had shot him, and\n   then later identified the defendant as the shooter, he had time for deliberation and fabrication, and therefore the statement was not a spontaneous utterance.

The defendant argues that the court abused its discretion in excluding the letter from evidence because the letter contained statements against Ellis' penal interest under \u00a7 8-6(4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. The state responds that the court properly excluded the letter, as there is no indication that Ellis was aware of whether he was subjecting himself to criminal punishment when making the statements in the letter, and therefore the statements are not against Ellis' penal interest. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The following procedural history is relevant to the resolution of this claim. Just prior to the start of the second trial in January, 2016, the state informed the court that Ellis was refusing to testify. The court noted that the state had properly served Ellis with a subpoena and that the subpoena contained a notice that if Ellis did not appear in court on the date and time stated, the court could order his arrest. The court issued a capias pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-2a and set bond in the amount of $100,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   During the trial, the state informed the court that Ellis maintained his refusal to testify. The court allowed Ellis' testimony from the first trial and probable cause hearing to be read into the record, and provided the jury with redacted transcripts of that former testimony. In response, the defendant offered a letter that Ellis \"purportedly handed to madam clerk\" on January 5, 2016, in which he stated, inter alia, that \"I have also been pressured to point out a specific individual, the defendant, Miguel Vega, in which, I state and have stated I did not actually know who the offender was. In the heat of the incidence, in which, I was attacked and was in the midst of running to safety in order to contact authorities. I did not in fact see the offender's face.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Ellis also allegedly wrote that \"I am reaching out in efforts to express my feelings and concerns that my well-being, safety, and cooperation has not been taken into account by the police department, [the] State of Connecticut, [or] the Superior Courts. I am in fear of my life and the lives of my family.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defense counsel argued that the letter should be admitted as a statement against penal interest under \u00a7 8-6(4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. Defense counsel reasoned that the statement was against Ellis' penal interest because \"he told [the court] this morning that in the face of criminal contempt, penalties of incarceration and fines, he still was not going to testify. So, this is evidence of his ... penal intent, if you will, against his penal [interest].\" The state objected, arguing that \"although [the letter] was submitted in the belief that it would help him in his quest not to testify here,\" none of the statements in the letter were against Ellis' penal interest. The state specified that it did not believe that Ellis \"felt that this statement was going to be against his penal interest when he made it,\" or that \"he felt that he was [going to] incur any liability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The court sustained the state's objection to the letter, concluding that the statements contained in the letter were not against Ellis' penal interest. The court reasoned that \"[a]lthough a refusal to cooperate does in fact implicate ... a victim's\n   exposure to possible consequences such as contempt, the court does not view the letter as a statement against penal interest. In fact, much of the letter relates to Mr. Ellis' fears for his safety and that of his family as well as his perceived dissatisfaction with the manner in which he was treated.... The letter is therefore inadmissible hearsay and the objection is sustained.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that the court should have admitted the letter as a statement against Ellis' penal interest. The defendant argues for the first time\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   that because Ellis previously testified that the defendant was one of the shooters, he knew or should have known that the statement in his letter, in which he maintained that he did not know who shot him, exposed him to a\n   <em>\n    perjury\n   </em>\n   charge and was thus against his penal interest. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \" Section 8-6 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides that if the declarant is unavailable as a witness,\n   a statement against penal interest is not excluded by the hearsay rule. Section 8-6(4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence defines a statement against penal interest as follows: A trustworthy statement against penal interest that, at the time of its making, so far tended to subject the declarant to criminal liability that a reasonable person in the declarant's position would not have made the statement unless the person believed it to be true. In determining the trustworthiness of a statement against penal interest, the court shall consider (A) the time the statement was made and the person to whom the statement was made, (B) the existence of corroborating evidence in the case, and (C) the extent to which the statement was against the declarant's penal interest.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4056846\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/109/519/#p544\">\n    109 Conn.

It stated that Pitkin threatened Ellis by telling him that if he did not testify at the defendant's second trial, he would go to prison. Although the letter alleged that Ellis \" 'did not actually\n   know who the offender was' \" and that he \" 'did not see the offender's face,' \" these statements are not against Ellis' penal interest, as they, standing alone, provide no indication that Ellis knew or should have known that he was subjecting himself to criminal liability by making those statements. As in\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   , the statements were in the nature of a recantation of Ellis' prior testimony, and seemingly not intended by him as an admission of perjury. Therefore, Ellis' letter did not contain any statements against penal interest pursuant to \u00a7 8-6(4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly,\n   the court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the state's objection and excluding the letter from evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   We now turn our analysis to the defendant's constitutional claim. On appeal, the defendant claims that the\n   admission of certain statements violated his sixth and fourteenth amendment right to confrontation. The statements at issue are the statements Kirkwood made over the telephone to someone she referred to as \"[m]om\" and the statements Kirkwood made directly to Flynn, which Taylor overheard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state responds that the statements were nontestimonial and that even if the statements were testimonial, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

Flynn did not initiate this conversation with Kirkwood, and there is no evidence that Kirkwood intended for Flynn to hear the statements she was making during her telephone call. Rather, Kirkwood made the statements over the telephone to a private person, not a government agent, while under stress from the incident, including the shooting, which she had witnessed minutes before.

As in\n   <em>\n    Kirby\n   </em>\n   , when Flynn was interviewing Kirkwood, his primary purpose was to determine what had\n   <em>\n    happened\n   </em>\n   , not what was\n   <em>\n    happening\n   </em>\n   . The emergency had ceased; Flynn and other officers were present at the scene, and both shooters had fled the area. Having heard Kirkwood make the statements over the phone in which she identified the defendant, Flynn interviewed Kirkwood as part of his investigation into the crime that had occurred. Accordingly, we conclude that the statements Kirkwood made directly to Flynn were testimonial. Because the defendant never had an opportunity to cross-examine Kirkwood regarding those testimonial statements, their admission violated the defendant's right to confrontation. Therefore, the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The defendant's claim, however, fails under the fourth prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   . \"It is well established that a violation of the defendant's right to confront witnesses is subject to harmless error analysis ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pugh\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491021\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/170/710/#p528\">\n    176 Conn.

Although the defendant has established that a constitutional violation exists, we conclude that the state presented sufficient independent evidence to render any error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Such independent evidence includes the statements that Flynn overheard Kirkwood make during a phone call, in which she identified the defendant, with whom she had a child, as one of the shooters. Additionally, the jury heard Phillips' 911 call, in which she stated that the defendant had shot Perry. Numerous witnesses who were present at the Prest Street apartment during the occurrence identified the defendant as one of the shooters,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and at least two witnesses testified that they heard Kirkwood scream the defendant's name during the occurrence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was also testimony that the defendant fired the first shot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In addition, the jury heard numerous witnesses testify that the defendant, Ellis, and Perry were involved in a fight while at the bar and that the defendant was on the losing end of that fight, evidence that could be used to establish a motive for the defendant's subsequent actions. The jury heard testimony that investigators could not find anyone to corroborate the defendant's alibi that he was in a taxi at the time of the occurrence. Moreover, the jury heard testimony that Ellis twice identified the defendant as one of the shooters: once while speaking to Clachrie, and again when shown a photographic array containing the defendant's photograph. The state also presented forensic evidence which established that the same weapons that were fired inside the apartment also were fired outside the apartment and at Ellis as he was running away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Accordingly, on the basis of the strong identification evidence before the jury, which was separate from the testimonial statements that Taylor overheard Kirkwood make directly to Flynn, we conclude that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. As the preceding paragraphs demonstrate, the state had presented substantial evidence for the jury reasonably to identify the defendant as the shooter of Perry and one of the shooters of Ellis. Therefore, all four prongs of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   have not been satisfied with respect to this claim. Accordingly, the defendant's unpreserved constitutional claim must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    During the sentencing proceeding, the court vacated the finding of guilt on the felony murder count.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Mikey is a nickname for the defendant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Flynn did not testify regarding the substance of the statements that Kirkwood made directly to him.

Ellis had been shot twice, was suffering from an extremely painful and life-threatening condition, and was in shock or under the stress of the occurrence when he made to Clachrie the statement in which he identified the defendant as one of the shooters.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    For the first time on appeal, the defendant raises the argument that the statements contained in the letter exposed Ellis to\n    <em>\n     perjury\n    </em>\n    charges and were thus against his penal interest. At trial, the defendant had argued that it was Ellis' exposure to\n    <em>\n     contempt\n    </em>\n    charges that made the statements in his letter against his penal interest. The state argues that the defendant's claim is unpreserved. Although the defendant argued before the court and before this court that the statements contained in the letter were against Ellis' penal interest, he based his argument before the trial court on Ellis' alleged exposure to a charge of criminal contempt, and did not raise in the trial court Ellis' alleged exposure to a charge of perjury. The trial court, therefore, never had the occasion to consider whether Ellis' statements reasonably subjected him to a perjury charge. Because both Ellis' alleged exposure to a charge of criminal contempt, raised solely in the trial court, and Ellis' alleged exposure to a charge of perjury, raised solely in this court, implicate the statement again penal interest hearsay exception, we will address the merits of the defendant's claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The trial court in\n    <em>\n     Diaz\n    </em>\n    also concluded that the statements contained in the letter were not trustworthy.
