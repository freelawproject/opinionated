Cancel (Cancel), as Administratrix of the Estate of Ira Lukens (Lukens), appeals from a Superior Court summary judgment entered in favor of the defendants, the City of Providence and various city officials (collectively the city).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cancel asserts that there remain genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the city knew of the dangerous condition of a pothole on a street in Roger Williams Park (the park) and whether it \"willfully and/or maliciously failed to warn\" of the pothole, which would strip the city of the protection against liability afforded under Rhode Island's Recreational Use Statute, G.L. 1956 chapter 6 of title 32 (RUS). This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties' written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 9, 2014, Lukens was thrown from his bicycle after striking a pothole on a road in the park.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cancel filed a complaint on September 28, 2015, wherein she alleged that Lukens suffered serious personal injuries as a result of the city's negligence in maintaining the park. Cancel subsequently filed an amended complaint alleging, in addition to negligence, willful and/or malicious failure to warn, inspect, and/or repair the roadway within the park. The amended complaint further asserted that the city's conduct was a direct and proximate cause of Lukens' injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 20, 2017, the city filed a motion for summary judgment. The matter was argued in the Superior Court on April 19, 2017, after which the hearing justice deferred her ruling so that Cancel could depose the Superintendent of the City of Providence's Department of Parks. The matter was heard again on July 17, 2017, and the hearing justice thereafter granted the city's motion for summary judgment. Judgment entered on August 11, 2017. Cancel filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"This Court will review the grant of a motion for summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , employing the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Newstone Development, LLC v.

She asserts that, during his deposition, Salem, the Director of Roger Williams Park Services, testified that there is no regular schedule for inspection of the roadways within the park. However, Salem also testified that the strip of road where the pothole was located was driven over daily by McMahon, the then Superintendent of the park. Likewise, McMahon confirmed that he traveled over the area in question at least two to three times per week on his way into the park and once per week while he was leaving the park. Cancel also asserts that the photographs of the pothole make it \"clearly foreseeable that any reasonable person would recognize [that] a pothole of this size should be remedied, repaired or marked off so as to not cause a danger to the public.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It is undisputed that the park is open to the public free of charge and that Lukens was engaged in the recreational activity of riding his bicycle at the time he was injured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, immunity under the RUS clearly applies to the city. The remaining issue is whether the exception provided in \u00a7 32-6-5(a)(1) also applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This Court had occasion to examine this exception to the RUS in\n   <em>\n    Berman\n   </em>\n   , cited\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Berman\n   </em>\n   sustained catastrophic injuries when he walked down a path leading off Newport's famed Cliff Walk and the ground beneath him gave way, causing him to fall approximately twenty-nine feet to the rocks below.\n   <em>\n    Berman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7291533\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/991/1038/#p1043\">\n    991 A.2d at 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although McMahon denied having notice or knowledge of the pothole, Cancel asks this Court to question the veracity of McMahon's testimony and queries, \"How could someone admit to driving over the defect * * * and then claim to have no notice[?]\" She has proffered no evidence, expert or otherwise, however, that demonstrates that the pothole was, in fact, present at any of the times that McMahon drove over the roadway or that the city had received any complaints or other notice concerning the condition of the roadway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The facts of this case are more akin to those cases in which this Court has refused to apply \u00a7 32-6-5(a)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carlson v.

After viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we cannot conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning the city's knowledge of the dangerous condition or \"discover[y] [of] the user's peril[.]\" Section 32-6-5(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Moreover, the evidence in this case cannot support an assertion that the city willfully or maliciously failed to guard or warn against the pothole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 32-6-5(a)(1).
