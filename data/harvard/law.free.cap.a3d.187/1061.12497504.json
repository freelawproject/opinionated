Because Claimant gave notice within 21 days, she was entitled to benefits from September 10, 2004, the date she left work due to her injury, as opposed to September 23, 2011, the date she filed her claim petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Claimant worked as an active firefighter for Employer for 16 years. In August 2004, she noticed a lump on her breast and had a\n   mammogram, resulting in a diagnosis of breast cancer. A month later, she had a mastectomy. Because of that surgery, she was unable to continue her full duties as a firefighter. Her last official date of employment with Employer was September 9, 2004. It is undisputed that if Claimant had not been diagnosed with cancer, she would have continued working as a firefighter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Effective July 7, 2011, the Workers' Compensation Act (Act)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was amended via Act 46 of 2011 (Act 46).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Act 46, the General Assembly enacted Sections 108(r) and 301(f), creating a new occupational disease provision to provide a new presumption of compensable disability for firefighters who suffer from cancer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Claimant admits that sometime after Act 46's enactment, in the summer of 2011, she received a letter of distribution from her union informing her of the new firefighter cancer presumption law (Union Letter). That Union Letter led Claimant to question whether there was a connection between her job and her cancer. Because Claimant is unable to locate the Letter and cannot remember exactly when she received it, its exact date and contents are unknown. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 63a-64a, 68a.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following receipt of the Union Letter, on September 23, 2011, Claimant filed a claim petition providing notice to Employer of the possible connection between her work and her cancer. She sought payment of medical bills and full disability benefits from September 10, 2004, and ongoing. Notwithstanding, Claimant did not receive actual confirmation of the causal link between her cancer and occupation until several months thereafter-when she received a medical report from her oncologist, Dr. Lanie Francis (Dr. Francis), dated February 24, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following hearings, now-retired WCJ Linda Tobin (WCJ Tobin) circulated a decision on October 4, 2013, granting Claimant's claim petition. As pertinent, WCJ Tobin concluded that Claimant established direct exposure to a Section 108(r) carcinogen and that she was examined and found cancer-free repeatedly before and during her employment with Employer, and that she served more than four years in continuous firefighting duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 301(f) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 414. Determining that Claimant filed her claim petition within 300 weeks, WCJ Tobin concluded that Claimant was entitled to the presumption afforded under Section 301(f) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 414. Notwithstanding, WCJ Tobin also concluded that even in the absence of the statutory presumption, Claimant met her burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that her cancer was caused by her occupational exposure as a firefighter. WCJ Tobin then awarded Claimant benefits commencing from the last date of employment, September 9, 2004. Employer appealed to the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because Claimant's last date of employment was September 9, 2004, and she did not file her claim petition until September 23, 2011-approximately 367 weeks thereafter-the Board held that Claimant was not entitled to the presumption that her cancer was caused by firefighting because she did not file her claim petition within 300 weeks of her last date of employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 301(f) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 414. The Board did agree, however, with WCJ Tobin that even in the absence of the presumption, Claimant met her burden of proving that her cancer and disability were caused by her occupational exposure as a firefighter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Board also determined that a remand was necessary because the WCJ did not render any findings as to when Claimant first discovered that her cancer was possibly related to her work as a firefighter or when she provided notice to Employer of the possible connection between her work and her cancer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the\n   Board remanded the matter \"for the WCJ to render findings and a determination [as to (1) ] when Claimant first discovered that her cancer was\n   <strong>\n    possibly related\n   </strong>\n   to her work as a firefighter and [2] when she provided notice to [Employer] of the\n   <strong>\n    possible connection\n   </strong>\n   between her work and her cancer.

As he reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   In the present case, claimant, a sophisticated individual, was advised by her union that the workers' compensation law had been changed so that\n   <strong>\n    her cancer was presumed to be work-related\n   </strong>\n   ....

WCJ Torrey awarded Claimant benefits as of September 23, 2011-the date she filed her claim petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Employer appealed and the Board reversed in part, determining that the notice period only began once Claimant received the medical report because \"mere suspicion, or even certain knowledge of disease or disability, standing alone, does not trigger the notice period.\" (Board's Decision dated December 8, 2017 at 5) (citing\n   <em>\n    Carrier Coal Enterprises v.

Section 311 sets forth the notice required to be given by an employee to an employer:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Unless the employer shall have knowledge of the occurrence of the injury or unless the employe or someone in his behalf or some of the dependents or someone in their behalf shall give notice thereof to the employer\n   <strong>\n    within twenty-one days\n   </strong>\n   after the injury, no compensation shall be due until such notice be given, and unless such notice be given\n   <strong>\n    within one hundred and twenty days\n   </strong>\n   after the occurrence of the injury, no compensation shall be allowed.\n   <strong>\n    However\n   </strong>\n   , in cases of injury resulting from ionizing radiation or\n   <strong>\n    any other cause in which the nature of the injury or its relationship to the employment is not known to the employe\n   </strong>\n   , the time for giving notice\n   <strong>\n    shall not begin to run until the employe knows or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should know of the existence of the injury and its possible relationship to his employment\n   </strong>\n   .

There, a claimant who had been a smoker for more than 40 years became a tester of a plastic product in 1988 and began to experience throat and lung problems. Although the claimant suspected that her health problems were due to inhaling fumes while working, she lacked proof and did not advise her employer of her belief. In November 1992, she was admitted to a hospital and was told that she had emphysema but was not told of its cause. Upon discharge, she searched for a doctor with knowledge of the chemicals in her work environment, but did not locate one until August 1993. That doctor advised her that exposure to chemicals at her work had exacerbated her emphysema and the claimant notified her employer the same month. Only then did the claimant file a claim petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Ultimately, our Supreme Court held that the claimant timely provided her employer notice because, prior to her doctor informing her, she did not know or have reason to know that her illness had been aggravated by work exposures. As the Court reasoned, the discovery rule \"calls for more than an employee's suspicion, intuition or belief; by its terms, the statute's notice period is triggered only by an employee's knowledge that she is injured and that her injury is possibly related to her job.\"\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"124695,11105471\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/771/1246/\">\n    771 A.2d at 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The substantial evidence relating to the course taken by [the claimant's] disease provides ample support for the WCJ's determination that\n   <strong>\n    without the benefit of medical consultation\n   </strong>\n   , [the claimant] neither knew, nor should have known, that from among all her respiratory difficulties, there was a compensable injury.

Essentially, Employer is asking this Court to use Act 46 to impute on Claimant actual knowledge that her injury could possibly be work-related.

While he never filed an incident report with the employer stating that he suffered a heart attack, there is no dispute that the employer was aware claimant had suffered a heart attack. For example, the employer received a note from his doctor, his sister called employer informing it that claimant was sick, high-ranking fire department officials had knowledge of claimant's heart attack, and the claimant filed a claim petition for sick and accident benefits. Unfortunately, none of those contacts informed the employer specifically that the claimant believed his heart attack was work-related.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Similar to Employer's contention in this appeal, the firefighter-claimant argued that the presumption afforded to him imputed on the employer actual knowledge that his known injuries were work-related. This Court wholly rejected that contention, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   However, the presumption provided in Section 301(e) [of the Act] was clearly intended to give claimants in specific occupations\n   <strong>\n    an evidentiary advantage in establishing one of the elements necessary to support an award\n   </strong>\n   (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the causal link between his injury and his employment),\n   <strong>\n    not to circumvent or replace the notice provisions of Section 311\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Pawlosky v.

Therefore, although claimant would be entitled to a presumption that his heart attack was caused by his work for the purpose of supporting his claim, he is not entitled to such a presumption\n   <strong>\n    for the purpose of imputing actual knowledge on employer\n   </strong>\n   . Because claimant's suggested extension of the presumption provided by Section 301(e) is not supported by caselaw or the Act, we conclude employer did not have actual knowledge that claimant had suffered a compensable injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Shannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1431689\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/147/210/\">\n    607 A.2d at 331-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pawlosky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1804529,1804531,1804614\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/525/1204/\">\n    525 A.2d at 1211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the claimant seeking to recover for an occupational disease is \"given a\n   <strong>\n    procedural or evidentiary advantage\n   </strong>\n   \" that, if established, entitled him \"to a non-conclusive presumption that his occupational disease arose out of and in the course of his employment\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Correspondingly, in this case, Employer knew of Claimant's cancer since 2004 and\n   (just like Claimant) knows of the presumption afforded to firefighter-claimants under Act 46. However, as this Court held in\n   <em>\n    Shannon\n   </em>\n   , knowledge of Act 46's effect does not perfect notice onto Employer because Section 311 requires\n   <strong>\n    actual\n   </strong>\n   knowledge of an injury's work-relatedness. For the same reason, Claimant, learning of Act 46's effect, does not perfect Section 311's requirement that she actually knows of the possible relationship between her injury and her work. All the presumption does is give a claimant an evidentiary/procedural advantage; it does not impute knowledge to a claimant that her cancer was caused by exposure and not due to other risk factors. That only occurs when a claimant receives notice of that nexus from a medical doctor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Although Claimant's knowledge of the firefighter-cancer presumption does not, in itself, commence Section 311's notice period, that does not mean that she could sit on her rights indefinitely. The undisputed facts make clear that Claimant's receipt of the Union Letter \"awakened in her, at once, the idea of exploring whether or not her occupational exposure resulted in her breast cancer.... And so she did, within 120 days ....\" (WCJ Torrey's Decision at 9.) Clearly, because the Union Letter awakened in Claimant the need to promptly investigate the cause of her injury, she had to abide by Section 311's mandate that she exercise \"reasonable diligence\" to become aware of \"the existence of the injury and its possible relationship to [her] employment.\" Section 311 of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 631. Had she not, her claim would have become barred.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Allegheny Ludlum Corp. v.

Now, for the first time, and still not disputing Claimant's entitlement to benefits under Act 46, Employer contends that Act 46 cannot be applied retroactively to provide Claimant benefits at any time prior to its effective date.
