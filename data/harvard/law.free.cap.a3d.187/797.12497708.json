The underlying lawsuits sought damages arising from Mr. Muehlhauser's surreptitious videotaping of women who were using a restroom at a restaurant and tavern owned by Rams Head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We conclude that Harleysville had a duty to defend Rams Head. Harleysville issued insurance policies that provide coverage for damages Rams Head becomes legally obligated to pay because of, among other offenses, the \"invasion of the right of private occupancy of a room ... that a person occupies, committed by or on behalf of its owner ....\" Under the plain language of the coverage grant, we conclude that the underlying tort suits alleged that Rams Head and Mr. Muehlhauser invaded the plaintiffs' right of private occupancy of the restroom when Mr. Muehlhauser conducted his unauthorized video surveillance. We also conclude that an exclusion for \"Recording and Distribution of Material or Information in Violation of Law\" does not preclude coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Harleysville did not, however, have a duty to defend Mr. Muehlhauser because coverage for him is excluded by the policies' Criminal Acts exclusion. There is no version of facts alleged in the complaints under which Mr. Muehlhauser's alleged conduct is not criminal. We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rams Head is a Maryland limited liability company that owns and operates the Rams Head Tavern. Rams Head's operating agreement designates Mr. Muehlhauser as general manager and majority owner of the company and gives him \"full, exclusive, and complete discretion, power, and authority ... to manage, control, administer, and operate the business and affairs\" of Rams Head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Rams Head leases the property on which it operates the Rams Head Tavern from Savage Mill Limited Partnership under a long-term lease that was originally entered in 1998. During the term of that lease, provided Rams Head pays its rent and abides by the other terms of the lease, Rams Head\n   \"shall peaceably and quietly hold and enjoy the Leased Premises ... without hindrance or interruption by Landlord or any other person or persons ....\" Rams Head is permitted to make improvements, and is responsible for making repairs, renovations, and renewals to the leased property, subject to approval by Savage Mill. Savage Mill is permitted to make changes to the leased property only with the approval of Rams Head. The circuit court found that Rams Head exercised \"exclusive control\" over the restaurant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Underlying Incident\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In May 2014, a Rams Head Tavern patron was using its single-occupancy women's restroom when a portable camera fell onto the floor from underneath the sink, close to the toilet. She reported the incident to the police, who identified Mr. Muehlhauser as the culprit. In July 2015, Mr. Muehlhauser pleaded guilty to two counts of conducting video surveillance with prurient intent in violation of \u00a7 3-902 of the Criminal Law Article (2012 Repl.; 2017 Supp.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Two different sets of plaintiffs filed class action complaints in the Circuit Court for Howard County against Rams Head and Mr. Muehlhauser. In\n   <em>\n    Michelle Castle, et al. v. Kyle C. Muehlhauser, et al.\n   </em>\n   (Case No. 13-C-15-102598), the plaintiffs alleged that from March 2, 2012 to May 9, 2014, Mr. Muehlhauser mounted a camera in the women's restroom at Rams\n   Head Tavern to \"conduct visual surveillance of the female patrons and employees using the toilets ... solely for prurient intent\" in \"an attempt to satiate his sexual perversions at the expense of the privacy of the female patrons and employees.\" The complaint further alleged that Mr. Muehlhauser was \"at all times ... acting in the scope of his employment and/or authority as a principal and employee of\" Rams Head and that Rams Head \"adopted and ratified\" his conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Castle\n   </em>\n   complaint brought claims against Rams Head and Mr. Muehlhauser for (1) violation of \u00a7 3-902 of the Criminal Law Article, which criminalizes certain visual surveillance with prurient intent and also creates a private cause of action for individuals subjected to unlawful surveillance, and (2) the tort of unreasonable intrusion upon seclusion. The complaint alleged that Ms. Castle and the other putative plaintiffs incurred damages including \"expenses, mental pain and suffering, fright, nervousness, indignity, humiliation, embarrassment and insult.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Felicia Barlow Clar, et al. v. Kyle C. Muehlhauser, et al.\n   </em>\n   (Case No. 13-C-15-102863), similarly alleged that Mr. Muehlhauser, \"both individually and in his capacity as President, General Manager, and Owner of the Rams Head ... did plant video recording equipment in the ladies['] restroom for the purpose of videotaping women patrons and employees in the restroom without their permission.\" The\n   <em>\n    Clar\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs, women who used the restroom at the Rams Head Tavern between January and May of 2014, alleged that \"[a]t all relevant times, Defendant Muehlhauser did violate\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Crim.%20Law%20%C2%A7%203-902\">\n    Md.

Counts\n   II, III, IV, V, and VII were brought against Rams Head and Mr. Muehlhauser. Mr. Muehlhauser was not named as a defendant in Counts I and VI. The plaintiffs alleged that, as a result of the conduct of Mr. Muehlhauser and Rams Head, they \"suffered severe humiliation, violation, anxiety, loss of dignity, emotional distress, mental anguish, and loss of valuable consideration.\" In Count VII, they further\n   alleged that they \"sustained severe emotional distress resulting in physical manifestations, emotional anguish, fear, anxiety, humiliation, embarrassment and other physical and emotional injuries ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Harleysville Policies\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During the period covered by the allegations in the complaints-from March 2012 through May 2014 for the\n   <em>\n    Castle\n   </em>\n   complaint and from January 2014 through May 2014 for the\n   <em>\n    Clar\n   </em>\n   complaint-Harleysville insured Rams Head under three one-year commercial lines insurance policies. For policies running from December 1, 2011 through December 1, 2012 and December 31, 2012 through December 31, 2013, respectively,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   policy provisions relevant to this dispute were supplied on Harleysville's Commercial General Liability Coverage Form CG 00 01 12 04 (the \"04 Policy Form\"). From December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2014, relevant policy provisions were supplied on Form CG 00 01 12 07 (the \"07 Policy Form\"). Rams Head was listed as a named insured under each policy, and each included within the definition of \"an insured\" the members and managers of the named insureds, but only to the extent of their respective roles. Because the policy provisions were essentially identical each year, with one notable exception identified below, we discuss them collectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The policies each provided grants of coverage for bodily injury and property damage liability (Coverage A) and personal and advertising liability (Coverage B). Under Coverage A, Harleysville agreed to \"pay those sums that the insured\n   becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' to which this insurance applies.\" Coverage A excludes property damage or bodily injury that is \"expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\" In addition to this duty to indemnify, the parties agreed that Harleysville would also have \"the right and duty to defend the insured against any 'suit' seeking those damages,\" but only if such damages would be covered by the policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Under Coverage B, Harleysville agreed to \"pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'personal and advertising injury' to which this insurance applies,\" including any such injury \"caused by an offense arising out of your business\" during the policy period. \" 'Personal and advertising injury' means injury, including consequential 'bodily injury,' arising out of\" seven enumerated categories of offenses. Most relevant here is \"[t]he wrongful eviction from, wrongful entry into, or invasion of the right of private occupancy of a room, dwelling or premises that a person occupies, committed by or on behalf of its owner, landlord or lessor.\" As with Coverage A, in Coverage B Harleysville also undertook \"the right and duty to defend the insured against any 'suit' seeking [ ] damages\" for personal and advertising injury covered by the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Harleysville invokes three coverage exclusions contained in the policies. First, only with respect to the policy in place from December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2014 (the \"2014 Policy\"), the \"Recording and Distribution of Material or Information in Violation of Law\" exclusion (the \"Recording and Distribution exclusion\") precludes coverage under both Coverage A and Coverage B for injuries \"arising directly or indirectly out of any action or omission that violates or is alleged to violate\" three specific statutes-the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"),\n   the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\")-or\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [a]ny federal, state, or local statute, ordinance or regulation, other than the TCPA, CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 or FCRA and their amendments and additions, that addresses, prohibits,\n   or limits the printing, dissemination, disposal, collecting, recording, sending, transmitting, communicating or distribution of material or information.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, the \"Criminal Acts\" exclusion exempts from Coverage B injuries \"arising out of a criminal act committed by or at the direction of the insured.\" Third, the \"Knowing Violation of Rights of Another\" exclusion (the \"Knowing Violation exclusion\") precludes coverage under Coverage B for injuries \"caused by or at the direction of the insured with the knowledge that the act would violate the rights of another and would inflict 'personal and advertising injury'.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Declaratory Judgment Action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Harleysville sought a declaratory judgment that it did not owe a defense to Rams Head or Mr. Muehlhauser with respect to either underlying action. Harleysville argued that the complaints did not allege injuries covered under either Coverage A or Coverage B and, with respect to the 2014 Policy, that the Recording and Distribution exclusion precluded coverage. Harleysville further argued that Mr. Muehlhauser does not qualify as an insured under the policies because the Criminal Acts and Knowing Violation exclusions preclude coverage for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After a hearing, the circuit court issued a memorandum opinion and declaration that Harleysville had a duty to defend Rams Head and Mr. Muehlhauser against both complaints. The court observed that the duty to defend \"depends on whether the allegations\" in a complaint \"potentially come[ ] within the Policy coverage,\" regardless of whether the claims have a \"probability of success.\" Thus, the court concluded, Harleysville had an obligation under Coverage A to provide a\n   defense for Rams Head to the\n   <em>\n    Clar\n   </em>\n   complaint, which the court concluded \"clearly set[ ] forth numerous 'occurrences' \" of negligence by Rams Head that \"enabled\" Mr. Muehlhauser to conduct surveillance in the restroom, causing \"bodily injury\" to the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court held that both defendants were entitled to a defense under Coverage B, specifically the policy's coverage for injuries arising from an alleged \"invasion of the right of private occupancy of a room ... that a person occupies, committed by or on behalf of its owner.\" Finding that coverage grant to be ambiguous, the court interpreted it in the light most favorable to the policyholder. The court further rejected Harleysville's reliance on exclusions, concluding that: (1) the Recording and Distribution exclusion is limited to the protection of \"personal and financial\" information; and (2) the Knowing Violation and Criminal Acts exclusions are invalid under\n   <em>\n    Bailer v. Erie Ins. Exch.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"850426\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/344/515/\">\n    344 Md. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"850426\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/344/515/\">\n    687 A.2d 1375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997), because applying them would render the coverage grant illusory. Because the complaints alleged that Mr. Muehlhauser was, at all relevant times,\n   acting on behalf of Rams Head, the court also concluded that Harleysville owed a duty to defend Mr. Muehlhauser. In light of the pendency of the underlying cases, the court declined to accept extrinsic evidence to resolve whether Mr. Muehlhauser was actually acting on behalf of Rams Head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Both underlying complaints have now been resolved finally in favor of Rams Head and Mr. Muehlhauser.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the sole remaining coverage issue is whether Harleysville had a duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"When an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous ....\" Maryland Rule 8-131(c). \"To the extent this case involves questions of law, including the interpretation of a contract, we review for legal error.\"\n   <em>\n    White Pine Ins.

The Plain Language of the Coverage Grant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The coverage grant on which Rams Head primarily relies requires Harleysville to provide a defense to claims for damages based on the \"wrongful eviction from, wrongful entry into, or invasion of the right of private occupancy of a room, dwelling or premises that a person occupies, committed by or on behalf of its owner, landlord or lessor.\" Rams Head argues that this coverage grant obligates Harleysville to defend it because the\n   <em>\n    Clar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Castle\n   </em>\n   complaints alleged that (1) the plaintiffs had a right to occupy the private restroom at the Rams Head Tavern, (2) the plaintiffs in fact occupied that room, (3) Mr. Muehlhauser, acting on behalf of Rams Head, invaded that right of private occupancy by his video surveillance, and (4) Rams Head, by virtue of its control over the restroom, was its owner for purposes of this coverage grant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Harleysville disagrees that the coverage grant applies to these allegations. Relying heavily on the fact that it is paired in the policy with the concepts of \"wrongful eviction\" and \"wrongful entry,\" Harleysville argues that to have a \"right of private occupancy in a room,\" one must have a possessory interest in the room. Because the plaintiffs lacked any such interest, Harleysville contends that their claims do not fall within the coverage grant. Harleysville also argues that Rams Head was not the \"owner\" of the restroom because it was merely a lessee of the premises, which were instead owned by non-party Savage Mill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To determine who is correct, we turn to the plain meaning of the relevant policy terms.\n   <em>\n    JMP Assocs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"400089\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/345/630/#p635\">\n    345 Md. at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"400089\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/345/630/#p635\">\n    693 A.2d 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We start with the specific policy language\n   under which Rams Head claims an entitlement to coverage, an \"invasion of a right of private occupancy in a room.\" \"Occupancy,\" as commonly understood, is \"the action or fact of occupying a place.\"\n   <em>\n    New Oxford American Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , \"occupancy,\" at 1213 (3d ed. 2010);\n   <em>\n    see also Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , \"occupancy,\" at 858 (11th ed. 2014) (\"the fact or condition of holding, possessing, or residing in or on something\"). Common meanings of \"occupy\" similarly include \"to take up (a place or extent in space),\" \"to take or hold possession or control of,\" and \"to reside in as an owner or tenant,\" all in\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster's Collegiate\n   </em>\n   , \"occupy,\" at 858; and \"reside or have one's place of business in,\" \"fill or take up,\" or \"be situated in or at,\" all in\n   <em>\n    New Oxford American\n   </em>\n   , \"occupy,\" at 1213. Although each of these sets of definitions of \"occupy\" includes one that references \"resid[ing]\" in a place, the others reference more generic concepts of taking up space or having temporary possession of a place. Indeed, the use of variants of \"occupy\" and \"occupied\" specifically to identify one's temporary possession of a restroom (e.g., on an airplane) are common.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The word \"occupancy\" appears as part of the phrase \"right of private occupancy.\" The question is thus not just whether a person claims to have been occupying a particular \"room, dwelling or premises,\" but whether that person claimed a \"right\" to occupy that location in private. We conclude that, in Maryland, a patron of a business using that business's restroom stall for its intended purpose has a right to do so in private. We need look no further than \u00a7 3-902 of the Criminal Law Article, the statute under which Mr. Muehlhauser was convicted and on which the underlying plaintiffs relied, to find a statutory embodiment of this right. Section 3-902(a) prohibits a person from conducting nonconsensual visual surveillance of an individual in a private place with prurient intent. The statute defines \"private place\" to mean \"a room in which a person can reasonably be expected to fully or partially disrobe and has a reasonable expectation of privacy,\" including a \"restroom\" in, among other places, a \"restaurant or tavern.\" Crim. Law \u00a7 3-902(a)(5)(i) and (6). We conclude that the plain\n   meaning of the phrase \"right of private occupancy\" covers the right of an individual who is occupying a single-occupancy restroom in a restaurant or tavern for its intended purpose to do so in private.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We also have no trouble in concluding that video surveillance of the activities of an individual who is using a restroom stall in a restaurant or tavern for its intended purpose constitutes an \"invasion\" of that right. That is, again, conclusively established by the criminal penalties and private right of action created by \u00a7 3-902 itself. Maryland also recognizes a cause of action for intrusion upon seclusion, which is \"the intentional intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion of another or his private affairs or concerns that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.\"\n   <em>\n    Pemberton v.

Harleysville correctly points out that the language \"invasion of the right of private occupancy of a room\" does not appear alone in the policy. In particular, Harleysville highlights that this phrase appears with two others, \"wrongful eviction from\" and \"wrongful entry into,\" each of which requires the claimant to allege that she or he has a possessory interest in the property at issue. Based on the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   , Harleysville argues that this construction requires that a claimant alleging an invasion of a right of private occupancy must also allege a possessory interest in the property to fall within this coverage grant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   , meaning \"of the same kind or class,\" is a \"canon of construction holding that when a general word or phrase follows a list of specifics, the general word or phrase will be interpreted to include only items of the same class as those listed.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , \"\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   ,\" at 631 (10th ed. 2014).

The provision itself is one of seven listed categories of offenses that comprise the definition of \"personal and advertising injury.\" The full list is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   a. False arrest, detention or imprisonment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   b. Malicious prosecution;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   c. The wrongful eviction from, wrongful entry into, or invasion of the right or private occupancy of a room, dwelling or premises that a person occupies, committed by or on behalf of its owner, landlord or lessor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   d.

Infringing upon another's copyright, trade dress or slogan in your 'advertisement'.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Nothing about this list suggests that \"invasion of the right of private occupancy\" is intended to be limited in scope by the two terms that precede it. Indeed, none of the other categories of offenses follow that structure. To the contrary, categories (a), (b), (f), and (g), simply list specific offenses. And categories (d) and (e) identify broad categories, but without any specific examples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We also find it notable that \"invasion of the right of private occupancy\" is not preceded by the word \"other,\" which is a\n   standard grammatical cue that a term is meant to encompass what came before it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sinclair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1877487\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/274/646/#p650\">\n    274 Md. at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=337%20A.2d%20703\">\n    337 A.2d 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (referencing \"other thing of value\").\n   Instead, the provision simply lists three items, separated by an \"or\" that is not paired with \"other,\" which is the standard grammatical cue that an additional listed item is to follow. By contrast, several of the cases from other jurisdictions on which Harleysville relies construed coverage grants that\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   include the cue \"other.\" Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Groshong v.

Indeed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit observed that \"[a]lmost all of the precedent invoking the Latin maxim involve insurance policies that include the phrase '\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   invasion of the right of private occupancy.' \"\n   <em>\n    New Castle County v.

In\n   <em>\n    New Castle County\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit observed that courts interpreting similar policy language had reached inconsistent conclusions.

The policy provided coverage for personal injury, including \"[w]rongful eviction from, wrongful entry into,\n   <em>\n    or invasion of the right of private occupancy of a room\n   </em>\n   , dwelling or premises that a person occupies\n   <em>\n    by or on behalf of its owner, landlord or lessor\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457612\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/273/605/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457612\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/273/605/\">\n    at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis supplied by Fifth Circuit).

Moreover, although the court found the provision to be unambiguous, it further noted that even if it were ambiguous, it would need to be interpreted in favor of coverage under Mississippi law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457612\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/273/605/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457612\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/273/605/\">\n    at 619-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (acknowledging that \"[w]ell reasoned opinions of other courts\" had found the phrase to be \"highly ambiguous\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We join the Fifth Circuit in declining to read into the phrase \"invasion of the right of private occupancy\" a requirement that a claimant asserting such a right have a possessory interest in the property at issue. As already noted, we do not consider the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   to be implicated by either the grammatical structure of the provision or the context of the list in which it appears. We do not believe the coverage grant to be ambiguous. But even if it were, in the absence of any extrinsic evidence that would support Harleysville's interpretation, we would be required to interpret the provision in favor of the reasonable interpretation proffered by Rams Head. We thus conclude that, for purposes of the duty to defend under the Harleysville policies, video surveillance of individuals using a restroom in a tavern or restaurant for its intended purpose\n   is an invasion of the right of private occupancy of the restroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Rams Head as the Owner of the Restroom\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Harleysville also contends that the underlying complaints do not allege \"personal and advertising injury\" under the policy because they do not allege that the invasion of the right of private occupancy at issue was committed by or on behalf of the \"owner, landlord or lessor\" of the restroom. The facts are not in dispute. Rams Head leases the property on which the Rams Head Tavern is located from Savage Mill pursuant to a long-term lease. Provided Rams Head complies with its obligations under the lease, it is entitled to \"peaceably and quietly hold and enjoy the Leased Premises ... without hindrance or interruption by Landlord or any other person or persons ....\" The circuit court\n   found that Rams Head exercises \"exclusive control\" over the restaurant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In essence, Harleysville asks that we strictly construe the term \"owner\" to be limited to the legal ownership of the real property on which the building is located. Rams Head counters that the use of \"owner\" in the provision is more flexible and encompasses Rams Head's exclusive control over the restroom located in the business it owns and operates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   To resolve this issue, we look to the common and popular understanding of the word \"owner.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2017537\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/330/758/#p781\">\n    330 Md. 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 781,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2017537\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/330/758/#p781\">\n    625 A.2d 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993) (observing that courts afford policy terms the meanings \"as used and understood by reasonably prudent laypersons in daily life\"). Of course, \"owner\" is not used in a vacuum, but it appears as part of the phrase \"of a room, dwelling or premises that a person occupies, committed by or on behalf of its owner, landlord or lessor.\" Given that we are focused on a \"right of private occupancy\" in the restroom, the question is whether Rams Head was the \"owner\" of that room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A common definition of \"own\" is \"have (something) as one's own; possess.\"\n   <em>\n    New Oxford American\n   </em>\n   , \"own,\" at 1253;\n   <em>\n    accord Merriam-Webster's Collegiate\n   </em>\n   , \"own,\" at 887 (\"to have or hold\n   as property: POSSESS\"). There is no indication in the policies that \"owner\" was intended to reference fee simple ownership of real property as opposed to this common, everyday understanding of the term. It is uncontested here that Rams Head possessed the entire Rams Head Tavern, including its women's restroom; indeed, Harleysville's counsel expressly conceded that at oral argument. We conclude that, for purposes of this coverage grant, Rams Head was the \"owner\" of the restroom in the Rams Head Tavern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We consider it confirmation of our interpretation of the plain language of the policy that coverage would be rendered illusory if we were to instead accept Harleysville's interpretation. This category of personal and advertising injury insurance provides coverage for claims that an insured who has granted someone a right to possess or occupy privately a \"room, dwelling or premises\" has wrongfully diminished or destroyed that right. Interpreting \"owner, landlord or lessor\" as proposed by Harleysville would effectively eliminate coverage for any owner of a business that, like Rams Head, does not own in fee simple the property on which the business operates. In light of the structure of many modern businesses, that would effectively wipe out coverage for many business owners even for wrongful eviction or wrongful entry claims. For example, a hotel that is operated by a company that does not own the underlying property would be denied coverage for a claim that it improperly evicted a patron from a room she or he had rented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Rams Head, not Savage Mill, possessed and had control over the restroom. And Rams Head, not Savage Mill, was empowered to grant its customers the right to occupy the restroom while they were patronizing the restaurant. We therefore conclude that Rams Head was the owner of the restroom for purposes of the coverage grant. We now turn to the exclusions Harleysville invokes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Recording and Distribution Exclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Harleysville contends that even if Rams Head otherwise would be entitled to a defense, coverage is precluded under the 2014 Policy by the Recording and Distribution exclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under that exclusion, coverage is not available for \" 'personal and advertising injury' arising directly or indirectly out of any action or omission that violates or is alleged to violate\" three specific statutes-the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"), the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\")-or \"[a]ny federal, state or local statute, ordinance or regulation, other than the TCPA, CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 or FCRA and their amendments and additions, that addresses, prohibits, or limits the printing, dissemination, disposal, collecting, recording, sending, transmitting, communicating or distribution of material or information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Unlike the listing of offenses covered as personal and advertising injury, this appears to be a paradigmatic case for application of\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   , as it satisfies all of the\n   <em>\n    In re Wallace W.\n   </em>\n   criteria.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2023760\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/333/186/#p190\">\n    333 Md. at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2023760\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/333/186/#p190\">\n    634 A.2d 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, we have (1) an enumeration by specific words of statutes intended to be covered; (2) the enumeration suggests a class of statutes directed at protecting consumers from either unwanted solicitations\n   (TCPA and CAN-SPAM) or the collection and distribution of financial information (FCRA); (3) a class that is not exhausted by these references; (4) a reference to a general category; and (5) no manifestation of an intent to give a broader meaning to the general category than the doctrine requires. Thus, we interpret the Recording and Distribution exclusion to cover conduct that is alleged to violate, in addition to the specified statutes, other statutes or regulations that protect consumers from the types of harm addressed by the enumerated statutes: unwanted solicitations and the improper collection and distribution of financial information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The history of this provision supports our interpretation. The 04 Policy Form contained a \"Distribution of Material in Violation of Statutes\" exclusion, which was similar to the Recording and Distribution exclusion except that it did not: (1) list the FCRA as a specific statute covered; or (2) include \"printing, dissemination, disposal, collecting, [or] recording\" in the general category that followed the listing of specific statutes. The addition of the FCRA was thus linked to the addition of these new terms in the general category when the new exclusion appeared by endorsement in the 2014 Policy.

HARLEYSVILLE DID NOT HAVE A DUTY TO DEFEND AGAINST CLAIMS THAT MR. MUEHLHAUSER INVADED THE UNDERLYING PLAINTIFFS' RIGHT OF PRIVATE OCCUPANCY OF THE RAMS HEAD TAVERN'S RESTROOM .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Our analysis with respect to the general applicability of Coverage B and the lack of application of the Recording and\n   Distribution exclusion applies equally to Mr. Muehlhauser's claim for coverage as it does to Rams Head's claim for coverage. However, Harleysville raises additional defenses to Mr. Muehlhauser's claims, including that: (1) Mr. Muehlhauser is not an \"insured\" under the policy for purposes of the underlying claims; and (2) the Knowing Violation and Criminal Acts exclusions preclude coverage. We disagree as to the first argument, but agree that the Criminal Acts exclusion applies and bars coverage for Mr. Muehlhauser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Mr. Muehlhauser Was an Insured Under the Policy for Purposes of the Duty to Defend.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The policies define an insured to include the members of a named insured, \"but only with respect to the conduct of your business,\" as well as the managers of a named insured, \"but only with respect to their duties as your managers.\" Harleysville contends that Mr. Muehlhauser was not an insured for purposes of the\n   <em>\n    Clar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Castle\n   </em>\n   claims because the activities he is alleged to have engaged in were not \"with respect to the conduct of [Rams Head's] business.\" Mr. Muehlhauser responds that, at least for purposes of the duty to defend, he qualifies as an insured because both complaints expressly alleged that he was acting within the scope of his duties as a manager and owner of Rams Head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Before we address the merits of this claim we must first address Harleysville's contention that the circuit court erred in refusing to consider evidence outside the pleadings that would have established conclusively that Mr. Muehlhauser was not acting with respect to the conduct of Rams Head's business. Harleysville argues that the parties to a declaratory judgment action regarding the duty to defend are not restricted to the allegations of the underlying complaints when considering who is an insured under the policy. Although that is true in certain circumstances, those are limited to cases in which the resolution of the question of who an insured is would not affect the defense of the underlying claims. That is not the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As already discussed, the general rule is that whether an insurer has a duty to defend is determined exclusively by comparing the coverage provisions of the policy against the allegations of the claim.\n   <em>\n    Blackstone Int'l Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , 442 Md. at 696,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185121\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/685/#p694\">\n    114 A.3d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Coverage B does not apply to injuries \"arising out of a criminal act committed by or at the direction of the insured.\" Harleysville contends that this exclusion bars coverage for Mr. Muehlhauser because the acts he is alleged to have committed are criminal. Mr. Muehlhauser argues that the application of this exclusion would render meaningless the coverage grant and run afoul of the rule established in\n   <em>\n    Bailer\n   </em>\n   , which prohibits giving effect to an exclusion that would swallow the coverage grant.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"850426\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/344/515/\">\n    344 Md. at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"850426\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/344/515/\">\n    687 A.2d 1375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Harleysville disagrees, asserting that, unlike the \"expected or\n   intended\" exclusion at issue in\n   <em>\n    Bailer\n   </em>\n   , giving force to the Criminal Acts exclusion would not negate the coverage provided by Coverage B.
