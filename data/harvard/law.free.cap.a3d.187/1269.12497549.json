In this direct appeal, appellant challenges the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress statements he made during his post-arrest custodial interrogation. He primarily argues that statements his interrogators made during his interview subverted the advice they had earlier given him about his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   invalidated the waiver he had made of those rights, and resulted in a confession that was inadmissible. He also contends that the investigators' tactics rendered his confession involuntary. Although we agree that improper statements by an interrogator after a suspect has heard, understood, and waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights may, in the totality of circumstances, invalidate the waiver prospectively, we are persuaded that this is not what occurred in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are also satisfied that appellant's confession was voluntary. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The relevant facts are as follows. In the afternoon of June 9, 2014, Metropolitan Police Department (\"MPD\") officers responded to a \"look[-]out for an individual who was possibly carrying a firearm\" at 16th Street and Kalorama Road, N.W. Upon arriving at a location in the 2400 block of 16th Street, N.W., one of the officers observed appellant, who fit the look-out description, walking northbound on 16th Street. As the officers, who were in uniform and driving a scout car, parked and began to exit the car, appellant noticed them, and he fled before they had a chance to speak with him. The officers followed on foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the chase, appellant turned into a parking lot and stopped at the rear of a vehicle, where an officer who had caught up with him saw appellant \"ducking down almost to conceal himself ....\" The officer testified to seeing appellant \"move his arm ... away from [his] body and towards the [vehicle]\" and then hearing \"the sound of a metal object hitting the ground.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant fled again, this time tripping and falling shortly upon taking flight. The officers apprehended and detained appellant and, upon returning to where the vehicle was parked, found a firearm beneath the vehicle. The officers then arrested appellant for possession of the firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the police station, Investigators Elias Danho\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and James Gamble interviewed appellant. The video recording of that interview,\n   which we have reviewed, shows appellant arriving into a small room, where the investigators undo his handcuffs and chain his feet to the floor. The substantive interview began with Investigator Gamble telling appellant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [D]on't say anything yet, but you're looking at a felon in possession of a firearm charge .... So today, because you're a felon, it's a felon in possession of a firearm. It's a little more serious .... So this is your chance to kind of roll me through what's going, what happened out there .... So let me read you your rights, you think about ... what we gonna talk about and then you let me know what we're gonna do[,] okay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant nodded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, Investigator Gamble read appellant his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights from a form as appellant, looking at the form, followed along. Once he finished reading, Gamble asked appellant whether he had any questions (a question appellant answered by \"shak[ing his] head no\") and whether he understood his rights. Appellant responded that he did. When Investigator Gamble then asked appellant whether he \"wish[ed] to answer any questions,\" and appellant responded, \"No,\" Gamble stated, \"All right. That's it then.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As the investigators begin gathering their materials to leave the room, appellant inquired, \"How I got charged with a gun?\" Gamble responded, \"Well[,] I'm not gonna answer your questions if you're not gonna answer mine[ ].\" Appellant replied, \"I mean I'll answer questions. I ain't got no problems answering no questions.\" Gamble then retrieved a new\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   form, reread appellant his rights, and asked the required questions again. This time, appellant agreed to answer questions outside the presence of an attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The investigators then questioned appellant over a period of about an hour and fifteen minutes (interrupting the interview at one point after appellant said that he needed to use the restroom). The investigators began by asking appellant to explain \"why [he] started running\" when officers arrived. Appellant first said that he did not know that the men who approached him were officers, even though they were in uniform. When Investigator Gamble again asked why appellant had run, appellant eventually explained that he and the man he was with when officers arrived were in the area because that man, whom he did not really know, had asked appellant to give him a ride to an apartment building there. Appellant said that he had no idea what the other man was planning to do at the building. Appellant continued, \"So then-so we couldn't get in the building .... So when we start walking back off[,] he was just like, man run. I don't know what he had did. When the police had pulled up[,] and he was like run, I just ran. That was it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When Investigator Gamble told appellant that the other officers had reported that appellant had a gun on him, appellant denied that he had a gun (saying instead, \"I had a knife on me, man.\"). In response, the investigators told appellant that his denials were \"not gonna cut it.\" Appellant responded, \"I already know it ain't gonna cut it right here.\" Investigator Gamble urged appellant to provide \"a reason\" why he had the gun, such as \"someone's out for me,\" suggesting that \"maybe they can work with that.\" Gamble told appellant that if he were to go \"in front of th[e] judge and say, I didn't have a gun on me, ... they're gonna look at [appellant's prior convictions for] armed robbery, previous arrest with the gun, [and the] officer saying [appellant] had the gun,\" and appellant would be \"done. Right?\" Appellant agreed, saying \"Um hmm.\" Appellant also agreed with Gamble's observation that the gun\n   made it look like he was \"there about to rob somebody again\" and acknowledged that \"[w]ith my background[,] [the judge or jury] gonna believe [what the officers have to say].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Throughout the interview, Gamble suggested that appellant's possession of the gun had already been established, stating at one point, \"[W]e don't really need to talk. Because from what they're telling me[,] they got you.\" Gamble further told appellant, \"I'm not even trying to get you to say, yeah[,] I had a gun, because we know you had a gun. I'm trying to figure out why you had a gun.\" Gamble told appellant that the investigators \"need[ed] to hear a reason,\" such as that appellant had \"an ex-girlfriend ... who [had] threatened\" him, or that appellant's friend \"handed [him] a gun\" and \"said hold this for a second,\" or that appellant \"needed a gun [be]cause he thought [other people] were gonna kill him .... [or that] [t]hey might even go kill his grandma ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The investigators also told appellant that this was his chance to \"lessen the damage\" by informing them of the reason for his possession of the gun. Investigator Gamble told appellant that if the person to whom he had given a ride \"did something wrong up in that apartment[,] you're facing that too.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When appellant continued to deny possession of the gun (he asserts that he did so \"twenty times\"), Gamble finally stated, \"All right[,] man. I mean, we don't want to keep going round and round with you, but you got-this is it. I don't think we have much more. So you sure? You don't want to go over this story one more time from the beginning?\" This time-just after telling Investigator Danho (who had stood after telling appellant that the investigators would \"give [him] a few minutes\") to \"sit down\" again-appellant confessed. Appellant told the investigators that he and the man to whom he had given a ride went to the building to \"sell the gun to somebody,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that because \"the [other man's] shirt ... was too small\" or \"too short\" to conceal the gun, appellant \"held the gun\" (\"just grabbed [the gun] and tucked it\" in his jeans) for the other man. Appellant said that the gun had a \"wood handle\" and stated that the gun must have fallen out of his pants when he tripped and fell during his flight from the officers. Shortly after appellant made that statement (at approximately 6:43 p.m.), the interview ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Appellants Contentions and the Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Appellant contends that the trial court erred in ruling that his confession was admissible and in denying his motion to suppress. He asserts first that \"when police administer proper\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and secure a valid waiver ... but then contradict or undermine the warning, any subsequent statement is inadmissible,\" because \"a suspect who is misinformed about the consequences of foregoing his right[s] ... cannot have knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived that right ....\" He argues that this is what happened here: that statements by Investigators Gamble and Danho contradicted and undermined the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning, rendering appellant's prior waiver ineffective with respect to the statements he made toward the close of the interview. Appellant also argues that the interrogators' tactics rendered his confession coerced and involuntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The facts of what occurred during the interrogation, captured on video and transcript, are not in dispute. Appellant's claims raise entirely legal issues, as to which our review is\n   <em>\n    de novo. See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dorsey v.

Thus, where a suspect says that he will no longer talk and that he wants a lawyer,\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   requires the authorities to stop the interrogation cold, even after initially obtaining a valid waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641704,12449208\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/370/\">\n    560 U.S. at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641704,12449208\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/370/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If the right to counsel or the right to remain silent is invoked at any point during questioning, further interrogation must cease.\"). \"[T]he individual's right to choose between silence and speech [must] remain[ ] unfettered throughout the interrogation process.\"\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , 384 U.S. at 469,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court and others have recognized that this means that \"the interrogator may not say or do something during the ensuing interrogation that subverts th[e] [\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ] warnings and [prospectively] vitiates the suspect's earlier waiver by rendering it unknowing, involuntary, or both.\"\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722823\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/418/136/\">\n    12 A.3d at 1241, 1250-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that an officer's statement that the interrogation is \"between you and me\" subverted the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning that any statement the suspect makes \"can and will be used against\" him, \"rendering in violation of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   all statements the suspect thereafter made during that interrogation\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This court found a vitiation of a prior waiver in\n   <em>\n    Di Giovanni v.

The opinion in that case recounts that when suspect Di Giovanni asked the police sergeant \"whether he needed a lawyer at that point in time[,]\" the sergeant \"responded that he would need one later, but that at that time he did not think Di Giovanni needed one\" and that \"it would be best if [Di Giovanni] told [his] side of the story.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314267\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/810/887/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314267\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/810/887/\">\n    at 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We concluded that \"in the totality of the circumstances, [the sergeant's] embellishments and directives that Di Giovanni didn't need a lawyer vitiated the validity of his waiver.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314267\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/810/887/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314267\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/810/887/\">\n    at 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Here, similarly, we agree with appellant's argument that when an interrogator or interrogators make statements during a post-waiver interrogation that are contrary to what the suspect was told when he was read his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and agreed to talk to the police without counsel, those statements may, in the totality\n   of the circumstances, effectively nullify the waiver and render inadmissible any statements the suspect makes from that point on. The issue we confront is whether, in the totality of circumstances, that result ensued from appellant's custodial interrogation by Investigators Gamble and Danho. The totality of the circumstances includes,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a suspect's \"prior experience with the legal system, evidence of coercion or trickery, cognitive ability ... [, and the] delay between arrest and statement.\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Below, we consider the statements in the context of the totality of circumstances to determine whether any of the statements, by themselves or in combination, had that effect and rendered appellant's waiver ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether appellant's\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    waiver was vitiated\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Appellant's background and the interrogation conditions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The record indicates that at the time of his interrogation, appellant was thirty-one-years-old, had a criminal history that included convictions for robbery and CPWL, and, as he told the investigators during the interrogation, had \"been locked up before\" and was \"familiar with the system.\" Prior to the interrogation, appellant had not \"been drinking or smok[ing] anything.\" After entering the interview room, appellant placed his arms inside the torso section of his short-sleeved T-shirt (as if for warmth) and held them there for most of the interview, but seemed relaxed\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and exhibited no signs of physical or mental distress during the interview.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officers had encountered and arrested appellant at approximately 2:42 p.m., and Investigators Danho and Gamble began interviewing appellant at approximately 5:28 p.m. the same day, ending the interview approximately one hour and fifteen minutes later, at 6:43 p.m. Several times during the interview-including just before he confessed-appellant took long pauses before answering the interrogators' questions, apparently taking his time to think through the implications of his decision about what to say and whether to answer the investigators' questions (as if performing his \"own balancing of competing considerations,\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9426998\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/643/735/#p751\">\n    643 N.W.2d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 751-52 (S.D. 2002) ). Throughout the interview, the investigators never raised their voices, and they accommodated appellant's request to use the bathroom. Appellant was informed that he was \"under arrest\" and was read his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights (twice), and he told the investigators, \"I understand my rights, man.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We can discern nothing in the foregoing context and circumstances that gives us concern that appellant did not understand his rights at the time he confessed. We now go on to consider the investigators' statements and appellant's arguments based on them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Statements that appellant contends disparaged his right to have counsel present during the interrogation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Appellant argues that the interrogators subverted the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning by disparaging his right to counsel. He focuses on the following statements by Investigator Gamble:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   If you get to court and your defense attorney stands up there, who they're not gonna believe anyway. He says well, someone was threatening his life. He needed a gun 'cause he thought they were gonna kill him. They-they said they were gonna kill him. They might even go kill his grandma. They not gonna believe it then. At that point[,] it's too far gone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Appellant variously characterizes those remarks as \"a 'directive that [he] didn't need a lawyer,' and that he would be better off speaking right then without counsel\"; as advice \"that he would put himself at risk if he waited to talk to his attorney\"; as a \" 'one-sided, unauthorized legal opinion' that [he] should\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   'remain silent and exercise his right to counsel' \"; as a warning that \" 'invoking the right to counsel would come at a price' \"; and as statements that told appellant that \"reliance on an attorney would be futile.\" Appellant contends that through these remarks, the investigators \"methodically undermined\" the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights of which he had been advised. He asserts that the investigators' conduct was geared toward making him believe that \"relying on an attorney ... would be a grave mistake.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We do not agree that the investigators disparaged the right to counsel or that their statements otherwise contravened \"the principles the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights were designed to protect.\"\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   is \"concern[ed] ... primarily with th[e] interrogation atmosphere and the evils it can bring.\"\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , 384 U.S. at 456,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The reading of a suspect's\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights is designed to combat the pressures of in-custody interrogation, so as \"to permit a full opportunity to exercise the [Fifth Amendment] privilege against self-incrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 467,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   Court also recognized, however, that \"[t]he circumstances surrounding in-custody interrogation can operate very quickly to overbear the will of one merely made aware of his privilege by his interrogators.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 469,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The investigators' statements were to the effect that, at trial, the fact-finder would be unlikely to believe a gun-possession-in-self-defense theory mentioned by counsel for the first time during trial, after appellant, in answering the interrogators' questions, had denied having a gun at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The investigators did not, as appellant's argument implies, suggest to appellant that it would be a \"grave mistake\" to rely on an attorney during interrogation\n   or that appellant would do better without counsel during interrogation.

Here, by contrast, the investigators' statements to appellant were made after he had said he had \"no problem\" answering questions without counsel present. In addition, the investigators' statements focused not on remaining silent vs. speaking with the investigators without counsel, but instead on the credibility of any reason for having the gun appellant might later give at trial, compared to the credibility of an explanation provided during the interview. We do not discern that the investigators' statements were in derogation of appellant's \"ongoing right to remain silent\" or that the statements contradicted appellant's right to \"request the assistance of counsel at any time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We conclude, in short, that none of the investigators' statements highlighted by appellant implicated his right to consult with counsel before being interrogated or to have counsel present during the interrogation and that the statements in combination also did not do that. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the interrogators subverted their earlier message apprising appellant of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights by disparaging the right to counsel that\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   protects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Rather, the investigators' comments specifically cautioned appellant, an adult who was \"familiar with the system,\" that through lab work the police would find out to whom the gun actually belonged. The statements apprised appellant of the potential, in light of the officer's report that appellant had been in possession of the gun they recovered and had fled from police, that he could be charged with a while-armed homicide, robbery, or assault if, after \"digging,\" evidence of any such offense tied to the gun was found in the apartment building from which appellant had fled.

To begin with, the investigators never suggested to appellant that he could avoid prosecution and escape penalty if he confessed. Quite the contrary, as discussed above, the investigators let appellant know that he faced serious charges and that \"first of all[,] there's no getting out of this, you['re] on the hook.\" Appellant agreed that he \"kn[e]w what [he was] facing\" and at one point said \"[a]bout ten more years, man[,]\" (seeming to imply that he knew that this would be the potential period of prison time he would face after having \"just been there and done six years\"). He told the investigators that whether he said that he did not have the gun or said that he had it \"for whatever reasons,\" \"[t]he shit not gonna help me .... You see what I'm saying?\" (but agreed that he \"need[ed] to be looking to lessen the damage\").

Specifically, Gamble three times told appellant, \"If you didn't have a gun, don't say you had one,\" or words to that effect, and told appellant that he was \"not trying to get you to say you had [a gun] if you didn't.\" Danho said, \"If you didn't have a gun and you swear to it, we're not trying to convince you to say you did have the gun.\" Gamble also told appellant that he did not want him to \"kind of try to put a story together ....\" Thus, we cannot agree with appellant's claim that \"the detectives' repeated instruction that all they needed [him] to do was provide a 'decent reason' made it clear that their efforts were focused on obtaining an incriminating statement as opposed to the truth.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Appellant asserts that the investigators told him \"that providing them with an incriminating statement was his 'only' and 'last chance' to 'lessen the damage,' \" but the record does not quite support that characterization.

While appellant is correct that \"there are\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   circumstances in which law enforcement officers may suggest that a suspect's exercise of the\n   <em>\n    right to remain silent\n   </em>\n   may result in harsher treatment by a court or prosecutor,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   we are satisfied that such a coercive tactic is not what occurred here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    6. The cumulative effect of the investigators' various statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Our analysis of the investigators' individual statements shows that, contrary to appellant's assertion, his interrogators did not \"proceed to subvert [the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ] warnings at every turn\" and did not \"repeated[ly] mischaracterize[e]\" appellant's constitutional rights.

We therefore demur to appellant's complaint that questioning designed to urge appellant to confess \"permeated the entire interrogation.\" It is difficult to imagine a custodial interrogation whose entire \"course\" would not involve the interrogator's \"repeatedly\" posing questions or making statements by which, without deviation, they try to learn, through a confession, what actually happened. Nevertheless, having performed a statement-by-statement and subset-by-subset analysis of the interrogators' statements,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   we must\n   consider whether the statements, though not problematic individually or in combination under one of appellant's theories, might have had the cumulative effect of vitiating appellant's\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver. Therefore, we next consider appellant's argument his interrogators' \"relentless[ly]\" delivered the \"pervasive message\" that he \"could face other charges, including murder,\" and be \" 'hit hard' at sentencing\" unless he did as Investigator \"Gamble instructed\": give the investigators \" 'a decent reason' why he had a gun.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For the following reasons, we are satisfied that the investigators' statements and questions did not have the cumulative effect of rendering appellant's waiver invalid. First, the interrogation was a relatively short one,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   lasting approximately one and a half hours-which time was punctuated with a bathroom break, with a repeat of the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, and, during the questioning, by repeated long pauses (at least seventeen by our count) that appellant took (and seemed comfortable taking) before responding to the investigators' questions. Appellant rebuffed certain statements the investigators made to him (telling them that \"whatever reason[ ]\" he might offer for having a gun was \"not gonna help [him]\" or enable him to avoid \"do[ing] the protocol,\" and he got the investigators to agree with\n   <em>\n    him\n   </em>\n   (\"Yeah, you gonna be going through ... the process, ain't no doubt about that.\"). When Gamble told appellant that he could face additional charges related to the gun and the judge or jury would likely believe the officer who said he heard appellant drop the gun, appellant told them, \"I already know. I understand all that\" and \"I understand. I really do.\" Thus, the overall tenor of the interrogation was not, as appellant asserts, a \"steady corrosion\" of the understanding appellant had when he heard the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and waived his right to remain silent and to have an attorney present for questioning. Even after beginning his confession by saying, \"I think I was set up,\" appellant took long pauses, evidencing that he was still thinking about whether to go further rather than caving in the face of anything the investigators had said to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Further, not just at the beginning of the interview but throughout the exchanges between appellant and the investigators, appellant (and the investigators) appeared relaxed, and the investigators neither raised their voices, nor invaded appellant's\n   personal space, nor aggressively challenged his answers. As described above, they also displayed a willingness to \"step outside\" and give appellant \"a few minutes to think\" and to relent in their questioning. For example, when appellant initially responded that he did not want to answer any questions, Investigator Gamble said, \"All right. That's it then,\" and the investigators began gathering their materials to leave the room. When appellant later would not give a reason why he had the gun, Investigator Gamble said, \"we'll go with that\" and \"go and sit on back downstairs.\" Both investigators repeatedly told appellant not to confess falsely, Gamble telling him that three times before he confessed and Danho twice saying words to the effect that if the gun was not appellant's, he should \"stick to\" his denial. All these facts, coupled with the fact that this was not appellant's first encounter with the criminal justice system, leave us quite satisfied that the cumulative effect of the statements and questions about which appellant now complains was not to undermine and vitiate his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether appellant's confession was voluntary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Appellant also contends that \"[t]he investigators' 'undeviating intent to extract a confession' ... violated due process and rendered [his] confession involuntary\" and inadmissible for any purpose. \"The test for determining the voluntariness of specific statements is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the will of the suspect was overborne in such a way as to render his confession the product of coercion.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To recap what we have said above, appellant, a thirty-one-year-old adult, was no novice to the criminal system. He was advised of his rights (twice), underwent a relatively short (a little over an hour) and conversational-tone interrogation, was permitted to use the bathroom, was offered medical help, and apparently felt comfortable enough and sufficiently in control during the interrogation to take repeated long pauses before answering the investigators' questions. The Supreme Court has observed that \"cases in which a defendant can make a colorable argument that a self-incriminating statement was 'compelled' despite the fact that the law enforcement authorities adhered to the dictates of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   are rare.\"\n   <em>\n    Berkemer v.

It is true that in\n   <em>\n    Spano\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court concluded that the \"undeviating intent to extract a confession\" (through \"persistent and continuous\" efforts, including the sequential use, over an eight-hour period, of at least four different interrogators and, finally, Spano's close, childhood friend,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8889\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/360/315/#p324\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8889\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/360/315/#p324\">\n    at 317-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8889\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/360/315/#p324\">\n    79 S.Ct. 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) contributed to rendering Spano's confession involuntary. The Court has not, however, generally rejected law enforcement officials' deliberate efforts to obtain confessions. The Court has recognized that \"[a]dmissions of guilt are more than merely 'desirable[ ]'; they are essential to society's compelling interest in finding, convicting, and punishing those who violate the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Moran v.

Again, when appellant would not give a reason why he had the gun, Gamble said that the investigators would just \"go and sit on back downstairs.\" Earlier, when appellant initially responded that he did not want to answer any questions, Investigator Gamble said, \"All right. That's it then[,]\" and the investigators began gathering their materials to leave the room. This record does not bear the \"undeviating\" or unrelenting effort to extract a confession characterization appellant assigns to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Moreover, appellant's confession came only after he had taken several long pauses to think and a bathroom break, and after he beckoned Investigator Danho, who had stood up as if to leave, to sit down again. Those facts make this case much more like\n   <em>\n    Jacques\n   </em>\n   than like\n   <em>\n    Spano\n   </em>\n   . As appellant notes, in concluding that Jacques's confession was voluntary, the First Circuit observed (in appellant's words) that \"the defendant confessed not immediately after the police's urging that the confession would help him, but only after he had taken a cigarette break and returned to the room to tell the detectives he wanted to confess because he realized they had sufficient evidence to prove the case against him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the interrogators' statement did not vitiate appellant's\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver and that appellant's confession was voluntary. We therefore affirm the denial of appellant's motion to suppress and the judgment of the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    <em>\n     Miranda v.
