The primary issue we must resolve in this case is whether General Statutes \u00a7 8-2,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which authorizes a municipality's zoning commission to regulate the height, size, and location of \"advertising signs and billboards,\" permits a municipality to regulate signs erected on residential property that disparage a commercial vendor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff, the zoning enforcement officer for the city of Milford,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeals from the judgment of the trial court denying the plaintiff's request for permanent injunctions ordering the defendant homeowner, Eileen R. Arisian, to remove signs on her property that were not in compliance with city zoning regulations and precluding the defendant from occupying the property until she obtained certain certificates required after home improvements had been made to her residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the defendant's signs are not \"advertising signs,\" and, accordingly, the trial court properly concluded that municipal regulation of such signs is outside the scope of the authority granted under \u00a7 8-2. We further conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion when it declined to issue an injunction precluding the defendant from occupying the subject premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We first address the plaintiff's challenge to the trial court's conclusion that the city's zoning commission\n   lacked authority to regulate the defendant's signs as \"advertising signs\" under \u00a7 8-2. The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant contracted with Baybrook Remodelers, Inc., for certain home improvements. Evidently dissatisfied with Baybrook's performance, the defendant erected three signs on her property. One sign stated: \"I\n   <em>\n    Do Not\n   </em>\n   Recommend BAYBROOK REMODELERS.\" Two signs contained the caption: \"BAYBROOK REMODELERS' TOTAL LAWSUITS,\" with bar graphs underneath the caption reflecting the number of lawsuits to which the contractor purportedly was a party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thereafter, the plaintiff issued an order notifying the defendant that her signs violated city zoning regulations limiting the size, height, and number of signs per\n   street line and ordering her to remove them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   See Milford Zoning Regs., art. V, \u00a7\u00a7 5.3.3.3 (2) and 5.3.4.1. When the defendant still had not complied months later, the plaintiff commenced the present action, which sought to enjoin the defendant from maintaining the signs that did not comply with the zoning regulations. The defendant asserted a special defense that the city lacked authority to regulate her signs under \u00a7 8-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court denied the request for the injunction. The court found that the defendant's signs violated the restrictions on the size, height, and number of signs in the city's zoning regulations. The court nonetheless concluded that the city lacked authority to regulate the signs under \u00a7 8-2. It reasoned that the defendant's signs were not \"advertising signs\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   as previously defined by this court because they did not promote the sale of goods or services. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff asserts that an \"advertising\" sign, as that term is used in \u00a7 8-2 and as that term is commonly defined, means any sign that makes a public announcement. According to the plaintiff, this broad definition is proper because it more fully aligns with the stated purposes of the zoning enabling statute than the narrower one adopted by the trial court. The plaintiff further asserts that this broader definition is proper because a narrower definition may constitute content based regulation in violation of the first amendment to the United States constitution. We disagree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The meaning of the term \"advertising signs\" is a matter of statutory construction, to which well settled principles and plenary review apply.\n   <em>\n    Middlebury\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Siting Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489798\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/537/#p48\">\n    326 Conn. 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489798\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/537/#p48\">\n    161 A.3d 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). \"In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z directs us to first consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes.

But see General Statutes \u00a7 20-206g (a) (defining \" 'advertise' \" for purposes of provision limiting advertisements by massage therapists by reference to inclusion of certain terms). However, as the trial court's decision in the present case reflects, this court has previously considered the meaning of this term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Schwartz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Planning &amp; Zoning Commission\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519028\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/208/146/#p153\">\n    208 Conn. at 153-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=543%20A.2d%201339\">\n    543 A.2d 1339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the defendant commission was attempting to apply its zoning regulations to preclude the display of an artistic, cylindrical metal sculpture erected in front of a shopping plaza. We concluded\n   that the sculpture was not a \"sign\" as defined under the town of Hamden's zoning regulations, because, although it would attract the attention of passersby, it did not attract attention to a \" 'use, product, service, or activity' \" as provided under the regulation's definition. Id., at 154,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=543%20A.2d%201339\">\n    543 A.2d 1339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We also noted, however, that the defendant commission's expansive interpretation was not consistent with the authority granted to it under \u00a7 8-2 to regulate \"advertising signs and billboards.\" Id., at 154-55,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=543%20A.2d%201339\">\n    543 A.2d 1339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court first referenced dictionary definitions of \"advertise\" that it deemed most relevant: \"to announce publicly esp[ecially] by a printed notice or a broadcast; [and]\n   <em>\n    to call public attention to esp[ecially] by emphasizing desirable qualities so as to arouse a desire to buy or patronize\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)

See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491081\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/171/1037/#p939\">\n    327 Conn. 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 939,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491081\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/171/1037/#p939\">\n    171 A.3d 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (The court acknowledged prior case law addressing the matter before the court but concluded: \"[W]e have never undertaken the necessary textual and historical examination to reach an informed conclusion.... Therefore, we now undertake such an examination,\n   informed by settled factors that guide this process.\" [Citations omitted; footnote omitted.] ).\n   In the absence of a statutory definition of \"advertising signs,\" our starting point must be the common meaning of the term, as reflected in the dictionary. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) (\"[i]n the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language\");\n   <em>\n    Maturo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State Employees Retirement Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489841\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/706/#p176\">\n    326 Conn. 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 176,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489841\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/706/#p176\">\n    162 A.3d 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (relying on dictionary definitions). However, the definition applied in Schwartz, as well as those relied on by both parties to the present case, suffers from two flaws. First, those definitions are not contemporaneous with the time when the grant of authority to regulate \"advertising signs and billboards\" was added to the zoning enabling statute. See\n   <em>\n    Maturo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State Employees Retirement Commission\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 176,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489841\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/706/#p176\">\n    162 A.3d 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[w]hen a term is not defined in a statute, we begin with the assumption that the legislature intended the word to carry its ordinary meaning, as evidenced in dictionaries in print at the time the statute was enacted\"); see also\n   <em>\n    Sandifer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701987\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/220/\">\n    571 U.S. 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12585945,12701987\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/870/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 876,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12585945,12701987\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/870/\">\n    187 L.Ed. 2d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (\"[i]t is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that, unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,\n   <em>\n    contemporary\n   </em>\n   , common meaning\" [emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted] ); see, e.g.,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12585945,12701987\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/870/\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (looking to dictionary definition at time of statute's enactment). Second, the parties rely exclusively on definitions of the verb \"advertise,\" not the adjective \"advertising,\" which is the operative form of the word used in the statute and which could have a different meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The grant of municipal zoning authority to regulate \"advertising signs and billboards\" was added to the zoning enabling statute in 1931. Public Acts 1931, c. 29, \u00a7 42a; General Statutes (Cum. Supp. 1931) \u00a7 88c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Contemporaneous dictionaries provide a relevant definition of \"advertise\" that is consistent with the broad meaning advocated by the plaintiff. See Webster's New International Dictionary (2d Ed. 1934) p. 39 (\"[t]o give notice to; to inform; to notify; to make known to; hence, to warn;-often with\n   <em>\n    of\n   </em>\n   before the subject of information; as, to\n   <em>\n    advertise\n   </em>\n   a man of his loss\" and \"[t]o give public notice of; to announce publicly, esp[ecially] by a printed notice; as, to\n   <em>\n    advertise\n   </em>\n   a sale; hence, to call public attention to, esp[ecially] by emphasizing desirable qualities, in order to arouse a desire to purchase, invest, patronize, or the like\" [emphasis in original] ); Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language (1928) p. 42 (\"[t]o give public notice or information, as of some thing desired, an entertainment, a place of business, etc.; publish; as, to\n   <em>\n    advertise\n   </em>\n   for a servant; to\n   <em>\n    advertise\n   </em>\n   extensively\" [emphasis in original] ). These definitions indicate that commercial advertising is perhaps the most common form of such expression, but not the only form under this broad meaning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The definition of \"advertising,\" however, reflects a more specific meaning aimed at the purpose of this form of expression. Webster's New International Dictionary,\n   supra, p. 39, defines \"advertising\" as \"[a]ny form of public announcement intended to aid directly or indirectly in the sale of a commodity, etc., in the promulgation of a doctrine or idea, in securing attendance, as at a meeting, or the like.\" See also Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language (1946) p. 42 (defining \"advertising\" as \"[t]he act of making known by public notice; by extension, the art of announcing or offering for sale in such a manner as to induce purchase\"). These dictionaries reflect that, around 1931, \"advertising\" referred to the\n   <em>\n    promotion\n   </em>\n   of many subjects, of which commercial goods and services were perhaps the most common. Because the announcement is \"intended to aid\" the proponent, the definition implies that some benefit inures to the proponent through such promotion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    People\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"830078\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc/147/12/#p13\">\n    147 Misc. 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 13-15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=263%20N.Y.S.%20290\">\n    263 N.Y.S. 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Spec. Sess. App. Pt. 1933) (The court concluded that a municipal ordinance prohibiting \"advertising\" trucks in the streets had been violated by a truck bearing messages offering a reward for the arrest of persons who had bombed a labor union's headquarters, and the following statements: \"Please do not patronize Patio Albermarle Farragut Rialto. They employ a scab group.\" \"We stand for decency in unionism ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When the meaning of \"advertising\" is linked with the meaning of \"sign,\" there is further evidence that the\n   broadest meaning of \"advertise\"-any public announcement-was not intended when this zoning authority was granted in 1931. The relevant contemporaneous definition of \"sign\" was \"[a] lettered board, or other conspicuous notice, placed on or before a building, room, shop, or office to advertise the business there transacted, or the name of the person or firm conducting it; a publicly displayed token or notice.\" Webster's New International Dictionary, supra, p. 2334. As such, the definition distinguishes a sign as a means to advertise from a means to simply convey information to the public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   By interpreting \"advertising\" consistently with its contemporaneous definition, we afford independent meaning to that term as well as to \"sign.\" By contrast, the plaintiff's interpretation of advertising sign to mean any sign that makes a public announcement largely renders the term \"advertising\" superfluous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is a cardinal rule of construction that no word or phrase of a statute should be rendered superfluous. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Marchesi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Selectmen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Conn.%20608\">\n    309 Conn. 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 615,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20A.3d%20394\">\n    72 A.3d 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) ;\n   <em>\n    Lopa\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brinker International, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086077\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/296/426/#p433\">\n    296 Conn. 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 433,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=994%20A.2d%201265\">\n    994 A.2d 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Had the legislature intended to cast such a broad net, presumably it would have simply granted a municipality the authority to regulate \"signs,\" as it has in other provisions of the General Statutes. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 7-148 (c) (7) (vi) (granting municipality power to \"[r]egulate and prohibit the placing, erecting or keeping of signs ... upon or over the sidewalks, streets and other public places of the municipality\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We also observe that the contemporaneous, narrower meaning of advertising better comports with related statutes and the history of the grant of regulatory authority. \"Advertising signs\" are the subject of several other statutes, some adopted prior to the amendment to the zoning statute in 1931, and some afterward. Prior to 1931, the legislature enacted a licensing (permit and fee) requirement for advertising signs, which was codified in a chapter of the General Statutes entitled \"ADVERTISING SIGNS.\" Public Acts 1915, c. 314; General Statutes (1918 Rev.) tit. 25, c. 168. That scheme is currently codified at chapter 411 and is identically entitled. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21-50 through 21-63. According to historical evidence, this requirement was aimed at controlling the proliferation of commercial advertising.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   See J. Loshin, \"Property in the Horizon:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Theory and Practice of Sign and Billboard Regulation,\" 30 Environs: Envtl.

Supp. 1931) \u00a7\u00a7 89c and 90c (prescribing conditions for erecting advertising signs and treating such signs as type of commercial or business structure).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, exemptions to the licensing requirement reveal that the signs subject to the licensing requirements extended beyond purely commercial advertising to signs promoting other types of enterprises. See General Statutes \u00a7 21-55 (providing exemption for \"advertising sign containing six square feet or less, from any town, city, borough, fire district or incorporated fire company, service club or church or ecclesiastical society in this state for any advertisement owned by it and advertising its industries\n   or attractions and maintained at either public or private expense\"); see also General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 3024 (excluding signs less than four square feet); General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 3029 (providing exception for \"any town, city or borough for any advertisement owned by it and advertising its industries and maintained at either public or private expense\"). Consistent with the contemporaneous meaning of \"advertising,\" this exemption implies that advertising promotes something for the benefit of the proponent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This meaning is also consistent with the interpretation given to a statute regulating advertising signs that was subsequently enacted. The legislature enacted a statute limiting placement of advertising signs and structures within a certain distance of highways. See General Statutes \u00a7 13a-123. This statute was originally enacted in 1959 and subsequently was amended in 1967 to ensure compliance with the federal Highway Beautification Act of 1965. See Public Acts 1959, No. 526, \u00a7\u00a7 1-7, 9-11; Public Acts 1967, No. 632, \u00a7 1. Notably, the statute exempts signs bearing certain subject matter; all of the specific examples cited conform to the promotional, beneficial definition of advertising previously cited, i.e., signs \"pertaining to natural wonders and scenic and historical attractions,\" \"advertising the sale or lease of the property,\" or advertising \"activities conducted on the property on which they are located ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 13a-123 (e) (1), (2) and (3).

In rejecting a claim that the regulation applied to commercial speech only, the court addressed noncommercial advertising in a manner consistent with the promotional, beneficial\n   definition set forth\n   in the 1934 Webster's New International Dictionary: \"We construe the regulation ... to include ... those [signs] relating to noncommercial as well as commercial activities located on the premises, such as those of a hospital, church, club, political organization or other noncommercial institution. For example, if some organization of veterans were located on the premises where the defendant has placed his sign concerning Vietnam veterans, the requisite relationship between the sign and activities conducted on the premises would exist. Such a noncommercial message could ... be sponsored by a business conducted on the site of the sign for the purpose of advertising the business, since many advertisements contain statements of public interest not directly related to the wares sold by the sponsor but intended to attract attention or create good will for its benefit.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20558\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, we are mindful that, at the time the legislature added authority to regulate advertising signs and billboards and to this day, the zoning scheme sets forth broad purposes for zoning regulations. It provides in relevant part that such regulations \"shall be designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic, flood and other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population and to facilitate the adequate provision for transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   General Statutes \u00a7 8-2 (a) ; accord General Statutes (1930 Rev.) \u00a7 424. These purposes reflect safety and aesthetic concerns. The aforementioned\n   interpretation of advertising undoubtedly advances these purposes. The mere fact that a broader interpretation of advertising might more fully accomplish these purposes does not permit us to ignore the meaning of the term compelled under the applicable rules of construction. We are obliged to construe the grant of authority narrowly, as it is in derogation of common-law property rights.

However, the plaintiff's construction would allow for the regulation of signs that plainly were not of the sort envisioned when the legislature added this grant of authority in 1931.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Undoubtedly, since the 1930s, signs reflecting purely personal expressions have gained popularity. It is not uncommon to pass a residence bearing a sign announcing a celebratory event (e.g., the birth of a child-\"It's a Boy,\" the return of a loved one-\"Welcome Home, Soldier\"), a warning (\"Drive Slowly-Children at Play\"), or an expression of personal opinion. Although such signs may make a public announcement, we are hard pressed to characterize such expressions as advertising. To the extent that such signs may give rise to similar aesthetic and safety concerns as advertising signs, it is not up to this court to give the statute a broader meaning than the contemporaneous, common meaning intended by the enacting legislature. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254843\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/545/#p556\">\n    536 U.S. 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 556,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254843\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/545/#p556\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254843\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/545/#p556\">\n    153 L.Ed. 2d 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) (recognizing that court examines legislative intent in view of contemporaneous law, not subsequent developments in law that legislature could not have contemplated), overruled on other grounds by\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/#p103\">\n    570 U.S. 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 103,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/#p103\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/#p103\">\n    186 L.Ed. 2d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). Subsequent legislatures could have adopted a definition to expand the scope of the statute to address modern developments and practices. They failed to do so, leaving us to apply settled rules of construction. Under those rules of construction, we are bound to apply the narrower definition, consistent with the contemporaneous definition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The plaintiff nonetheless asserts that the principle of legislative acquiescence supports the broad definition of public pronouncement. The plaintiff contends that the legislature should be presumed to know that many municipalities have promulgated zoning regulations that are broader than the narrow definition of \"advertising signs\" adopted by the trial court, and thus its failure to amend the statute evidences legislative support for these broader interpretations. The plaintiff cites no authority, however, and we are aware of none, that extends the principle of legislative acquiescence to presume the legislature's awareness of municipal legislation that has not been subjected to judicial scrutiny and that may vary in form among municipalities. Moreover, in light of our prior construction of \u00a7 8-2 in\n   <em>\n    Schwartz\n   </em>\n   , there would be no reason for the legislature to presume that any contrary municipal\n   construction would withstand such scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As a fallback position, the plaintiff asserts that we should adopt the broader public announcement definition because limiting \"advertising signs\" to those that promote goods, services, or activities might constitute improper content based speech discrimination in violation of the first amendment to the United States constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gilbert\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2231\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2231,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2231\">\n    192 L.Ed. 2d 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (restrictions on temporary signs on basis of classification of content are violation of first amendment).

The defendant's message is not aimed at the sale of goods, the promulgation of a doctrine or idea, securing attendance, or the like. Nor is any activity or enterprise of the defendant benefited by any action of the recipient of the message. Rather, the defendant is expressing her personal, derogatory opinion of her home improvement contractor and citing prior lawsuits allegedly brought against the contractor to show that her unfavorable opinion is shared by others. Although\n   she might obtain personal satisfaction if her sign deters other homeowners from hiring the named contractor, it is not the sort of benefit fostered by advertising as we have interpreted the term.

The plaintiff sent a letter to the defendant notifying her that she had not \"turn[ed] in as-builts for the two permits that have not been inspected\n   and ha[d] not yet received [c]ertificates of [z]oning [c]ompliance or [c]ertificates of [o]ccupancy,\" and ordering her to do so. Several months later, the plaintiff sent a second letter to the defendant, ordering her to \"obtain [c]ertificates of [z]oning [c]ompliance and [c]ertificates of [o]ccupancy within ten ... days of the date of this order or vacate the premises.\" When the defendant still did not comply with the orders, the plaintiff brought the present action, seeking an injunction precluding the defendant from occupying the premises and ordering her to immediately obtain a certificate of zoning compliance and a certificate of occupancy. The plaintiff also sought civil penalties under General Statutes \u00a7 8-12 for the defendant's failure to comply with the order to remedy the stated violations. The complaint simply alleged that the defendant was occupying the premises without a certificate of zoning compliance or certificate of occupancy and had failed to comply with orders to comply with city regulations, and the two orders were attached as exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Trial on the action did not take place until almost four years after the complaint was filed. The following events ensued during the intervening period. Three years after the plaintiff commenced the present action, the defendant provided an as built plot plan to the plaintiff. Both the initial plot plan and a subsequent one submitted by the defendant contained substantive\n   errors. Nearly four years after the commencement of the action, the defendant submitted an adequate plot plan. The plaintiff reviewed the plot plan and determined that the renovations, as completed, violated city zoning regulations for maximum lot coverage. As a consequence, the plaintiff declined to issue a certificate of zoning compliance, and, in turn, the building inspector refused to issue a certificate of occupancy. The plaintiff did not amend the complaint to include an allegation regarding the zoning violation for lot coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The trial court found that the defendant had violated the zoning regulations because she did not have the requisite certificate of occupancy, but it nonetheless declined to grant the plaintiff's request for injunctive relief. The court found that the defendant could do nothing more to secure the certificate. The trial court credited the defendant's testimony that she had relied on her contractor to submit the necessary paperwork. Although extremely tardy, the defendant had submitted the required as built plot plan. The court further noted that, because the plaintiff had not followed the normal procedure for a zoning violation, the defendant had been deprived of administrative remedies related to the ground on which the plaintiff had refused to issue the certificate, namely, noncompliance with maximum lot coverage. Had the proper procedure been followed, the plaintiff would have provided notice to the defendant of that violation as well as a cease and desist order, which in turn would have entitled the defendant to review by the zoning board of appeals. Although the trial court concluded that injunctive relief should not issue, it ordered the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $1000 due to the fact that it had taken her more than four years to submit a proper as built plot plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It is well settled that we review a decision of the trial court to deny injunctive relief for an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Waterford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grabner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1576220\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/155/431/#p434\">\n    155 Conn. 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434-35,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=232%20A.2d%20481\">\n    232 A.2d 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967). \"A decision to grant or deny an injunction must be compatible with the equities in the case, which should take into account the gravity and willfulness of the violation, as well as the potential harm to the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Bauer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Waste Management of Connecticut, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"300295\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/239/515/#p527\">\n    239 Conn. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=686%20A.2d%20481\">\n    686 A.2d 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \"In seeking an injunction pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 8-12, the town is relieved of the normal burden of proving irreparable harm and the lack of an adequate remedy at law because \u00a7 8-12 by implication assumes that no adequate alternative remedy exists and that the injury was irreparable....
