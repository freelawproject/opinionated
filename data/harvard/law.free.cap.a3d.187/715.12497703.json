In 2015, the Maryland Department of the Environment (\"MDE\") issued a permit (\"the Permit\") to Prettyman Manor, LLC (\"Prettyman\"), appellee, to discharge treated wastewater into Little Creek, a tributary of the Choptank River. Arlene Q. Stevens and Mildred Quidas (collectively, \"Stevens and Quidas\"), appellants, filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Caroline County. The circuit court affirmed MDE's decision to issue the discharge permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal, Stevens and Quidas present two questions for our review, which we have rephrased as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1. Whether MDE failed to publish proper notice of Prettyman's application before issuing the Permit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2.

Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Stevens and Quidas own two parcels in Preston, Maryland. One of the parcels is located at 3740 Frazier Neck Road, while the other is located at 21355 Marsh Creek Road. For more than fifty years, Stevens and Quidas have grown vegetables on\n   their property (hereinafter \"Quidas Farm\") as their primary source of income. To irrigate their crops, Stevens and Quidas draw water from a retaining pond that they constructed by diverting water from Little Creek, a tidal tributary of the Choptank River. Maryland has identified this segment of the Choptank River as impaired due to excess nitrogen, phosphorus, TSS, and other pollutants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Directly across from Quidas Farm on Little Creek is a mobile home park (\"Prettyman Manor\") owned and operated by Prettyman. Located at 21269 Dover Bridge Road, Prettyman Manor has been home to dozens of families for decades. Over time, the sewage generated by the residents of Prettyman Manor has overwhelmed the park's aging septic tanks and drainfields. Eventually, MDE initiated an enforcement action, forcing Prettyman to pump and haul the sewage from the failing on-site disposal systems to a treatment facility in Dorchester County. Thereafter, Prettyman decided to build an on-site WWTP to service Prettyman Manor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    A. Prettyman's 2012 Application for a Discharge Permit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In April of 2012, Prettyman submitted an application for a discharge permit to discharge treated wastewater from the proposed WWTP into Little Creek (\"the 2012 Application\"). According to the 2012 Application, the proposed facility would treat up to 40,000 gallons per day using extended aeration technology. MDE published notice of the 2012 Application in\n   <em>\n    The Times Record\n   </em>\n   on August 8, 2012 and August 15, 2012 (\"the 2012 Notice\"). MDE did not receive any requests for an informational meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   MDE quickly determined that the 2012 Application was not consistent with the Caroline County Water and Sewer Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On August 24, 2012, MDE gave Prettyman an update on the status of the 2012 Application:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   In reviewing your discharge permit application for the proposed Prettyman Manor WWTP, we have found that your proposal is not consistent with the Caroline County Water and Sewer Plan. We cannot issue a wastewater\n   surface water discharge permit until the proposed facility is consistent with the county Plan and have suspended further processing of your application. However, to assist you in making a determination whether to proceed with the project, we will develop planning effluent limitations which are needed to estimate potential costs for the project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In October of 2012, MDE helped Prettyman determine the best point of discharge for the proposed WWTP. In December of 2013, MDE met with Prettyman to discuss, among other things, the possibility of amending the Caroline County Water and Sewer Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    B. Prettyman's 2014 Revised Application for a Discharge Permit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On July 21, 2014, Prettyman submitted a revised permit application (\"the 2014 Revision\"). In the 2014 Revision, Prettyman proposed using a membrane bioreactor rather than extended aeration technology in order to meet MDE's enhanced nutrient removal standards. The new design also lowered the treatment capacity from 40,000 gallons per day to 20,000 gallons per day. Additionally, Prettyman changed the outfall location from the southwest corner of Prettyman Manor to the southeast portion of the property. MDE processed the 2012 Revision under the same NPDES number as the 2014 Application and did not publish a new notice of application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Because Little Creek was impaired by excess amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen, MDE required Prettyman to secure offsets in the form of total nitrogen (\"TN\") credits and total phosphorus (\"TP\") credits. To obtain the necessary TN credits, Prettyman had to eliminate eighty on-site disposal systems. To obtain the necessary TP credits, Prettyman entered into a nutrient credit transfer agreement with the Town of Denton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On February 5, 2015, MDE provided Prettyman with effluent limits for the purpose of planning the wastewater treatment system. That same month, the Caroline County Commissioners amended the Caroline County Water and Sewer Plan to authorize the treatment technology and discharge\n   volume proposed in the 2014 Revision. On July 28, 2015, MDE notified Prettyman and other interested parties of its tentative determination to issue the Permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    C. Tentative Determination, Comment Period, and Final Determination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   MDE published a notice of tentative determination in\n   <em>\n    The Times Record\n   </em>\n   on August 5, 2015 and August 12, 2015. The notice included the following information: (1) the location of the WWTP; (2) the water that would receive the discharge; (3) the effluent limits; (4) details of the nutrient credit agreement with the Town of Denton; (5) the deadline for requesting a public hearing; and (6) the deadline for submitting comments, which was September 4, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   There was no request for a public hearing. On September 2, 2015, Stevens and Quidas sent a letter to MDE expressing their concern about the potential environmental impact of the project and requesting a meeting. MDE met with Stevens and Quidas on September 15, 2015. According to a letter from MDE to Prettyman's contractor, \"[t]he neighboring farmers had concerns about potential bacterial contamination\n   of their produce and they requested a few more days to take our proposed effluent bacterial limit and run it by their inspector before sending something in writing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On September 27, 2015, Stevens and Quidas sent a letter to MDE with additional questions and comments. MDE responded on October 21, 2015 with a detailed letter addressing each issue raised by Stevens and Quidas. Regarding the effect of the proposed WWTP on the Quidas Farm irrigation pond, MDE wrote the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   In addition, information of stage of the stream and wet trace observed during our site visit, and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) (USGS, 2009) of Little Creek were analyzed to determine the tidal boundary of the Creek, and the runoff drainage pattern for the landscape above the proposed outfall location. The DEM indicates the tidal boundary is 670 ft upstream of the point of discharge. Given your\n   property is 850 ft upstream from the proposed outfall location and the stream bed elevation beside your property is 3 ft above the stream bed elevation adjacent to the proposed outfall location, there is no reasonable potential the irrigation pond will be affected by the proposed discharge under normal circumstances (water profile modeled by HEC-RAS using DEM data, attachment pages 5-6).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   MDE provided Prettyman with the final discharge permit on October 27, 2015 and published notice of its final determination in\n   <em>\n    The Times Record\n   </em>\n   on November 11, 2015 and November 18, 2015. On December 11, 2015, Stevens and Quidas filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Caroline County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    D. Judicial Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The circuit court held a hearing on December 12, 2016. At the hearing, Stevens and Quidas argued that the Permit was invalid because MDE failed to publish notice of the 2014 Revision. Stevens and Quidas further argued that the Permit unlawfully allowed Prettyman to discharge TSS into a body of water already impaired by excess TSS levels without requiring any offsets. MDE argued that the 2012 Notice was sufficient and that Stevens and Quidas had waived any objection to the TSS limit specified in the Permit. In a memorandum opinion and order issued on March 22, 2017, the circuit court found that MDE had \"acted properly within its authority and did not err by granting the discharge permit in this matter[.]\" Stevens and Quidas timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Notably, the General Assembly left the word undefined. In general usage, an application is a \"request or petition\" or \"a form used in making a request.\" Application, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014); Application, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/application. According to this definition, an \"application\" could plausibly encompass both an initial request and subsequent revisions to that request; just as plausibly,\n   each subsequent revision could be considered an entirely new \"application.\" We conclude, therefore, that the notice requirement as applied to revised applications is \"susceptible to two or more equally plausible interpretations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Inasmuch as the notice requirement is ambiguous, we give considerable weight to MDE's reasonable construction of that requirement. The General Assembly has explicitly tasked MDE with administering the NPDES permit process in Maryland,\n   including the notice-and-comment requirements. Env't \u00a7 9-324 ; Env't 1-601\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Indeed, MDE is uniquely situated to determine whether a particular interpretation of the notice-and-comment requirements would be practically feasible and consistent with the agency's overall mission. MDE may be wary of delays that would arise if every minor revision of an application were to reset the process to the very beginning. Each revised application, in turn, could lead to more revisions, and so on\n   <em>\n    ad absurdum\n   </em>\n   . Additionally, MDE can reasonably expect a certain amount of flexibility in processing permits that implicate competing interests among local communities. In the case at hand, for example, MDE had determined that the replacement of the failing septic system was an urgent matter \"for the health and well being of the residents\" of Prettyman Manor. We will defer, therefore, to MDE's expertise in the NPDES permit process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In light of MDE's expertise, we hold that MDE's construction of the notice requirement is reasonable. Indeed, the parties appear to be roughly in agreement as to the appropriate standard for determining when a new notice of application is needed. According to MDE, a new notice of application is unnecessary if the revisions \"do not substantially change the permitted activity\"; Stevens and Quidas, on the other hand, assert that a new notice is required if the revised plan is \"materially different.\" MDE's \"substantial change\" standard is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Proffitt v. Rohm &amp; Haas\n   </em>\n   , in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that an amendment to an existing NPDES permit requires public notice if the amendment \"effects a substantial change in the terms of the permit.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792652\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/850/1007/#p1012\">\n    850 F.2d 1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1012-13 (3d Cir. 1988).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We hold,\n   therefore, that MDE reasonably interpreted the term \"application\" in Env't \u00a7 1-603, Env't \u00a7 9-324, and the related regulations as encompassing an initial application and subsequent revisions \"which do not substantially change the permitted activity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    B.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Although the volume and location of the discharge changed somewhat between 2012 and 2014, these changes fell within the scope of the 2012 Notice. The effluent discharge in the 2014 Revision was actually\n   <em>\n    decreased\n   </em>\n   from 40,000 gallons per day to 20,000 gallons per day. Given that nearby residents were already on notice of a proposed discharge of up to 40,000 gallons per day, they could not have been surprised that the Permit allowed a discharge within that range. More broadly, the change in the discharge volume did not result in an increased environmental impact that would warrant additional notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Stevens and Quidas argue that the \"location of the outfall structure as proposed in 2012 was materially different than the location selected, and ultimately permitted, in the 2014 application.\" Notably, the 2012 Notice stated only that the proposed facility would discharge effluents \"to Little Creek.\" Although the precise point of discharge was moved to a\n   different part of Prettyman's property, the body of water receiving the discharge-Little Creek-remained the same.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, there is nothing\n   in the record to suggest that the new point of discharge would significantly change the environmental impact of the permitted activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We, therefore, conclude that the change in discharge location did not deprive the public of a fair opportunity to participate in the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Stevens and Quidas claim that the 2012 Application was \"wholly abandoned.\" The record shows, however, that MDE did not reject the 2012 Application. Instead, MDE informed Prettyman that it would not issue a permit \"until the proposed facility is consistent with the county Plan[.]\" Although MDE \"suspended further processing\" of the 2012 Application, MDE continued to work with Prettyman in 2012 and 2013 to bring the plan into compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Stevens and Quidas stress that \"three (3) full years\" passed between 2012 Notice and the notice of tentative determination in 2015. While this is true, the 2012 Notice made it clear that members of the public could ask \"to be notified of further action\" concerning the application. Critically, Stevens and Quidas did not sign up for these notifications. Had they done so, MDE would likely have alerted them to the 2014 Revision. Further, MDE did not receive any request for an informational meeting after it published the 2012 Notice. If residents\n   were not alarmed by the 2012 Application, it is unclear why they would suddenly be spurred into action by the 2014 Revision, which drastically cut the effluent discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Although MDE did not publish notice of the 2014 Revision, the 2012 Notice and the notice of tentative determination published in 2014 were sufficient to place Stevens and Quidas on notice of the proposed discharge. Indeed, MDE went beyond the statutory requirements in ensuring that Stevens and Quidas had an opportunity to participate. MDE held an informational meeting with Stevens and Quidas even though their request was untimely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   MDE further accommodated Stevens and Quidas by responding to their September 27, 2015 letter, even though, as we explain\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the comment period closed on September 4, 2015. More broadly, the outcome of this particular proceeding-a permit with more stringent standards than those proposed in the initial application-is the expected and desired outcome of the public comment process. Accordingly, we reject Stevens's and Quidas's contention that such an outcome is proof that the process was flawed. We hold, therefore, that MDE \"provided for, encouraged, and assisted\" public participation as Congress envisioned.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The comment period ended, consequently, on September 4, 2015. The only comment made by Stevens and Quidas during this period was a letter, dated September 2, 2015, in which Stevens and Quidas expressed some general concerns and requested a meeting with MDE:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   My family and I are property owners on Little Creek in Caroline County and use it as a water source for irrigation of vegetables and other agricultural products. We have concerns with effects the proposed influx of treated wastewater and nutrients may have in the future. We believe the potential exists for detrimental environmental impact. As farmers and family members who are income dependent on growing crops, including some for human consumption, a major concern is possible economic consequences this proposal may have on our business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   [...]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   I would appreciate meeting with you regarding this matter. Please contact me at the above cell phone number at your earlier convenience.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Although Stevens and Quidas followed up with specific objections in a letter dated September 27, 2015, these objections were not made within the comment period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The September 2, 2015 letter was not sufficient to put MDE on notice that Stevens and Quidas would object to the TSS limit specified in the Permit. Critically, the September 2, 2015 letter does not raise any concrete objections to the proposed WWTP. Although Stevens and Quidas referred generally to \"the proposed influx of treated wastewater and nutrients,\" their concerns were couched in broad and indefinite language. Stevens and Quidas were worried about \"effects the proposed influx ...\n   <em>\n    may have in the future\n   </em>\n   ,\" the \"\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   ... for detrimental impact,\" and \"\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   economic consequences\" (emphasis added). The September 2, 2015 letter evinced no particular knowledge of the details of either the 2012 Application or the 2014 Revision. The lack of detail and concluding request for a meeting indicate that, as of September 2, 2015, Stevens and Quidas were primarily seeking to learn more about the project, rather than to lodge a substantive objection grounded in the specifics of the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Because the TSS issue was not properly raised in the comment period, we do not have a complete administrative record that would support a review on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   MDE claims that offsets for TSS levels were unnecessary in light of the expected overall reduction of TSS levels under Maryland's Phase II Watershed Implementation Plan for the Chesapeake Bay TMDL (\"WIP II\"). Stevens and Quidas correctly point out that WIP II is not part of the record. The dispute over WIP II only underscores our conclusion that the record concerning the TSS levels was not properly developed prior to judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The record clearly demonstrates that MDE did not merely \"rubber stamp\" Prettyman's application; instead, MDE worked with Prettyman for three years to bring its application\n   into compliance. Among other things, MDE required Prettyman to offset the expected levels of phosphorus and nitrogen in the WWTP discharge by eliminating eighty on-site disposal systems and entering into a \"nutrient transfer agreement\" with the Town of Denton. MDE held an informational meeting with Stevens and Quidas and provided a detailed response to their untimely comment letter. Had Stevens and Quidas properly raised the TSS issue, MDE would have had an opportunity to revise the Permit or, at the very least, to explain its decision, as it did for every other objection raised by Stevens and Quidas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Stevens and Quidas argue that a neighboring farm family will not necessarily \"command the same grasp of the technical jargon employed in the Clean Water Act, State statutes[,] and implementing regulations as only private experts, environmental attorneys, and the agency itself would have [done].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, we cannot review an administrative decision without a fully-developed record. The general concerns voiced by Stevens and Quidas during the comment period were insufficient to generate such a record. We do not fault Stevens and Quidas for failing to use \"technical jargon.\" Stevens and Quidas may not, however, recast a request for an informational meeting as an all-purpose objection preserving every issue they wish to raise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Stevens and Quidas argue that the procedural bar of Env't \u00a7 1-601 does not apply here because the TSS issue \"[was] not reasonably ascertainable during the comment period.\" We disagree. As we explain\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the 2012 Notice was sufficient to apprise concerned residents of the discharge permit that was ultimately issued in 2014. Furthermore, the 2014 Revision imposed the same TSS limit as the 2012 Application. Stevens and Quidas had nearly three years to review the TSS limit, study the relevant statutes and regulations governing TSS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   levels, and formulate a specific objection to the Permit on that basis. If Stevens and Quidas had questions about the TSS limit, they could have requested an informational meeting in 2012. If the 2014 Revision gave rise to additional questions, Stevens and Quidas could have requested a public hearing. In short, Stevens and Quidas had ample opportunity to ascertain potential issues related to the TSS limit, but they failed to do so. We hold, therefore, that the TSS issue has been waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The only question preserved for our review is whether MDE was required to publish a second notice of application for the 2014 Revision. For the foregoing reasons, we hold that MDE reasonably dispensed with the second notice of application, and that MDE's actions were consistent with the need to ensure public participation in the NPDES permit process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CAROLINE COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Assuming\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    that the actual outfall location differs from the location specified in the Permit, such a discrepancy would be an issue of compliance rather than grounds for challenging the Permit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Because\n    <em>\n     Proffitt\n    </em>\n    involved an amendment to an existing permit, rather than a revision to a pending application, it is not directly on point.

Significantly, COMAR 26.08.04.01-1(D) refers to \"the location of the discharge\" rather than \"point of discharge.\" This distinction is reflected in the format of the 2012 Notice, which listed the general body of water that would receive the discharge, rather than the exact coordinates.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Stevens and Quidas assert that the new point of discharge is \"far worse\" than the old one.
