The plaintiff represents Julie M. Sowell, the plaintiff in a wrongful discharge action pending in the Superior Court against her former employer, Southbury-Middlebury Youth and Family Services, Inc. (Youth Services), a Connecticut nonstock, nonprofit corporation that had been dissolved, Deirdre H. DiCara, its executive director, and Mary Jane McClay, the chairperson of its board of directors. See\n   <em>\n    Sowell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DiCara\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Docket No. CV-12-6016087-S (Sowell action). On September 6, 2012, the law firm filed an appearance in\n   the Sowell action on behalf of Youth Services, McClay, and DiCara. At a hearing held on December 12, 2013, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Barbara J. Sheedy\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, granted Youth Services' motion for an emergency protective order (protective order) on the basis of the court's finding that the plaintiff had violated rule 4.2 of the Rules of Professional Conduct by communicating directly with certain \"putative\" members of Youth Services' board of directors regarding the merits of a counterclaim that counsel for Youth Services had filed against Sowell at McClay's direction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Judge Sheedy did not order any sanctions against the plaintiff, the protective order enjoined him from further contact of any kind with members of Youth Services' board of directors without prior permission from the law firm.

In the first writ, the plaintiff claimed that Judge Sheedy had (1) improperly found clear and convincing evidence that he had violated rule 4.2 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, and (2) violated his state and federal constitutional rights to due process and abused its discretion by refusing to permit him to present evidence at the hearing on the motion for a protective order.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20A.3d%20356\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The Appellate Court issued a comprehensive opinion rejecting the plaintiff's challenges to the basis for the protective order, namely, the finding that he had violated rule 4.2, and rendered judgment dismissing the first writ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Id., at 133,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20A.3d%20356\">\n    127 A.3d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This court dismissed the second writ on May 25, 2016, and denied\n   the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration en banc of that dismissal on June 27, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 3, 2016, the plaintiff filed the present action in the Superior Court seeking a declaratory judgment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-29 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). In the first count of the declaratory judgment complaint, the plaintiff claimed that there is substantial uncertainty with respect to the scope, meaning, and applicability of rule 4.2 of the Rules of Professional Conduct affecting his legal rights and relations with other parties. In the second count, the plaintiff claimed that the Appellate Court exceeded its constitutional authority and violated his constitutional rights by finding facts from evidence beyond the trial court record, namely, the existence of an attorney-client relationship between the law firm and Youth Services, which he was not given the opportunity to rebut or explain. In the third count, the plaintiff sought a declaration pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   that rule 4.2 is unconstitutional under the due process and equal protection clauses as applied to the facts of this case. In the fourth count, the plaintiff claimed that the Appellate Court had violated his free speech rights under the state and federal constitutions because his speech was a reasonable remedial measure under rule 3.3 (b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct to address fraud and a matter of public importance. In the fifth count, the plaintiff claimed that the Appellate Court's construction of rule 4.2 was a due process violation because it amounted to an ex post facto law. In the sixth count, the plaintiff claimed a violation of his right to equal protection of the laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendants moved to dismiss the declaratory judgment complaint, claiming that the plaintiff's claims are nonjusticiable and barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The trial court,\n   <em>\n    Schuman, J.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   granted the motion to dismiss, concluding that General Statutes \u00a7 51-197f\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   precluded further review of the Appellate Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Sowell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DiCara\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=161%20Conn.%20App.%20102\">\n    161 Conn.

The trial court further concluded that the claims against the Appellate Court were barred by sovereign immunity. Concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, the trial court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss and rendered judgment accordingly. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the existence of binding precedent, namely, the decision of the Appellate Court in\n   <em>\n    Sowell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DiCara\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=161%20Conn.%20App.%20102\">\n    161 Conn.

The plaintiff also argues that he has standing to seek a declaratory judgment under \u00a7 52-29 because the Appellate Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Sowell\n   </em>\n   \"has caused a continuing injury to his reputation and professional standing and the unconstitutional application of rule 4.2 [of the Rules of Professional Conduct] by the Appellate Court poses an immediate threat of further injury in the future.\" The plaintiff then contends in detail that the trial court improperly determined that sovereign immunity and\n   judicial immunity barred his\n   claim for declaratory relief under \u00a7 52-29 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response, the defendants contend, inter alia, that the trial court properly dismissed the plaintiff's claims because they are not justiciable, relying specifically on\n   <em>\n    Valvo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Freedom of Information Commission\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5769223\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/294/534/\">\n    294 Conn. at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=985%20A.2d%201052\">\n    985 A.2d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to argue that no practical relief is available because a trial court lacks the authority to reverse the rulings of another court in a separate case, and particularly those of the Appellate Court, which are binding precedent. The defendants contend that the sole avenue of relief available to the plaintiff was his petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court to this court pursuant to \u00a7 51-197f. The defendants emphasize that the plaintiff's complaint did not allege any facts to establish the existence of a \"dispute separate and distinct from his desire to overturn\n   <em>\n    Sowell\n   </em>\n   ,\" such as a new threat of discipline under rule 4.2 of the Rules of Professional Conduct or a new situation in which he might commit a similar violation of rule 4.2. We agree with the defendants and conclude that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this declaratory judgment action because the plaintiff's claims are not justiciable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"A motion to dismiss ... properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court....

App. 270\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 278 n.4,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492208\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/178/1103/\">\n     178 A.3d 1103\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , cert. denied,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494688\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/566/12494688/\">\n     328 Conn. 917\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12493563\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/180/963/\">\n     180 A.3d 963\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2018). Finally, although the parties to such a declaratory judgment action might use a reservation to advance the legal issue concerning the vitality of\n    <em>\n     Sowell\n    </em>\n    into the Appellate Court or this court more expeditiously; see Practice Book \u00a7 73-1 (a) ; the use of that reservation procedure would not relieve the Appellate Court of its obligation to ensure that jurisdiction lies over the underlying declaratory judgment action. See\n    <em>\n     ASL Associates\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Zoning Commission\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"742905\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/18/542/\">\n     18 Conn. App. at 546-49\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=559%20A.2d%20236\">\n     559 A.2d 236\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
