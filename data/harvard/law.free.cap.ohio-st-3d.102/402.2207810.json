Reid, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 402, 2004-Ohio-3121.]</p>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b558-8\">(No. 2004-0512</docketnumber>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AkG\">Submitted May 11, 2004</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A7S\">Decided July 7, 2004.)</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b558-10\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">{\u00b6 1} On July 12, 2000, a client retained the law firm of Harshman, Gervellis and Bernard, n.k.a. Harshman, Bernard and Ramage, to represent him for injuries he sustained when a car turned in front of him and another person while they were riding motorcycles. The firm assigned the case to respondent, Wayne P. Reid of Youngstown, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0066124.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">{\u00b6 2} On August 1, 2000, the other motorcyclist also retained the Harshman law firm for injuries sustained in the accident. The firm assigned the second client\u2019s case to respondent as a \u201ccompanion\u201d to the first client\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">{\u00b6 3} On August 16, 2000, the second client advised respondent that in addition to being struck by the car, he believed that the first client\u2019s motorcycle had also hit him during the accident. Respondent also determined that the driver of the car had a $100,000 single-limit automobile insurance policy, which could require an evaluation of the policy limit for both clients\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-14\">{\u00b6 4} In December 2000, respondent spoke to another attorney in the Harsh-man firm, who agreed that the representation of both clients created a conflict. Respondent did not discuss the conflict with either client, however, and continued to represent both.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">{\u00b6 5} On April 25, 2001, respondent obtained a settlement on behalf of the second client with the driver\u2019s insurance company. The settlement amount was $94,633, which constituted the $100,000 policy limit less the amount paid for damage to the second client\u2019s motorcycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-16\">{\u00b6 6} In July 2001, respondent left the Harshman law firm. In August 2001, the law firm referred the clients to attorneys outside the firm. The attorney to whom the second client was referred to did not accept his case concerning a possible claim against the first client. The first client, through his new attorney, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania, and he ultimately received an arbitration decision of over $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">{\u00b6 7} On February 10, 2003, relator, Mahoning County Bar Association, filed a complaint charging respondent with violating certain Disciplinary Rules. A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court heard the matter upon the stipulated facts, testimony, and exhibits offered by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">{\u00b6 8} The panel found the facts as previously set forth and concluded that, consistent with the parties\u2019 stipulations, respondent\u2019s conduct violated DR 5-105(B) (prohibiting continued employment by multiple clients where lawyer\u2019s independent professional judgment on a client\u2019s behalf is likely to be adversely affected by lawyer\u2019s representation of another client).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">{\u00b6 9} In mitigation, the panel found that respondent had no prior disciplinary record, lacked a dishonest motive, and fully cooperated in the disciplinary proceedings. In addition, relator\u2019s investigation revealed no monetary prejudice to the clients from respondent\u2019s misconduct. Several individuals, including judges and attorneys, submitted letters to the panel commending respondent\u2019s moral character and legal competence. Respondent testified that he was involved in a lengthy divorce and custody battle at the time the conflict arose and that his misconduct would not likely happen again.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">{\u00b6 10} The parties agreed that a public reprimand would be an appropriate sanction. The panel concurred and recommended that respondent be publicly reprimanded. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation, and further recommended that the costs of the proceedings be taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">{\u00b6 11} We agree with the board\u2019s recommended sanction. To determine the appropriate sanction, we analyze \u201cthe duties violated, the actual injury caused, the attorney\u2019s mental state, the existence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and sanctions imposed in similar cases.\u201d <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">{\u00b6 12} Respondent violated his duty to his clients, DR 5-105(B), but the record lacks clear and convincing evidence that his misconduct harmed them. And mitigating factors exist: lack of a prior disciplinary record, absence of a dishonest motive, full disclosure and cooperation in the disciplinary proceedings, and good character and reputation. See Sections 10(B)(2)(a), (b), (d), and (e) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">{\u00b6 13} In comparable cases, we have publicly reprimanded attorneys who violated DR 5-105(B) where there existed some of the same mitigating factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>present here. See, e.g., <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Tolliver </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 462, 463, 584 N.E.2d 670 (mitigating factors included no prior record of disciplinary action and no harm resulting from respondent\u2019s actions); <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Phillips </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 286, 287-288, 544 N.E.2d 237 (no prior disciplinary record and good reputation in legal community).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A9T\">David C. Comstock Jr. and Ronald E. Slipski, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A74\">Arnold &amp; Caruso, Ltd., and James D. Caruso, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">{\u00b6 14} Based on the foregoing, a public reprimand is the proper sanction. Accordingly, respondent is hereby publicly reprimanded for having violated DR 5-105(B). Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b560-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
