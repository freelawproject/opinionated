On December 17, 2002, members of the Akron Bar Association Admissions Committee interviewed applicant as part of the review process to determine whether he possessed the requisite character, fitness, and moral qualifications for admission to the Ohio bar. Gov.Bar R. I(11)(C) and (D). The interviewers recommended that applicant\u2019s candidacy be disapproved temporarily because he had not fully and truthfully answered questions about the circumstances surrounding his forced resignation from employment with a real estate company. In reporting to the Board of Commissioners on Character and Fitness, the admissions committee also recommended that respondent\u2019s candidacy be disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">{\u00b6 2} Respondent appealed from the committee\u2019s recommendation pursuant to Gov.Bar R. I(12)(B). A panel appointed by the board heard the appeal on May 6, 2003.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Evidence presented established, for the purpose of this proceeding, the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant graduated in the spring of 2003 from the University of Akron School of Law and applied to take the July 2003 bar examination. During law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>school, he worked full-time for a commercial real estate company that leased property to tenants in shopping centers and warehouse distribution districts. Applicant began working for his employer in 1994 as a property manager, advancing quickly over the years to eventually become the director of the company\u2019s retail properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">{\u00b6 4} As the director of retail properties, applicant showed space for lease to prospective tenants, managed building operations and construction projects, negotiated lease agreements, evaluated improvements, and developed rental space plans. He enjoyed considerable autonomy in his position but also reported almost daily to his supervisor, the president of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">{\u00b6 5} In the course of this employment, applicant leased contiguous space in a shopping center to two retail tenants: one an Arabica Coffeehouse franchisee, the other a Heavenly Ham franchisee. The owner of the Arabica Coffeehouse eventually decided to sell his business and thus wanted to get out of his lease. Because applicant\u2019s employer encouraged him to work with tenants in this situation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he contacted the owner of the Heavenly Ham store in or around June 2000 and inquired whether the owner would be interested in taking an assignment of the lease of the coffeehouse space. The two tenants consented to this arrangement and negotiated an assignment. Afterward, the Arabica Coffeehouse tenant paid respondent $5,000 for his assistance. Respondent kept this money and did not disclose the payment to his employer. He also did not report the $5,000 payment as income on his 2000 tax return in April 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">{\u00b6 6} Over the next year, the Heavenly Ham store tenant defaulted on his original lease and the assigned lease. In July 2001, the real estate company brought an eviction action and also sued both tenants for unpaid rent. With the lawsuit looming, the Arabica Coffeehouse tenant contacted applicant and, after they discussed the situation, applicant became concerned that the $5,000 payment would be exposed during the litigation. Applicant subsequently disclosed the $5,000 payment to his employer, and his employer, after discussions among the board of directors and officers, asked for his resignation. In November 2001, applicant tendered his resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">{\u00b6 7} In completing his bar application the next year, applicant was asked to provide the \u201cfull particulars as to the reasons\u201d for which he was asked to resign from his job. Applicant related that he had been asked to resign by the real estate company after he had \u201cearned a sum of money for finding a buyer\u201d for one of the company\u2019s tenants. He gave the impression that no company policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>prevented this, practice and that it was not \u201cuncustomary in the industry.\u201d He also described the reason for his resignation as the \u201cpolitical\u201d decision of a major shareholder and board member who, according to applicant, had forced him out while telling the remaining board members that he had quit to pursue his education full-time.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">{\u00b6 8} When applicant appeared for his character interview in December 2002, his interviewers confronted him about the resignation. Applicant revealed the additional facts that the tenant had paid him $5,000, that he had accepted this money without telling his employer, and that he had not reported the payment as taxable income. According to one interviewer, applicant\u2019s excuse for not reporting the income was that \u201cthe tenant hadn\u2019t given him a 1099 [reporting form], so the IRS would never know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">{\u00b6 9} During the panel hearing, applicant presented three character references and his own testimony. Judge Brenda Unruh of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, who had known applicant socially for approximately one and one-half years prior to the hearing, assured the panel of his integrity. She also described a telephone conversation they had had after he received notice of the committee\u2019s disapproval. Judge Unruh attested that while applicant had initially insisted that his forced resignation was political, or personal in nature, he began to realize the impropriety of his conduct after they discussed further the conflict of interest and deceit in which he had engaged. The judge added that in interactions after this discussion, applicant consistently acted in a manner demonstrating his contrition, his having accepted responsibility for his mistakes, and his commitment never to repeat those improprieties.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">{\u00b6 10} Applicant\u2019s other references were the real estate company\u2019s president and vice-president. The president, a mentor of applicant\u2019s who had opposed his forced resignation, also assured the panel of applicant\u2019s high moral and ethical character. The president testified that although applicant accepted the $5,000 payment, concealed it, and did not report it as income, the president was convinced that applicant had since appreciated the wrongfulness of his conduct and had learned a valuable lesson from these mistakes. The vice-president, it was agreed, would have testified that he, too, was aware of the events surrounding applicant\u2019s resignation, including his failure to report income. Notwithstanding this, the vice-president still recommended applicant\u2019s character and moral fiber, believing that the incident had been an \u201ceye-opening\u201d experience for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">{\u00b6 11} For his part, applicant testified on direct examination to the facts of the $5,000 secret side deal and his subsequent failure to report this income. He emotionally conceded his wrongdoing, apologized, and promised never to repeat his transgressions. Applicant also proved that after he had received notice of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>disapproval, he amended his tax returns to declare the $5,000 payment and paid the applicable taxes and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">{\u00b6 12} After the panel considered all of the foregoing evidence, it remained troubled, as had been the admissions committee, about applicant\u2019s ability to tell the truth. The panel concluded that applicant\u2019s bar application responses, interview answers, and testimony did not comport with other witnesses\u2019 testimony at the hearing, adding that he often contradicted himself. In describing its assessment of applicant\u2019s credibility, the panel observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cWhile stating that he did wrong, Applicant\u2019s words, manner and demeanor continue to indicate that he really doesn\u2019t accept responsibility [for his wrongdoing]; it is more a matter that, having been caught, he is now sorry that he did something that is standing in the way of his becoming a lawyer. He continues to try to explain away his actions which inevitably leads to inconsistencies in his testimony and in the appearance he makes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">{\u00b6 14} The panel recommended, in effect, that respondent\u2019s application to register as a candidate for admission to the Ohio bar be disapproved but that he be permitted to reapply in anticipation of taking the February 2004 bar examination. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings but modified its recommendation. The board recommended, in effect, that respondent\u2019s application be disapproved but that he be permitted to reapply for admission in anticipation of taking the February 2005 bar exam.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">(\u00b6 15} We concur in the panel\u2019s findings, as adopted by the board, that applicant has not established his character and fitness as required for admission to the Ohio bar. We do not, however, accept the premise that he may acquire these moral qualifications in the future and that his bar application should be merely postponed. Instead, because applicant has consistently exhibited duplicitous behavior, we are convinced that he must be permanently denied the privilege of applying for admission to the practice of law in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe paramount concern in proceedings before the Board of Commissioners on Character and Fitness is whether the applicant possesses those moral traits of honesty and integrity which will enable him to fully and faithfully discharge the duties of our demanding profession. We view such proceedings as being different from the adversary contest associated with, for example, disciplinary cases. A hearing to determine character and fitness should be more of a mutual inquiry for the purpose of acquainting this court with the applicant\u2019s innermost feelings and personal views on those aspects of morality, attention to duty, forthrightness and self-restraint which are usually associated with the accepted definition of \u2018good moral character.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Application of Davis </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 273, 274, 67 O.O.2d 344, 313 N.E.2d 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>{\u00b6 17} <em>In re Application of Davis </em>criticized an applicant\u2019s reliance on the attorney-client privilege to keep damaging yet salient character information concerning his prior felony conviction from the board. Because the board\u2019s sole function is to \u201cfully determine all the facts which can logically reflect upon the wisdom of admitting an applicant with a questionable background to the practice of law,\u201d we held that the board\u2019s review commanded \u201cthe utmost in cooperation between the applicant and the board, and [left] little room for the employment of doctrines which work to keep relevant information from the board.\u201d Id, 38 Ohio St.2d at 274-275, 67 O.O.2d 344, 313 N.E.2d 363. The same rule applies here. An applicant\u2019s complete and impeccably honest report is required for any information that possibly reflects on the applicant\u2019s moral fiber and fitness to fulfill the position of trust in which an attorney is placed by clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">{\u00b6 18} That applicant defied this duty throughout the admissions process was made abundantly clear by testimony before the panel. Applicant gave the impression on his bar application that side deals were customary in real estate; however, the real estate company president testified that taking money \u201cunder the table\u201d was not an accepted practice in his business. After persistent questioning, even applicant conceded that side deals were \u201cprobably more customary for a real estate agent\u201d than for someone in his position as an in-house leasing agent. Applicant testified inconsistently about precisely when he realized the impropriety of taking the $5,000 payment and his failure to report it as income. Initially, he presented Judge Unruh\u2019s testimony that he had fully realized the extent of his wrongdoing only after consulting her. On cross-examination, however, applicant conceded that he had earlier acknowledged his improprieties and expressed his remorse to his interviewers, an exchange that was also marked by his emotional promises to \u201cdo better.\u201d And when asked whether he realized that he had not reported the $5,000 as income after his November 2001 termination, applicant testified first that he \u201cinherently knew\u201d but later that this realization did not \u201cdawn\u201d on him until \u201ccloser\u201d to his December 2002 interview. Moreover, in response to intense inquiries from the panel, applicant revealed for the first time that the Arabica Coffeehouse tenant had originally offered him $10,000 for what he claimed to have been no more than his help in finding an assignee of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">{\u00b6 19} Equally disturbing is applicant\u2019s inability to settle on the reason that he had failed to report the $5,000 payment as income. Applicant testified that he had initially forgotten about the payment in filing his taxes. He also testified that he had not known whether he had had to report the payment, implying that he might have considered the money a gift rather than earned income. Either way, it is patently clear from applicant\u2019s testimony that he lied to his interviewers about why he had not reported the payment for tax purposes. In response to additional probing by the panel, respondent ultimately admitted that the explana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>tion he had provided during his interview \u2014 that he did not report the income because he had not received a 1099 form \u2014 \u201cdidn\u2019t have anything to do with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">{\u00b6 20} Hedging and inconsistencies were the standard as applicant attempted to establish his character and fitness. His testimony revealed a propensity to conceal actions \u2014 his acceptance of the $5,000 secret payment and failure to report it as income \u2014 which he knew to be wrong. He was also caught having told at least one unmitigated lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">{\u00b6 21} Applicant\u2019s false or incomplete answers on his application and in his interview and his continued attempts to avoid the truth in his testimony confirm for us what the panel and board surmised \u2014 that the applicant lacks integrity. As the panel and board found, applicant knew that his receipt of the $5,000 payment was wrong, he disclosed the payment only because he feared exposure, he compounded his deceit by deliberately failing to report the payment as income, and he then attempted to conceal the extent of his wrongdoing through evasive responses to legitimate questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">{\u00b6 22} Evidence of false statements, including material omissions, and lack of candor in the admissions process reflect poorly on an applicant\u2019s character, fitness, and moral qualifications. <em>In re Application of Panepinto </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 397, 704 N.E.2d 564. Where, as here, these ethical infractions so permeate the admissions process that the applicant\u2019s honesty and integrity are shown to be intrinsically suspect, our disposition must be to permanently deny his application to register as a candidate for admission to the Ohio bar. Accordingly, applicant is permanently denied admission to the practice of law in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b174-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

Had the respondent committed similar acts after becoming an attorney, we would have given him at most an indefinite suspension and permitted him later to demonstrate that he had rehabilitated himself before rejoining the bar. In this case, there was no theft involved and no clients harmed although the conduct involved dishonesty. While I do not condone his behavior, I believe it was such that respondent ought to be given a chance to rehabilitate himself and then be permitted to apply again for admission to the bar.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ah5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Robert C.
