On December 9, 2002, relator, Medina County Bar Association, charged respondent with having violated the Code ,of Professional Responsibility. A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the cause, and the board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">{\u00b6 2} Respondent, in his private law practice, shared office space in Medina and North Ridgeville, Ohio, with a credit-counseling company, Confidential Credit Counselors (\u201cCCC\u201d). Respondent, who continues to serve as CCC\u2019s vice-president of legal affairs, provided services to CCC at these locations, including accepting referrals of customers experiencing credit or other problems and answering CCC credit counselors\u2019 legal questions. In exchange, CCC paid respondent\u2019s rental, secretarial, and telephone expenses at both locations. CCC also paid for respondent\u2019s signage and telephone directory advertisements.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">{\u00b6 3} For a few years before relator\u2019s investigation, three separate signs publicized CCC\u2019s business and respondent\u2019s law practice at 775 West Smith Road in Medina. At the street in front of their offices, one sign displayed CCC\u2019s name and logo and immediately below identified \u201cBaker and Baker, Attorneys at Law.\u201d Another sign on the glass entryway to the offices displayed CCC\u2019s name and logo and immediately below identified \u201cMartin Baker, Attorney at Law.\u201d A third sign over the office entrance identified a single telephone number preceded by the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>CONFIDENTIAL CREDIT COUNSELORS</p>\n<p id=\"AhZ\">BAKER &amp; BAKER</p>\n<p id=\"Ayj\">ATTORNEYS AT LAW</p>\n<p id=\"Acfr\">A FULL SERVICE CREDIT CENTER</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">{\u00b6 4} Also during this period, CCC and respondent were listed at the same telephone number at the Medina and at the North Ridgeville office locations. Moreover, during 1997, this description of CCC\u2019s and respondent\u2019s services appeared in local directory advertisements:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">CONFIDENTIAL CREDIT COUNSELORS, INC.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">MARTIN BAKER, Attorney at Law</p>\n<p id=\"A94\">THE CENTER FOR DEBT RELIEF</p>\n<p id=\"AW_\">Stop Lawsuits and Creditor Phone Calls!</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Financial Counseling/Negotiated Settlements</p>\n<p id=\"AqJF\">Personalized Payment Plans</p>\n<p id=\"AnI\">Free Initial Consultation</p>\n<p id=\"Acnj\">Piece [sic] Of Mind With</p>\n<p id=\"AbI\">Experience You Can Depend On</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">{\u00b6 5} Upon review, we find that the preceding signage and advertisements failed to distinguish for the public between CCC\u2019s credit counseling company and respondent\u2019s law firm. Both forms of publicity misled clients as to whether respondent or his law firm was practicing law under the trade name \u201cConfidential Credit Counselors,\u201d whether his law practice was offering credit counseling, and the identity, responsibility, and status of those who might be associated with him. See EC 2-10. Because respondent tacitly approved of the signage and advertisements and should have realized their misleading effect, we find that respondent violated DR 2-102(B),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cA lawyer in private practice shall not practice under a trade name, a name that is misleading as to the identity of the lawyer or lawyers practicing under the name, or a firm name containing names other than those of one or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>more of the lawyers in the firm, except that the name of a professional corporation or association, legal clinic, limited liability company, or registered partnership shall contain symbols indicating the nature of the organization as required by Gov.Bar R. III.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AaK\">Oberholtzer, Filous &amp; Lesiak, John C. Oberholtzer and Kimberly J. Timer; and John C. Crilly, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A3JR\">Koblentz &amp; Koblentz, Richard S. Koblentz and Bryan L. Penvose, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">{\u00b6 7} In determining a sanction for this misconduct, we have considered the mitigating and aggravating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline. As mitigating features, we find that respondent, who has practiced law for 32 years, has no prior record of professional discipline. Respondent also has a reputation for honesty, integrity, and competence among members of his local bar and has a history of charitable and civic works for his community. In addition, respondent cooperated fully and truthfully in the disciplinary process and has taken steps to correct the advertising that led to relator\u2019s complaint. As an aggravating factor, we conclude that respondent, who denied having intentionally tried to take advantage of the public, profited to some degree from his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">{\u00b6 8} Relator proposed a public reprimand. The board, after finding a violation of DR 2-102(B), recommended a public reprimand. Although respondent initially urged the board to dismiss the complaint, he has not filed objections to the board\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 9} We agree that respondent committed the cited misconduct and that a public reprimand is appropriate. Respondent is hereby publicly reprimanded for having violated DR 2-102(B). Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b418-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-11\">. The board found a violation of DR 2~102(B), in part based on a later version of respondent\u2019s 1997 directory advertisement that changed \u201cAttorney at law\u201d to \u201cGeneral Counsel.\u201d We do not pass upon whether this advertisement also constitutes misconduct because relator did not charge this in its complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
