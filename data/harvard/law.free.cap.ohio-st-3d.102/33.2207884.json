Sweeney, Sr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">{\u00b6 1} General Motors Corporation (\u201cGM\u201d) appeals from a Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) decision affirming use-tax assessments against GM for amounts it paid for parts and services provided by GM\u2019s Ohio dealers to repair motor vehicles under GM\u2019s warranty and special-policy repair programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">{\u00b6 2} Agreements between GM and its dealers, entitled \u201cDealer Sales and Service Agreements,\u201d provided that the dealers would perform all repairs covered by warranty or a repair program on each qualified vehicle, using only GM-approved parts. The services and parts provided by the dealers in fulfilling the repairs covered by warranty and repair programs were then charged to GM based on prices set by GM in its Service Policies and Procedures Manual. The dealers were reimbursed by GM for the parts and labor by credits to their GM accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">{\u00b6 3} The Tax Commissioner levied two use-tax assessments against GM. One assessment was based on the amount that GM reported it had paid dealers for warranty and repair-program parts and services for the month of January 1993, the other was for the month of January 1994. GM filed petitions for reassessment with the Tax Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">{\u00b6 4} In its petitions for reassessment, GM contended that it did not acquire title or possession of or use any of the tangible personal property or services that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>were the subject of the use tax. The Tax Commissioner rejected that contention based on the definition of \u201cuse\u201d in R.C. 5741.01, which \u201cincludes the exercise of any right or power incidental to the ownership of the thing used.\u201d The Tax Commissioner found that \u201c[i]n directing the dealers to provide repair parts and services to vehicle owners, and agreeing to pay the dealers for the parts and services GM * * * exercised a right incidental to the ownership of the parts and services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">{\u00b6 5} GM next contended that if any sales of repair parts and services were made in fulfilling the warranty agreements, such sales were made directly to the owners of the vehicles and not to GM. The Tax Commissioner rejected that contention, stating that the warranty agreement was between GM and the vehicle owner, not between the dealer and the vehicle owner. The Tax Commissioner further found that GM purchased the repair parts and services from its dealers and consumed those parts and services in fulfilling its contractual obligations to the vehicle owners. GM alternatively contended that if it was the consumer of the parts and services, then such parts and services were purchased for resale to the vehicle owners. The Tax Commissioner rejected that contention, stating that R.C. 5739.01(D)(4) provides that the purchase by a warrantor of property and services to be used in fulfilling a warranty contract is not a purchase for resale and that although R.C. 5739.01(D)(4) was not effective until July 1, 1993, the enactment was a clarification rather than a change in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">{\u00b6 6} GM also contended that since the motor vehicles being repaired were registered by their owners, they were excluded from the definition of personal property in R.C. 5701.03(A). The Tax Commissioner found that the exclusion in R.C. 5701.03(A) for motor vehicles registered by their owners was applicable only to ad valorem taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">{\u00b6 7} Finally, GM contended that the imposition of the use tax on parts and services made under warranty agreements effective before January 1, 1993, violated Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, which prohibits retroactive laws or laws that impair the obligation of contract. The Tax Commissioner rejected that contention, finding that no repair transactions prior to January 1, 1993, were assessed and, therefore, there was no retroactive application of the tax. The Tax Commissioner further found that the imposition of the tax on the repairs did not alter GM\u2019s obligations under the warranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">{\u00b6 8} On appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals, the final determinations of the Tax Commissioner were affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">{\u00b6 9} This cause is before the court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">{\u00b6 10} GM initially contends that the motor vehicles that were repaired by its dealers were not personal property as defined in R.C. 5701.03(A), and, thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>repair of those vehicles was not subject to use tax. GM raises this issue because R.C. 5739.01(B)(3)(a) provides for a sales tax on repairs to personal property:</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(B) \u2018Sale\u2019 and \u2018selling\u2019 include all of the following transactions for a consideration * * *;</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(3) All transactions by which:</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(a) An item of tangible personal property is or is to be repaired * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">{\u00b6 15} Although R.C. 5739.01(B)(3)(a) is a sales-tax provision and GM was assessed a use tax, we will refer to sales-tax provisions in this opinion, unless otherwise noted, because R.C. 5741.02(C)(2), a use-tax provision, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(C) The [use] tax does not apply to the storage, use, or consumption in this state of the following described tangible personal property or services, nor to the storage, use, or consumption or benefit in this state of tangible personal property or services purchased under the following described circumstances:</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(2) * * * tangible personal property or services, the acquisition of which, if made in Ohio, would be a sale not subject to the tax imposed by sections 5739.01 to 5739.31 of the Revised Code [i.e., sales-tax provisions].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">{\u00b6 19} Thus, if the item being repaired is not personal property, its repair would not be subject to the sales tax imposed by R.C. 5739.01(B)(3)(a) and, likewise, would not be subject to the use tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">{\u00b6 20} GM\u2019s contention that the motor vehicles repaired by its dealers were not personal property is based on its interpretation of R.C. 5701.03(A), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b191-14\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cAs used in Title LVII of the Revised Code:</p>\n<p id=\"b191-15\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(A) \u2018Personal property\u2019 includes every tangible thing that is the subject of ownership, whether animate or inanimate * * *. * * * \u2018Personal property\u2019 does not include * * * motor vehicles registered by the owner thereof * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-16\">{\u00b6 23} GM contends that since the motor vehicles being repaired are registered by the owners, they are not personal property and, therefore, repair of those vehicles is not the repair of tangible personal property and not subject to the sales or use tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-17\">{\u00b6 24} Contrary to GM\u2019s position, the Tax Commissioner contends that the exclusion for motor vehicles registered to their owners is applicable only to ad valorem taxes and is not applicable to sales and use taxes. As authority for his contention that R.C. 5701.03 is applicable only to ad valorem taxes, the Tax Commissioner cites <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Lindley </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 331, 21 O.O.3d 208, 423 N.E.2d 479, wherein GM had applied for a refund of use taxes it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>had paid on patterns purchased from out-of-state suppliers. The opinion states, \u201cThe sole issue presented in this cause is whether the patterns in question are exempt from taxation by virtue of the provisions of R.C. 5701.03.\u201d Id. at 332, 21 O.O.3d 208, 423 N.E.2d 479. GM argued that the patterns were exempt from use tax because they were not personal property. The basis for GM\u2019s argument was that R.C. 5701.03 excluded from the definition of personal property, patterns that \u201care held for use and not for sale in the ordinary course of business.\u201d However, the Tax Commissioner contended that the exclusion of patterns from the definition in R.C. 5701.03 pertained only to ad valorem taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">{\u00b6 25} We determined that GM\u2019s use of the patterns was subject to use tax because it is a tax on transactions involving the patterns, not on the patterns themselves, and if the patterns had been purchased from Ohio venders, GM would have had to pay sales tax. Id. at 333-334, 21 O.O.3d 208, 423 N.E.2d 479. While R.C. 5701.03 was raised as an issue in that case, the decision did not reach the issue of whether R.C. 5701.03 should be applied to exclude property from sales and use taxes. Thus, contrary to the Tax Commissioner\u2019s assertion, our decision in <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Lindley </em>did not resolve the issue raised by GM in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">{\u00b6 26} Although at first blush R.C. 5701.03 gives credence to GM\u2019s position that motor vehicles registered to their owners are not personal property, further consideration shows that acceptance of that position leads to irreconcilable conflicts with numerous provisions in R.C. Chapter 5739 (the sales-tax chapter). For instance, R.C. 5739.01(E)(2) and R.C. 5739.01(P) exclude from sales tax the sale of a motor vehicle that the consumer will use directly in rendering a public utility service. This presupposes that motor vehicles are personal property for sales-tax and use-tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">{\u00b6 27} In addition, R.C. 5739.011(C)(9) provides that a motor vehicle \u201cregistered for operation on public highways\u201d is not a \u201cthing transferred\u201d for the purposes of the manufacturing exception; as a result, motor vehicles are not excepted from sales tax under the manufacturing exception in R.C. 5739.01(E)(9). If under R.C. 5701.03(A) registered motor vehicles were not personal property for sales-tax purposes, there would be no reason to exclude them from the manufacturing exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">{\u00b628} R.C. 5739.01(L) defines \u201ccasual sale\u201d as a sale of tangible personal property that the seller had previously obtained for his or her own use. R.C. 5739.02(B)(8) exempts casual sales from sales tax. However, it expressly excludes sales of motor vehicles. In order to constitute a casual sale, the item must be personal property. Because a motor vehicle obtained by a person for his or her own use must be registered, the express exclusion of motor vehicles shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>that the General Assembly considers motor vehicles, including those registered by the owner, to be personal property for sales-tax and use-tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">{\u00b6 29} R.C. 5739.02(B)(9) exempts from sales and use taxes \u201c[s]ales of services or tangible personal property, other than motor vehicles, * * * by churches\u201d or nonprofit organizations. Again, motor vehicles are assumed to be personal property for sales-tax and use-tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">{\u00b6 30} R.C. 5739.02(B)(23) provides a sales-tax and use-tax exemption for sales of motor vehicles to nonresidents under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">{\u00b6 31} Perhaps the most telling provision expressing the General Assembly\u2019s intent to include registered motor vehicles as personal property is R.C. 5739.01(B)(6), which lists examples of assets as \u201cboats, planes, motor vehicles, or other tangible personal property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">{\u00b6 32} A review of the legislative history of R.C. 5701.03(A) reveals no indication that the General Assembly intended to exclude registered motor vehicles from personal property for purposes of sales or use taxes. Since at least the Act of March 2, 1846, 44 Ohio Laws 85, there has been a legislative definition of \u201cpersonal property.\u201d The 1846 version states in its preamble that the purpose of the act was \u201clevying taxes on all property in this State according to its true value.\u201d Section 1 of that Act provides, \u201c[A]ll property, whether real or personal, within this state * * * except such as is hereinafter expressly exempted, shall be subject to taxation; and such property * * * shall be entered on the lists of taxable property, for that purpose, in the manner prescribed by this act.\u201d Section 2 of the Act states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cThe term \u2018personal property,\u2019 wherever used in this act, shall be held to mean and include-</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c1st. Every tangible thing, being the subject of ownership, whether animate or inanimate, other than money, and not forming part of any parcel of real property, as hereinbefore defined.\u201d Thus, the predecessor of R.C. 5701.03 was enacted to define \u201cpersonal property\u201d for the purpose of ad valorem taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">{\u00b6 35} In 1931, Am.S.B. No. 323, 114 Ohio Laws 714, 716, amended the predecessor of R.C. 5701.03 to exclude from the definition of \u201cpersonal property,\u201d \u201cmotor vehicles registered by the owner thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">{\u00b6 36} Apparently to clarify that registered motor vehicles were excluded from the ad valorem tax, the language in what is now R.C. 4503.04 for registering motor vehicles was enacted, providing, \u201cTaxes at the rates provided for in this section shall be in lieu of all taxes on or with respect to the ownership of such motor vehicles.\u201d Am.S.B. No. 328,114 Ohio Laws 851, 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">(\u00b6 37} When analyzing the interplay between R.C. 5701.03 and the sales-tax and use-tax laws, it is important to keep in mind that when the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u201cpersonal property\u201d was enacted in 1859, and even for a time after the exclusion for \u201cmotor vehicles registered by the owner thereof\u2019 was added, Ohio had no sales or use taxes. The Ohio sales tax was not enacted until 1934, H.B. No. 134, 115 Ohio Laws, Part II, 306, and the use tax in 1935, H.B. No. 590, 116 Ohio Laws, Part II, 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">{\u00b6 38} There can be no question but that since the inception of the sales and use taxes, the General Assembly has considered motor vehicles to be personal property subject to those taxes. For instance, G.C. 6294, H.B. No. 255, 116 Ohio Laws, Part I, 78, 79, enacted in 1935, provided that for a motor vehicle purchased after January 27, 1935, to be registered, the application had to show payment of the three percent sales tax or the reason for its exemption. Casual sales of motor vehicles were initially not subject to sales tax. However, in 1951, the sales-tax exemption for casual sales was amended to specifically exclude the \u201ccasual and isolated sales of motor vehicles.\u201d Am.S.B. No. Ill, 124 Ohio Laws 147,149. Thus, unless otherwise excepted or exempted, all sales or uses of motor vehicles are subject to sales or use tax, as items of personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">{\u00b6 39} There is clearly a conflict between R.C. 5701.03(A), which excludes motor vehicles registered by their owners from the definition of personal property and the sales-tax and use-tax statutes, which assume that the sale or use of such motor vehicles is the sale or use of personal property. Since their adoption, the sales-tax and use-tax statutes have apparently been operating independently from R.C. 5701.03. Now, however, the provisions have met head-on. When this type of conflict is encountered, we look to R.C. 1.51 for guidance. R.C. 1.51 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">(\u00b6 40} \u201cIf a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision, they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general provision prevail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">{\u00b6 41} R.C. 5701.03(A) and the sales-tax and use-tax statutes in R.C. Chapters 5739 and 5741 cannot be reconciled to give effect to all.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">{\u00b6 42} Here, the exclusion of motor vehicles registered by their owners from the definition of \u201cpersonal property\u201d is a general provision, while R.C. Chapters 5739 and 5741 are special provisions, providing for taxing the sale or use of motor vehicles as the sale or use of tangible personal property. R.C. Chapters 5739 and 5741 were adopted after R.C. 5701.03(A). There is no manifest intent that R.C. 5701.03(A) should prevail over R.C. Chapters 5739 and 5741.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">{\u00b6 43} Applying R.C. 1.51, we find that the sales-tax and use-tax provisions in R.C. Chapters 5739 and 5741 prevail as exceptions to the general definition of personal property in R.C. 5701.03(A). Therefore, we find that for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>R.C. Chapters 5739 and 5741, motor vehicles registered by their owners are personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">{\u00b6 44} GM next contends that it did not use the repair parts or realize the benefit of the repair services. We will discuss the repair parts and the repair services issues separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">{\u00b6 45} R.C. 5741.02(A) levies use tax on the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">{\u00b646} \u201c(A) * * * [T]he storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property or the benefit realized in this state of any service provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">{\u00b6 47} R.C. 5741.02(B) provides that the use tax is imposed on the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c(B) Each consumer, storing, using, or otherwise consuming in this state tangible personal property or realizing in this state the benefit of any service provided, shall be liable for the tax * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">{\u00b6 49} The term \u201cuse\u201d is defined in R.C. 5741.01(C) as \u201cthe exercise of any right or power incidental to the ownership of the thing used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">{\u00b6 50} GM contends that it did not use the repair parts, because it never owned or possessed them. However, the Tax Commissioner contends that GM used the repair parts to fulfill its warranty obligations and for its repair programs and, therefore, exercised a right or power incidental to ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">{\u00b6 51} As authority for his position, the Tax Commissioner cites <em>Drackett Products Co. v. Limbach </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 204, 527 N.E.2d 860, wherein Drackett paid out-of-state publishing companies to produce advertising supplements. The publishers shipped the advertising supplements to Ohio newspaper companies that Drackett had selected. The newspaper companies would then insert them into their newspapers and deliver them. Drackett was assessed a use tax based on the amounts it had paid the publishing companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">{\u00b6 52} Just as GM does here, Drackett argued that it had never possessed the materials for which it was assessed a use tax. However, we held that \u201c[t]he use tax, contrary to [Drackett\u2019s] argument, is not imposed upon the transfer of possession of tangible personal property. It is imposed upon the storage, use, or consumption of tangible personal property in Ohio.\u201d Id. at 205, 527 N.E.2d 860. Therefore, because the advertising supplements had been published and distributed in Ohio at Drackett\u2019s direction and expense, we found that Drackett had \u201cexercised sufficient rights or powers incidental to ownership to subject its purchase of a portion of the supplement to the use tax.\u201d Id. at 206, 527 N.E.2d 860. Applying <em>Drackett, </em>we find that just as the advertising supplements were paid for by Drackett and distributed by the newspapers on Drackett\u2019s behalf, the repair parts were paid for by GM and were placed on the customers\u2019 vehicles on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>GM\u2019s behalf. Thus, GM exercised sufficient rights or powers incidental to ownership to subject it to the use tax for using the parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">(\u00b6 53} GM also contends that it did not realize any benefit from the repair services. In addition to the use tax on the storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property, R.C. 5741.02(A) also levies a use tax on \u201cthe benefit realized in this state of any service provided.\u201d The term \u201cproviding a service\u201d is defined in R.C. 5741.01(M) as having \u201cthe same meaning as in division (X) of section 5739.01 of the Revised Code,\u201d which defines the term as meaning \u201cproviding or furnishing anything described in division (B)(3) of [R.C. 5739.01] for consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">{\u00b6 54} R.C. 5739.01(B) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c(B) \u2018Sale\u2019 and \u2018selling\u2019 include all of the following transactions * * *:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c(3) All transactions by which:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c(a) An item of tangible personal property is or is to be repaired * *</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">{\u00b6 59} Thus, the use tax is imposed upon the benefit of a transaction in which an item of tangible personal property is repaired. Referring to its first proposition of law \u2014 that motor vehicles registered by their owners are not personal property \u2014 GM contends that it was not the beneficiary of the repair service, because no item of personal property was repaired. We reject this contention because we have determined that motor vehicles registered to their owners are personal property for sales-tax and use-tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">{\u00b6 60} In addition, GM contends that it did not receive any benefit from the repair services. We also reject this contention. There are two different transactions occurring when a vehicle is repaired. In one transaction, between GM and its customer, GM is fulfilling its obligations to its customer under the warranty or repair program. In order for GM to fulfill its obligations, it has entered into a separate transaction with the dealer. In this other transaction, which is between GM and its dealer, the dealer provides the parts and services necessary for GM to fulfill its obligations to its customer. The dealer has no warranty or repair-program obligation to GM\u2019s customer. When the dealer provides the parts and services to repair a vehicle, GM receives a benefit because the parts and services enable GM to fulfill its warranty or repair-program obligation to its customer. Thus, GM did realize a benefit from the repair services provided by its dealer and that benefit is subject to use tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">{\u00b6 61} In its third proposition of law, GM contends that it was not the consumer of any tangible personal property or services provided by the dealers. R.C. 5741.02(B) provides, \u201cEach consumer, storing, using, or otherwise consuming in this state tangible personal property or realizing in this state the benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>any service provided, shall be liable for the tax * * Thus, it is the consumer that is liable for the use tax. However, GM contends that it was not the consumer and, therefore, it should not be liable for the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">{\u00b6 62} The term \u201cconsumer\u201d is defined in R.C. 5741.01(F) as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">{\u00b6 63} \u201c[A]ny person who has purchased tangible personal property or has been provided a service for storage, use, or other consumption or benefit in this state. \u2018Consumer\u2019 does not include a person who receives, without charge, tangible personal property or a service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">{\u00b6 64} GM contends that the motor vehicle owner is the consumer because he or she paid for the repairs when they paid for the warranty or repair programs as part of the purchase price of the motor vehicle. At this point it bears repeating that two transactions occurred each time a vehicle was repaired. One transaction was between GM and the motor vehicle owner and the other was between GM and its dealer who provided the parts and services. The transaction at issue here is the one between GM and the dealer. It was GM, not the motor vehicle owner, that paid the dealers for the parts and services. GM also received the benefit of the services provided by the dealers because the services were necessary for GM to fulfill its obligations to its customers. The benefit that the motor vehicle owners received was the benefit of GM\u2019s warranty or repair programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">{\u00b6 65} Applying the definition of \u201cconsumer\u201d set forth in R.C. 5741.01(F) makes it clear that the motor vehicle owners were not consumers in these transactions, because they received the parts and services without any charge. Contrary to its argument, GM was a consumer when it purchased and consumed the parts and services that were used to fulfill its warranty and repair programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">{\u00b6 66} In its fourth proposition of law, GM contends that with regard to repairs that occurred before July 1, 1993, even if GM had realized a benefit when the dealers performed the repairs covered by the warranty or repair programs, the benefit was resold by GM to the owners of the vehicles and, therefore, under R.C. 5739.01(E)(1), GM was exempt from tax because its purpose was to resell the benefit. July 1, 1993, was the effective date of an amendment to R.C. 5739.01(D) that provided that services purchased in the performance of a warranty contract were not covered by the purchase-for-resale exception. Am.Sub. H.B. No. 152, 145 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3313, Part III, 4289-4290.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">{\u00b6 67} The BTA held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider GM\u2019s purchase-for-resale claim because GM did not raise that issue in the notice of appeal filed with the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">{\u00b6 68} R.C. 5717.02 provides that appeals to the BTA \u201cshall be taken by the filing of a notice of appeal with the board * * * and shall also <em>specify the errors </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number><em>therein </em>[in the Tax Commissioner\u2019s final determination] <em>complained of </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This court reviewed the requirements for perfecting an appeal to the BTA in <em>Am. Restaurant &amp; Lunch Co. v. Glander </em>(1946), 147 Ohio St. 147, 149-150, 34 O.O. 8, 70 N.E.2d 93, and held, \u201cThese requirements are specific and in terms that are mandatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">{\u00b6 69} The petitions for reassessment that GM filed with the Tax Commissioner specified that GM should not be taxed, because the repair parts and services \u201cwere acquired by General Motors for \u2018resale\u2019 to the vehicle owners.\u201d However, when GM filed its notices of appeal with the BTA, it dropped the purchase-for-resale claim; instead it claimed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">{\u00b6 70} \u201c4. The Commissioner failed to find that the consideration or price paid by the owner of a new motor vehicle at the time of purchase included an amount for repairs to the vehicle that would be provided under a new motor vehicle warranty. Consequently, GM has been assessed use tax on a transaction that was previously subjected to sales tax when the vehicle was purchased by the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">{\u00b6 71} In <em>Queen City Valves v. Peck </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 579, 583, 53 O.O. 430, 120 N.E.2d 310, this court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cUnder the wording of the statute the [BTA] was entitled to be advised specifically of the various errors charged to the Tax Commissioner. The statute requires in plain language that the errors complained of be specified. The word \u2018specify,\u2019 according to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4 Ed.) means \u2018to mention specifically; to state in full and explicit terms; to point out; to tell or state precisely or in detail; to particularize; or to distinguish by words one thing from another.\u2019 * * * And in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2 Ed.), \u2018specify\u2019 is defined as \u2018to mention or name in a specific or explicit manner; to tell or state precisely or in detail.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">{\u00b6 73} The notices of appeal that GM filed with the BTA did not specify the purchase-for-resale exception or any statutory provision that encompasses the purchase-for-resale exception. GM claims that language in its notices of appeal to the BTA related back to its petitions for reassessment and a technical-arguments memorandum it had filed with the Tax Commissioner. In its brief filed with this court, GM claims that its \u201cpurchase for resale claim is inherent in its double taxation claim.\u201d However, a claim of double taxation is different from a claim of exception from taxation as a purchase for resale.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">{\u00b6 74} The BTA is not required to decipher a notice of appeal. While this court has stated that it is \u201cnot disposed to deny review by a hypertechnical reading of the notice,\u201d <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. Limbach </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 195, 197, 625 N.E.2d 597, the notice is required to \u201cspecify\u201d the errors complained of, which means that they are to be clearly and distinctly set forth. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The purchase-for-resale claim was not clearly and distinctly set forth in the notices of appeal that GM filed with the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">{\u00b6 75} GM cites <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Limbach </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 381, 575 N.E.2d 146, to support its contention that it specified a claim of purchase for resale in its notices of appeal. In <em>Goodyear, </em>the question arose whether the taxpayer had raised an issue in its notice of appeal to the BTA. The court concluded that the taxpayer could assert an alternative argument in this court in support of an issue it had raised in the BTA. The court permitted that alternative argument because it concluded that Goodyear had specified the commissioner\u2019s action that it questioned, cited the statute under which it objected, and asserted the treatment that it believed the commissioner should have applied. Id. at 383, 575 N.E.2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">{\u00b6 76} Conversely, in GM\u2019s notices of appeal to the BTA, it did not question the Tax Commissioner\u2019s finding that the purchase-for-resale exception was not applicable, nor did it cite the statutory provision relating to the purchase-for-resale exception. Therefore, the notices did not meet the specificity required by R.C. 5717.02. Since GM\u2019s notices of appeal did not specify the purchase-for-resale issue, the BTA had no jurisdiction to determine it. Consequently, this court has no jurisdiction to review the purchase-for-resale issue raised by GM. <em>Osborne Bros. Welding Supply, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 175, 178, 532 N.E.2d 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">{\u00b6 77} In its final proposition of law, GM contends that by taxing its use of parts and services the state impaired GM\u2019s obligation of contracts in violation of Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, which provides, \u201cThe general assembly shall have no power to pass retroactive laws, or laws impairing the obligation of contracts * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">{\u00b6 78} In support of its contention that its contracts were impaired, GM claims that its bargained-for profit on the sale of its vehicles has been reduced. GM claims that because it anticipated a certain amount it would have to pay per vehicle for repairs, any unanticipated tax it is required to pay reduces its profit. However, anytime the state raises the rate of any tax paid by GM, the amount of profit realized is reduced. Surely, GM does not believe that by entering a contract it is constitutionally guaranteed a lock on the current tax rate. We find that the tax did not impair GM\u2019s contractual obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">(\u00b6 79} In <em>North Missouri RR. Co. v. Maguire </em>(1873), 87 U.S. (20 Wall.) 46, 22 L.Ed. 287, the court had before it the question whether it was a violation of the United States Constitution provision prohibiting <em>the </em>states from passing laws that impair the obligation of contracts for the state of Missouri to impose a tax on proceeds from the operation of a railroad after the state had entered into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>contract with the railroad that provided how the railroad\u2019s gross earnings would be distributed. In upholding the power of the state to tax, the court stated:</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AH\">Jones Day and Charles M. Steines, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AV\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Richard C. Farrin, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">{\u00b6 80} \u201cUnless exempted in terms which amount to a contract not to tax, the property, privileges, and franchises of a corporation are as much the legitimate subjects of taxation as any other property of the citizens which is within the sovereign power of the State. Repeated decisions of this court have held, in respect to such corporations, that the taxing power of the State is never presumed to be relinquished, and consequently that it exists unless the intention to relinquish it is declared in clear and unambiguous terms.\u201d Id. at 61, 22 L.Ed. 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">{\u00b6 81} GM had no contract with the state forbidding taxation; the state properly exercised its constitutional right to tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">{\u00b6 82} For all of the foregoing reasons, we hold that the decision of the BTA was reasonable and lawful, and we affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b200-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
