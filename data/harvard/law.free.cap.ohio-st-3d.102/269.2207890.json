Sabarese of Rootstown, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0042479, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1989. On May 13 and August 11, 2003, relator, Portage County Bar Association, charged respondent, in two complaints, with having violated the Code of Professional Responsibility. A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline consolidated the cases and heard both causes and, based on the parties\u2019 stipulations and other evidence, made findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommended a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">{\u00b6 2} As to the first complaint, board case No. 03-046, the panel found that Lauren A. Weaver had retained respondent to oversee the administration of her father\u2019s estate. During respondent\u2019s initial meeting with Weaver on July 28, 2000, respondent told Weaver that once she obtained Weaver\u2019s father\u2019s original will, which was in the possession of an out-of-town attorney, she would be able to complete the estate administration in approximately three months. Respondent also discussed her fee with Weaver during this meeting, requesting $1,500 for her services and $125 for court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">{\u00b6 3} Weaver paid respondent\u2019s fee, apparently with the understanding that it was an initial retainer. Respondent, however, recalled that she had told Weaver that this was a flat fee. Their fee agreement is not in writing. Respondent deposited the $1,500 into her personal account rather than placing any unearned funds into a client trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">{\u00b6 4} Weaver and her brother were beneficiaries under their father\u2019s will. Among other tasks, they needed respondent to file with the county auditor a tax-release form so that funds from their father\u2019s IRA, which were not subject to probate, could be distributed. The siblings also needed respondent to have their father\u2019s vehicle released from probate so that they could sell it. They planned to pay off the loan on the vehicle with part of the IRA proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">{\u00b6 5} Respondent prepared various standard probate forms, some of which Weaver signed on September 15, 2000. Respondent also prepared and filed the tax-release form that was needed before substantial IRA assets could be transferred to Weaver and her brother. Respondent never filed any of the probate documents that she had prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Respondent failed, at times, to maintain adequate communication with Weaver. And although she requested Weaver\u2019s father\u2019s will by letter dated September 18, 2000, respondent did not obtain the will until October 10, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b6 7} Weaver discharged respondent on November 10, 2000. When Weaver retained new counsel, respondent delayed several weeks before transferring the estate case file to the new attorney. After her discharge, respondent told Weaver that she would provide her with an itemized account of her services and refund any unearned funds from the $1,500 fee. Respondent did not provide this accounting until relator\u2019s investigation and has not returned any of Weaver\u2019s money.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 8} On April 20, 2001, Weaver, her brother, and her father\u2019s estate sued respondent, claiming legal malpractice and breach of contract. Due to respondent\u2019s many debts, including extensive medical costs for her child, respondent filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. The bankruptcy reorganization plan was confirmed on July 29, 2003, and requires that respondent pay $2,750 to Weaver\u2019s father\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 9} As to respondent\u2019s representation of Weaver, the parties stipulated and the panel found that respondent had violated DR 6-101(A)(3) by neglecting the estate that had been entrusted to her, DR 9-102(A) by depositing unearned fees directly into her personal account rather than holding them in trust, and DR 9-102(B)(3) by failing to timely render an appropriate accounting of funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b6 10} As to the second complaint, board case No. 03-064, the panel found that Vicki J. Knapp had retained respondent to represent her in a dissolution or, if necessary, a divorce. Respondent and Knapp first met on or about November 15, 2001, at which time they determined that respondent would prepare the paperwork necessary for a dissolution. Respondent further advised Knapp that, assuming that the termination of Knapp\u2019s marriage could be achieved through dissolution, a final hearing could be held 30 days after the petition for dissolution was filed. Respondent requested $1,500 in legal fees. Knapp paid $400 at their first appointment and the remaining $1,100 the following month. Respondent deposited these fees directly into her personal bank account rather than a client trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">{\u00b6 11} Thereafter, respondent failed at times to maintain adequate communication with Knapp. From December 2001 until April 2002, for example, the parties had minimal contact, and Knapp denied having received correspondence that respondent claimed to have sent her during that time. In April 2002, respondent and Knapp met to discuss details to be added to a separation agreement and a shared-parenting agreement, which respondent had prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">{\u00b6 12} Knapp discharged respondent in early July 2002 and retained other counsel. Although respondent did not provide Knapp with an itemized account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>her services immediately after her discharge, she did provide an accounting to relator during its investigation. Respondent also reimbursed Knapp in full by bank check, after her initial personal check was returned for insufficient funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">{\u00b6 13} The parties stipulated and the panel found that respondent violated DR 6-101(A)(3) by neglecting Knapp\u2019s case, DR 9-102(A) by depositing unearned fees directly into a personal account, and DR 9-102(B)(3) by failing to timely render appropriate accounts to Knapp.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">{\u00b6 14} In recommending a sanction for this misconduct, the panel considered the aggravating and mitigating elements of respondent\u2019s case. See Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). As aggravating factors, the panel found that respondent\u2019s neglect of two clients\u2019 cases and commingling of funds constituted multiple offenses and a pattern of misconduct and that her delays harmed vulnerable clients. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c), (d), and (h). As mitigating, the panel found that respondent had no prior disciplinary record and had not acted dishonestly or out of self-interest. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a) and (b). Respondent had also fully refunded Knapp\u2019s money, conceded her obligation to repay $2,750 to the estate of Weaver\u2019s father, cooperated in the disciplinary process, and appeared to be of good character and reputation apart from these transgressions. BCGD Proc. Reg. 10(B)(2)(c), (d), and (e). The panel further found mitigating that respondent, a sole practitioner and single mother, was experiencing dire financial problems and other difficulties, during some of the events at issue, due in part to her child\u2019s medical bills and her ex-husband\u2019s significant child-support arrearages.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">{\u00b6 15} The parties jointly proposed a sanction for the misconduct. Consistent with that proposal, the panel recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six months, with the entire period of the suspension stayed on the following conditions: (1) that respondent be placed on probation for one year pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(9); and (2) that during the term of probation, respondent completes five hours of continuing legal education (\u201cCLE\u201d) in law-office management or bookkeeping. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">{\u00b6 16} Upon review, we agree that respondent violated DR 6-101(A)(3), 9-102(A), and 9-102(B)(3). We also agree that the recommended stayed suspension and probation is appropriate. See <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Jackson </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 463, 678 N.E.2d 920 (attorney\u2019s neglect of clients, including duties required for probating an estate, warranted a six-month suspension, all stayed, provided that a monitor oversaw attorney\u2019s work for six months).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ag5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Kevin T. Poland and David S. Hirt, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AZn\">Buckingham, Doolittle &amp; Burroughs, L.L.P., and Peter T. Cahoon, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">{\u00b6 17} Accordingly, respondent is suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for a period of six months, but this suspension is stayed on the conditions that (1) she serve a one-year probation pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(9), and (2) during the term of probation she completes five hours of CLE in law-office management or bookkeeping. If respondent fails to comply with these conditions, the stay shall be lifted and respondent shall serve the entire six-month suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b429-6\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
