Spears named appellees, Judge DeWeese and Richland Correctional Institution Warden Julius Wilson, as respondents. Spears claimed that he was entitled to the writ because Judge DeWeese failed to comply with the requirements of R.C. 2701.06<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and consequently lacked jurisdiction to convict and sentence him.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJ2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Gregory Spears, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b359-3\">{\u00b6 3} On December 22, 2003, the court of appeals sua sponte dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">{\u00b6 4} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. First, a trial court judge\u2019s failure to comply with R.C. 2701.06 is not cognizable in habeas corpus; the proper respondent is the individual who is directly responsible for keeping the petitioner in custody, i.e., Warden Wilson. See, e.g., <em>Davis v. Wilson, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 269, 2003-Ohio-5898, 798 N.E.2d 379, \u00b6 11; cf. <em>Potts v. Rose, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 119, 2003-Ohio-5102, 796 N.E.2d 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">{\u00b6 5} Moreover, any noncompliance by Judge DeWeese with R.C. 2701.06 did not invalidate Spears\u2019s criminal proceedings. See <em>Potts v. DeWeese </em>(Jan. 23, 2002), Richland App. No. 01CA66, 2002 WL 106320, appeal not accepted, 95 Ohio St.3d 1438, 2002-Ohio-2084, 766 N.E.2d 1003; cf. <em>State ex rel. Ragozine v. Shaker, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 201, 2002-Ohio-3992, 772 N.E.2d 1192, \u00b6 13, quoting <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Farrar </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 467, 32 O.O. 542, 66 N.E.2d 531, paragraph three of the syllabus (\u201c \u2018As a general rule, a statute providing a time for the performance of an official duty will be construed as directory so far as time for performance is concerned, especially where the statute fixes the time simply for convenience or orderly procedure\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">{\u00b6 6} Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals did not err by dismissing Spears\u2019s habeas corpus petition. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b359-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
