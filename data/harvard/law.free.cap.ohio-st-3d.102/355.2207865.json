Howard, filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Lucas County naming appellee, Judge Charles J. Doneghy of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, the Industrial Commission, the Administrator of Workers\u2019 Compensation, and Seaway Food Town, Inc., as respondents. Howard sought a writ of procedendo to compel Judge Doneghy to proceed to judgment in Howard\u2019s administrative appeal in the common pleas court. <em>Howard v. Indus. Comm., </em>case No. CI0200301864. Howard alleged that Judge Doneghy had failed to rule on several motions in the administrative appeal. Howard also requested a writ of mandamus to compel Judge Doneghy to report to the Ohio State Bar Association alleged misconduct by opposing counsel in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">{\u00b6 2} On January 15, 2004, the court of appeals dismissed the Industrial Commission, the Administrator of Workers\u2019 Compensation, and Seaway Food Town, Inc. The court of appeals further issued an alternative writ and ordered the remaining respondent, Judge Doneghy, to do the acts requested by Howard or show cause why he would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">{\u00b6 3} On January 21, 2004, Judge Doneghy entered judgment against Howard in his administrative appeal and denied all of Howard\u2019s pending motions. On January 29, 2004, Judge Doneghy moved to dismiss Howard\u2019s writ action. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>February 9, 2004, the court of appeals granted Judge Doneghy\u2019s motion and dismissed Howard\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 4} On February 11, 2004, Howard requested that the court of appeals vacate its February 9, 2004 judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 15, 56, and 60(B)(1) through (5). On March 4, 2004, the court of appeals denied Howard\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">{\u00b6 5} On appeal, Howard asserts that the court of appeals erred in dismissing his claims for writs of procedendo and mandamus and denying his Civ.R. 60(B) motion. Howard\u2019s assertion is meritless for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">{\u00b6 6} First, Howard\u2019s claim for a writ of procedendo was rendered moot by Judge Doneghy\u2019s January 21, 2004 judgment in the underlying case. \u201cNeither procedendo nor mandamus will compel the performance of a duty that has already been performed.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Kreps v. Christiansen </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 313, 318, 725 N.E.2d 663, citing <em>State ex rel. Grove v. Nadel </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 252, 253, 703 N.E.2d 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">{\u00b6 7} Second, Howard was not entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel Judge Doneghy to report alleged ethical misconduct by opposing counsel, because Howard has or had an adequate legal remedy by filing a grievance under Gov.Bar R. v. <em>Howard v. Spore </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 131, 132, 742 N.E.2d 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">{\u00b6 8} Third, the court of appeals properly denied Howard\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion. \u201c \u2018A Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment cannot be used as a substitute for a timely appeal * * \u201d <em>State ex rel. Bragg v. Seidner </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 87, 748 N.E.2d 532, quoting <em>Key v. Mitchell </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 89, 90-91, 689 N.E.2d 548. The issues raised in Howard\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion could have been raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">{\u00b6 9} Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">{\u00b6 10} Moreover, we impose sanctions pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. XIV(5). Howard is no stranger to filing frivolous actions in this court. See <em>State ex rel. Howard v. Zimmerman, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 1535, 2003-Ohio-4753, 795 N.E.2d 676, where we noted that \u201cthe continued filing by Gregory T. Howard of frivolous actions * * * will result in additional sanctions, including the forfeiture of security deposits, awards of expenses and attorney fees, costs or double costs, or any other sanction the court considers just\u201d; <em>State ex rel. Howard v. Indus. Comm., </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1465, 2004-Ohio-819, 804 N.E.2d 39 (sanction of attorney fees awarded against Howard).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">{\u00b6 11} Howard\u2019s appeal is frivolous because it is \u201cnot reasonably well-grounded in fact or warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing laws.\u201d S.Ct.Prac.R. XIV(5). As Judge Doneghy aptly observes, we rejected a similar mandamus claim by Howard a few years ago. <em>Howard, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 132, 742 N.E.2d 649. Therefore, we impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>sanctions against Howard under S.Ct.Prac.R. XIV(5) and order Judge Doneghy to submit within 20 days a detailed bill of reasonable expenses and reasonable attorney fees incurred by him in this appeal. Howard may file objections within ten days of the filing of the bill and documentation, and Judge Doneghy may file a reply to the objections within five days of the filing of the objections.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AsS\">Gregory T.
