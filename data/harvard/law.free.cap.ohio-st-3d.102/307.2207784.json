Holder of Akron, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0015110, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1966. On April 14, 2003, relator, Akron Bar Association, filed a second amended complaint charging that respondent had violated the Code of Professional Responsibility while representing several clients with competing interests. Respondent answered. A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the cause and considered the parties\u2019 comprehensive stipulations and other evidence. Based principally on the stipulated facts and exhibits, the board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>The professional misconduct charged in the complaint emanated from respondent\u2019s representation of a client involved in a business dispute, respondent\u2019s suit against that client for legal fees and fraud, respondent\u2019s efforts to assist his wife and a friend with opening a community school in East Cleveland, Ohio, and respondent\u2019s advocacy on his own behalf during the disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>process. The parties\u2019 stipulations, incorporated exhibits, and witnesses substantiate, for the purpose of this case, the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The Business Dispute</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">{\u00b6 3} Respondent met Marcus or \u201cMark\u201d L. Wright, the client who would later file the grievance that initiated this disciplinary process, in 1999. By that time, Wright had been affiliated for a number of years with an Ohio nonprofit corporation established to provide social services to children enrolled in community or \u201ccharter\u201d schools. This corporation, initially known as The Right Way Foundation, later became known as Child First Alternative Care (\u201cChild First\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 4} The Right Way Foundation was incorporated in 1994, and a three-member board of trustees was appointed. An amendment to The Right Way Foundation\u2019s Articles of Incorporation, filed in 1997, purported to change the company\u2019s corporate name to Child First. That filing identified a business associate of Wright\u2019s as the chairman of the board. On the same filing, Wright was identified as Child First\u2019s president.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">{\u00b6 5} By the fall of 2000, Wright and the associate were in sharp disagreement about Child First\u2019s operations, with the associate alleging Wright\u2019s misuse of corporate funds. The associate engaged legal counsel and threatened to sue Wright on behalf of Child First. In November or December 2000, Wright engaged respondent as his counsel in the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">{\u00b6 6} On February 1, 2001, the associate filed suit against Wright in the Summit County Court of Common Pleas (the \u201cChild First lawsuit\u201d). Respondent appeared on Wright\u2019s behalf, representing him during proceedings that included a hearing before a court magistrate on February 9, 2001. During the hearing, the magistrate ordered that Wright\u2019s associate \u201ccontinue to operate the business as the in-place chief executive officer.\u201d The magistrate further ordered that Wright \u201cshould not in any fashion undertake any business decisions on his own unilaterally that would affect the course of direction of the business or substantially be an expansion or regression of the business. In other words, he\u2019s to keep the status quo of the business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">{\u00b6 7} Respondent understood the magistrate\u2019s order to prohibit Wright only from affecting the business operations of Child First or altering its status quo. Respondent thus took steps that he considered permissible to defend his client against the associate\u2019s lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">{\u00b6 8} Respondent attempted to contact the three members of Child First\u2019s board of trustees, none of whom was the associate identified as the board chairman on the name-change filing. In May 2001, respondent and Wright were able to reach one trustee but not the other two. From discussions with this trustee and a deposition of the associate, respondent and Wright drew three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>conclusions: (1) the Child First trustees had never elected the associate as an officer; (2) the Child First trustees had never authorized the 1997 corporate name change; and (3) the Child First trustees had not authorized the associate\u2019s suit against Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">{\u00b6 9} Respondent arranged a meeting of the Child First trustees to be held on May 25, 2001, at the Cincinnati office of the trustee with whom respondent and Wright had been in contact. Respondent sent notice of the meeting to the last known addresses of all three Child First trustees, but the other two trustees did not attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">{\u00b6 10} Before the meeting, respondent prepared a series of corporate resolutions for execution, as well as an affidavit for the attending trustee to sign. One of the proposed resolutions was to discharge the associate and another person as employees of Child First. The affidavit confirmed that the trustees had never designated the associate to be an officer of Child First and had not authorized the associate\u2019s lawsuit against Wright. The affidavit reported the trustee\u2019s adoption of these resolutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 11} Respondent sent the resolutions and affidavit to the Cincinnati meeting with Wright and members of his staff. Respondent, recovering from surgery and too ill to attend, had advised Wright not to participate in the meeting because of the magistrate\u2019s order in the Child First lawsuit. Respondent\u2019s staff also brought another resolution that respondent had prepared for the meeting \u2014 a resolution for the Child First trustees to retain respondent as counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">'{\u00b6 12} Wright objected to this resolution, and he and respondent apparently discussed the matter by telephone. Afterward, respondent\u2019s staff withdrew the resolution to retain respondent as counsel before offering it for the attending trustee\u2019s approval. The attending trustee signed the prepared affidavit and the remaining resolutions, however, and one of respondent\u2019s staff notarized the trustee\u2019s signature. Child First had not adopted regulations to permit one trustee to act on the board\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">{\u00b6 13} Respondent subsequently submitted the trustee\u2019s affidavit and the corporate resolutions to the common pleas court in support of a motion for summary judgment in the Child First lawsuit. On May 30, 2001, the associate voluntarily dismissed the Child First lawsuit. Also at that time, the associate relinquished control of Child First to Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">The Fee Dispute</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">{\u00b6 14} Respondent and Wright ended their attorney-client relationship on May 30, 2001, with the dismissal of the Child First lawsuit. On April 24, 2001, however, opposing counsel in the Child First lawsuit had deposed Wright. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Wright\u2019s testimony during the deposition disclosed that Wright had a history of felony convictions and other behavior that respondent found objectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">{\u00b6 15} On June 14, 2001, respondent sent a letter to Wright and enclosed a statement for legal fees in the amount of $24,543.61. On July 6, 2001, respondent sent Wright another letter, this time threatening to sue him and Child First on July 11, 2001, if arrangements had not been made by then to pay legal fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">{\u00b6 16} On July 9, 2001, respondent and a family member allegedly noticed Wright following them, and respondent claims that he saw Wright gesture obscenely to him. The next day, respondent sued Wright individually and as president of Child First for legal fees and fraud. The fraud claim alleged that Wright did not inform respondent truthfully about Wright\u2019s criminal record and background. Respondent attached to his complaint Wright\u2019s deposition from the Child First lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The Community School Project</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">{\u00b6 17} In the spring of 2000, another client of respondent (\u201cClient A\u201d), who also was a lifelong friend of respondent\u2019s wife, began working on plans to open a community school in East Cleveland. Client A planned to participate in a program offered by the Ohio Department of Education that supplied startup grants for qualifying community schools and further financial assistance based on enrollment.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">{\u00b6 18} During 1998 and 1999, Wright was also affiliated with an Akron company that operated a large number of Ohio community schools. Respondent was aware of Wright\u2019s affiliation and .experience with community schools, and beginning in 2000, respondent\u2019s wife and Client A began discussing with Wright his expertise in this area. Thereafter, Wright became involved in the community school project with respondent\u2019s wife and Client A.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">{\u00b6 19} The East Cleveland Academy (\u201cECA\u201d) was incorporated as an Ohio nonprofit corporation on January 30, 2001, with Client A and others serving as directors. ECA contracted with Gold Key Management Corporation (\u201cGold Key\u201d) for Gold Key to provide management services to the school. Gold Key is an Ohio for-profit corporation that respondent set up in June 1997. Although respondent served as the first president of Gold Key, his wife assumed the presidency in 1998, sharing responsibilities with three other corporate officers. Respondent\u2019s wife is also a beneficial owner of Gold Key.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">{\u00b6 20} During the planning stages for ECA, Wright had encouraged certain individuals to become involved in Client A\u2019s efforts to open the community school. On his recommendation, some of Wright\u2019s acquaintances eventually undertook roles in establishing the school\u2019s location and operation. One of Wright\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>acquaintances served on the ECA board of directors, and several became members of primary or secondary development teams. Wright also attended meetings concerning ECA in Akron, at the Ohio Department of Education in Columbus, and in East Cleveland.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 21} Wright anticipated that he would be compensated for these services when the school\u2019s funding came through. Client A, however, anticipated only that Wright would receive a contract for providing social services after the school opened. Client A and respondent\u2019s wife also had a financial disagreement with a member of a development team whom Wright had recommended. In the end, neither Wright nor the development-team member he recommended would receive any compensation from the ECA project.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">{\u00b6 22} After Wright\u2019s April 24, 2001 deposition as part of the Child First lawsuit and while that litigation was still pending, respondent became concerned about Wright\u2019s continued involvement with ECA. Respondent did not want Wright to have any part in the project because of Wright\u2019s criminal record and other elements of his background. Around the same time, Client A was having what she considered unsettling confrontations with Wright and had developed her own concerns about him. Respondent disclosed Wright\u2019s felony convictions to Client A, and Client A thereafter wanted Wright to have nothing further to do with ECA, including any compensation or contracts. Wright had no involvement in the ECA project after June 9, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">{\u00b6 23} On May 9, 2001, ECA entered into a preliminary agreement with the Ohio Department of Education. The Ohio Department of Education made \u201csub-grant\u201d payments of $50,000 to ECA on June 14 and June 21, 2001. Further foundation payments of $23,222.13 each were paid, based on the school\u2019s estimated enrollment, on July 13 and August 6, 2001. ECA never opened. Under the terms of the agreement with the Ohio Department of Education, however, ECA was nevertheless entitled to retain the $100,000 sub-grants. Respondent, Gold Key, and Client A did receive payments from the sub-grants.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">{\u00b6 24} On July 19, 2001, while acting as counsel for the school, respondent sent a letter to the ECA director whom Wright had recommended. In it, respondent noted Wright\u2019s background as revealed in his deposition in the Child First lawsuit. Respondent enclosed with the letter a copy of his complaint against Wright for legal fees and fraud and a copy of the deposition. Respondent also sent copies of this letter to the other directors on the ECA board, and at some point after June 9, 2001, respondent discussed with Client A the basis for his fraud claims against Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">{\u00b6 25} Also on July 19, 2001, respondent directed letters highlighting Wright\u2019s criminal record to an employee of the Ohio Department of Education and to the minister of a church that had been proposed as a site for ECA. Respondent timed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>the July 19, 2001 letters to prevent Wright\u2019s anticipated participation in a meeting scheduled for July 20, 2001, with the Ohio Department of Education and the church. Respondent sent copies of the fee and fraud complaint and Wright\u2019s deposition to the trustee who had signed the resolutions and affidavit that resulted in the dismissal of the Child First lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The Disciplinary Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 26} During relator\u2019s investigation, respondent defied the investigator\u2019s attempts to learn about his representation of Wright and those involved with ECA. Respondent repeatedly replied to legitimate questions with obstreperous rhetoric, and he threatened to take legal action to stop the investigation. Moreover, as part of discussions to settle the legal fee and fraud claim against Wright, respondent negotiated with Wright\u2019s new attorney, seeking in part to have Wright sign off on letters to relator and Disciplinary Counsel that in effect withdrew Wright\u2019s grievance. The two letters were never sent, however, and respondent and Wright ultimately resolved the fee and fraud claim on other terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">{\u00b6 27} The board found that respondent had violated DR 4 \u2014 101(B)(1) (prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of a client confidence or secret) and (2) (prohibiting unauthorized use of a client confidence or secret to the client\u2019s disadvantage) by impermissibly disclosing Wright\u2019s criminal record and other background information to Client A, to trustees of Child First and ECA, and to the representative of the Ohio Department of Education, all in an effort to prevent Wright\u2019s further involvement in the ECA project. See DR 4-101(0(1) through (4) (attorney\u2019s disclosure of client\u2019s confidences or secrets permissible where the client has consented, where a legal duty to reveal exists, to prevent a crime, or where necessary to collect a fee or for the attorney\u2019s defense). The board also found a violation of DR 4 \u2014 101(B)(3) (prohibiting use of a client\u2019s confidence or secret for an attorney\u2019s own or another\u2019s advantage) because in disclosing the personal information about Wright, respondent purposefully acted in the interests of Client A, ECA, and Gold Key to undercut Wright\u2019s interests in being compensated for his advice or any other services he might have provided. Moreover, because respondent\u2019s disclosures were immediately responsible for the loss to Wright of these opportunities, the board also found respondent in violation of DR 7-101(A)(3) (prohibiting an attorney from causing a client damage or prejudice other than as necessary to report fraud upon a tribunal or third person).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">{\u00b6 28} The board further found that respondent had violated DR 7-102(A)(l) (prohibiting the filing of a lawsuit that obviously serves merely to harass or maliciously injure another) by groundlessly suing Wright for fraud. Respondent had also violated DR 7-102(A)(5) (forbidding knowingly making false statements of law or fact), the board found, by (1) representing to the common pleas court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the Child First lawsuit that the corporate resolutions were properly acted upon and valid; and (2) after dismissal of the Child First lawsuit, conceding in correspondence to Wright that the resolutions were effective only for the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">{\u00b6 29} The board additionally found violations of DR 5-105(A) (requiring an attorney to decline employment that is likely to compromise the attorney\u2019s independent judgment on a client\u2019s behalf) and (B) (requiring an attorney to discontinue multiple representations that are likely to compromise his or her independent judgment on a client\u2019s behalf). The board explained that respondent \u201ccontinued multiple representation, despite conflicts of interest that disadvantaged some of his clients to the advantage of other clients * * *, all without full disclosure to any of the clients of the possible effects of the conflicts his * * * independent judgment on behalf of each.\u201d See DR 5-105(C) (multiple representations permissible if it is obvious that an attorney can adequately represent the interests of each client and each client consents to the representation after full disclosure), which the board found that respondent had also violated. The board further found respondent in violation of DR 2-110(B)(2) (requiring an attorney\u2019s withdrawal from employment, with a tribunal\u2019s permission where necessary, where it is obvious that continued employment will result in the violation of a Disciplinary Rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">{\u00b6 30} The board found that respondent had also violated DR 1-102(A)(4) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) in several respects. To obtain the dismissal of the Child First lawsuit, respondent had arranged for a trustee of Child First, whose fiduciary interests were likely to be adverse to Wright\u2019s, to ostensibly act on that board\u2019s behalf. Then, in a letter to Wright, respondent encouraged Wright to retain his services on behalf of Child First to restructure the corporation and correct whatever filing deficiencies existed. The board observed that although \u201c[t]he evidence is not clear that the resolutions were valid or invalid in law, * * * in one or the other alternative, [respondent] engaged in misrepresentation either to the court and counsel for adverse litigants or subsequently to his client in that regard.\u201d Moreover, respondent unjustifiably threatened to sue Child First and seek a receivership when Wright did not immediately remit respondent\u2019s legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">{\u00b6 31} Having found violations of DR 4-101(B)(l), (2), and (3); 7-101(A)(3), 7-102(A)(1) and (5); 5-105(A), (B), and (C); 2-110(B)(2); and 1-102(A)(4), the board further found that this misconduct, including respondent\u2019s extensive efforts to discredit Wright for respondent\u2019s own benefit and the benefit of others, violated DR 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting conduct that adversely reflects on an attorney\u2019s fitness to practice law). And because respondent had attempted to derail the investigation of his misconduct by negotiating the withdrawal of Wright\u2019s griev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>anee through settlement discussions, threatening legal action, and actually filing a grievance against the investigator, among other examples, the board found respondent in violation of Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (requiring an attorney to cooperate in the disciplinary proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">{\u00b6 32} In recommending a sanction for this misconduct, the board considered the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). As having mitigating effect, the board found that respondent had practiced law for 37 years and had never before been disciplined for professional misconduct. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a). The board also found that respondent\u2019s misconduct was directed against only one client. The board noted respondent\u2019s physical illness during the misconduct, although the board did not find evidence of a causal connection. The board further found that respondent, once he had retained counsel, vigorously defended himself but cooperated appropriately. BCGD Proc. Reg 10(B)(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">{\u00b6 33} As aggravating features, the board found that Wright had been harmed by respondent\u2019s misconduct even though evidence did not quantify any financial loss. The board was also \u201cgravely concerned about Respondent\u2019s persisting belief that he owed no duty of loyalty or confidentiality to Wright because of Wright\u2019s criminal past\u201d and found that respondent lacked remorse. Moreover, the board was \u201cunable to reconcile Respondent\u2019s long practice experience with either his inability to recognize his conflicts of interest and avoid them, or with his professed lack of knowledge or perception of the total impropriety of his concerted effort to maliciously injure his former client for the benefit of other clients and for his own benefit.\u201d Doubting respondent\u2019s candor, the board thus concluded that respondent acted \u201centirely from selfish motives.\u201d See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">{\u00b6 34} As the sanction for his misconduct, relator proposed disbarment. Respondent initially proposed that the complaint be dismissed or that he receive no more than a public reprimand. The board, in adopting the panel\u2019s report, recommended that respondent\u2019s license to practice law be suspended for 24 months but that the final 18 months be stayed on the condition that respondent commit no further misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">{\u00b6 35} Respondent does not contest the findings that he violated DR 7-101(A)(3), 7-102(A)(l) and (5); 5-105(A), (B), and (C); 2-110(B)(2); and 1-102(A)(4) and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) and, upon review, we find ample evidence of this misconduct. Respondent does object, however, to the finding that he disclosed a client\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d as contemplated by the language of DR 4 \u2014 101(B)(1), (2), and (3). Respondent also contends that he did not use Wright\u2019s background <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>information to his own or another\u2019s advantage as prohibited by DR 4-101(B)(2) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">{\u00b6 36} Under DR 4-101(A), a client \u201cconfidence\u201d refers to \u201cinformation protected by the attorney-client privilege under applicable law,\u201d and a client \u201csecret\u201d includes \u201cother information gained in the professional relationship that * * * would be embarrassing or would be likely to be detrimental to the client.\u201d Under DR 4-101(B), a lawyer cannot \u201cknowingly * * * [r]eveal\u201d either a confidence or a secret unless permitted by DR 4-101(C). Respondent argues that Wright\u2019s criminal record was not a \u201csecret,\u201d inasmuch as it was a matter of public record and a matter that Wright had himself revealed to others, including the ECA director whom he had recommended to Client A. Respondent further contends that his disclosure, even if it was of a secret, was not likely to be detrimental, considering the criminal background check to which Wright might have been subjected as a condition of being offered a service contract. We reject these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cA fundamental principle in the attorney-client relationship is that the attorney shall maintain the confidentiality of any information learned during the attorney-client relationship.\u201d <em>Kala v. Aluminum Smelting &amp; Refining Co., Inc. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 1, 4, 688 N.E.2d 258. This professional duty exists to safeguard client confidences and secrets to ensure the client\u2019s complete trust in the attorney and the client\u2019s freedom to divulge anything and everything needed for the client\u2019s proper and effective representation. <em>Lightbody v. Rust </em>(2000), 137 Ohio App.3d 658, 663, 739 N.E.2d 840, discretionary appeal not accepted (2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 1424, 735 N.E.2d 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">{\u00b6 38} For the purpose of DR 4-101, a \u201cconfidence\u201d is information learned directly from the client, whereas a \u201csecret\u201d is defined more broadly. <em>In re Original Grand Jury Investigation </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 544, 545, 733 N.E.2d 1135. A client secret necessarily includes embarrassing or detrimental information that the client reveals, but the term also extends to embarrassing or detrimental information that is available from other sources, such as witnesses or investigative research. Id., 89 Ohio St.3d at 545-546, 733 N.E.2d 1135. Ohio\u2019s definition of a client secret is still less encompassing than that in American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct 1.6(a), which expresses \u201cthe basic principle of professional ethics that <em>all </em>information \u2018relating to\u2019 a lawyer\u2019s professional relationship with a client is presumptively confidential and must not be disclosed unless an exception applies.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) 1 Hazard &amp; Hodes, The Law of Lawyering (3d Ed.2001) 9-52, Section 9.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">{\u00b6 39} There being an ethical duty to maintain client secrets available from sources other than the client, it follows that an attorney is not free to disclose embarrassing or harmful features of a client\u2019s life just because they are docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>mented in public records or the attorney learned of them in some other way. (Cf. <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Bodiker </em>[1999], 134 Ohio App.3d 415, 425, 731 N.E.2d 245, holding that to the extent that DR 4-101 protects client secrets and confidences equally, a public defender\u2019s financial records about the cost of a client\u2019s defense are not embarrassing or detrimental and therefore not protected from disclosure under the public records law.) To the contrary, in only four situations may an embarrassing or harmful secret learned in the course of an attorney-client relationship be revealed: when the client has consented after being advised of the possible implications, DR 4 \u2014 101(C)(1); when the Disciplinary Rules, a court order, or the law otherwise requires disclosure, DR 4 \u2014 101(C)(2); when disclosure is necessary to prevent a crime the client intends to commit, DR 4 \u2014 101(C)(3); or when disclosure is necessary to collect an attorney\u2019s fee or to the attorney\u2019s defense against charges of misconduct, DR 4 \u2014 101(C)(4). None of these exceptions applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">{\u00b6 40} Accordingly, we find that respondent improperly disclosed the secrets of Wright\u2019s past after Wright divulged them in response to opposing counsel\u2019s questioning during Wright\u2019s deposition. As for detrimental effect, DR 4-101(A) requires no more than a probability that the disclosure of a client\u2019s secret will be \u201cembarrassing.\u201d And here, respondent disclosed Wright\u2019s criminal record and other background information, not for any of the reasons that require disclosure under DR 4 \u2014 101(C), but to warn Client A and others about Wright. Respondent acted to protect those involved in the ECA project from doing business with Wright for what he believed was their own good and the good of the school. Similarly, respondent\u2019s allegations of fraud, which were obviously unnecessary to his claim for legal fees, were intended to intimidate Wright. These disclosures surely worked to Wright\u2019s disadvantage and constituted the use of secrets at Wright\u2019s expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">{\u00b6 41} Respondent testified during the hearing that Wright consented after full disclosure to representation at the same time respondent was representing clients with competing interests, including Client A. Wright did not consent in -writing, however, and we see no other evidence of express consent. In fact, given the breadth of conflict that developed, one attorney should never have attempted to represent this combination of clients. Accordingly, we agree that respondent violated DR 4-101(B)(l), (2), and (3) as found by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">{\u00b6 42} Respondent also objects to the board\u2019s recommendation, taking issue with the findings of selfish motivation and lack of remorse, and now urges a one-year suspension of his law license with the entire period conditionally stayed. Upon review, we concur in the board\u2019s assessment of these aggravating features and find that respondent committed the misconduct in this case without regret to protect favored clients. Moreover, we share the board\u2019s concern as to respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>dent\u2019s initial inability to appreciate the degree to which he compromised Wright\u2019s secrets.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">{\u00b6 43} We also agree that respondent\u2019s misconduct warrants a 24-month suspension of his law license with a conditional stay of the final 18 months of this suspension. When an attorney violates DR 1-102(A)(4), especially to mislead a court or client, the sanction is ordinarily an actual suspension from the practice of law for an appropriate period of time. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Fowerbaugh </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 187, 191, 658 N.E.2d 237. Moreover, a suspension of at least two years is appropriate when an attorney compromises client interests in a conflict of this magnitude. See <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Osborne </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 140, 1 OBR 175, 438 N.E.2d 114; <em>Medina Cty. Bar Assn. v. Carlson, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 134, 2003-Ohio-5073, 797 N.E.2d 55 (attorney\u2019s license suspended for two years for entering into business deal with disabled client and taking advantage of entrusted information for his own financial gain); and <em>Bar Assn. of Greater Cleveland v. Watkins </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 11, 22 O.O.3d 125, 427 N.E.2d 516 (attorney\u2019s license suspended indefinitely for telling client\u2019s employer, after client filed bar grievance, about misdeeds client revealed to the attorney in confidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 44} Evidence of mitigation may warrant a stay of all or part of the suspension. <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Statzer, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 14, 2003-Ohio-6649, 800 N.E.2d 1117, \u00b6 21. Here, although the board saw little connection between respondent\u2019s medical condition and his misconduct, respondent did undergo a serious surgery and recovery period during these events. We also see no evidence that respondent\u2019s infirmity contributed to his misconduct, but we nevertheless consider his medical condition mitigating in combination with respondent\u2019s 37 years of practice. Moreover, the depth of remorse that respondent has expressed in the proceedings before this court is encouraging and convinces us that he will not repeat these transgressions.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">{\u00b6 45} Accordingly, we adopt the board\u2019s findings of misconduct and recommendation. Respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for two years; however, the final 18 months of the suspension are stayed on the condition that respondent commit no further misconduct during the suspension period. If respondent violates this condition, the stay shall be lifted, and respondent shall serve the entire two-year suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b473-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
