Hawkins\u2019s petition did not contain his commitment papers, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>required by R.C. 2725.04(D), or an affidavit describing each civil action or appeal of a civil action that he had filed in the previous five years in any state or federal court, as required by R.C. 2969.25(A). Moreover, Hawkins\u2019s purported verification of his petition was not notarized.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ad1\">Jomo K. Hawkins, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ANO\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Gregory T. Hartke, Assistant Attorney General, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">{\u00b6 2} Hawkins\u2019s prison warden moved to dismiss the petition on several grounds, including that the petition violated R.C. 2725.04(D) and 2969.25(A). Hawkins subsequently filed an unnotarized statement purporting to be his R.C. 2969.25(A) affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">{\u00b6 3} On January 9, 2004, the court of appeals dismissed the petition because it did not comply with R.C. 2725.04 and 2969.25(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">{\u00b6 4} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals for the reasons stated in its entry. Hawkins\u2019s habeas corpus petition is fatally defective and subject to dismissal because it did not comply with the commitment-paper and verification requirements of R.C. 2725.04. <em>State ex rel. McCuller v. Callahan, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 307, 2003-Ohio-858, 784 N.E.2d 108, \u00b6 4. Hawkins\u2019s purported verification, which is not notarized, is insufficient. <em>Chari v. Vore </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 323, 327, 744 N.E.2d 763, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.1999) 1556 (\u201c Verification\u2019 means a \u2018formal declaration made in the presence of an authorized officer, such as a notary public, by which one swears to the truth of the statements in the document\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">{\u00b6 5} Moreover, Hawkins\u2019s petition did not satisfy R.C. 2969.25(A). See <em>Fuqua v. Williams, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 211, 2003-Ohio-5533, 797 N.E.2d 982, syllabus (\u201cA habeas corpus action is a civil action and therefore the provisions of R.C. 2969.21 through 2969.27 are applicable to such action\u201d). His belated attempts to file the required affidavit do not excuse his noncompliance. Id. at \u00b6 9, citing R.C. 2969.25(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b456-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
