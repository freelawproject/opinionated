Hart\u2019s temporary total disability compensation (\u201cTTC\u201d), alleging that he had reached maximum medical improvement (\u201cMMI\u201d) for his allowed back conditions. In support, it submitted the December 19, 2001 report of Dr. Steven S. Wunder. Dr. Wunder reported claimant\u2019s complaints of constant back pain with occasional radiation and numbness. Tenderness in the lumbosacral area was noted, as well as reduced forward flexion. Dr. Wunder concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cFor the recognized and allowed conditions of thoracic and lumbar sprain and strain, he has reached the level of maximum medical improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cI believe further medical treatment for Mr. Hart should be more active than passive. He should be improving his aerobic conditioning of the back and abdominal muscle groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cI would have him avoid heavy lifting and repetitive bending.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cI believe his symptoms will gradually dissipate over time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">{\u00b6 6} A district hearing officer for appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio found that Dr. Wunder\u2019s report supported a finding of MMI and ordered TTC terminated. A staff hearing officer reversed on appeal, writing:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe Staff Hearing Officer finds that there is no credible evidence on file to demonstrate that claimant has reached Maximum Medical Improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe Staff Hearing Officer finds that the opinions of Dr. Wunder that claimant has reached Maximum Medical Improvement and that claimant\u2019s symptoms will gradually dissipate over time are inconsistent and do not support a finding of Maximum Medical Improvement. The Staff Hearing Officer further finds, based upon the prohibition against repetitive bending and heavy lifting in Dr. Wunder\u2019s report in the Functional Capacities Evaluation of Nova Care, that claimant cannot return to work at his former position of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe Staff Hearing Officer further finds that there is presently no medical evidence on file to support the continued payment of temporary total disability compensation. Payment of temporary total compensation may continue upon submission of medical evidence documenting claimant\u2019s inability to return to work due to the allowed conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>{\u00b6 10} Further consideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">{\u00b6 11} Frisch\u2019s filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the commission had abused its discretion in refusing to assess MMI. The court of appeals disagreed, ruling that the commission had not abused its discretion in concluding that Dr. Wunder\u2019s report was not evidence of MMI.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">{\u00b6 12} This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">{\u00b6 13} The commission is solely responsible for interpreting the evidence before it. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. This prerogative empowers it to adopt one of two plausible readings of a report and to disqualify that report \u2014 based on the commission\u2019s reading \u2014 as internally inconsistent. <em>State ex rel. Copeland Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 238, 559 N.E.2d 1310; <em>State ex rel. Lopez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 445, 633 N.E.2d 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">{\u00b6 14} MMI is defined as \u201ca treatment plateau (static or well-stabilized) at which no fundamental functional or physiological change can be expected within reasonable medical probability in spite of continuing medical or rehabilitative procedures.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(A)(l). The commission found that Dr. Wunder\u2019s anticipation of eventual dissipation of symptoms contradicted his assertion that claimant had reached MMI. We find this conclusion to be within the commission\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">{\u00b6 15} We are not persuaded by Frisch\u2019s reliance on <em>State ex rel. Brown v. Indus. Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-108, 2002-Ohio-4313, 2002 WL 1937596. The issue in <em>Brown </em>\u2014 unlike here \u2014 was not an evidentiary one. It instead pitted the commission\u2019s declaration of MMI against the authorization of further treatment by claimant\u2019s managed-care organization. Distinguishing between the differing goals of rehabilitative treatment and treatment to achieve fundamental function or physiological change, the court of appeals rejected claimant\u2019s argument that MMI and continued treatment are irreconcilable, and properly so. A finding of MMI has never \u2014 nor should it ever \u2014 automatically bar further treatment in a claim. Conversely, authorization of further treatment does not automatically foreclose an MMI declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">{\u00b6 16} The situation before us is vastly different. Distinctions between treatment goals do not change the contradiction between Dr. Wunder\u2019s assessment of MMI and his belief that a symptomatic claimant would eventually be symptom-free. We do not, therefore, find that the commission abused its evidentiary discretion in finding a fatal inconsistency between these two conclusions. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>ingly, we uphold the commission\u2019s disqualification of Dr. Wunder\u2019s report as evidence of MMI.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A3m\">Taft, Stettinius &amp; Hollister, L.L.P., and Charles M.
