In his complaint as subsequently amended, Scruggs requested a writ of mandamus to compel appellees, Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Lisa L. Sadler and Franklin County Municipal Court Judge Michael T. Brandt, to comply with Crim.R. 41(D) by providing copies of certain records, including the search warrant and inventory list of a November 12, 1998 search and seizure at 1973 Denune Avenue in Columbus, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">{\u00b6 2} On March 19, 2002, the court of appeals granted Judge Sadler\u2019s motion to dismiss her as a respondent, denied Judge Brandt\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, and returned the cause to the court magistrate for further proceedings. On appeal, because not all of the claims had been adjudicated, we dismissed the appeal for lack of a final appealable order. <em>State ex rel. Scruggs v. Sadler, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 78, 2002-Ohio-5315, 776 N.E.2d 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">{\u00b6 3} In December 2002, Judge Brandt moved for summary judgment. Attached to the motion were certified copies of all records on file in the clerks\u2019 offices of the municipal and common pleas courts concerning the November 12, 1998 search and seizure at 1973 Denune Avenue. On January 17, 2003, the magistrate recommended that the court of appeals grant Judge Brandt\u2019s motion and deny the writ. The magistrate reasoned, \u201cBecause the documents requested in the complaint are now in relator\u2019s possession, and there is no evidence to suggest that other documents exist as requested in the complaint, there can be no legal duty to produce further documents, and a writ of mandamus cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>issued.\u201d Although he objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision, Scruggs admitted that he had \u201cno objection to the dismissal of Judge Brandt and the action being declared resolved\u201d and that his \u201crequest was made and fulfilled.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AXX\">Leo E.

Chapnick v. E. Cleveland City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 449, 451, 755 N.E.2d 883, quoting <em>State ex rel. Jones v. O\u2019Connor </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 426, 704 N.E.2d 1223. Judge Brandt\u2019s proffer of the requested records rendered Scruggs\u2019s mandamus claim moot. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer, Div. of Gannett Satellite Info. Network, Inc. v. Dupuis, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 126, 2002-Ohio-7041, 781 N.E.2d 163, \u00b6 8 (\u201cIn general, the provision of requested records to a relator in a public-records mandamus case renders the mandamus claim moot\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">{\u00b6 6} Moreover, Scruggs waived new claims that he raises on appeal by failing to plead them in his original or amended petition. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. R.W. Sidley, Inc. v. Crawford, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 113, 2003-Ohio-5101, 796 N.E.2d 929, \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b317-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
