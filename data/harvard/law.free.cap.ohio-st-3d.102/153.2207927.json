Jordan Jr., broke his left wrist at work on September 28, 2000. Appellee-employer Ford Motor Company thereafter offered \u2014 and claimant accepted \u2014 a light-duty job at the same hourly wage as before. Unlike his prior job, however, claimant, for reasons yet to be determined, received substantially less overtime, despite an absence of medical restrictions limiting the number of hours he could work. Consequently, claimant\u2019s weekly earnings were usually less than those before his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">{\u00b6 2} Claimant eventually moved for wage-loss compensation pursuant to R.C. 4123.56(B). A district hearing officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) for appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio denied the application, finding no causal relationship between claimant\u2019s injury and his reduced hours. Without explaining, the DHO said simply that \u201c[a]ny loss of overtime would appear to be related to any number of factors.\u201d A staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) also denied the application, but for other reasons. In an ambiguous order, the SHO suggested the absence of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>actual wage loss in citing a lack of evidence that others in claimant\u2019s former position of employment were still receiving overtime. She also, however, mentioned a lack of evidence that claimant would have accepted overtime if offered, implying no causal relationship between wage loss and injury. Further consideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">{\u00b6 3} Claimant petitioned the Court of Appeals for Franklin County for a writ of mandamus, claiming that the commission had abused its discretion in denying his request for compensation. The court of appeals, speaking through its magistrate, noted that \u201cthe record includes no evidence to show <em>why </em>claimant did not receive overtime hours.\u201d Rather than order the commission to reconsider the application, however, the court denied the writ, prompting claimant\u2019s appeal to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">{\u00b6 4} Compensation for wage loss demands actual wage loss and a causal connection to injury. <em>State ex rel. Watts v. Schottenstein Stores Corp. </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 118, 623 N.E.2d 1202. The commission\u2019s denial is conflicting, drifting between suggestions of no actual wage loss and no causal relationship. The court of appeals upheld the commission\u2019s order, but clearly on the basis of no causal relationship. For the reasons to follow, we reverse that judgment and order the commission to conduct further proceedings and issue an amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">{\u00b6 5} The parties agree that claimant was making approximately $1,300 per week when injured. He quickly took light-duty work with the same employer at the same $22.23 hourly rate as before. From these numbers, it follows that if the claimant was earning $1,300 weekly, he was working considerable overtime to get it.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">{\u00b6 6} During the disputed period, claimant worked minimal overtime with a commensurate decline in earnings, and it is around this that controversy revolves. The commission\u2019s order implied that no wage loss existed, based on the absence of evidence that others in claimant\u2019s former classification were still receiving overtime during that period. Claimant assails that reasoning, citing <em>State ex rel. Bos v. Navistar Internatl. Transp. Corp. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 314, 738 N.E.2d 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">{\u00b6 7} <em>Bos </em>involved a claimant whose former associates apparently received a raise after injury forced claimant into a lower-paying assignment. The commission refused to compare claimant\u2019s post-injury earnings with those of his fellow employees to calculate wage-loss differential, and the court of appeals upheld the order. We did not, however, address this holding, confining our analysis instead to the novel wage-averaging proposal raised in Navistar\u2019s sole proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">{\u00b6 8} <em>Bos </em>does not, therefore, advance claimant\u2019s argument, but that does not detract from his position\u2019s overall viability. Ohio Adm.Code 4125-1-01(F) prescribes the claimant\u2019s average weekly wage as the preinjury benchmark against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>which to compare post-injury earnings. Therefore, any changes to what claimant could have been making had he remained at his former position of employment\u2014 via raises or overtime \u2014 are irrelevant. <em>Bos </em>renders even less germane <em>to the question of actual wage loss </em>the earnings of others and the amount of their underlying overtime. The commission thus abused its discretion to the extent that it attempted to assess claimant\u2019s wage loss by comparing it to the overtime available to those in his former position.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ap4\">Gallon &amp; Takacs Co., L.P.A., and Theodore A.

Hufstader, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee Industrial Commission.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">{\u00b6 9} Actual wage loss is, of course, inconsequential absent a causal relationship to claimant\u2019s allowed conditions. The DHO specifically found no causal relationship between the industrial injury and reduced wages, but the SHO adopted completely different reasoning in denying claimant\u2019s wage-loss application. The SHO having found no actual wage loss, the question of causal relationship became moot, and the SHO went no further. She did offhandedly refer to a lack of evidence that \u201cclaimant would have accepted such overtime if offered,\u201d but that is not entirely accurate. Claimant\u2019s preinjury pattern of routinely performing overtime, at a minimum, suggests his willingness to accept overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">{\u00b6 10} Acceptance, however, is predicated on overtime being offered, and, on this, the commission is silent. Two key questions thus remain unaddressed. First, was overtime offered? If it was and was declined, claimant\u2019s refusal\u2014 unless supported by medical restrictions on the number of hours claimant could work \u2014 would break the requisite causal connection. Second, if it was not offered, then why not? If, for example, overtime was rescinded on a plantwide basis for economic reasons, then again there would be no causal connection. If, however, the employer singled out claimant because of his injury, a causal relationship between injury and wage loss could be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">{\u00b6 11} For these reasons, further consideration of the question of causal relationship is warranted. The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause is returned to the commission for further proceedings and an amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b311-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
