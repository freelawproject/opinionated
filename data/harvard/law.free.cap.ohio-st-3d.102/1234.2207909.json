We conclude that they may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">{\u00b6 2} Last year, we permanently disbarred Toledo attorney Richard M. Neller. See <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Neller, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 314, 2003-Ohio-774, 784 N.E.2d 689. In accordance with that disbarment order, we directed Neller to take various steps to terminate his law practice. Included in this court\u2019s March 5, 2003 order to Neller is this language:</p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cIt is further ordered that * * * respondent shall:</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b662-14\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c6. File with the Clerk and the Disciplinary Counsel * * * an <em>affidavit </em>showing compliance with this order * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-15\">{\u00b6 6} The quoted language tracks the requirements of Gov.Bar R. V(8)(E)(3), which describes the duties of a disbarred or suspended attorney. .</p>\n<p id=\"b662-16\">{\u00b6 7} In response to that order, Neller sent to the Clerk of this court in February of this year a signed document that he styled as an \u201caffidavit,\u201d though he did not sign it before a notary or any other person authorized to administer oaths. In the signed \u201caffidavit,\u201d Neller \u201cstates and declares under the penalties of perjury\u201d that the statements in the document are \u201ctrue and correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-17\">{\u00b6 8} The Clerk\u2019s office initially rejected the document because Neller\u2019s signature on it was not notarized. Neller sent the document back to the Clerk, however, insisting that a federal statute recognizes the validity of unsworn documents like the one that he prepared. On February 25, 2004, the Clerk\u2019s office accepted and filed the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>{\u00b6 9} We have now examined the question and conclude that the document does not comply with this court\u2019s order \u2014 and the language in Gov.Bar R. V(8)(E)(3) \u2014 requiring that an \u201caffidavit\u201d be filed by Neller and any other suspended or disbarred attorney in the same situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">\n<em>Ohio Law on Affidavits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">{\u00b6 10} In Ohio, an affidavit \u201cis a written declaration under oath.\u201d R.C. 2319.02. It \u201cmay be made in or out of this state before any person authorized to take depositions.\u201d R.C. 2319.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">{\u00b6 11} Notaries public are of course the persons who most often administer the oaths that appear on affidavits. In Ohio, a \u201cnotary public may, throughout the state, administer oaths required or authorized by law,\u201d R.C. 147.07, and \u201c[n]o notary public shall certify to the affidavit of a person without administering the appropriate oath or affirmation to the person.\u201d R.C. 147.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">{\u00b6 12} Anyone who knowingly makes a false statement that is \u201csworn or affirmed before a notary public or another person empowered to administer oaths\u201d can be prosecuted under R.C. 2921.13(A)(6) for the first-degree misdemeanor crime of falsification, while a knowing and material false statement given in an \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d can lead to a felony prosecution under R.C. 2921.11(A) for the crime of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">\n<em>A Different Approach Under Federal Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">{\u00b6 13} Neller points to a federal statute in support of his claim that he need not present a sworn affidavit to the Clerk to comply with this court\u2019s order and Gov.Bar R. V(8)(E)(3). That federal statute \u2014 Section 1746, Title 28, U.S.Code\u2014 says:</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u2018Wherever, under any law of the United States or under any rule, regulation, order, or requirement made pursuant to law, any matter is required or permitted to be * * * established * * * by the sworn * * * statement, oath, or affidavit, in writing of the person making the same * * *, such matter may, with like force and effect, be * * * established * * * by the unsworn * * * statement ] in writing of such person which is subscribed by him, as true under penalty of perjury, and dated, in substantially the following form:</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(2) If executed within the United States * * *: T declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">(Signature).\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">{\u00b6 17} As Neller suggests, that federal statute is indeed a valid provision, and it is cited in a number of other federal statutes and rules. See, e.g., Section 1621(2), Title 18, U.S.Code (imposing penalties for perjury on those who make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>material false statements in a document signed \u201cunder penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28\u201d); U.S.Sup.Ct.R. 29(2) and (5)(c) (describing filing and service requirements for documents sent to the Supreme Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">{\u00b6 18} And the federal circuit and district courts have readily accepted for many years the kinds of documents that Neller has presented to this court. See, e.g., <em>Peters v. Lincoln Elec. Co. </em>(C.A.6, 2002), 285 F.3d 456, 475 (noting that the federal statute \u201callows for \u2018unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury\u2019 to support any matter that legally requires an affidavit to support it\u201d); <em>Hameed v. Pundt </em>(S.D.N.Y.1997), 964 F.Supp. 836, 840-841 (citing the federal statute in relying on unsworn documents to grant summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">{\u00b6 19} Yet the legislative history of the federal statute indicates that the law was designed \u201cto permit the use in <em>Federal </em>proceedings of unsworn declarations given under penalty of perjury in lieu of affidavits.\u201d (Emphasis added.) H.R.Rep. No. 94-1616, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5644. That legislative history tracks the text of the federal statute itself, which allows the use of unsworn declarations in lieu of sworn affidavits when affidavits would otherwise be required or permitted by \u201cany law of the <em>United States\u201d </em>(emphasis added), or any other \u201crule, regulation, order, or requirement made pursuant to law.\u201d Section 1746, Title 28, U.S. Code. That language in the statute indicates that Congress intended to change <em>federal </em>law but leave the states free to set their own policies concerning affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">{\u00b6 20} As for the purpose of the federal statute that Congress enacted and President Ford signed in 1976, the legislative history explains that \u201c[t]he requirement that the person who signs an affidavit must appear before a notary and be sworn can be inconvenient.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 94-1616, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5644, 5645. The law is therefore designed to \u201cprovide[ ] an alternative to affidavits and sworn documents.\u201d Id. at 5645.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">{\u00b6 21} While Congress is certainly entitled to its view that appearing before a notary to sign an affidavit is an unnecessary inconvenience, the states have by no means universally embraced the idea. To be sure, several states have either adopted the federal statute outright or have enacted statutes that achieve the same result. See, e.g., Fla.Stat.Ann. 92.525 (2004); Nev.Rev.Stat. 53.045 (2001); W.Va.Code 39-1-10a (2004). Ohio, however, has never recognized any exception to the statutory requirement that a valid affidavit must be a \u201cwritten declaration under oath.\u201d R.C. 2319.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">{\u00b6 22} In fact, this court has repeatedly explained \u2014 both before and after the 1976 enactment of the federal statute \u2014 that an \u201caffidavit\u201d must be a sworn statement. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 463, 2002-Ohio-2481, 768 N.E.2d 1176, \u00b6 5 (holding that unnotarized statements attached to a prisoner\u2019s complaint did not meet the relevant statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>affidavit requirement); <em>In re Disqualification of Pokorny </em>(1992), 74 Ohio St.3d 1238, 657 N.E.2d 1345 (\u201cA paper purporting to be an affidavit, but not to have been sworn to before an officer, is not an affidavit\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Coulverson v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 12, 14, 577 N.E.2d 352 (an \u201c \u2018affidavit\u2019 * * * not sworn before anyone authorized to give oaths * * * is void\u201d); <em>Benedict v. Peters </em>(1898), 58 Ohio St. 527, 536, 51 N.E. 37 (\u201cThe general rule is that an affidavit must appear on its face to have been taken before the proper officer, and in compliance with all legal requisitions\u201d).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Apj\">Richard Neller, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">\n<em>Neller\u2019s \u2018Affidavit\u201d Must Be Stricken</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">{\u00b6 23} When Neller presented to the Clerk of this court an unsworn declaration \u201cunder the penalties of perjury,\u201d he failed to comply with the court\u2019s express order that he provide an \u201caffidavit\u201d to the Clerk. That directive echoes the affidavit requirement imposed on all similarly suspended or disbarred attorneys by Gov.Bar R. V(8)(E)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">{\u00b6 24} Our rejection today of Neller\u2019s filing, and our enforcement instead of a strict and traditional reading of the term \u201caffidavit,\u201d is consistent with this court\u2019s longstanding insistence that only a written declaration made under oath before a proper officer qualifies as an \u201caffidavit.\u201d Because the General Assembly has never done what Congress has done in this area \u2014 enact a provision recognizing the legal validity of unsworn declarations made under penalty of perjury \u2014 we cannot accept the \u201caffidavit\u201d that Neller presented to the Clerk in February.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">{\u00b6 25} For the reasons explained above, the document presented by Richard M. Neller and accepted by the Clerk of this court on February 25, 2004, is hereby rejected and stricken from this court\u2019s files. Neller remains bound by Gov.Bar R. V(8)(E)(3), as well as this court\u2019s March 5, 2003 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b665-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

This issue is not worthy of the paper it has consumed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
