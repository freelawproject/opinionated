We conclude that it does not. We are also asked to determine whether a previously decided civil rights action necessarily precludes a party from seeking monetary damages before SERB. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">{\u00b6 2} In <em>Ft. Frye Teachers Assn., OEA/NEA v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 392, 396-397, 692 N.E.2d 140 <em>{\u201cFort Frye I\u201d), </em>this court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cIn their federal action, [Fort Frye Teachers Association, OEA/NEA, and Michael Rauch] sought damages for the School Board\u2019s violation of Rauch\u2019s freedom of association rights. The material issue was whether the School Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>nonrenewed Rauch\u2019s contract in retaliation for his exercise of the right to associate as protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The underlying facts substantiating the School Board\u2019s retaliatory motive centered around Rauch\u2019s union activities. The test for determining whether a violation of First Amendment rights, including associational rights, has occurred is found in <em>Mt Healthy City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Doyle </em>(1977), 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471. This case sets forth a \u201cbut for\u201d test for establishing that an employee\u2019s exercise of First Amendment rights was violated by employer retaliation. [Footnote omitted.] This standard is a much stricter standard than Ohio\u2019s standard to determine whether an unfair labor practice charge has occurred. (See <em>[State Emp. Relations Bd. v.] Adena [Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1993) ], 66 Ohio St.3d at 495-497, 613 N.E.2d at 613-614, where we rejected the <em>Mt. Healthy </em>\u201cbut for\u201d test applicable to First Amendment rights and established the \u201cin part\u201d test applicable to unfair labor practice proceedings. However, both standards revolve around the same factual issue, the employer\u2019s motivation.)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cSimilarly, in the state administrative action, the material issue was whether the School Board nonrenewed Rauch\u2019s contract in retaliation for his exercise of rights protected by R.C. Chapter 4117. As such, the essential facts regarding this issue concerned the same union activities engaged in by Rauch that were relied upon by the jury in the federal action. Since the same evidence would prove the underlying facts in each of these two proceedings, the issues are the same for purposes of applying the collateral estoppel doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cWe find that the collateral estoppel requirements have been satisfied. Thus, we conclude that the court of appeals properly applied collateral estoppel to the issue of the employer\u2019s motivation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">{\u00b6 6} This court- concluded that on the finding regarding an \u201cemployer\u2019s motivation,\u201d established and not adequately rebutted in the federal action, the parties were collaterally estopped, and, therefore, the issue could not be further litigated on remand. Id., 81 Ohio St.3d at 397, 692 N.E.2d 140. Because an improper employer motivation \u201craises a presumption of antiunion animus,\u201d we impliedly considered that issue dispositive as to whether a ULP had occurred. Id., 81 Ohio St.3d at 394, 692 N.E.2d 140, fn. 2. See <em>Adena, </em>66 Ohio St.3d 485, 613 N.E.2d 605, paragraph two of the syllabus. Nevertheless, we remanded the issue to SERB because it has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to decide whether unfair labor practices have occurred.\u201d <em>Fort Frye I, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 394, 692 N.E.2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">{\u00b6 7} On remand, SERB dismissed the ULP complaint. Fort Frye Teachers Association and Rauch appealed from this decision to the Washington County Court of Common Pleas, which reversed SERB\u2019S dismissal pursuant to this court\u2019s holding in <em>Fort Frye I. </em>The common pleas court remanded the case to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>SERB with an order that it find a ULP to have occurred. The common pleas court also held that the federal jury\u2019s determination of Rauch\u2019s damages was res judicata and that Rauch could not further litigate that issue. SERB appealed from the order that it was collaterally estopped from finding that a ULP had not occurred. Fort Frye Teachers Association and Rauch cross-appealed from the determination that the damages issue was res judicata. The Fourth District Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court. All parties appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">{\u00b6 8} The case is now before this court upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">{\u00b6 9} SERB\u2019S exclusive jurisdiction does not authorize SERB to overlook our determination that a dispositive issue is precluded from being rebutted. Out of respect for its exclusive jurisdiction in the matter, we did not direct SERB to make a specific ruling. Nevertheless, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, which held, \u201cSERB was required to find that the School Board nonrenewed Rauch\u2019s teaching contract based in part upon Rauch\u2019s union activities. Because nonrenewal of a contract based upon an employee\u2019s union activities constitutes a ULP, SERB was likewise required to conclude that a ULP occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">{\u00b6 10} We now consider whether the issue of damages is also precluded. Collateral estoppel \u201cprecludes the relitigation of an issue that has been \u2018actually and necessarily litigated and determined in a prior action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Krahn v. Kinney </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 103, 107, 538 N.E.2d 1058, quoting <em>Goodson v. McDonough Poiver Equip., Inc. </em>(1983), 2 Ohio St.3d 193, 195, 2 OBR 732, 443 N.E.2d 978. As previously noted, in their federal civil rights action, appellants and cross-appellees \u201csought damages for the School Board\u2019s violation of Rauch\u2019s freedom of association rights.\u201d <em>Fort Frye I, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 396, 692 N.E.2d 140. In this case, appellants and cross-appellees seek damages for the School Board\u2019s commission of a ULP. R.C. 4117.11 and 4117.12. Nothing in the record suggests that the issue of damages caused by the ULP was \u201c \u2018actually and necessarily litigated and determined in a prior action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Krahn, </em>43 Ohio St.3d at 107, 538 N.E.2d 1058, quoting <em>Goodson, </em>2 Ohio St.3d at 195, 2 OBR 732, 443 N.E.2d 978. Accordingly, the issue of monetary damages is not precluded, and we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">{\u00b6 11} We remand the cause to SERB for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A4r\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Cloppert, Latanick, Sauter &amp; Washburn, William J.

Chapter 4117.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>Fort Frye I, </em>I joined a dissent authored by Justice Cook in which she concluded that \u201ccollateral estoppel should not apply to mixed-motive cases under SERB\u2019S jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Fort Frye Teachers Assn., OEA/NEA v. State Employment Relations Bd. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 392, 398, 692 N.E.2d 140 (Cook, J., dissenting). I continue to adhere to that well-reasoned dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">{\u00b6 14} I write here to re-emphasize my belief that requiring SERB to find that a ULP occurred based on the federal jury\u2019s determination that the school board violated Rauch\u2019s First Amendment rights encroaches upon SERB\u2019S <em>\u201cexclusive jurisdiction </em>to decide matters committed to it pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4117.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Franklin Cty. Law Enforcement Assn. v. Fraternal Order of Police, Capital City Lodge No. 9 </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 167, 572 N.E.2d 87, paragraph one of the syllabus. In this case, SERB issued its initial order finding that the board\u2019s nonrenewal of Rauch\u2019s contract did <em>not </em>result in a ULP on July 22, 1991, which was a month <em>before </em>Rauch even filed his complaint in federal court. By eviscerating SERB\u2019S exclusive jurisdiction to determine a ULP, we permit employees to forum-shop their discrimination claims between federal courts and SERB, a situation that does not represent the intent of the General Assembly in resolving state labor claims. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
