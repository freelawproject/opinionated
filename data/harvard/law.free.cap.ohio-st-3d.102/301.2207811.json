On December 17, 2003, the commission set hearing procedures for the SBC Ohio case and denied SBC Ohio\u2019s request for an increase in interim UNE rates. Id. In <em>Review of SBC Ohio\u2019s TELRIC Costs, </em>at 6-7, the commission stated, \u201cAlthough we are commencing a reexamination of certain TELRIC components as requested by SBC Ohio, we find no reason to adopt interim rates pending resolution of this matter nor to true-up any rates modified through this proceeding, if any, to the date this case was initiated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">{\u00b6 2} On January 16, 2004, SBC Ohio applied for a rehearing of the commission\u2019s decision denying interim rate increases. On that same date, a group of competitive local exchange carriers applied for a rehearing of the commission\u2019s decision setting a procedural schedule for the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">{\u00b6 3} On February 11, 2004, the commission granted the applications \u201cfor the limited purpose of allowing the Commission additional time to consider the issues raised on rehearing.\u201d On February 26, 2004, the commission issued an agenda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>for its March 4, 2004 public meeting. The agenda included the applications for rehearing in case No. 02-1280-TP-UNC.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">{\u00b6 4} On March 1, 2004, relator, Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel (\u201cOCC\u201d), filed this action for a writ of prohibition to prevent respondents, the commission, its chairman, and the commissioners, from granting the applications for rehearing. OCC further requested a finding that the applications had been denied as a matter of law on February 16, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">{\u00b6 5} On March 4, the commission rescheduled consideration of the rehearing application for March 11. On March 5, SBC Ohio moved for an interim rate increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">{\u00b6 6} On March 11, 2004, the commission granted SBC Ohio\u2019s March 5 motion for an interim rate increase and denied the applications for rehearing. The commission denied SBC Ohio\u2019s application for rehearing as moot \u201c[i]n light of [the commission\u2019s] order issued * * * regarding a March 5, 2004 motion for interim rates filed by SBC Ohio in this proceeding.\u201d The commission denied the competitive carriers\u2019 application because the carriers raised arguments that the commission had previously rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">{\u00b6 7} On March 19, 2004, respondents moved to dismiss OCC\u2019s prohibition action. On March 29, OCC filed a memorandum in opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">{\u00b6 8} This cause is now before the court for our S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5) determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">{\u00b6 9} Under S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5), we must determine whether dismissal, an alternative writ, or a peremptory writ is appropriate. <em>State ex rel. Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 447, 449, 727 N.E.2d 900. Dismissal is required if, after presuming the truth of all material factual allegations and making all reasonable inferences in OCC\u2019s favor, it appears beyond doubt that OCC is not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in prohibition. <em>State ex rel. Satow v. Gausse-Milliken, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 479, 2003-Ohio-2074, 786 N.E.2d 1289, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">{\u00b6 10} Respondents contend that the commission\u2019s March 11, 2004 entry rendered OCC\u2019s prohibition claim moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">{\u00b6 11} Respondents initially assert that OCC\u2019s request for a writ of prohibition is moot because the \u201caction OCC sought to prevent has already occurred.\u201d This argument lacks merit. Prohibition is not limited to prevention of <em>future </em>unauthorized judicial or quasi-judicial actions. <em>Hughes v. Calabrese, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 334, 2002-Ohio-2217, 767 N.E.2d 725, \u00b6 15. Therefore, a prohibition action is not necessarily rendered moot when the act sought to be prevented occurs before a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>court can rule on the prohibition claim. <em>State ex rel. Rogers v. McGee Brown </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 408, 410, 686 N.E.2d 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">{\u00b6 12} Nevertheless, as respondents note, the commission has now <em>denied </em>the applications for rehearing. Because OCC sought the writ to prevent the commission from <em>granting </em>the applications, its request appears moot. The commission did not grant the applications for rehearing. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Denton v. Bedinghaus, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 298, 2003-Ohio-861, 784 N.E.2d 99, \u00b6 26 (\u201cto the extent that [relators] sought to prevent a policy that had already been discontinued by [respondents], their prohibition claim was moot\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 13} Furthermore, unlike the relators in <em>Denton, </em>OCC did not expressly challenge the commission\u2019s <em>general practice </em>of granting rehearing applications for the limited purpose of extending its time to review the application. And this practice would not necessarily evade review in the future. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Louden </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 61, 64, 741 N.E.2d 517 (\u201can exception to the mootness doctrine arises when the claims raised are capable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d). Instead, OCC now challenges a separate March 11 action by the commission to grant a March 5, 2004 motion by SBC Ohio for an interim rate increase. This order is not the subject of OCC\u2019s prohibition claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">{\u00b6 14} Therefore, OCC\u2019s prohibition claim is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Prohibition</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">{\u00b6 15} Even if OCC\u2019s claim is not moot, dismissal is still warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">{\u00b6 16} OCC claims that it is entitled to the writ because the commission and its members lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of the applications for rehearing when more than 30 days had passed without a merits decision by the commission. OCC cites R.C. 4903.10, which provides that an application for rehearing is considered denied if the commission does not grant or deny it within 30 days of its filing: \u201cIf the commission does not grant or deny such application for rehearing within thirty days from the date of filing thereof, it is denied by operation of law.\u201d On February 11, 2004, the commission granted the January 16 applications for the limited purpose of giving the commission more time to consider the issues. On March 11 \u2014 more than 30 days after the applications were filed \u2014 the commission denied the applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">{\u00b6 17} In order to be entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in prohibition, OCC had to establish, among other things, that the commission\u2019s exercise of quasi-judicial power in granting the applications for rehearing in limited part was \u201cunauthorized by law\u201d and that \u201cthe denial of the writ will result in injury for which no other adequate remedy exists in the ordinary course of law.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Hunter v. Summit Cty. Human Resource Comm. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 450, 451, 692 N.E.2d 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>{\u00b6 18} For the following reasons, OCC cannot establish these required elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 4903.10 did not expressly preclude the commission from considering the merits of the applications for rehearing. The commission acted within 30 days of the filing of the applications when it granted the applications on February 11 for the limited purpose of allowing additional time to consider them. Nothing in R.C. 4903.10 or precedent specifically prohibited the commission from so proceeding. OCC\u2019s reliance on <em>State ex rel. Gen. Motors Corp. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 111, 4 O.O.3d 241, 362 N.E.2d 1221, to assert otherwise is misplaced. That case involved statutory language that specifically required that a complaint be issued within one year after alleged unlawful discriminatory practices had been committed. There is no comparable express requirement in R.C. 4903.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">{\u00b6 20} Moreover, OCC still had an adequate remedy by application for rehearing. In fact, R.C. 4903.10 <em>explicitly bars </em>OCC from challenging the commission\u2019s orders in any action without first applying for rehearing:</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cNo cause of action arising out of any order of the commission, other than in support of the order, shall accrue in any court to any person, firm, or corporation unless such person, firm, or corporation has made a proper application to the commission for a rehearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">{\u00b6 22} OCC\u2019s complaint lacks any allegation that it applied for a rehearing of the commission\u2019s February 11 order granting the rehearing applications. It is axiomatic that a prohibition claim constitutes a \u201ccause of action.\u201d Consequently, R.C. 4903.10 prevents OCC\u2019s prohibition action because it failed to satisfy the statutory prerequisite for filing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">{\u00b6 23} OCC\u2019s prohibition claim is moot and without merit. It seeks to challenge an action on a commission decision to defer consideration of SBC Ohio\u2019s January 16, 2004 application for rehearing that has since been denied. Therefore, we grant respondents\u2019 motion and dismiss the cause. Our judgment renders moot the motion to intervene as a respondent of Ohio Bell Telephone Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">Cause dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b460-12\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

It is difficult to decipher the commission\u2019s motivations on the sparse facts of this case, but it is less difficult to decipher the path it took to avoid review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">{\u00b6 25} On December 17, 2003, the commission denied SBC\u2019s request for higher interim rates while considering SBC\u2019s application to approximately double its rates for unbundled network elements provided to competitive carriers. On January 16, 2004, SBC Ohio applied for a rehearing of the interim-rate decision. Also on January 16, 2004, competitors of SBC Ohio applied for a rehearing of the commission\u2019s decision setting a procedural schedule on the underlying increase case.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">{\u00b6 26} On February 11, 2004, the commission essentially bought more time, granting the rehearing applications \u201cfor the limited purpose of allowing the Commission additional time to consider the issues raised on rehearing.\u201d On February 26, the commission issued an agenda for its March 4, 2004 public meeting that included a consideration of the applications for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">{\u00b6 27} On March 1, 2004, relator, Ohio Consumer\u2019s Counsel (\u201cOCC\u201d), filed this action in prohibition to prevent the granting of applications for rehearing, since more than 30 days had passed since the applications had been filed. At that point, this court probably made a mistake by not granting OCC\u2019s motion for expedited consideration of the OCC\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">{\u00b6 28} The commission moved quickly after that. On March 4, it rescheduled consideration of the rehearing application for March 11. Then, the next day, SBC Ohio moved for another interim rate increase. On March 11, 2004, the commission granted SBC Ohio\u2019s new motion for an interim rate increase and denied the applications for rehearing. The commission denied SBC\u2019s application as moot and denied the competitive carriers\u2019 application because the carriers raised only arguments that the commission had previously rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">{\u00b6 29} In so ruling, the commission avoided meaningful consideration by this court of the OCC\u2019s prohibition action. The majority in this case holds that the OCC\u2019s prohibition action was mooted because the applications for rehearing were denied, thus precluding this court\u2019s determination of whether they were considered outside the prescribed time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">{\u00b6 30} The commission\u2019s timing suggests that it wanted to allow an interim increase to SBC Ohio but did not want to risk that it would be overturned upon a ruling by this court that the rehearing motion was considered out of rule.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJ4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Janine L. Migden-Ostrander, Consumers\u2019 Counsel, Joseph P. Serio, David C. Bergmann and Terry L. Etter, Assistant Consumers\u2019 Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AVz\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, Duane Luckey, Senior Deputy Attorney General, and Matthew J. Satterwhite, Assistant Attorney General, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">{\u00b6 31} The most interesting fact in this case is that, somehow, SBC Ohio caught on to this and moved for another interim rate increase while its rehearing motion was still pending. Once the new motion was safely filed, the commission ruled on the pending motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">(\u00b6 32} Of course, we are dealing only with appearances here \u2014 there may well be a good reason for the commission\u2019s behavior in this case. But with questions being raised recently regarding the performance and loyalties of the previous Consumer\u2019s Counsel, appearances are important. The public is left to question whether anyone remains to look out for its interests.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
