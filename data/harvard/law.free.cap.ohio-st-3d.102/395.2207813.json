On May 7, 2003, relator, Columbus Bar Association, charged respondent with four counts of having violated the Code of Professional Responsibility. A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the cause and made findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">Count One</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">{\u00b6 2} In 2000, after being referred to respondent by a real estate broker, a client engaged respondent to assist in the sale of her tavern and the transfer of the tavern\u2019s liquor license. Respondent received a $20,000 down payment toward the $80,000 purchase price of the tavern that, pursuant to an escrow agreement, he was to hold in trust until the closing or the parties otherwise authorized disbursement. Respondent failed to have his client sign this agreement and, contrary to provisions of the agreement, respondent transferred $19,500 from the escrow account without authority. Respondent paid these funds by a bank check to the real estate broker who had referred the tavern owner as a client.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">{\u00b6 3} At the hearing, respondent admitted that he had no authority to disburse the funds in escrow, a transfer that paid the broker $11,500 over his $8,000 commission. In explanation, respondent told the panel that the broker had brought him \u201can unbelievable amount of business\u201d and \u201cpressured\u201d him for the money. Respondent also explained, referring to the depression from which he was suffering during this period, that he was \u201cnuts at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>{\u00b6 4} As further evidence of his transgressions, respondent admitted to the panel that although he had received additional payments from the sale of the tavern that were to be deposited in the escrow account, he did not report these receipts to his client, inasmuch as \u201cnobody had asked [him] during that time period to account for anything.\u201d Respondent also admitted that he had written checks \u201cfrom time to time\u201d from his IOLTA account to his law firm\u2019s operating account, using those funds to pay office expenses; that he did not keep a trust ledger of his IOLTA account; and that he did not pay attention to the withdrawals and disbursements registered in bank records for that account.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">{\u00b6 5} Respondent\u2019s client ultimately hired another lawyer, who repeatedly demanded an accounting from respondent as well as the return of the sale proceeds. When respondent did not comply with these demands, the client, with her new attorney, and the buyer of the bar sued him to recover the missing funds. The client\u2019s suit against respondent has since been settled and dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">{\u00b6 6} The panel found from these facts that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(4) (barring conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting conduct adversely reflecting on an attorney\u2019s fitness to practice), 6-101(A)(l) (prohibiting an attorney from accepting employment for which the attorney is not professionally competent), 6-101(A)(3) (prohibiting neglect of an entrusted legal matter), 7-101(A)(l) (requiring an attorney to seek client\u2019s lawful objectives), 7-101(A)(3) (prohibiting an attorney from damaging or prejudicing a client during their professional relationship), 9-102(A) (prohibiting commingling of attorney and client funds), 9-102(B)(l) (requiring prompt notification that an attorney has received client\u2019s funds), 9-102(B)(3) (requiring an attorney to maintain complete records of client funds and render appropriate accounts), and 9-102(B)(4) (requiring an attorney to promptly deliver funds to which a client is entitled).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Count Two</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">{\u00b6 7} After the Count One client filed a grievance, respondent repeatedly ignored relator\u2019s requests for information during the investigation of this misconduct. Respondent ultimately supplied the requested information, but the investigation was significantly delayed due to respondent\u2019s early failures to respond. The panel found that respondent had thereby violated Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (requiring an attorney\u2019s assistance in a disciplinary investigation) and DR 1-102(A)(5) (barring conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Count Three</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">{\u00b6 8} Another client retained respondent to represent her in a personal injury claim arising from the client\u2019s August 1998 fall in a department store. Respondent notified the store\u2019s insurance carrier that he was representing the client and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>without requesting any discovery, negotiated a settlement in early May 2002, just a few days before the scheduled trial date. The parties settled the client\u2019s claim for $25,000, an amount somewhat higher than respondent\u2019s client had initially agreed to accept. On May 7, 2002, the attorney for the department store sent the settlement check directly to respondent even though she had not yet received written confirmation of the agreement. At the hearing, the attorney told the panel that she had acted quickly, although she later regretted having been so accommodating, because respondent had been \u201calmost screaming or yelling\u201d on the telephone at her about where the check was.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">{\u00b6 9} Respondent\u2019s client was desperate for money and had expected to be compensated soon after the settlement date; however, respondent did not immediately notify her that he had received the settlement check. The client called respondent repeatedly about the settlement proceeds, finally reaching him on June 2, 2002. At that time, respondent told his client that he did not have the check and that she just had to be patient. At the hearing, the client testified that following their telephone call, she had \u201ccried for about two hours.\u201d The next morning, the client called the department store\u2019s insurance company and learned that the settlement check had been sent to respondent the month before.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">{\u00b6 10} Despite what he told his client on June 2, respondent had not only received the settlement check, he had also endorsed the check for the client without her knowledge and deposited it in his IOLTA account. The client did not receive any portion of the settlement proceeds until she met with respondent on July 1, 2002. On that day, the client signed a settlement agreement providing for respondent\u2019s receipt of $8,333.33 in legal fees and accepted a check for the balance of the settlement. According to her panel testimony, the client acquiesced in this arrangement because she was afraid that it was the only way she would get any money.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">{\u00b6 11} After receipt, the client immediately attempted to cash the settlement check. She quickly discovered that the check could not be honored due to insufficient funds, and more than a week passed before she was able to get her money. At the hearing, respondent was asked why he had waited <em>a </em>full two months before giving his client her share of the settlement proceeds. He replied, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t I pay her the money? Well, the main reason was that the money was not in the IOLTA account, but the other complicating factor was that I was still just out of my mind, trying to get my life back together and all my matters just really didn\u2019t get taken care of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">{\u00b6 12} Respondent also compromised this client\u2019s efforts to declare bankruptcy. During the period that respondent represented her in the personal injury case, the client retained another attorney to file a bankruptcy petition on her behalf. The bankruptcy attorney was unable, despite repeated attempts, to get any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>information from respondent about the client\u2019s personal injury claim. As a result, the bankruptcy attorney checked area courts for any record of the personal injury claim and, because respondent did not file it until later, the attorney found nothing. Thus, in the petition she filed on June 19, 2000, the bankruptcy attorney did not list the personal injury action. The client was discharged in bankruptcy in January 2001, but according to the bankruptcy trustee, the client\u2019s discharge might have to be revoked because of the undisclosed personal injury claim she had when she filed her bankruptcy petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">{\u00b6 13} The panel found on these facts that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-1Q2(A)(6), 6~101(A)(3), 7-101(A)(l), 7-101(A)(3), 7-102(A)(7) (barring an attorney from assisting a client to act illegally or fraudulently), 9-102(A), 9-102(B)(1), 9-102(B)(3), and 9-102(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Count Four</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">{\u00b6 14} In 1999, respondent represented a third client, who was sued by a tenant seeking the return of a security deposit. Respondent filed an answer and counterclaim on his client\u2019s behalf, charging that the tenant had damaged the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">{\u00b6 15} Respondent never responded to interrogatories propounded during discovery by the tenant\u2019s attorney. Eventually, the court entered a default judgment against respondent\u2019s client on the tenant\u2019s counterclaim because respondent had not, even after a court order, complied with the tenant\u2019s discovery requests. The court awarded damages and also ordered respondent and his client to pay legal fees and expenses as sanctions, a judgment that grew, with interest, to $10,173.63. In the meantime, the Franklin County Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment against respondent and his client, in part because respondent had not filed a transcript of the trial court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">{\u00b6 16} Respondent freely admitted his neglect of this client\u2019s interests and told the client, who ultimately paid the judgment in full, that he \u201cwould take care of\u2019 the judgment against her. Around April 1, 2003, after his client had filed her grievance with relator, respondent gave the client a $12,000 promissory note and a check in the amount of $1,000 as a first partial payment on the debt. The check bounced. Not until later that month did respondent actually remit the first installment. Respondent was apparently also late with the second installment and, as of the panel hearing on July 31, 2003, he had not paid either the June or July 2003 installments. Respondent, who did not immediately disclose to this client his lack of malpractice insurance, also executed a third mortgage on his house to the client that he claimed secured the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">{\u00b6 17} The panel found from these facts that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(5), 1-102(A)(6), 1-104 (requiring an attorney to disclose insufficient mal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>practice insurance), 6-101(A)(l), 6-101(A)(2) (requiring adequate preparation in a legal matter), 6-101(A)(3), 7-101(A)(1), 7-101(A)(2) (requiring an attorney to carry out a contract for employment), 7-101(A)(3), 9-102(B)(l), 9-102(B)(3), and 9-102(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">{\u00b6 18} In recommending a sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct, the panel considered the aggravating and mitigating elements of respondent\u2019s case. See Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proe.Reg.\u201d). Relator argued to the panel that respondent\u2019s case presented \u201coverwhelming evidence of multiple instances of serious misconduct over a lengthy period and the lack of any substantial mitigating behavior.\u201d Relator recommended that respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">{\u00b6 19} After admitting nearly all of the misconduct charged against him, respondent described how he had plunged into a deep depression and alcohol abuse culminating in an attempted suicide on December 13, 2001. In mitigation of his misconduct, respondent recounted:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cI\u2019ve seen the gates of hell. * * * [N]ever in my life did I expect to ever be before a panel of distinguished judges explaining myself as to misdeeds against the Supreme Court rules. I have committed misdeeds. I have admitted them * * * many times.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cMy practice took off in the mid \u201990s. I took cases nobody else wanted. When lawyers had cases that were too messy, too small, they didn\u2019t want, they gave them to me. And I had a pretty good practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe pressure became overwhelming, the litigation, the contracts, the divorce disputes, the clients calling all hours of the day wanting things done, and I developed an alcohol problem. The alcohol problem or heredity, for whatever reason, I also suffered from depression, severe depression. It all manifested itself in a suicide attempt, December of 2001.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">{\u00b6 23} The panel found compelling the corroborating testimony of respondent\u2019s wife, who described the drastic changes in respondent\u2019s behavior that had taken place in 2001. He was sick in bed much of the time, drank heavily, and no longer conscientiously answered telephone calls when he did go to work. Also in 2001, respondent had immersed himself in volunteer activities in what his wife thought was an escape from dealing with the overwhelming financial problems and other responsibilities of his practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">{\u00b6 24} After his suicide attempt, respondent was hospitalized for four days. Upon his release, respondent intermittently saw a psychiatrist and psychologist and was treated with medication. Respondent was not satisfied with his progress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>under medical care, and during July 2002, he had what appeared to his wife to be a significant relapse. At that time, respondent and his wife discussed taking a different approach. Respondent\u2019s wife testified, answering respondent\u2019s questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cAnd we just kind of finally sat down together and decided that we had to come to terms with this, that the past two and a half years had been living a nightmare, like nothing we\u2019d ever known, and we wanted to get back to the way things were. So you became very dedicated in talking to people and reading about depression and finding out everything that could be done aside from medication to try to alleviate it, and exercising regularly and talking more openly with me about things that had gone on and were going on in your business and not trying to handle all of that yourself. And the last year has been remarkable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">{\u00b6 26} Respondent\u2019s wife also described how he had stopped drinking completely, which at the time of the panel hearing had been for 13 months. In the meantime, she said, respondent had returned to being the responsible, sober, ethical, trustworthy, and honest person he used to be. In response to questions by panel members, respondent\u2019s wife acknowledged that his recovery efforts had been undertaken without much medical supervision but explained that this was due, in part, to their family\u2019s distressed financial situation. She assured the panel that she and respondent were receptive to any assistance medical professionals could provide. In closing argument to the panel, respondent presented heartfelt statements about his devotion to his wife and children and family, and assured the panel that whatever resulted from the disciplinary proceedings, he would sustain his recovery because of his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">{\u00b6 27} The panel recommended that respondent\u2019s license to practice law be suspended for a term of two years, with the second year stayed, subject to the conditions (1) that during at least the first year of the suspension, respondent actively participate in the Lawyers Support System of the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program (\u201cOLAP\u201d); (2) that during at least the first year of the suspension, respondent submit to a counseling and treatment program recommended by a licensed health care professional to manage his depression; (3) that during at least the first year of the suspension, respondent properly administer medications as prescribed; and (4) that before filing any petition for reinstatement to the practice of law, respondent present evidence to relator that he has met all of the foregoing conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">{\u00b6 28} The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct and found an additional violation of DR 5-107(B) (prohibiting an attorney from accepting direction from a person who referred the client) as to Count One. Consistent with relator\u2019s suggestion, however, the board recommended that respondent\u2019s law license be indefinitely suspended. With this recommendation, the board sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>to allow respondent, with the assistance of OLAP or a similar program, to obtain a mental illness professional\u2019s diagnosis of his medical condition, undergo successful medical treatment, and receive a prognosis demonstrating his ability to return to the ethical and competent practice of law. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(G).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A3-\">Michael J. Hardesty, Barbara J. Petrella, Bruce A. Campbell, Bar Counsel, and Jill M. Snitcher McQuain, Assistant Bar Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AbX\">Gregory Darwin Port, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">{\u00b6 29} Upon review, we agree that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(5), 1-102(A)(6), 1-104, 5-107(B), 6- 101(A)(1), 6-101(A)(2); 6-101(A)(3), 7-101(A)(1), 7-101(A)(2), 7-101(A)(3), 7-102(A)(7), 9-102(A), 9-102(B)(l), 9-102(B)(3), and 9-102(B)(4) and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G), as found by the board. Respondent repeatedly neglected entrusted legal matters, deceived his clients, and failed to cooperate in the investigation of his misconduct. This combination of misconduct warrants an indefinite suspension of respondent\u2019s law license. <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Clavner, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 53, 2003-Ohio-2464, 788 N.E.2d 1065; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Golden, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 230, 2002-Ohio-5934, 778 N.E.2d 564. In, fact, respondent\u2019s misappropriation of a client\u2019s funds, in the absence of any extenuating circumstance, is cause for his disbarment. <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Dixon, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 490, 2002-Ohio-2490, 769 N.E.2d 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">{\u00b6 30} The board, however, was obviously moved by the lay testimony suggesting that respondent has suffered from mental disability from which he seems capable of recovery. This evidence does not establish the mitigating effect of respondent\u2019s disability to the extent specified in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g)\u00ae through (iv), which requires a professional diagnosis of the attorney\u2019s condition, proof that the condition contributed to the misconduct, proof that the condition has been treated with success, and a professional prognosis for the attorney\u2019s competent and ethical return to the practice of law. However, on the chance that respondent might, in time, regain the capacity to practice law in accordance with the standards of this profession, we accept the board\u2019s recommendation to indefinitely suspend him.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">{\u00b6 31} Accordingly, respondent is hereby indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b557-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
