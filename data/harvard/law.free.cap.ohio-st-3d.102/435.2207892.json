The court of appeals reversed, concluding that the state had \u201cfailed to prove an essential element of the offense charged \u2014 the making of a contribution to a political party as a result of Conese\u2019s pressure.\u201d We are asked to determine whether it is possible to be convicted of coercing a political contribution when no political contribution is made. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-16\">{\u00b6 2} R.C. 2921.43(C) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-17\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cNo person for the benefit of a political party, campaign committee, legislative campaign fund, political action committee, or political contributing entity shall coerce any contribution in consideration of either of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>{\u00b6 4} \u201c(1) Appointing or securing, maintaining, or renewing the appointment of any person to any public office, employment, or agency;</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">(\u00b6 5} \u201c(2) Preferring, or maintaining the status of, any public employee with respect to compensation, duties, placement, location, promotion, or other material aspects of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">{\u00b6 6} Former R.C. 2905.12(A) stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cNo person, with purpose to coerce another into taking or refraining from action concerning which he has a legal freedom of choice, shall do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(1) Threaten to commit any offense;</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(2) Utter or threaten any calumny against any person;</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(3) Expose or threaten to expose any matter tending to subject any person to hatred, contempt, or ridicule, or to damage his personal or business repute, or to impair his credit;</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(4) Institute or threaten criminal proceedings against any person;</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(5) Take or withhold, or threaten to take or withhold official action, or cause or threaten to cause official action to be taken or withheld.\u201d 1972 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 511, 134 Ohio Laws, Part II, 1905. (The current version includes gender-neutral changes but is substantively the same. 2002 Am.Sub. H.B. No. 490.)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">{\u00b6 13} Coercion does not require that the person being coerced take or refrain from action because of the coercive conduct. Rather, coercion occurs when a person, among other things, threatens another with the purpose of coercing the other into taking or refraining from action, irrespective of how the person threatened responds to the threat. The 1973 Legislative Service Commission comment to 1972 Am.Sub. H.B. No. 511, which enacted R.C. 2905.12, states that the \u201cgist of [R.C. 2905.12] is a threat made to force another into doing or refraining from something concerning which he has a legal freedom of choice.\u201d We conclude that the General Assembly\u2019s use of \u201ccoerce\u201d in R.C. 2921.43(C) encompasses this consideration. Accordingly, we hold that when a threat is made with the purpose to coerce another into taking or refraining from taking action concerning which that person has a legal freedom of choice, the person threatening \u201ccoerces\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2921.43(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the conviction. We remand to the trial court for execution of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b593-5\">Moyer, C.J., Farmer, Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b593-6\">F.E. Sweeney, J., dissents and would affirm the court of appeals.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b593-7\">O\u2019Donnell, J., dissents with opinion.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b593-8\">Sheila G.

The state assumed a burden in this case to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of all the essential elements of the crime of soliciting improper compensation. The statute in question here, R.C. 2921.43(C), provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cNo person for the benefit of a political party, campaign committee, legislative campaign fund, political action committee, or political contributing entity shall coerce any contribution in consideration of either of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(1) Appointing or securing, maintaining, or renewing the appointment of any person to any public office, employment, or agency;</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(2) Preferring, or maintaining the status of, any public employee with respect to compensation, duties, placement, location, promotion, or other material aspects of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">{\u00b6 19} Thus, the essential elements of this offense, which the state needed to prove in order meet its burden, required a showing that Conese (1) coerced Dixon, an employee of the board of elections (2) to make a contribution (3) in consideration of keeping his job at the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-15\">{\u00b6 20} Here, the state demonstrated that Conese used strong language in attempting to obtain a contribution to the Democratic Party in the amount of all of Dixon\u2019s salary at the board of elections, which directly related to the retention of Dixon\u2019s position at the board of elections. However, the state never demonstrated that Dixon ever made. any contribution as a result of his conversations with Conese. In fact, Dixon never did make such a contribution. Accordingly, the state failed to demonstrate that the actions of Conese \u2014 which may very well have constituted coercion \u2014 resulted in a contribution. Because the state failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>prove that Dixon made a contribution, it failed in its burden of proof. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aal\">Robin N. Piper, Butler County Prosecuting Attorney, Daniel G.
