Crouse Cartage Co. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 115, 748 N.E.2d 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">{\u00b6 2} On February 10, 1998, appellee, Gregory Modzelewski, received a number of injuries in the course of and arising from his employment with appellant, United Parcel Service, Inc. (\u201cUPS\u201d), a self-insured employer. Modzelewski\u2019s injuries resulted from an accident in which Brian Howe, an employee of Yellow Freight Systems, Inc., backed a tractor-trailer into Modzelewski and pinned him against a loading dock. UPS certified Modzelewski\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim and has since paid compensation and benefits pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4123.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">{\u00b6 3} On October 22, 1999, Modzelewski commenced this tort action by filing a complaint in the Summit County Court of Common Pleas against Howe and Yellow Freight, which he later dismissed and refiled on February 1, 2002, naming UPS as a necessary party to the extent that it \u201cclaims a subrogated interest in the subject matter of this lawsuit.\u201d Modzelewski then moved for summary judgment against UPS, arguing that former R.C. 4123.93 contains the same constitutional infirmities as R.C. 4123.931 and, therefore, is invalid for the reasons stated in <em>Holeton, </em>supra. Finding that R.C. 4123.93 improperly distinguishes between claimants who institute lawsuits against third-party tortfeasors and claimants who settle their claims against tortfeasors without filing suit, the trial court granted Modzelewski\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In a subsequent order, the court entered final judgment as to these parties upon an express determination that \u201cthere is no just cause for delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>{\u00b6 4} The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cAfter careful review of the record and the applicable law, this Court finds that former R.C. 4123.93 is unconstitutional. Former R.C. 4123.93, like R.C. 4123.931 treats claimants who litigate their claims against third-party tortfeasors differently from those who settle such claims out of court. R.C. 4123.931(D) unfairly deterred claimants from pursuing settlement over litigation because it stated that the entire amount of any settlement was unconditionally subject to subrogation, whereas a litigant could obtain a special verdict [or jury interrogatories] to protect the entire amount of [the] award from being subject to subrogation. Former R.C. 4123.93(D) unfairly deterred claimants from pursuing litigation over settlement because it stated that subrogation was automatic \u2018only if the claimant was a party to litigation involving the third-party tortfeasor, with no mention of such in regard to settlements.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">{\u00b6 6} The cause is now before this court pursuant to the acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">{\u00b6 7} The sole issue for our consideration is whether R.C. 4123.93, as enacted by Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107, effective October 20, 1993, 145 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3187, is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">{\u00b6 8} As relevant here, R.C. 4123.93 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(B) The administrator of workers\u2019 compensation, for the amount of compensation and benefits paid to or on behalf of an employee from any [workers\u2019 compensation] fund * * *, and a self-insuring employer, for the amount of compensation and benefits paid to or on behalf of his employee for any injury or occupational disease that is compensable under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code, less the amount of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and court costs actually incurred by the employee in the action, are subrogated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>all of the rights of that employee against a third-party tortfeasor involving that compensable injury or disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(D) The right of subrogation which inures to the benefit of the administrator, employer, or self-insuring employer under division (B) of this section is automatic and applies only if the employee is a party to an action involving the third-party tortfeasor.\u201d 145 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3187.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">{\u00b6 12} In <em>Holeton, </em>we held that R.C. 4123.931(D) violated Sections 2, 16, and 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, in part because it distinguished between claimants who try their tort claims and claimants who settle their tort claims. In the case where an award or judgment is rendered in the third-party action, R.C. 4123.931(D) permitted the claimant to save from subrogation those portions of his or her tort recovery that do not represent or duplicate workers\u2019 compensation benefits. But where a settlement was reached with the third party, R.C. 4123.931(D) subjected the entire amount of the claimant\u2019s tort recovery to the reimbursement right of the statutory subrogee. We found this framework unconstitutional because \u201cit allows for reimbursement from proceeds that do not constitute a double recovery\u201d for the settling claimant. Id., 92 Ohio St.3d at 126, 748 N.E.2d 1111. In particular, we explained that \u201c[s]uch disparate treatment of claimants who settle their tort claims is irrational and arbitrary because * * * there are situations where claimants\u2019 tort recovery is necessarily limited to amounts that if retained along with workers\u2019 compensation cannot possibly result in a double recovery.\u201d Id. at 132, 748 N.E.2d 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 4123.93(D) embodies a distinction similar to that of R.C. 4123.931(D), only it favors out-of-court settlement over litigation. Under R.C. 4123.93(D), claimants who institute lawsuits against third-party tortfeasors are treated differently from claimants who settle their third-party claims without filing suit, as only the former claimants\u2019 tort recovery is subjected to the reimbursement right of the statutory subrogee.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">{\u00b6 14} UPS argues, however, that this court did not find R.C. 4123.931 to be unconstitutional in <em>Holeton </em>\u201csimply because claimants who tried their claims were treated differently than those who settled their claims. * * * In <em>Holeton, </em>it was the effect the statute had on those claimants who chose to settle their claims that made R.C. 4123.931 unconstitutional. * * * The statute operated whether or not a double recovery had occurred for those who settled their claims.\u201d According to UPS, the government has a legitimate interest in \u201cencouraging claimants to settle their claims without going through the time and expense of a trial.\u201d UPS submits that R.C. 4123.93 does not allow for reimbursement from the claimant\u2019s tort recovery \u201cunless the injured worker has been fully compensated for his injuries and losses\u201d and \u201ca double recovery [has been] proven.\u201d In this regard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>UPS points out that contrary to Modzelewski\u2019s assertions, the General Assembly has made the right to subrogation \u201cautomatic\u201d in R.C. 4123.93(D) not to create \u201can irrebuttable presumption\u201d of double recovery, but to prevent the claimant from filing a third-party suit \u201cwithout informing the employer, thereby circumventing the employer\u2019s rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">{\u00b6 15} We need not consider whether R.C. 4123.93 is unconstitutional solely because it tends to penalize those claimants who, due to no fault of their own, are unable to settle their third-party claims within the applicable statute of limitations. Nor is it necessary for us to determine whether R.C. 4123.93 implicates the fundamental right of access to courts, thereby invoking the so-called strict-scrutiny test. Under the rational-relationship test, and for the reasons stated in <em>Holeton, </em>R.C. 4123.93 is unconstitutional because it precludes claimants who are parties to actions against third-party tortfeasors from showing that their tort recovery or portions thereof do not duplicate their workers\u2019 compensation recovery and, therefore, do not represent a double recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">{\u00b6 16} In reaching this conclusion, we fully agree with UPS that by making the right of subrogation \u201cautomatic\u201d in R.C. 4123.93(D), the General Assembly meant only to qualify that right as self-executing. But automatic or not, the right of subrogation under R.C. 4123.93 cannot be construed to apply only when the claimant receives a double recovery. To the contrary, R.C. 4123.93(B) expressly provides that the subrogee, for the amount of compensation and benefits paid, is \u201csubrogated to <em>all of the rights </em>of that employee against a third-party tortfeasor involving that compensable injury or disease.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">{\u00b6 17} UPS proffers the First Appellate District\u2019s decision in <em>Moellman v. Niehaus </em>(Feb. 5, 1999), 1st Dist. No. C-971113, 1999 WL 49370, as supporting the notion that R.C. 4123.93 can be interpreted to apply only when the claimant\u2019s tort recovery is duplicative of workers\u2019 compensation. In actuality, however, <em>Moellman </em>demonstrates just the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">{\u00b6 18} In <em>Moellman, </em>the claimant filed a third-party suit and ultimately settled with the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer for policy limits of $12,500. The claimant\u2019s employer, who had paid more than $23,000 in workers\u2019 compensation and medical benefits, intervened to protect its subrogation interest in the amount minus attorney fees and costs pursuant to R.C. 4123.93. The court of appeals held that a self-insured employer is not entitled to priority in the distribution of proceeds from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance policy when the policy limits are insufficient to fully compensate the claimant for his actual loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">{\u00b6 19} In reaching its decision, however, the court in <em>Moellman </em>was constrained to acknowledge that \u201c[t]he former statute [i.e., the version we review today] contains no * * * provision that would allow any damages to be excluded from the right of subrogation under any circumstances.\u201d Nevertheless, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>found the statute inapplicable, relying on a case that held a contractual subrogation clause, which purported to apply under similar circumstances, to be against public policy and, therefore, unenforceable. Thus, <em>Moellman </em>did not interpret R.C. 4123.93 to apply only when the claimant receives a double recovery. To the contrary, the court specifically recognized that the statute applies when there is no double recovery and then went on to nullify its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">{\u00b6 20} Accordingly, we hold that pursuant to <em>Holeton, </em>supra, R.C. 4123.93, as enacted by Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107, effective October 20, 1993, violates Sections 2, 16, and 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and, therefore, is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">{\u00b6 21} Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b353-8\">F.E. Sweeney, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b353-9\">Moyer, C.J., and O\u2019Connor, J., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b353-10\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b353-11\">Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-10\">. When the 120th General Assembly enacted Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107, it added divisions (B), (C), and (D) to former R.C. 4123.93, forming Ohio\u2019s first subrogation statute in the workers\u2019 compensation context. The 121st General Assembly repealed former R.C. 4123.93 when it enacted R.C. 4123.931 as part of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 278, effective September 29, 1995. 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3581. In <em>Holeton v. Crouse Cartage Co. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 115, 748 N.E.2d 1111, which was decided on June 27, 2001, this court held R.C. 4123.931 to be unconstitutional. As a result, former R.C. 4123.93 again became effective. See <em>State v. Sullivan </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 502, 739 N.E.2d 788, paragraph two of the syllabus. Following our decision in <em>Holeton, </em>the 124th General Assembly repealed existing R.C. 4123.93 and 4123.931 and enacted new versions of these subrogation statutes as part of Sub.S.B. No. 227. However, new R.C. 4123.93 and 4123.931 did not take effect until April 9, 2003. Accordingly, UPS\u2019s subrogation rights in this case are governed by R.C. 4123.93 as enacted by Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107 in 1993. Throughout the remainder of this opinion, we will refer to this version of R.C. 4123.93 without the designation \u201cformer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b353-12\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AXM\">concurring in judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">{\u00b6 22} I write separately to explain my reasons for concurring with the majority decision. Although I agree with the ultimate holding of the majority, I do not agree that the constitutionality of former R.C. 4123.93 depends on its similarities to the statute analyzed in <em>Holeton v. Crouse Cartage Co. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 115, 748 N.E.2d 1111. Rather, I believe that the constitutionality of former R.C. 4123.93 depends on whether the government has a rational basis for distinguishing between employees who settle their claims against third-party tortfeasors before initiating a lawsuit and those who settle after initiating a lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">{\u00b6 23} This case addresses the constitutionality of former R.C. 4123.93, 145 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3188-3189, which became effective when this court held its successor statute, R.C. 4123.931, unconstitutional in <em>Holeton. </em>Both former R.C. 4123.93 and its successor statute governed the circumstances in which a self-insured employer who has paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits to an employee for an injury caused by a third-party tortfeasor may \u201cstep into the legal shoes\u201d of the employee and exercise his or her right to recover damages from the tortfeasor. Of critical legal import, however, is that the event that triggers this statutory right of subrogation in former R.C. 4123.93 differs significantly from the event that triggers that right in R.C. 4123.931. I examine each statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>separately to highlight this important difference and to make clear the manner in which that difference should affect our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">{\u00b6 24} The statute at issue in <em>Holeton, </em>R.C. 4123.931(D), distinguished between two groups of employees: those who fully litigated their claims against third-party tortfeasors and those who settled such claims. 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3596-3597. If the employee litigated the third-party claim to completion, the statute allowed the employee to obtain jury interrogatories segregating the damages that did not represent workers\u2019 compensation benefits and, therefore, were not subject to the reimbursement right of the statutory subrogee. 92 Ohio St.3d at 125, 748 N.E.2d 1111. If the employee settled, by contrast, the entire amount of the settlement was presumed to be subject to the reimbursement right of the statutory subrogee. Id. at 125-126, 748 N.E.2d 1111. Hence, the statute treated employees who fully litigated third-party claims more favorably than the employees who settled by affording the former a protection not afforded the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">{\u00b6 25} In addressing the constitutionality of R.C. 4123.931(D), the majority in <em>Holeton </em>held that the statute violated the Ohio Constitution because claimants who opted for settlement, unlike claimants who opted for trial, \u201c \u2018ha[d] no comparable method or opportunity to shield a portion of their damages from the subrogee.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 132, 748 N.E.2d 1111, quoting from the petitioners\u2019 brief. I dissented. Id. at 135-139, 748 N.E.2d 1111. My disagreement with the majority centered on whether the government had a rational basis for the disparate treatment. I concluded that it plainly did. Id. at 138, 748 N.E.2d 1111. That rational basis was to prevent collusive settlements; for \u201c[wjithout the restriction regarding settlement awards in R.C. 4123.931(D), employees could accept a lower settlement amount from the tortfeasor, in exchange for an agreement stating that the entire amount was not subject to subrogation.\u201d Id. at 138, 748 N.E.2d 1111. Notwithstanding my dissent in <em>Holeton, </em>however, I recognize its holding as controlling precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">{\u00b6 26} The statute at issue in the instant case, former R.C. 4123.93, differs significantly from the one invalidated in <em>Holeton. </em>Enacted in 1993, former R.C. 4123.93(D) provides that \u201c[t]he right of subrogation which inures to the benefit of the administrator, employer, or self-insuring employer under division (B) of this section is automatic and applies <em>only if the employee is a party to an action involving the third-party tortfeasor.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 145 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3188-3189. This provision thus required claimants to disgorge that portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>their recovery that represented payments made by his or her employer for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">{\u00b6 27} Significantly, however, the subrogation contemplated in former R.C. 4123.93 occurs only if the employee filed a lawsuit (an \u201caction\u201d). If the employee settled prior to filing a lawsuit, the employee could retain the full settlement amount; but if the employee filed a complaint and then settled the following day, the employee would be required to \u201cshare\u201d that recovery with the employer that paid his or her workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">{\u00b6 28} In view of this disparate treatment, the dispositive issue in this case is simply whether the government has a rational basis for distinguishing between claimants who settle their claims against third-party tortfeasors before initiating a lawsuit and claimants who settle after initiating a lawsuit. No rational basis for this distinction has been offered to us by the parties or by the dissent. I therefore conclude that the statute is unconstitutional because the filing of a legal action against a third-party tortfeasor bears no rational relationship to whether a portion of the claimant\u2019s recovery should be paid to the claimant\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">{\u00b6 29} The foregoing analysis makes clear that <em>Holeton </em>has little impact on our decision today. The reasoning set forth in the dissenting opinions in <em>Holeton </em>cannot serve as a basis to uphold the legislation in the instant case. That is to say, the rational basis that I believe supported the disparate treatment in <em>Holeton </em>\u2014 the prevention of collusive settlements \u2014 does not exist to support the statute at issue in the instant case because the unequal treatment of claimants authorized by former R.C. 4123.93(D) does not prevent collusive settlements. Indeed, it would be incongruous to uphold a statute that <em>favors </em>settlement before trial (former R.C. 4123.93[D]) based upon the reasoning in a case that addressed a statute that <em>disfavored </em>settlement before trial (R.C. 4123.931[D]). Given that the rational basis that I identified in <em>Holeton </em>cannot serve as the rational basis in the instant case, the government must have a <em>different </em>rational basis for the disparate treatment authorized by former R.C. 4123.93(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">{\u00b6 30} Finally, I am aware that one could concur in the majority opinion by applying stare decisis \u2014 a principle that I have applied in many instances. I believe that we are not directly bound by <em>Holeton, </em>however, because that decision addressed a different statute than the one before us today. This point is perhaps best illustrated by observing that, if the state <em>had </em>a rational basis for the disparate treatment authorized by former R.C. 4123.93(D) (a distinct possibility given that its successor statute favored a different class of employees), then stare decisis would not preclude the court from upholding the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>{\u00b6 31} Nevertheless, I believe that the disparate treatment authorized by former R.C. 4123.93 is less justified than that which was authorized by the statute in <em>Holeton. </em>Indeed, we have been offered no rational basis for why the filing of an \u201caction\u201d should trigger the employer\u2019s statutory right of subrogation. Thus, because a majority of this court held that the statute in <em>Holeton </em>did not have a rational basis and because the statute before us today has less justification than the statute in <em>Holeton, </em>I believe that the majority decision is consistent with our precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">{\u00b6 32} For the foregoing reasons, I concur with the majority in judgment only.</p>\n<judges id=\"b356-6\">O\u2019Connor, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b356-7\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AsG\">concurring in judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">{\u00b6 33} I join the concurrence of Chief Justice Moyer, except to the extent that it is critical of <em>Holeton v.

Doe </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 312, 319, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257. Furthermore, \u201c[i]n areas of social and economic policy, [such a classification] must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\u201d <em>Fed. Communications Comm. v. Beach Communications, Inc. </em>(1993), 508 U.S. 307, 313, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 124 L.Ed.2d 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">{\u00b6 36} The majority has avoided application of that test by following <em>Holeton v. Crouse Cartage Co. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 115, 748 N.E.2d 1111, where the court concluded that the \u201cdisparate treatment of claimants who settle their tort claims is irrational and arbitrary because * * * <em>there are situations </em>where claimants\u2019 tort recovery is necessarily limited to amounts that if retained along with workers\u2019 compensation cannot possibly result in a double recovery.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 132, 748 N.E.2d 1111. In this case, the majority finds the classification \u201cunconstitutional because it precludes claimants who are parties to actions against third-party tortfeasors from showing that their tort recovery or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>portions thereof do not duplicate their workers\u2019 compensation recovery and, therefore, do not represent a double recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">{\u00b6 37} Now, rather than deferring to the General Assembly and determining whether \u201cthere is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification,\u201d <em>Beach Communications, </em>508 U.S. at 313, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 124 L.Ed.2d 211, the majority has decided that if a court can come up with any set of facts that demonstrates how \u201cirrational and arbitrary\u201d the classification could be, the law must be struck down as violative of equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">{\u00b6 38} But \u201cequal protection is not a license for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choices\u201d \u2014 even if wisdom dictates the irrationality and arbitrariness of favoring claimants who settle over those who litigate. Id. When, as here, \u201cthere are \u2018plausible reasons\u2019 \u201d for the General Assembly\u2019s action, \u201c \u2018our inquiry is at an end.\u2019 \u201d Id., 508 U.S. at 313, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 124 L.Ed.2d 211, quoting <em>United States RR. Retirement Bd. v. Fritz </em>(1980), 449 U.S. 166, 179, 101 S.Ct. 453, 66 L.Ed.2d 368. See, also, <em>Am. Assn. of Univ. Professors, Cent. State Univ. Chapter v. Cent. State Univ. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 55, 58, 717 N.E.2d 286, quoting <em>Heller, </em>509 U.S. at 320, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (\u201ca state has no obligation whatsoever \u2018to produce evidence to sustain the rationality of a statutory classification\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">{\u00b6 39} By failing to accord a strong presumption of validity to classifications that involve neither fundamental rights nor suspect classes, the majority has ignored long-standing equal protection jurisprudence, under which the determination of the wisdom of a statute \u201c \u2018must come from [the legislature], not the courts. Our concern here * * * is with power, not with wisdom.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States RR. Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, </em>449 U.S. at 176, 101 S.Ct. 453, 66 L.Ed.2d 368, quoting <em>Flemming v. Nestor </em>(1960), 363 U.S. 603, 611, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">{\u00b6 40} Therefore, when the General Assembly enacts a law pursuant to its constitutionally derived authority' \u2014 that is, when the legislature acts in furtherance of a legitimate governmental interest \u2014 this court may not strike down a law simply because the law \u201c \u2018is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dandridge v. Williams </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 471, 485, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491, quoting <em>Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co. </em>(1911), 220 U.S. 61, 78, 31 S.Ct. 337, 55 L.Ed. 369. Indeed, \u201c[t]he problems of government are practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rough accommodations \u2014 illogical, it may be, and unscientific.\u201d <em>Metropolis Theatre Co. v. Chicago </em>(1913), 228 U.S. 61, 69-70, 33 S.Ct. 441, 57 L.Ed. 730. Under the doctrine of separation of powers, the Constitution confers the authority to resolve those practical problems and rough accommodations to the legislative \u2014 not the judicial \u2014 branch.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A3n\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Gary W.
