Hoffner, defendant-appellant, and Archie Dixon kidnapped and robbed Christopher Hammer, then drove Hammer to a remote area where they buried him alive in a shallow grave and left him to die.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">{\u00b6 2} Hoffner was convicted of the aggravated murder, aggravated robbery, and kidnapping of Hammer, and he was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">{\u00b6 3} Hoffner and Hammer met in August 1993. For a short period of time in mid-August 1993, Hoffner, Hammer, and Dixon lived at the Toledo home of Kirsten Wilkerson, Dixon\u2019s girlfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">{\u00b6 4} In early September 1993, Michael Elting, a friend of Hammer, Hoffner, and Dixon, borrowed Hammer\u2019s car, a 1987 Dodge Daytona, to go to the movies with Hoffner and Dixon. According to Elting, Hoffner and Dixon discussed \u201chow to get rid of [Hammer\u2019s] car,\u201d and Hoffner said that he knew a place where he could take the car, presumably after Hammer was killed. Approximately one month after Hammer\u2019s disappearance, Elting discovered Hammer\u2019s car at a used car lot in Toledo.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">{\u00b6 5} On the afternoon of September 21, Dixon told Wilkerson that he and Hoffner were going to \u201cget [Hammer] tonight.\u201d Wilkerson understood this to mean that Dixon and Hoffner were going to kill Hammer.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">{\u00b6 6} In the early morning of September 22, Hoffner, Dixon, and Hammer went to Wilkerson\u2019s house. Once there, Hoffner and Dixon attacked Hammer. Hoffner restrained Hammer in a headlock while Dixon beat him. Hoffner tried to break Hammer\u2019s neck, and Dixon struck Hammer in the head with a wine bottle. Hoffner and Dixon then tied Hammer to a bunk-bed ladder, and Dixon went through Hammer\u2019s wallet, taking out his money, birth certificate, and Social Security card. Then Hoffner and Dixon discussed how they should dispose of Hammer\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>{\u00b6 7} While Hammer remained tied to the bunk-bed ladder, Hoffner and Dixon left Wilkerson\u2019s house to dig a grave. Hoffner and Dixon returned to Wilkerson\u2019s house and they, along with Wilkerson, drove Hammer, blindfolded, to the gravesite in Hammer\u2019s car. Wilkerson stayed at the car while Hoffner and Dixon walked Hammer into the woods, where they permitted Hammer to smoke a cigarette. Then they gagged and again blindfolded Hammer, tied his hands and feet behind his back, grabbed him by his arms and legs, and dropped him into the grave, still alive. At one point, Hammer was able to remove the gag from his mouth and free one of his legs. Hoffner jumped into the grave and placed his foot over Hammer\u2019s mouth when Hammer yelled for help. Hoffner and Dixon then held Hammer down and covered him with dirt. After Hammer was completely buried, Hoffner and Dixon walked back and forth across the grave, packing down the dirt. Hoffner, Dixon, and Wilkerson then returned to Wilkerson\u2019s house in Hammer\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 8} After killing Hammer, Hoffner and Dixon carried out their plan to sell his car. On September 25, Dixon obtained a state of Ohio identification card with his photograph but in Hammer\u2019s name. On September 30, Hoffner and Dixon went to the automobile title bureau, where Dixon obtained a duplicate certificate of title for Hammer\u2019s car using the fraudulent ID card. Hoffner and Dixon then took Hammer\u2019s car to a used car lot, where they sold the car for $2,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">{\u00b6 9} By November 8, 1993, police officers investigating Hammer\u2019s disappearance had located his Dodge Daytona at a used car lot in Toledo, had confirmed its unauthorized sale on September 30, and had identified Dixon as the prime suspect in the vehicle transaction. On November 9, police went to Wilkerson\u2019s home and arrested Dixon for forgery. The police also executed a search warrant at Wilkerson\u2019s home. During the search, police questioned Hoffner regarding Hammer\u2019s disappearance. Hoffner denied involvement but made statements implicating Dixon. Hoffner agreed to accompany police detectives downtown to make a statement. On the way to the station, Hoffner told police that Dixon had shown him the location of Hammer\u2019s body, and he then led police to the gravesite.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">{\u00b6 10} Once at the station, police read Hoffner his <em>Miranda </em>rights, but Hoffner was not placed under arrest. Hoffner waived his rights and gave a taped account of Dixon\u2019s involvement in Hammer\u2019s murder. After Hammer\u2019s body was discovered, Dixon confessed to Hammer\u2019s murder and also implicated Hoffner. Police subsequently arrested Hoffner on November 10 at his mother\u2019s home. At police headquarters, detectives read Hoffner his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and Hoffner signed a waiver-of-rights form. Hoffner then gave a taped statement confessing to his part in Hammer\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Cynthia Beisser, Deputy Coroner of Lucas County, performed an autopsy and concluded that Hammer had died of asphyxiation. According to Dr. Beisser, Hammer likely died within five minutes of being buried alive, and he might have remained conscious during the first two to three minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 12} A grand jury indicted Hoffner, Dixon, and Wilkerson for the aggravated murder, kidnapping, and aggravated robbery of Hammer. Hoffner was indicted on three counts of aggravated murder. Count One of the indictment charged Hoffner with aggravated murder involving prior calculation and design. R.C. 2903.01(A). Count Two charged Hoffner with aggravated murder while committing kidnapping, and Count Three charged Hoffner with aggravated murder while committing aggravated robbery, both pursuant to R.C. 2903.01(B). Hoffner was additionally indicted for kidnapping in Count Four, aggravated robbery in Count Five, and three counts of forgery in Counts Six, Seven, and Eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b6 13} The three counts of aggravated murder each contained two R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) death pen\u00e1lty specifications. The first specification charged aggravated murder during a kidnapping, and the second charged aggravated murder during an aggravated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">{\u00b6 14} The jury convicted Hoffner as charged and recommended the death penalty. Thereafter, the trial court sentenced Hoffner to death for the murder, to ten to 25 years each for kidnapping and aggravated robbery, and to 18 months for each forgery charge. On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed Hoffner\u2019s convictions and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">{\u00b6 15} We previously upheld identical convictions and the death sentence for Dixon. See <em>State v. Dixon, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 328, 2004-Ohio-1585, 805 N.E.2d 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Pretrial Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">{\u00b6 16} In his first proposition of law, Hoffner claims that the trial court erred in failing to suppress various oral statements that he made to police before and after his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">{\u00b6 17} On November 9, 1993, Hoffner and Dixon were living at Wilkerson\u2019s house. At approximately 11:00 a.m. on that date, Toledo police officers executed a search warrant at the Wilkerson residence and arrested Dixon for forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-13\">{\u00b6 18} During the search, Lieutenant Charles Hunt discovered Hoffner covered with a blanket lying on a couch in the family room. Hunt, with his weapon drawn but pointed in the air, ordered Hoffner off the couch. Hunt then pulled the blanket away from Hoffner, holstered his weapon, and searched Hoffner for weapons. To prevent Hoffner from interfering while police searched the premises, Hunt asked Hoffner to sit in a nearby chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Hunt and Detective Robert Leiter then searched the family room. During their search, the detectives asked Hoffner whether he knew anything about Hammer\u2019s disappearance. Hoffner denied all knowledge of Hammer\u2019s whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">{\u00b620} After Hunt and Leiter completed their search of the family room, Hoffner asked to speak with them. Hoffner told police that Dixon and Hammer had gotten into an argument and that Dixon had \u201c[taken] care of him,\u201d had buried Hammer\u2019s body in the woods, and had sold Hammer\u2019s car. At no point did Hoffner implicate himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">{\u00b6 21} Once Hoffner had implicated Dixon, Hunt and Leiter asked whether Hoffner would go downtown to make a statement. Hoffner agreed. On the drive to the police station, Leiter told Hoffner that officers would begin searching the wooded area where Hoffner had said Hammer\u2019s body was buried and that any other information Hoffner had would be helpful. Leiter again asked whether Hoffner had had anything to do with Hammer\u2019s disappearance, and Hoffner said he had not. Hoffner subsequently asked the detectives to stop the car and indicated that he had additional information but said he did not want to get into trouble. Leiter told Hoffner that he could be charged with obstruction if he withheld information, but if he told the truth and was not involved in any crimes, he had nothing to worry about. At that point, Hoffner told the detectives where they could find Hammer\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">{\u00b6 22} After leading the detectives to Hammer\u2019s grave, Hoffner again agreed to go to the police station to give a statement. On the way to the station, the detectives stopped at a fast-food restaurant, and Hoffner was given food and a drink. At the station, Leiter advised Hoffner of his <em>Miranda </em>rights but did not arrest him. Hoffner confirmed that he understood his rights and signed a waiver-of-rights form. At approximately 3:30 p.m., Hoffner gave a taped statement describing Dixon\u2019s murder of Hammer. After the interview, Leiter and Detective Phil Kulakoski drove Hoffner back to Wilkerson\u2019s house. Hoffner then packed his belongings and drove himself to his mother\u2019s house in Perrysburg.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">{\u00b6 23} At approximately 7:30 p.m. on November 9, Dixon confessed to Hammer\u2019s murder and, in the process, implicated Hoffner. Shortly thereafter, police obtained an arrest warrant for Hoffner. After midnight on November 10, Kulakoski and Leiter arrested Hoffner at his mother\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">{\u00b6 24} Detectives drove Hoffner to the police station, where they again read him <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Hoffner signed a waiver-of-rights form and gave a taped statement confessing to Hammer\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">{\u00b6 25} Hoffner now contends that police should have given <em>Miranda </em>warnings to him prior to any questioning during his initial encounter with police at the Wilkerson residence. Hoffner argues that he was in custody because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>presence of detectives and uniformed officers during the execution of the search warrant presented a \u201ccoercive atmosphere.\u201d As a result, Hoffner submits that any statements he made during the search should have been suppressed. Hoffner further contends that all subsequent statements, including his confession, were inadmissible because they were tainted by the earlier <em>Miranda </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">{\u00b6 26} Contrary to Hoffner\u2019s argument, <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not required simply because the questioning takes place in a coercive atmosphere. See <em>Oregon v. Mathiason </em>(1977), 429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (a coercive environment does not automatically convert a noncustodial situation into one requiring <em>Miranda </em>warnings). The procedural safeguards identified in <em>Miranda </em>apply only when one is subjected to custodial interrogation. <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 478-479, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">{\u00b6 27} <em>Miranda </em>defined \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d as \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. In order to determine whether a person is in custody for purposes of receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, courts must first inquire into the circumstances surrounding the questioning and, second, given those circumstances, determine whether a reasonable person would have felt that he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interview and leave. <em>Thompson v. Keohane </em>(1995), 516 U.S. 99, 112, 116 S.Ct. 457, 133 L.Ed.2d 383. Once the factual circumstances surrounding the interrogation are reconstructed, the court must apply an objective test to resolve \u201cthe ultimate inquiry\u201d of whether there was a \u201c \u2018formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement\u2019 of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d <em>California v. Beheler </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S.Ct. 3517, 77 L.Ed.2d 1275, quoting <em>Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. at 495, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">{\u00b6 28} We hold that Hoffner was not in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes during the execution of the search warrant and that, therefore, he was not entitled to its protective warnings. When the search warrant was served, detectives informed Hoffner as to the reasons for the search and asked whether he knew anything about Hammer\u2019s disappearance. Such questioning does not require <em>Miranda </em>warnings. \u201cGeneral on-the-scene questioning as to facts surrounding a crime or other general questioning of citizens in the fact-finding process is not affected by our holding.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 477, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. At the time, police were questioning Hoffner as a witness, not a suspect, and police did not arrest him or restrain him in any manner. See <em>State v. Richey </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 353, 361, 595 N.E.2d 915 (police not required to issue <em>Miranda </em>warnings, since Richey was initially interviewed only as a possible witness and was not under arrest or in custody).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>{\u00b6 29} Moreover, there is no evidence that police officers coerced Hoffner into making any statements. After initially denying all knowledge of Hammer\u2019s disappearance, Hoffner asked to speak with Leiter and Hunt. Then he voluntarily offered information that Dixon had killed Hammer. Hoffner\u2019s statements were not made in response to police questioning, nor were they compelled by police in any manner. See <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 478, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (any statement given freely and voluntarily without compelling influences is admissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">{\u00b6 30} Police did briefly restrict Hoffner\u2019s movement during the initial stages of the search in order to secure the location and search the area for weapons and evidence. Nevertheless, directing Hoffner to stay in a specific location (i.e., sit in a chair) was reasonable in light of the circumstances. After the weapons search was completed, police never told Hoffner that he could not leave the premises, nor did Hoffner ever state that he wanted to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">{\u00b6 31} Events after Hoffner left the Wilkerson residence with Leiter and Hunt further confirm that Hoffner was not in custody. Hoffner voluntarily agreed to go to police headquarters to give a taped statement. On the way to the station, Hoffner offered to direct police to the location of Hammer\u2019s body. Police did not threaten Hoffner or make any promises in exchange for this information. Again, police had not arrested Hoffner, nor was he handcuffed or restrained in any manner. In fact, while leading Lieutenant Hunt to Hammer\u2019s grave, Hoffner was, at one point, ahead of him by 30 to 40 yards, and, at times, out of his sight.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">{\u00b6 32} After arriving at the station, detectives read Hoffner his <em>Miranda </em>rights but again did not place him under arrest. Hoffner stated that he understood his rights, agreed that he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and signed a waiver-of-rights form. Hoffner agreed that he came to the station of his own free will and acknowledged that police had not threatened or promised him anything in return for his statement. After Hoffner gave a taped statement, police drove him back to Wilkerson\u2019s house, and he then packed his belongings and drove himself to Perrysburg.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">{\u00b6 33} Finally, after he was arrested and taken into custody on November 10, detectives again issued <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Hoffner. He then executed a voluntary waiver of his rights before confessing to his part in Hammer\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">{\u00b6 34} Because Hoffner was not under arrest or in custody during the execution of the search warrant or when he directed detectives to Hammer\u2019s body, police were not required to issue <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Moreover, Hoffner was not in custody at the police station when he was interviewed on November 9 as a witness only. Finally, prior to his interview at the police station on November 9 and again after his arrest on November 10, he executed a valid, written waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. All of Hoffner\u2019s statements regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Hammer\u2019s disappearance and murder were voluntarily made and properly admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">{\u00b6 35} Accordingly, Hoffner\u2019s first proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">{\u00b6 36} In his second proposition of law, Hoffner contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress physical evidence seized from his automobile. Hoffner argues that his consent to search was not voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">{\u00b6 37} During the search on November 9, Detective Larry Scoble noticed an automobile parked outside the Wilkerson residence. In response to Scoble\u2019s inquiry, Hoffner acknowledged that the car was his. Scoble requested permission to search the vehicle, and Hoffner verbally agreed. Hoffner, Scoble, and Detective Ron Scanlon then went outside to the car, where Hoffner read and signed a consent-to-search form. Police then searched Hoffner\u2019s car and confiscated a pair of tennis shoes, a notebook, and a pharmacy receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">{\u00b6 38} In order to waive one\u2019s Fourth Amendment privilege against unreasonable searches and seizures, one must voluntarily consent to the search. Whether consent was voluntarily given is determined by the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Childress </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 217, 4 OBR 534, 448 N.E.2d 155, paragraph one of the syllabus <em>(Schneckloth v. Bustamante </em>[1973], 412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854, followed).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">{\u00b6 39} Hoffner argues on appeal that the items seized should have been suppressed because the presence of police officers invalidated his consent. However, none of the items seized from Hoffner\u2019s automobile was introduced into evidence at his trial. In any event, Hoffner freely consented to the search. Hoffner was not under arrest or restrained in any manner, and police made no threats or promises to obtain his cooperation. Nor does any evidence indicate that Hoffner was under the influence of drugs or alcohol or that he did not understand the consequences of signing the consent-to-search form. See, e.g., <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, at \u00b6 63-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">{\u00b6 40} Hoffner\u2019s second proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">{\u00b6 41} In his third proposition of law, Hoffner makes various claims relating to ineffective assistance of counsel. Reversal of a conviction or sentence based upon ineffective assistance of counsel requires satisfying the two-pronged test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. <em>Strickland </em>requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and second, that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. Id. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">{\u00b6 42} Hoffner first contends that defense counsel were deficient for failing to file a post-hearing brief in support of the motion to suppress his statements to police. As discussed under the first proposition of law, the trial court properly denied suppression of Hoffner\u2019s pre-arrest and post-arrest statements. Hoffner has not shown how the filing of a post-hearing brief would have altered the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">{\u00b6 43} Hoffner next contends that defense counsel were deficient in presenting only a brief opening statement during the guilt phase. During opening statement, defense counsel informed the jury that it would have to analyze every count of the indictment, \u201celement by element,\u201d and that the burden was on the prosecutor to prove Hoffner\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to each element of the offenses charged. While admittedly brief, defense counsel\u2019s opening statement represented a tactical choice, and Hoffner has failed to establish that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient or prejudicial. See <em>State v. Ballew </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 244, 256-257, 667 N.E.2d 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">{\u00b6 44} Hoffner also challenges defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the state\u2019s witnesses. Defense counsel cross-examined three witnesses and was able to elicit testimony that Dixon was the primary planner and actor of the crimes against Hammer and that Dixon\u2019s photo, and not Hoffner\u2019s, appeared on the fraudulent ID. Defense counsel attempted to discredit the testimony of the state\u2019s key witness, Kirsten Wilkerson, based upon her plea agreement with the state. Counsel also elicited testimony from Wilkerson that Dixon had been violent toward her but that she was not afraid of Hoffner.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">{\u00b6 45} We conclude that counsel\u2019s strategy reflected reasonable representation. The scope of cross-examination clearly falls within the ambit of trial strategy, and debatable trial tactics do not establish ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 339, 738 N.E.2d 1178; <em>State v. Otte </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 555, 565, 660 N.E.2d 711. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 142-144, 538 N.E.2d 373. The decision to forgo additional cross-examination was likely predicated on defense counsel\u2019s desire to avoid reinforcing the state\u2019s evidence, which consisted primarily of eyewitness accounts and Hoffner\u2019s confession. Hoffner has not shown that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient or that additional cross-examination would have altered the outcome of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">{\u00b6 46} Hoffner also alleges that defense counsel were deficient during the guilt phase for repeatedly \u201cdescribing the crime in the prosecution\u2019s terms \u2014 rather than the defense\u2019s.\u201d Hoffner cites only two isolated comments by defense counsel. During opening statement, defense counsel informed the jury that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>would not dispute the prosecution\u2019s portrayal of Hammer\u2019s death as \u201chorrific\u201d and \u201ca terrible tragedy.\u201d Defense counsel made a similar reference to this horrible event during cross-examination of Wilkerson. Considering the nature of the offenses here, these comments from the defense do not amount to unreasonable trial tactics. See <em>State v. Campbell, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 337, 738 N.E.2d 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">{\u00b6 47} Hoffner also complains that defense counsel were deficient by not presenting a guilt-phase closing argument. Defense counsel made a tactical decision to waive closing argument in order to preclude any rebuttal argument from the prosecutor. Courts must be highly deferential to counsel\u2019s performance and will not second-guess trial strategy decisions. See <em>State v. Tibbetts </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 166, 749 N.E.2d 226. Hoffner has not shown that counsel\u2019s strategy was unreasonable or prejudicial. See, e.g., id. at 166-167, 749 N.E.2d 226. See, also, <em>State v. Keith </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 514, 537, 684 N.E.2d 47 (failure to make an opening and closing argument will not result in ineffectiveness per se).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">{\u00b6 48} In his final claim under this proposition, Hoffner asserts that defense counsel were deficient during closing argument in the mitigation phase of the trial. Specifically, Hoffner claims that counsel were deficient in making the following comments:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cThis is a heinous crime, it\u2019s unbelievable. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cPlease don\u2019t mistake any of my remarks as an attempt to evoke sympathy on behalf of Timothy L. Hoffner, because I don\u2019t feel any, not a bit. I feel revulsion and confusion in equal parts because of everything that we have heard * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cTo stand before you and ask for 20 full years to the parole board is an abomination and it\u2019s an insult to you, to me and to the Hammers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">{\u00b6 53} In this case, we determine that defense counsel\u2019s comments do not reflect deficient performance and that they were not prejudicial. Rather than an abandonment of Hoffner\u2019s mitigation defense, counsel\u2019s comments were an apparent attempt to acknowledge the particularly gruesome nature of the crime and to preserve credibility between counsel and the jury. See, e.g., <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 295-296, 754 N.E.2d 1150; <em>State v. Campbell, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 337, 738 N.E.2d 1178. Judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential, and reviewing courts should refrain from second-guessing the strategic decisions of trial counsel. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">{\u00b6 54} Furthermore, Hoffner misconstrues defense counsel\u2019s final comment. In making this statement, counsel merely informed the jury that their mitigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>strategy was to seek a life sentence for Hoffner with the possibility of parole after 30 years, instead of parole after 20 years. Counsel apparently believed that any attempt to seek the lesser sentence of life with the possibility of parole after 20 years would have alienated the jury. This tactic was not unreasonable in light of the particularly heinous nature of the aggravated murder committed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">{\u00b6 55} Based on the foregoing, we overrule Hoffner\u2019s third proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">{\u00b6 56} Hoffner contends in his ninth proposition of law that defense counsel\u2019s failure to preserve errors at trial deprived Hoffner of the effective assistance of counsel. \u201cThe failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Holloway </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831. Upon review of the record, we hold that Hoffner has failed to satisfy the test outlined in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Hoffner has pointed to only three instances where defense counsel failed to object to alleged errors committed by the trial court. See the fourth, fifth, and sixth propositions of law. These complaints have been examined and are without merit. Hoffner has failed to identify any other instance where he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to preserve an issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">{\u00b6 57} Hence, Hoffner\u2019s ninth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Guilt-Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">{\u00b6 58} In his fourth proposition of law, Hoffner contends that the trial court\u2019s failure to inquire on the record whether he knowingly and intelligently waived his right to testify violated his right to due process. We rejected this same argument in <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 499-500, 709 N.E.2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">{\u00b6 59} Thus, the fourth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">{\u00b6 60} Hoffner contends in the sixth proposition of law that the trial court erred by instructing the jury using the statutory definition of \u201creasonable doubt\u201d contained in R.C. 2901.05(D). However, defense counsel failed to object to this instruction and thereby waived all but plain error. Crim.R. 52(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">{\u00b6 61} We conclude that no error, plain or otherwise, occurred. The definition of \u201creasonable doubt\u201d set forth in R.C. 2901.05(D) correctly conveys the concept of reasonable doubt and is not an unconstitutional dilution of the state\u2019s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State v. Van Gundy </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 230, 232, 594 N.E.2d 604; and <em>State v. Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 202, 702 N.E.2d 866. The trial court\u2019s reasonable-doubt instruction in the guilt phase was in accord with R.C. 2901.05(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>{\u00b6 62} The definition of reasonable doubt in the penalty phase was also not error. That instruction comports with the instruction we suggested in <em>State v. </em>Goff (1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 123, 132, 694 N.E.2d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">{\u00b6 63} Therefore, we overrule the sixth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Penalty-Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">{\u00b6 64} Hoffner claims in his fifth proposition of law that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the issue of punishment would ultimately be left to the court. At the close of the guilt phase, the trial court instructed the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cIn reaching your verdict, you may not discuss or consider the subject of punishment. Your duty is confined to the determination of the guilt or innocence of the Defendant. In the event you find the Defendant guilty, the duty to determine the proper punishment is placed by law, ultimately, on the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">{\u00b6 66} This instruction is appropriate at the guilt stage to ensure that the question of punishment is not discussed during the jury\u2019s deliberations on the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. Notwithstanding, Hoffner challenges the effect of the instruction on the jury\u2019s penalty recommendation. Although it was not challenged on appeal, the trial court gave a similar instruction during the penalty phase when it referred to the jury\u2019s penalty determination as a recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">{\u00b6 67} Defense counsel failed to object in both instances and has waived all but plain error. Crim.R. 52(B). We have previously determined that an instruction informing the jury that a recommendation of death is not binding on the trial court is an accurate statement of law and does not constitute reversible error. See <em>State v. Carter </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 559, 651 N.E.2d 965; <em>State v. Woodard </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 70, 77, 623 N.E.2d 75; and R.C. 2929.03(D)(3). Likewise, the trial court\u2019s instructions here do not constitute plain error. See <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72,100-101, 656 N.E.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">{\u00b6 68} We also reject Hoffner\u2019s contention, raised by appellate counsel during oral argument, that the trial court\u2019s instructions here amount to reversible error based on <em>Ring v. Arizona </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556. In <em>Ring, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that Arizona\u2019s capital-sentencing scheme violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment jury-trial guarantee because it entrusted the trial judge, and not the jury, with making factual determinations as to the existence of aggravating circumstances necessary for imposition of the death penalty. Id. at 609, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">{\u00b6 69} We hold, however, that <em>Ring </em>has no possible relevance to Hoffner\u2019s case, or to Ohio\u2019s death penalty statute. Under the Arizona sentencing statutes proscribed in <em>Ring, </em>the trial court was solely responsible for making all factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>determinations regarding whether a defendant should be sentenced to death. Id. at 592-593, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (construing Ariz.Rev.Stat. Sections 13-703 and 13-1105[C]). In contrast, Ohio\u2019s capital-sentencing scheme places that responsibility with the jury. R.C. 2929.03 charges the jury with determining, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of any statutory aggravating circumstances and whether those aggravating circumstances are sufficient to outweigh the defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence. R.C. 2929.03(B) and (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">{\u00b6 70} Here, the jury made the required factual findings regarding the existence of statutory aggravating circumstances and further found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the factors in mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt. Clearly, the Sixth Amendment violation found in <em>Ring </em>is not implicated in this matter. Thus, the trial court\u2019s instructions did not violate <em>Ring, </em>and any contention by Hoffner that the jury\u2019s responsibility in imposing the death sentence was diminished is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">{\u00b6 71} Accordingly, Hoffner\u2019s fifth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">{\u00b6 72} In his seventh proposition of law, Hoffner requests that the court reconsider its decision in <em>State v. McGuire </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 686 N.E.2d 1112, syllabus, and give weight to residual doubt as a mitigating factor when it conducts its independent review of Hoffner\u2019s death sentence. However, we rejected exactly this argument in <em>State v. Green </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 352, 360, 738 N.E.2d 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">{\u00b6 73} Therefore, we overrule Hoffner\u2019s seventh proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">{\u00b6 74} In the eighth proposition of law, Hoffner contends that his death sentence should be reversed and his case remanded for resentencing because of flaws in the trial court\u2019s R.C. 2929.03(F) sentencing opinion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">{\u00b6 75} Hoffner first asserts that the trial court erred by weighing the aggravating circumstances against individual mitigating factors instead of the collective mitigation evidence. Specifically, Hoffner contends that the trial court weighed the aggravating circumstances against the individual mitigating factors of Hoffner\u2019s history, character, and background. See R.C. 2929.04(B). This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">{\u00b6 76} The trial court found that Hoffner had established the following mitigating factors during the mitigation hearing: Hoffner\u2019s relative youth (21 years old) at the time of the murder, R.C. 2929.04(B)(4); his lack of any significant criminal history, R.C. 2929.04(B)(5); and his antisocial and schizotypal personality disorders, R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). The trial court gave limited weight to Hoffner\u2019s youth, found that his \u201calmost unblemished criminal record\u201d was a significant mitigating factor, and noted that his personality disorders provided a \u201cmoderate basis\u201d for mitigation. The trial court also considered Hoffner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>abusive and bizarre upbringing to be mitigating but found nothing mitigating in the nature and circumstances of the offense. The trial court then concluded that \u201cthe aggravated circumstances so clearly demonstrated by the evidence at trial, far, far outweighed the modest <em>cumulative </em>mitigating factors presented in this case during the penalty phase.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, it is clear that the trial court individually evaluated the mitigating factors but when weighing the mitigation evidence against the aggravating circumstances, it considered the mitigating factors, as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">(\u00b6 77} Hoffner also contends that the trial court considered the nature and circumstances of the offense as an aggravating circumstance. In its sentencing opinion, the trial court stated, \u201cSympathy for the defendant\u2019s mistreatment as a child, however, can in no way excuse the depraved, violent and calculated nature of the acts he committed against Christopher Hammer.\u201d The dissenting opinion in the court of appeals concluded, based on the above-quoted language, that the trial court weighed the nature and circumstances of the offense as nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. The dissent also contended that the trial court \u201cimproperly trebled the weight accorded [the] sole aggravating circumstance\u201d because it \u201cseparated] out kidnaping, robbery and prior calculation and design,\u201d all delineated in one statutory provision, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). For the following reasons, we find that no prejudicial error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">{\u00b6 78} First, the trial court did not refer to the nature and circumstances of the offense as \u201caggravating circumstances.\u201d Prior to sentencing, the trial court merged the three counts of aggravated murder into one count and sentenced Hoffner only in relation to Count I, the purposeful killing of Hammer with prior calculation and design. See R.C. 2903.01(A). In its sentencing opinion, the trial court set forth the two R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) capital specifications charged in Count I, and then summarized the evidence establishing Hoffner\u2019s guilt of the offenses and specifications charged. The trial court also evaluated Hoffner\u2019s mitigation evidence and, as noted above, concluded that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the modest cumulative mitigating factors. The trial court\u2019s opinion reflects the trial court\u2019s understanding of the difference between statutory aggravating circumstances and facts describing the nature and circumstances of the offense. See, e.g., <em>State v. Clemons </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 447, 696 N.E.2d 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">{\u00b6 79} Second, a trial court \u201cmay rely upon and cite the nature and circumstances of the offense as reasons supporting its finding that the aggravating circumstances were sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d <em>State v. Stumpf </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 512 N.E.2d 598, paragraph one of the syllabus. See <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 148, 538 N.E.2d 373; <em>State v. Wogenstahl </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 361, 662 N.E.2d 311. In <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>St.3d 111, 117, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, we noted that \u201cthe nature and circumstances of certain offenses will be such that no mitigating feature can be extracted.\u201d The trial court\u2019s comments here can be understood as justifying its conclusion that no mitigating value existed in the nature and circumstances of this particular offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">{\u00b6 80} Third, the trial court did not \u201ctreble\u201d the weight of the \u201csole\u201d aggravating circumstance. Two aggravating circumstances were proven, not one, and, therefore, we find no reversible error in the trial court\u2019s separate reference to kidnapping, robbery, and prior calculation and design. In relation to its guilty verdict on Count I, the jury found that Hoffner had committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design. The trial court\u2019s comments about prior calculation and design merely reflected the jury\u2019s verdict. Moreover, the evidence proved that Hoffner was a principal offender in the aggravated murder, and the trial court specifically found that Hoffner was a principal offender. The trial court\u2019s opinion does not demonstrate that the trial court weighed prior calculation and design as a separate and distinct aggravating circumstance. Cf. <em>State v. Penix </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 369, 370-372, 513 N.E.2d 744; and <em>State v. Green, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 361, 738 N.E.2d 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">{\u00b6 81} Hoffner further claims that the trial court completely ignored mitigating evidence that he has below average intelligence and cognitive reasoning. See R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). We find nothing in the record to support Hoffner\u2019s assertion. In fact, mitigation testimony included descriptions of Hoffner as \u201cvery intelligent,\u201d indicated that Hoffner\u2019s IQ test scores fell well within the average range of intelligence, and reported that Hoffner did not suffer from any neurological defects. The trial court also gave modest weight to Hoffner\u2019s personality disorders, which the mitigation testimony indicated could have affected his cognitive abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">{\u00b6 82} Finally, Hoffner suggests that the trial court gave \u201cno mitigating value\u201d to his \u201cconsistent physical abuse as a child and \u2018bizarre\u2019 family members and life experiences.\u201d However, the trial court did consider Hoffner\u2019s history, character, and background, and accorded some weight to his history and background in mitigation. Even if the trial court had assigned no value in mitigation, the weight assigned to a given factor is a matter for the discretion of the individual decisionmaker. See <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 193-194, 631 N.E.2d 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">{\u00b6 83} Accordingly, Hoffner\u2019s eighth proposition of law is overruled in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">{\u00b6 84} Hoffner contends in his twelfth proposition of law that the trial court erred in concluding that the aggravating circumstances in this case outweighed the mitigating factors. R.C. 2929.05(A) requires this court to independently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>weigh the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating factors. Therefore, we will address this argument during our independent review of Hoffner\u2019s death sentence. During our independent review, we will also address Hoffner\u2019s claim in his thirteenth proposition of law that his death sentence is neither appropriate nor proportionate to the death sentences in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Constitutional Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">{\u00b6 85} Hoffner in his tenth proposition of law raises numerous challenges to the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death penalty law. However, Ohio\u2019s capital-sentencing scheme is constitutional. See <em>State v. Evans </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 253-254, 586 N.E.2d 1042; <em>State v. Smith </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 284, 294, 574 N.E.2d 510; <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 170, 555 N.E.2d 293; <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 15, 32, 676 N.E.2d 82; and <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">{\u00b6 86} Thus, Hoffner\u2019s tenth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">{\u00b6 87} Hoffner contends in his eleventh proposition of law that the proportionality review required by R.C. 2929.05(A) is constitutionally defective. We find this claim meritless. <em>State v. Steffen, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Murphy </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 583, 605 N.E.2d 884; <em>State v. Davis </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 326, 351, 581 N.E.2d 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">{\u00b6 88} Therefore, we overrule the eleventh proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">Independent Sentence Review</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">{\u00b6 89} At the penalty hearing, Hoffner called nine mitigation witnesses, made an unsworn statement, and introduced documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">{\u00b6 90} Several family members testified on Hoffner\u2019s behalf. Timothy Hoffner was born Timothy Cade out of wedlock in June 1972. Karen Kay Mueller Dillinger, Hoffner\u2019s biological mother, testified that she abandoned Hoffner shortly after his birth and that some steprelatives, Sally and Paul Hoffner, adopted him in 1973. Karen claimed that she did not realize she was placing Hoffner for adoption and that Sally and Paul were supposed to care for Hoffner only until she was financially and physically stable. After the adoption, Karen did not see or speak to Hoffner until 1984, when Karen and Hoffner had an overnight meeting. In 1992, Hoffner lived with Karen for about a month. Karen\u2019s husband, Doug Dillinger, accused her of sleeping with Hoffner, and after leaving Dillinger briefly, Karen returned to him without Hoffner. Karen denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>ever having sexual relations with Hoffner. By the time of the trial in 1995, Karen had not seen Hoffner in almost three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">{\u00b6 91} Sally Hoffner Snyder, Hoffner\u2019s adoptive mother, testified that she and her husband, Paul, adopted Hoffner and his halfbrother, Danny, because Karen could not take care of them. Hoffner was sick and physically underdeveloped when adopted, suffered disabling headaches as a child, and exhibited mood swings. Hoffner also rocked constantly, to the point that he broke the springs of three rocking horses and wore out a rocking chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">{\u00b6 92} Sally claimed that Hoffner behaved badly growing up, fought constantly with Danny, was always in trouble at school, and once killed a cat. Because of his poor behavior, Sally and Paul would often discipline Hoffner by striking him with a belt or paddle. Sally insisted that this occurred only when Hoffner misbehaved and that he was never physically abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">{\u00b6 93} According to Sally, Hoffner\u2019s behavior worsened after her husband was diagnosed with cancer, and she claimed that Hoffner attempted suicide after Paul\u2019s death in 1987. Sally had sought psychological counseling for Hoffner as a result of his disruptive behavior. The Hoffner family also received counseling to deal with their grief from Paul\u2019s death. According to Sally, efforts to treat Hoffner were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">{\u00b6 94} Patricia Hoffner, Sally and Paul\u2019s biological daughter and Hoffner\u2019s adoptive sister, testified that she was very close to Hoffner. According to Patricia, Hoffner was very bright and articulate. Patricia admitted that her parents disciplined her with a belt, but she did not consider this physical abuse. Patricia also never saw Hoffner beaten with a belt. Patricia described an incident where her father had fondled her but stated that Hoffner never knew of this sexual incident and would not have been affected by it. Patricia agreed that Hoffner and Danny fought a lot while growing up, but she considered this normal horseplay. Patricia moved out of the Hoffner home in 1980 when Hoffner was eight years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">{\u00b6 95} Danny Hoffner, Hoffner\u2019s halfbrother, testified that when he was three or four years old, he saw Hoffner stuff a kitten into a Tonka toy. Danny admitted, however, that he did not actually witness Hoffner kill the kitten. Danny and Hoffner had a strained relationship, and they fought constantly, both verbally and physically, while growing up. Danny also did not get along with his adoptive father but did love him, and both he and Hoffner were angry when their adoptive father passed away.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">{\u00b6 96} Danny claimed that his adoptive parents beat him and Hoffner hundreds of times. While Danny agreed that punishment was sometimes warranted, he believed that the punishments were too severe. Danny said that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>previously undergone psychological counseling and was recently prescribed Prozac for clinical depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">(\u00b6 97} Danny also testified that he knew in advance that his brother and Dixon were planning to harm Hammer. Danny had warned Hammer and had tried to dissuade Hoffner from hurting Hammer. Danny also said that Dixon had threatened him and that he had been scared for his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">{\u00b6 98} Sherrie Specht, Sally\u2019s estranged halfsister and Hoffner\u2019s adoptive aunt, testified that Sally favored Danny over Hoffner and believes that Sally hates Hoffner. Sherrie noted that Hoffner was upset about his adoptive father\u2019s death and that Danny and Hoffner fought in front of the casket at Paul\u2019s funeral. After Paul died, Sherrie observed Sally and Danny together in the same bed, although Danny and Sally denied ever having sexual relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">{\u00b6 99} Additional testimony of Sally, Danny, and Patricia Hoffner provided further evidence regarding Hoffner\u2019s history and background. Hoffner grew up in a family that exhibited survivalist tendencies. The Hoffners possessed several firearms for protection, and guns were always kept loaded and unsecured in various rooms throughout the house. The house was equipped with a security system and motion detectors, and Sally testified that the neighbors were warned not to come over at night without first calling because they might get shot. The family also had two refrigerators and two commercial freezers containing a year\u2019s supply of food.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">{\u00b6 100} The Hoffner children were generally not allowed to participate in activities outside the home because their parents feared for their safety. However, after Patricia moved out of the house, she would return home to take Hoffner and Danny to the movies and shopping, and Hoffner stayed at her house many times.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">{\u00b6 101} Kirsten Wilkerson stated that Hoffner did not cause any problems while he lived at her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">{\u00b6 102} Two licensed clinical psychologists, Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon and Dr. Janice Ort, also testified for Hoffner.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">{\u00b6 103} Dr. Smalldon performed a complete neuropsychological evaluation of Hoffner to see whether Hoffner suffered from any psychotic disorders. Dr. Smalldon performed a battery of psychological tests and considered Hoffner\u2019s early history of neglect and deprivation, three incidents where Hoffner suffered head injuries, his tendency to engage in frequent, rhythmic rocking, his claim of alcohol abuse as a teenager, and allegations of physical abuse at the hands of his adoptive parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">{\u00b6 104} Dr. Smalldon concluded that Hoffner did not suffer from any structural or organic brain impairment or any formal psychotic disorder. Dr. Smalldon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>described Hoffner as \u201cvery bright\u201d and \u201cvery intelligent,\u201d and he was impressed with Hoffner\u2019s mental agility. However, Hoffner\u2019s odd, idiosyncratic behavior and his lack of appropriate emotional expression suggested a serious personality disorder. Dr. Smalldon did not perform a clinical evaluation of Hoffner and could not make a formal diagnosis of a personality disorder. Dr. Smalldon noted that Hoffner understands the difference between right and wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">{\u00b6 105} Dr. Janice Ort assessed Hoffner\u2019s psychological and intellectual functioning. Dr. Ort diagnosed Hoffner as suffering from antisocial schizotypal personality disorders. She also found that Hoffner suffered from major depression, dysthymia (a lengthy form of depression attributable to his adoptive father\u2019s death), and alcohol and cannabis abuse. Dr. Ort also noted that the Navy discharged Hoffner because he suffered from a nonspecific personality disorder. Dr. Ort believed that Hoffner\u2019s abusive, neglected upbringing and dysfunctional family contribute to his personality disorders and that these disorders impaired his behavior and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">{\u00b6 106} On cross-examination, Dr. Ort admitted that Hoffner\u2019s incarceration could have exacerbated his depression. Dr. Ort also agreed that Hoffner knows the difference between right and wrong and that he is capable of conforming his behavior to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">{\u00b6 107} Additionally, Sally Ann Walters, Chief of the Bureau of Sentence Computation for the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, testified as to the length of time that Hoffner would remain incarcerated if the jury recommended a life sentence. Walters concluded that under a life sentence with parole eligibility after 30 years and with maximum, consecutive sentences for his other convictions, Hoffner would serve a minimum of 46.3 years before parole eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">{\u00b6 108} In his unsworn statement, Hoffner told the jury, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I\u2019ve done and I know that\u2019s not enough. I liked Chris. I wish I could take it back. I know I need to be punished for what I\u2019ve done. Thank you.\u201d Hoffner also submitted for the jury\u2019s consideration defense counsel\u2019s letter to the prosecutor offering to plead guilty to all charges if the death penalty specifications were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">{\u00b6 109} In his twelfth proposition of law, Hoffner contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors. In the thirteenth proposition of law, Hoffner challenges the proportionality of his death sentence. Based on our independent review, we overrule Hoffner\u2019s propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">{\u00b6 110} After independent assessment, we find that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt the two R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) aggravating circumstances charged against Hoffner. Hoffner murdered Hammer during the commission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>an aggravated robbery and during a kidnapping and was a principal offender in the aggravated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">{\u00b6 111} Upon a review of the evidence in mitigation, we find nothing in the nature and circumstances of the offenses to be mitigating. Hoffner, along with codefendant Dixon, brutally beat Hammer, tied him to a bunk-bed ladder, and robbed him of his automobile and personal papers. When Hoffner\u2019s attempts to break Hammer\u2019s neck failed, Hoffner and Dixon drove him to a remote area and buried him alive. Dixon then assumed Hammer\u2019s identity, sold his car, and shared the proceeds with Hoffner.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">{\u00b6 112} In contrast, we find that Hoffner\u2019s history and background provide some mitigating features. Hoffner had a troubled and dysfunctional upbringing. Hoffner was neglected and abandoned by his birth mother. Throughout childhood, Hoffner was angry and spiteful toward his adoptive mother. Hoffner began performing poorly in school after his adoptive father was diagnosed with cancer, and Hoffner was adversely affected by his death. Hoffner did not graduate from high school but did obtain his GED while incarcerated for Hammer\u2019s murder. While growing up, Hoffner was routinely disciplined by corporal punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">{\u00b6 113} In addition, Hoffner\u2019s bizarre home life warrants consideration. Hoffner grew up in a home heavily protected with loaded firearms and other security measures. Loaded guns were readily accessible to the Hoffner children. The Hoffner children also were prohibited from engaging in normal social activities outside the home. This survivalist and isolationist mentality was enhanced by the family\u2019s practice of stocking an overabundance of food in refrigerators and commercial freezers.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">{\u00b6 114} We have found in other cases where defendants had backgrounds similar to or worse than Hoffner\u2019s that such mitigation was insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances. Cf. <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 48, 50-54, 765 N.E.2d 334; <em>State v. Biros </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 426, 455-457, 678 N.E.2d 891; <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 41-42, 544 N.E.2d 895. In this case, we find that Hoffner\u2019s history and background are entitled to only slight mitigating weight. See, e.g., <em>State v. Hanna, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 285, 2002-Ohio-2221, 767 N.E.2d 678, at \u00b6 147-167; <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 357, 744 N.E.2d 1163. In contrast to his history and background, we find nothing in Hoffner\u2019s character to be mitigating.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">{\u00b6 115} Hoffner established the following statutory mitigating factors. At the time of the offense, Hoffner was 21 years old. Therefore, his youth is entitled to weight under R.C. 2929.04(B)(4). See id.; <em>State v. Jones, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 357, 744 N.E.2d 1163; and <em>State v. Brown, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 51, 2003-Ohio-5059, 796 N.E.2d 506, at \u00b6 59. Hoffner had one juvenile conviction for petty theft and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>thus, we conclude that his lack of a significant history of criminal convictions and juvenile adjudications is entitled to significant weight in mitigation. R.C. 2929.04(B)(5). See <em>State v. White </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 433, 454, 709 N.E.2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">{\u00b6 116} We find no other statutory mitigating factors applicable: R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) (inducement by victim); (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provocation); (B)(3) (mental disease or defect); and (B)(6) (accomplice only).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">{\u00b6 117} As to the R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) \u201cother factors,\u201d we accord no weight to the testimony regarding the length of sentence Hoffner would serve before parole eligibility. See, e.g., <em>State v. White, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 448-449, 709 N.E.2d 140. We accord only minimal weight to Hoffner\u2019s offer to plead guilty to the charges in exchange for the prosecutor\u2019s dismissing the death penalty specifications from the indictment, as Hoffner knew that the evidence against him was overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">{\u00b6 118} Hoffner\u2019s personality disorders, his depression, his abuse of alcohol and marijuana, and his confession collectively deserve some weight in mitigation. See, e.g., <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 381, 400-401, 659 N.E.2d 292. Cf. <em>State v. Biros, 78 </em>Ohio St.3d at 457, 678 N.E.2d 891 (defendant\u2019s personality disorder, lifelong alcohol dependence, and depression collectively entitled to some, but very little, weight in mitigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">{\u00b6 119} Hoffner, however, confessed only after he was implicated and taken into custody, and he had previously misled police as to his involvement. See, e.g., <em>Wilson, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 401, 659 N.E.2d 292. In addition, personality disorders that, like Hoffner\u2019s, result from a troubled and dysfunctional upbringing, are often accorded little weight when they do not cause mental illness so severe as to inhibit a defendant\u2019s ability to control his actions. Id. As to Hoffner\u2019s severe depression, it is, at best, a weak mitigating factor. See, e.g., <em>State v. White, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 456, 709 N.E.2d 140. Testimony suggested that his incarceration could have exacerbated his depression, and it is unclear what role, if any, his depression played in these crimes. Similarly, it has not been shown that Hoffner\u2019s substance abuse affected his judgment or played a part in the murder. Cf., <em>State v. Hartman, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 306, 754 N.E.2d 1150. Finally, we accord little weight to Hoffner\u2019s expression of remorse in his unsworn statement. See, e.g., <em>State v. Keene </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 646, 671, 693 N.E.2d 246 (\u201cretrospective remorse\u201d entitled to little weight in mitigation); <em>State v. Stumpf, </em>32 Ohio St.3d at 106, 512 N.E.2d 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">{\u00b6 120} In summary, Hoffner\u2019s collective mitigation evidence is relatively modest when compared with the aggravating circumstances. Based on the evidence, we conclude that the aggravating circumstances of this murder during a kidnapping and robbery outweigh Hoffner\u2019s combined mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we find that the death penalty is appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>{\u00b6 121} Finally, we find that the death penalty imposed here is proportionate to death sentences approved in similar cases. See, e.g., <em>State v. Coley </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 253, 273, 754 N.E.2d 1129; <em>State v. Moore </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 22, 44, 689 N.E.2d 1; <em>State v. Henness </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 53, 69, 679 N.E.2d 686; <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 531, 605 N.E.2d 70; and <em>State v. Roe </em>(1989), 41 Ohio St.3d 18, 28-29, 535 N.E.2d 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">{\u00b6 122} For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the convictions and sentences, including the sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b534-7\">Moyer, C.J., Blackmon, F.E.
