Jennings, of four counts of gross sexual imposition and sentenced him to seven years in prison. On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed. <em>State v. Jennings </em>(Sept. 13, 2001), Franklin App. No. 00AP-1283, 2001 WL 1045490.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">{\u00b6 2} On September 12, 2003, Jennings filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Warren County for a writ of habeas corpus to compel his release from prison. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Jennings claimed that his trial court lacked jurisdiction to convict and sentence him because the R.C. 2901.13 statute of limitations had expired before the state\u2019s prosecution had commenced. Appellee, Warren Correctional Institution Warden Wanza Jackson, moved to dismiss the petition. On November 6, 2003, the court of appeals granted Jackson\u2019s motion and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AsK\">Ellis L.
