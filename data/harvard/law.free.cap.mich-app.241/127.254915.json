We reversed, <em>In re Parole of Glover, </em>226 Mich App 655; 575 NW2d 772 (1997), finding that the Parole Board\u2019s explanation for its decision did not satisfy federal and state due process requirements. Finding that there was no statute requiring the Parole Board to provide a written explanation for its decision, we nonetheless felt that constitutional due process requirements demanded a written explanation stating the Parole Board\u2019s reasons for denying parole. In addition, we held that the Parole Board had violated the Open Meetings Act, MCL 15.261 <em>et seq.-, </em>MSA 4.1800(11) <em>et seq., </em>by failing to give public notice before rendering its final decision and, further, that no ex post facto violation had occurred. We remanded the matter to the Parole Board for preparation of a written explanation of its reasons for denying parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>The Supreme Court granted the Parole Board\u2019s application for leave to appeal our decision. <em>Glover v Parole Bd, </em>458 Mich 867 (1998). The Supreme Court reversed this Court\u2019s ruling, yet affirmed our remand to the Parole Board for a more detailed explanation of its reasons for denying parole. <em>Glover v Parole Bd, </em>460 Mich 511; 596 NW2d 598 (1999). The Supreme Court held that such an explanation was required by then MCL 791.234(8); MSA 28.2304(8), not by the due process principles on which we relied. The Court ordered us to consider petitioner\u2019s appeal upon receipt of the Parole Board\u2019s explanation. Upon review of the Parole Board\u2019s written explanation for denying petitioner\u2019s request for parole, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\">At the time relevant to this appeal, MCL 791.234(8); MSA 28.2304(8) provided that an inmate\u2019s release on parole is discretionary with the Parole Board. The decision to grant or deny parole is reviewed for a clear abuse of discretion. MCR 7.104(D)(5)(b); <em>In re Parole of Roberts, </em>232 Mich App 253, 257; 591 NW2d 259 (1998). An abuse of discretion will generally be found where an unprejudiced person, considering the facts on which the decisionmaker acted, would say there is no justification or excuse for the ruling. <em>People v Ullah, </em>216 Mich App 669, 673; 550 NW2d 568 (1996). The board may not grant a prisoner parole unless it \u201chas reasonable assurance, after consideration of all of the facts and circumstances, including the prisoner\u2019s mental and social attitude, that the prisoner will not become a menace to society or to the public safety.\u201d MCL 791.233(l)(a); MSA 28.2303(l)(a). Petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating an abuse of discretion, and this Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Parole Board. MCR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>7.104(D)(5); <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor v Parole Bd, </em>210 Mich App 148, 153-154; 532 NW2d 899 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Petitioner is serving three concurrent life sentences. She was convicted in 1976 pursuant to a plea agreement of one count of second-degree murder and two counts of assault with intent to commit murder stemming from a gas station robbery she committed with her codefendant husband. They were stopped from removing cash from the register by employees and others and, while they were awaiting the arrival of the police, petitioner was allowed to use the restroom. She retrieved a handgun she had hidden in a toilet tank, and passed the gun to her husband, who then shot three men. One victim died immediately and a second died one year later.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The survivor of the shooting testified at the parole hearing that, even though petitioner stresses that she was merely an accomplice and that her husband did the actual shooting, the shooting would not have occurred had she not brought the gun back into the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Around July 30, 1993, a majority of the Parole Board voted \u201cinterest\u201d in proceeding to a public hearing on petitioner\u2019s request for parole. On May 25, 1994, a public hearing was held for the purpose of gathering public comment for consideration in deciding whether the Parole Board should grant parole to petitioner. Petitioner had served eighteen years at that time. The Parole Board received evidence and heard extensive testimony both for and against granting petitioner parole, which has been reviewed by this Court and the Supreme Court in our respective opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>ions. Regardless of petitioner\u2019s admirable efforts at self-improvement, family and friends of the victims, as well as members of the community, voiced strong opposition to petitioner\u2019s parole for various reasons, not the least of which was the loss of their loved ones. On July 15, 1994, the Parole Board, in executive session, voted to withdraw interest and deny parole; petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">On remand to the Parole Board, copies of the presentence investigation report (psi) and of the public hearing transcript were distributed to board members. The Parole Board met on February 9, 1998, and voted to affirm its July 15, 1994, denial of parole. In rendering its decision, the board reviewed the PSI and the public hearing transcript, and discussed the positive and negative aspects of petitioner\u2019s prison record. The board made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">A. Mary Glover continues to minimize her involvement in the offense; for example, her description of the crime as being \u201cimpulsive\u201d on her part, the abusive relationship with her husband/co-defendant, and her self-described victimization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">B. Mary Glover has minimized her behavior by failing to accept responsibility for her negative conduct during her earlier years of incarceration.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">C. The strong public opposition to parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The Supreme Court held that, upon remand for an explanation of its reasons, \u201cthe parole board is not required to provide extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law, nor do we insist upon legal opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>ions when it denies or grants a life prisoner parole. Rather, the board should simply indicate what it relied on in reaching its decision.\u201d <em>Glover, supra, </em>460 Mich 525. The Parole Board has satisfied the minimal explanation requirements directed by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The board decried petitioner\u2019s failure to take responsibility for her role in the crime and for her actions during her incarceration. The Parole Board properly considered petitioner\u2019s personal history and growth, including whether she \u201c[d]emonstrated willingness to accept responsibility for past behavior.\u201d 1999 AC, R 791.7715(2)(d)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The record also reflects that the board received numerous letters and heard testimony in opposition to parole by the surviving victim, relatives of the victims, and members of the community. The board also was presented with a petition signed by approximately 1,200 people opposed, in principle, to parole for any prisoner serving a life sentence. This evidence supports the board\u2019s finding of strong public opposition to parole. It is for the board to assess this evidence and weigh it against the positive evidence presented by petitioner. MCR 7.104(D)(5); <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor, supra </em>at 153-154. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-7\"> Although some people stated at the parole hearing that they believed the second victim died from his injuries, the death certificate indicated \u201cviral hepatitis\u201d as the cause of death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-10\"> Petitioner apparently amassed twenty-nine misconducts during the first fifteen years of her incarceration, including two sexual misconducts that she denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
