The plaintiff, in his declaration, after setting forth the condition of the bond, averred, that the ccllai wall and chimneys, did, on the 1st <em>January, </em>1800, settle, give way, and fall down, and that the defendant, though, often requested, did not rebuild the same, nor pay the damages, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>The defendant pleaded <em>non est factum ; </em>and traversed the breach assigned^ and the request to rebuild, or pay the damages;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-7\">The cause was tried at the <em>Rensselaer </em>circuit, in <em>October </em>last before Mr. Justice <em>Yates.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-8\">The plaintiff proved, that the chimneys settled and cracked, so that they took fire; that the defendant lived within thirty rods of the <em>house; </em>that the fire was a subject of public conversation in the neighbourhood, and that the defendant was frequently at the house, after the fire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-9\">A witness testified^ that about a year before, Messrs. <em>Comstock </em>and <em>Walworth </em>called on the defendant to repair the wall and chimneys, and demanded payment for the damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-10\">The judge was of opinion, that to entitle the plaintiff to recover, it was requisite for him to prove a notice to the defendant of the situation of the wall and chimneys, and a request to repair them according to the condition of the bond.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-11\">The plaintiff then offered to prove that <em>Comstock </em>and <em>Walworth </em>had purchased the house of him in 1800, and that he assigned the bond of the defendant to them, by an indorsement thereon, under his hand and seal, and that notice thereof was given to the defendant; that a short time before the present action was commenced, the defendant went to the house and examined the situation of the wall and chimneys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-12\">The judge decided that this evidence was inadmissible, and that a notice and request to the defendant from the plaintiff himself must be proved, before the plaintiff could recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-13\">The plaintiff was thereupon nonsuited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-14\">A motion was made to set aside the nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b416-15\"><em>Russel, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abx\">No notice of the happening of an event is necessary to be given, where it is public., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>mid notorious, and must be within the knowledge of the party.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-4\">Where the obligor is in a situation to know the happening of the event on which he is to be liable, he is bound to take notice of it, and the obligee need not give him notice. In <em>Peel </em>and others v. Tatlock,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> where the defendant was bound for the fidelity of a clerk, it was held, that an action lay against the surety, for the embezzlement of the clerk, three years after the fact happened, \u2022and though no notice was given of the embezzlement to the obligor, until the action was brought by the obligee on the bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-5\">But admitting such notice to be requisite, before an action is commenced, we contend, that the assignees of the bond, in the present case, were competent to give the notice <em>; </em>for this court have decided, that they will take notice of the rights of an assignee of a <em>chose in action;</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and this case comes within the spirit of that decision.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-12\"><em>Foot </em>and <em>Skinner, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9T\">It is admitted, that where the obligor must, from his situation, be supposed to know the fact, no notice is <em>necessary; </em>but this case does not come within that rule, for there is nothing in the defendant\u2019s situation, on which to ground, necessarily, a presumption of knowledge. Where a notice is essential, and necessary to be proved, the common words in a declaration, \u201c though often requested,\u201d See. are not sufficient ; but a notice must be specially averred. An there was no averment of notice, none could be proved at the trial. The terms of the contract show the necessity of notice; for the obligor is to rebuild, and pay the damages, arising from, a defect or failure of the wall or chimneys.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0Q\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>It is true, that rights of assignees are to be protected.

The assignees were the proper persons to give such notice ; they alone were beneficially interested in the covenant. It was proved that the defendants had notice of the assignment. It has been repeatedly decided, and well settled, both in our own, and in the <em>English </em>courts, that the right of an assignee of a <em>chose in action, </em>will be recognised, and protected. (3 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>462.) If notice of the breach in this case was necessary, the assignor, might have refused to give such notice; and if the assignees could not, the covenant would, thereby, become nugatory. The defendant\u2019s counsel, upon the argument, seemed to admit,, that the assignees were the proper persons to give notice, but contended that the proof was inadmissible, for want of a proper averment in the declaration. This objection, however, cannot prevail: the proof was in support of one of the issues in the cause ; and whether the declaration contains a sufficient averment, is a question which must arise on a motion in arrest of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>We are, accordingly, of opinion, that the nonsuit must be set aside, with cqsts to abide the event of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Rule granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
