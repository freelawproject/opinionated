There would be no end of new trials on that ground. (2 <em>Salk. </em>653. 12. <em>Mod. </em>584. <em>Sayer, 27. </em>3 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>255.) The newly discovered evidence is to impeach the character of the daughter, who was. a witness at the trial. There is another objection to the affidavit in this case. It states merely, that the persons mentioned had <em>told </em>the party what they coiild say. There can be no reliance on such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>declarations; nor could the persons, at the trial, be obliged to answer whether they ever had such criminal connection with the daughter. The motion must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Rule refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
