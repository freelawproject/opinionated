The cause was tried at the <em>Orange </em>circuit, before Mr. Justice Thompson, the 5th September, 1808, when a verdict was taken for the plaintiff, by consent, subject to the opinion of the court, on a case containing the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-15\"><em>George Denniston </em>died seised of the premises in question, on or about the 10th January, 1804, having previously made his will, dated the 21st December, 1803. There were three subscribing witnesses to the will, one of whom, <em>George Denniston, </em>was a son, and a devisee of the testator. The defendant is the widow of <em>George Dennis-</em>ton, the witness, and in possession of the premises devised by the will to <em>James </em>Denniston, who was also a witness to the will. <em>James Denniston </em>and <em>James M, </em>Wilkins, by their deed, dated the 2d September, 1808, conveyed the premises to the defendant. The lessors of the plaintiff are heirs at law of <em>George </em>Denniston, the testator, and claim two-sixths of the premises. <em>James Denniston, </em>at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>he subscribed the will as a witness, was an infant, and is now about 20 years of age. There was no proof of any actual ouster by the defendant, except her declaration made before the commencement of the present suit, that the lessors were not entitled to any part of the premises.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AAyc\"><em>Fisk, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aruu\">insisted, that the devise to <em>James Denniston, </em>the witness to the will, was void ; and that the premises having descended to the lessors, as the heirs at law of <em>George Denniston, </em>the plaintiff was entitled to recover. He relied on the 12th section of the statute concerning wills, by which a devise or bequest to a witness to a will, is declared to be void, as regards such witness.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AUV9\">\n<em>J. Radcliff</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvLY\">observed, that he did not deny the general rule as founded on the statute, but the question was, whether a witness to a will could not, by a conveyance to a third person, so divest himself of his interest, as to be a competent witness at the time of his examination, though not so before.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> If the devise was void, <em>ab </em>initio, then, indeed, there must be an end to the question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adi\">He contended also, that the lessors of the plaintiff, if entitled to recover, must be considered as tenants in common, and that without proving an actual ouster, they could not maintain this action.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A2P\"> <em>Jackson, ex dem.

It makes the devise to the witness void, and, of course, no title can exist under it. As the defendant claims under a sale by the witness, as devisee, her title must be void.</p>\n<p id=\"A7ST\">The lessors claim an undivided part only, and if they show title to any part, they will recover <em>pro tanto. </em>If the defendant meant to set up a tide as tenant in common, she ought to have entered into the common rule <em>specially. </em>As she has not done so, it was not necessary for the plaintiff to prove an actual ouster. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AzRs\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Anq\"> See <em>Sellon\u2019s Pr. </em>190. 3 <em>Burr. </em>1895.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
