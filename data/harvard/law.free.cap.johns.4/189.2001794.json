The declaration was in the usual form, and the defendants pleaded, first, the general issue ; secondly, that they well and truly kept and performed, all the covenants, articles, &amp;c. contained in the condition of the bond, &amp;c. and concluded with a verification. The plaintiff replied generally, that the defendants had not kept and performed all the covenants, articles, &amp;c. contained in the conditions of the said bond. On this issue, the cause was tried at the <em>Ulster </em>circuit, in June, 1806, and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, for six cents damages, and six cents costs.
