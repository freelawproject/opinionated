No formal notice of a waiver of hail is necessary.</headnotes>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ApV\">GOLD,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajuv\">in behalf of the defendants in this cause, moved, that the proceedings in the cause should be set aside, and an <em>exoneretur </em>entered on the bail-piece, in the original cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-5\">The defendants were sued as bail to the sheriff in an action brought by the plaintiffs against one Denniston. They became special bail in the cause, and the bail-piece was filed in the clerk\u2019s office on the 30th <em>November, </em>1807. An <em>exception </em>was entered on the bail-piece without date, notice of which was given on the 9th December, 1807. A declaration was filed, <em>de bene esse, </em>in the same suit, on the 8th <em>January, </em>1808, and a rule to plead entered. The defendants did not attempt to justify, nor was any other bail substituted in the i cause. On the 5th <em>July, </em>1808, a default was entered, on which an interlocutory judgment was entered, on the 5th <em>August, </em>1808. A final judgment was obtained, andth\u00e9 same signed and docketed, on the 2d <em>September, </em>1808. To recover the amount of this judgment, the present suit was brought against the defendants, as the bail of <em>Denniston, </em>who had become insolvent, and was in prison, in Philadelphia. It appeared, that the exception entered on the bail-piece, had never been erased, nor had any notice been given to the defendants, that it had been waived by the plaintiffs. <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Leite </em>(4 Burr. 2107.) was cited,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-6\">Henry, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b197-7\"><em>Per </em>Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"APJ\">The defendants were entitled to man\u00e9 this application at any time; and they have applied, as soon as they were called on, as bail. The case of <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Leite </em>(4 Burr. 2107.) is in point. There has been a waiver of bail in this case, and no formal notice of the waiver was necessary. The motion must be granted, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Rule granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
