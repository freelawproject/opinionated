A covenant, of itself imports' a consideration.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-12\">THIS was an action of <em>covenant. </em>The declaration stated, that on the 25th <em>July, </em>1792, one <em>Thomas Berry, </em>executed a bond to the plaintiff, for 96/. conditioned to pay 48/. on the 1st <em>November, </em>1798, with the interest yearly, to be calculated from the 1st <em>November, </em>1791; that on the 3d December, 1807, the defendant executed a writing, under his hand and seal by which he covenanted, and promised to and with the plaintiff, that the principal and interest of the bond given by Berry, should be paid to the plaintiff, in twelve months thereafter, &amp;c. averring a breach, &amp;c. with the common conclusion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-13\">There was a general <em>demurrer </em>to the declaration, and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-14\">Sudam, in support of the demurrer, contended, that as this was a promise, on the face of it, to pay the debt of another, and without consideration, it was void by the Statute of frauds. It being under the hand and seal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>the party, made no difference; for where the promise, on the face of it, is void by the statute, a seal cannot render it valid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABy\">. In <em>Low </em>v. Peers,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it was decided, that although from the deliberation and solemnity which accompanies the . <em>\u00a1. </em>i,,, . , execution 01 a deed, the law, presumes a consideration: yet, that this doctrine applies only where the deed is good on the face of it: for a consideration cannot be presumed to support a deed, which is void on the face of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-15\">This court have decided, that the consideration, as well as the promise, should be in writing.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> If the statute requires that the consideration should be in writing, or expressed on the face of the agreement, it cannot be implied from the mere seal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b429-19\">Hawkins, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AreF\">The cases of <em>Sears </em>v. Brink, and <em>Bailey </em>and <em>Bogert </em>v. Freeman, were on simple contracts. It is evident from the reasoning of the court, in the case of Jackson, <em>ex dem. Hudson </em>and others, v. Alexander,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> that the court did not intend to apply the doctrine to deeds, or sealed instruments, which, in themselves, import a consideration. This distinction between contracts by deed, and by <em>parol, </em>is well settled. The former are not within the statute of frauds.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AOx\"> 4 <em>Burr. </em>2225. <em>Wilmot, </em>564.

The statute of frauds was-never meant to alter the common law. Any promise, under <em>seal </em>was valid at common law. The <em>seal </em>imports a consideration, as much as if it was expressed in so many words. The statute of frauds says merely, that a promise to pay the debt of another, shall not be valid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>unless in writing. The statute has no application to a writing under seal.</p>\n<author id=\"b430-10\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AWy\">The promise to pay, in this case, was in writing and under seal, and is not, therefore, within the statute of frauds, nor any decision under it. The covenant, of itself, conclusively imports a consideration, so that it is not necessary that it should be set forth in the deed. The plaintiff is entitled to judgment, but the defendant has leave to withdraw his demurrer, on payment of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
