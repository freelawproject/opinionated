On the 2d <em>July </em>last, the attorney of O'Neal, sent to the attorney of the plaintiff, a notice of his being employed to defend the suit, and at the same time, during the same month, sent copies of the consent rule and plea, which were <em>not </em>received until after a default was entered, and were therefore refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-16\">The attorney of <em>O'Neal, </em>in his affidavit, stated that he did not obtain the declaration which had been served, until some time in <em>July, </em>and that, by the next post, he sent the consent rules and plea to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, who lives fifty miles from him, and that until he saw the declaration, he did not know who the fictitious parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>were ; and that he was not informed until the 9th <em>August, </em>that the default had been entered, when he offered to pay all the costs, if the plaintiff\u2019s attorney would waive the default, and accept a plea, which he refused to do. The tenant also swore that he had a good and substantial defence on the merits.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b502-7\">Hawkins, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-J\">cited <em>Col. </em>Cases, 90. 1 Caines, 155. 3 Caines, 107.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b502-9\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A8M\">The excuse given by the attorney of the defendant, for not entering into the consent rule in season, is frivolous and inadmissible. But here the tenant swears to merits ; and as no trial has been lost, we will not let the possession be changed, in an action of ejectment, without an opportunity to the tenant to defend it. It was said, in the case of Jackson, <em>ex dem. </em>Rosekrans, v. Stiles, (1 Caines, 503.) that the court would set aside a default, to protect the possession of the tenant, in an action of ejectment, when they would not do it in any other action. We, therefore, grant the y motion, on payment of costs, and on the tenant\u2019s entering into the consent rule, and pleading within 10 days, so \u25a0that the cause may be tried at the ensuing circuit in <em>Ulster.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">Rule granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
