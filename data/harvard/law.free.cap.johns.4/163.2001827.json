On the 25th <em>Au</em>gust, 1771, the governor of New-York, wrote to the commander in chief in Canada, inclosing a copy of his proclamation, made pursuant to the order of the council, of the 13th of the same month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-4\">It also appeared from the minutes of the council, that in December, 1771, the commander in chief of the province of Canada, transmitted to the governor of the province of New-York, abstracts taken from the public register, deposited with the secretary of the province of Canada, which were closely searched, containing the grantees\u2019 names, those of the new proprietors, the dates of the grants, and of their ratifications, those granted <em>en </em>seigneurie, and those <em>en </em>roture, (in socage,) and copies of the <em>French </em>king\u2019s edicts and declarations, relative to grants of lands which had the form of law. From these it appeared that the governor and intendant, or in case of their death or absence, those who executed their offices, had the power of granting lands, to be ratified by the king in twelve months, and were the sole judges, in case of a reunion to the royal demesne, where the grantors had not complied with the conditions of their grants, which reunion, however, did not take place until after a hearing upon legal process, issued at the instance of the king\u2019s attorney-general.

By an arret of the king, dated the 17th <em>July, </em>1743, the governor and intendant of <em>Canada, </em>and <em>Netv France, </em>were directed to cause all the grants of lands forfeited, to be reunited ; and the rules were particularly laid down, by which the proceedings, in cases of the reunion of grants, were to be regulated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ado\">It appeared, also, that at a superior council, held at the castle of St. <em>Louis, </em>in <em>Quebec, </em>the 10th of <em>May, </em>1741, at the instance of the attorney-general, proceedings were had in regard to various grants, alleged to be forfeited to the crown; and the court pronounced judgment of reunion, amongst others, for the lands granted, on the 11th <em>April, </em>1733, to <em>La Gauchetiere.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AS70\">The plaintiff also produced a copy of a conveyance, dated 14th <em>September, </em>1726, from the sachems of the five nations, confirming and ratifying the surrender of all their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>lands to the king of <em>Great </em>Britain, made the 19th <em>July, 1701, </em>to be protected, and defended for the use of the five nations, their heirs and successors ; a copy of a paper, filed in the secretary\u2019s office, indorsed 1688, purporting to be a report of certain commissioners of the king of <em>England, </em>by which it appears, that his majesty had considered the five nations as his subjects, pursuant to a voluntary submission by them to die crown of <em>England, </em>made the 30th <em>July, </em>1684, before the governor of <em>Virginia, </em>and <em>New-York, </em>and was determined to protect them as his subjects, against the French.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-6\">Several other papers were produced, to show the submission of the five nations to the <em>English </em>government, and the protection afforded them, and also the opposition made by the governors of the <em>English </em>colonies, to the encroachments of the <em>French, </em>and particularly to the building of the fort at <em>Crown Point, </em>and on <em>Lake Champlain.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\">The defendant, also produced the following papers : a certificate of a survey, made, the 21st <em>February, </em>1766, by one <em>P.

The lessor claims under the patent from the province of <em>New-York </em>to <em>Dean, </em>in 1769. It is admitted, that the premises in question lie within the boundaries of that patent; it follows, that the plaintiff must recover, unless the defendant can show that the grant to <em>Dean </em>is inoperative. This he has attempted to do, by setting up two grants from the <em>French Canadian </em>government, one to <em>Da la Gauchetiere, </em>in <em>April, </em>1733, and the other to the <em>Sicur Estebe, </em>in <em>January, </em>1744. <em>The act of reunion, </em>by the government of <em>Canada, </em>in <em>May, 1741 ? </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>confirmed by the <em>arret </em>of the king of France, has annulled the grant to <em>De la Gauchetiere. </em>As there can be no doubt of the reunion of this grant, from the documents produced, and that it was done according to the laws of France, or the royal edicts, it is presumed that the first ground of defence must be abandoned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-3\">2. It is well known, that about the year 1731, the French, in <em>Canada </em>and Louisiana, commenced a system of encroachments on the <em>English </em>colonies in America, for the purpose of confining the <em>English </em>to a narrow limit of territory along the sea coast, and to connect the <em>French </em>colonies together, so as to surround the <em>English </em>on the west. In the same year, the <em>French </em>took possession of <em>Crown </em>Point, and from that time, until the peace of 1763, made grants on both sides of lake <em>Champlain </em>and the river Chambly, comprehending all the lands on both sides of the lake and river. All these grants, it will be contended on the part of the defendant, are protected by the capitulation of Montreal, in 1760, and the treaty of peace, in 1763. The extent of the country comprehended in these grants, renders the cause of great importance, and will excuse the counsel for the plaintiff for taking a wider field of argument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-4\">We contend, that by a just construction of the <em>capitulation </em>of Montreal, and the treaty, they do not extend to the premises in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-5\">The 37th article of <em>the capitulation of Montreal </em>declares, that the inhabitants of <em>Canada </em>shall preserve the property and possession of their goods, or estates, moveable or immoveable. This article can apply only to the country of which the <em>French </em>were then possessed, and which they surrendered by that capitulation. It cannot extend to the country which they may have possessed at anytime before, and which they called Canada. The history of this country shows, that at some periods <em>the French </em>advanced on the <em>English </em>colonies, and, at others, the <em>English </em>colonists gained on the <em>French; </em>and capitulations between the two colonial governments have been made at different times. In the year 1759, the <em>English </em>had made considerable advances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>on the French, in various quarters, and had gained possession of all the country on Lake Champlain, as far as the <em>Isle aux Noix, </em>which is beyond the 45th degree of north latitude. The <em>English </em>were, then, in actual possession of the country, comprehending the premises in question, for twelve months prior to the capitulation of <em>Montreal.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq4X\">But preliminary conventions made between belligerents, relative to the territories of each, are subject to the final and more solemn stipulations of the definitive treaty of peace. By the 4th article of the treaty of <em>Paris, </em>the king <em>of France </em>ceded to the king of <em>Great Britain, </em>the whole of <em>Canada, </em>in full sovereignty. The latter stipulates, that the subjects of <em>France, </em>in <em>Canada, </em>may retire, and for that purpose may sell their estates to <em>British </em>subjects. The right to emigrate is limited, however, to 18 months, and the treaty secured only a right to sell, in case the <em>French </em>emigrated within 18 months. In every other respect, the property of the people of <em>Canada, </em>belonged to the king of <em>Great Britain, to </em>be disposed of according to the laws and usages of nations. As in the present case, there was no emigration or sale within the 18 months, the property in question is not protected by the treaty of <em>Paris.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARK\">Then, if the grant has any effect, it must be under the law of nations. Now, by a simple conquest, ratified by a treaty of peace, the possessors of the conquered country are all at the mercy of the conqueror. It is true, that according to the general usage of nations, the possessor of property, in a conquered country, on consenting to become a subject to the new government, acquires an imperfect right to his property. It is, however, in the discretion of the victor, to recognise this right or not. In the present case, there has been no recognition of these <em>French </em>grants, on the part of the <em>British </em>government. On the contrary, it appears from the acts and proceedings of the colonial government of <em>New-York, </em>that these grants were not allowed ; and that by the grant to <em>Dean, </em>the property in question was considered as a part of the domains of the <em>English </em>crown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>3. But admitting that the <em>capitulation of Montreal </em>is operative, and comprehended the property in question ; still, after the conquest and cession, the possessor of the <em>French </em>grant could retain nothing more than an <em>equitable </em>or <em>presumptive </em>right to a confirmatory grant from the <em>British </em>government. It never can be supposed that the <em>French </em>possessor was to hold his lands, according to the terns of the original grant, a tenure so different from those of <em>England. </em>It was a tenure <em>en </em>seigneurie, somewhat analogous to the ancient <em>English </em>tenure <em>in chivalry. </em>The holder was to pay <em>faith </em>and homage, at the castle of <em>St. </em>Louis, in Quebec, and all other dues, according to <em>the custom of Paris. </em>He was invested with the power of holding courts of justice ; and by the <em>arrets </em>of the <em>French </em>king, he could not transfer his seignory, and was bound to grant his lands at a reasonable ground-rent. By the construction of the capitulation and treaty, for which I contend, the property is so far saved, that the grantee has a prior and equitable claim to a confirmatory grant from the new government. That this is the just construction, is evident from the opinions of the council of the colony of New-York, expressed at various times, and from the practice in similar cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-4\">By the 3d article of the capitulation between the <em>Dutch </em>governor of <em>New-York </em>and the <em>English </em>deputies, by which the former surrendered the possession of <em>New-Netherlands, </em>in <em>August, </em>1664, it was stipulated, that \u201c all the <em>Dutch </em>people should continue free denizens, and enjoy their lands, houses, and goods wheresoever they were in the country, and dispose of them as they pleased;\"<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> yet we find, that the first act of <em>Nicolls, </em>the new governor under the duke of <em>York, </em>was to issue grants of confirmation <em>to </em>the <em>Dutch </em>patentees.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-5\">4. But we contend further, that an act of reunion of the grant to <em>Estebe, </em>is to be presumed. The grant to <em>Estebe </em>was in 1744. It is evident, from the tenor of these grants, that the great object was to have the lands settled, as the strength and safety of the colony depended on the increase of settlements. There is no evidence of any settlement at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>tempted on the land comprised within the grant, until after treaty in 1763, nor any survey thereof made. It is certain that there had been, long before, a breach of the conditions on which the grant was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-4\">[He then went into a minute examination of all the facts and circumstances of the case, from which an act of reunion was to be presumed.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-5\">Should it be said, that if there was an act of reunion, the record might be produced ; it may be answered, that since the date of the grant, there have been three wars in Canada, and it is probable, that the records have been lost by some of the many casualties incident to a state of war. It would be for the interest of the <em>French </em>subjects to destroy these records ; and before, or at the time of the treaty of peace, they were probably suppressed by them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqo6\">Again, as the king of <em>Great Britain, </em>by the cession in 1763, acquired all the rights of the <em>crown of </em>France, and the grant had become forfeited by the non-performance of the condition, it reverted to the crown, and belonged to the king of England, without any <em>office </em>found.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOz\">5. The lands for which the grant to <em>Estebe </em>was issued, are not within the capitulation of <em>Montreal, </em>and the treaty of 1763, because, they were not only within the territory claimed by the <em>English, </em>but actually a part of the province of <em>New-York, </em>at the time the grant was made. The <em>English </em>line or claim extended beyond the lands in controversy; and it will be sufficient, for the purpose of this argument, if it shall appear that there was a controversy existing, at the time, between the <em>English </em>and <em>French, </em>as to the northern boundary of the province of <em>New-York, </em>and that the former extended it beyond the lands in question. When, therefore, the <em>English </em>government, by the treaty of 1763, agreed to protect the property of <em>French </em>subjects in <em>Canada, </em>it must be understood to extend to grants in <em>Canada, </em>according to the <em>English </em>acceptation of the limits of that province, and\u2019this must be decided by the <em>English </em>courts. The <em>Dutch, </em>as early as the year 1649, claimed the country as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>far north as the St. <em>Lawrence, </em>or <em>Canada, </em>river.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In the duke of <em>York's </em>sub-grant, in 1664, the river <em>Canada, </em>is assumed as the north line of the patent. In 1696, the <em>English </em>government granted to one <em>Dellius, </em>lands situated beyond <em>Crown </em>Point. Again, the <em>English </em>claimed the sovereignty over the five nations, who were regarded as subjects to <em>Great Britain, </em>and their territory as the domains of the crown.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> That the claim was known to the <em>French, </em>is ascertained by the protest and speech of governor <em>Dongan, </em>in 1686 and 1687.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> It was solemnly recognised by the <em>French </em>themselves, in the treaty of <em>Utrecht, March </em>31, 1713,<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> and the treaty of <em>Aix la Chapelle, </em>in 1748.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-15\">The fact of the establishment of the sovereignty of the <em>British </em>over this territory, is proved by the history of the times. After the surrender of the <em>Dutch, </em>in 1644, <em>Carteret </em>had an interview with the chiefs of the five nations, and entered into a league of friendship with them, which continued uninterrupted for many years.<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark> In <em>July, </em>1701, a grant was made by the five nations to the crown of a vast tract of land,<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> comprehending die territories at the west end of lake <em>Erie, </em>and the north side of that lake and lake <em>Ontario, </em>and in 1726, those nations, by a solemn treaty made with governor <em>Burnet, </em>surrendered their whole country, south of the lakes, to the <em>British </em>crown, to be held for their use, and confirmed the prior cession of 1701.<footnotemark>\u2020\u2020</footnotemark> By these treaties of cession, these <em>Indian </em>nations acknowledged the <em>British </em>king as their sovereign and protector, and the <em>British </em>considered them as subjects of the crown, and protected them, on all occasions, against their enemies. That the lands in controversy are comprehended in the country possessed by the five nations, is an undoubted historic fact.<footnotemark>\u2021\u2021</footnotemark> The committee of the council of the province of <em>New-York, </em>as appears from the records referred to in the case, considered it, in 1772, as a fact not requiring any proof; and it is within our own recollection, that these claims extended over all the north part of this state, and have been extinguished by government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>But it may, perhaps, be said, in support of the <em>French </em>grants, that they were made while the <em>French </em>were in actual possession of the country by conquest. But such a possession, according to the law of nations, gives no right.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> No right can be acquired by a wrongful possession, unless it be afterwards acquiesced in, or conceded by the true owner.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-11\"><em>Van Vechten </em>and <em>Woodworth, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azu\">1. The defendant claims under the grant to <em>Estebe. </em>It is said, on the other side, that a resumption of this grant, by the crown of France, is to be presumed. We contend, that no act of reunion ever took place, nor is there, in the case, sufficient evidence <em>to </em>warrant such a presumption. The survey of <em>Mackie </em>is wholly inconsistent with the idea, that the grant had been resumed. That survey, too, was made by a royal, surveyor, who would not have undertaken the survey, had the grant been extinguished by an act of reunion. Again, the act of reunion was to be made in a particular manner, with the forms and solemnities of a judicial act; as in our law a grant must be avoided by an act as solemn and notorious as the grant itself. There must be some record of such a proceeding ; but no record of any act of reunion has been produced, except of the grant to <em>Le Gauchetiere. </em>Want of possession by the grantee, or the persons claiming under him, does not afford sufficient ground for the presumption, that the grant has been resumed. Immediate and successive wars in the country, sufficiently account for the want of possession. The premises lay on the frontiers, exposed to the incursions of the belligerent parties. This situation would afford an adequate excuse for not performing the condition of the grant, by making a settlement, and it is fair to presume, that such an excuse was received by the <em>French </em>government. One <em>Lafomber </em>went on the land in 1763, and persons, of the name of <em>Goude </em>and <em>Swarte, </em>settled there before the <em>French </em>war. <em>La Monte </em>took possession in 1774, and though interrupted by the subsequent war, he resumed his possession in 1784.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>In <em>December, </em>1757, but three years before the capitulation of Montreal, <em>Estebe </em>conveyed the tract of land in question to the <em>Bishop </em>of <em>Quebec, </em>with warranty ; and it is not probable that he would have executed such a deed to such a person, if the land had been resumed by the crown. These conveyances were executed before public notaries, and were matters of record. It is sufficient, if the defendant can show a title out of the lessor; but he has shown a title derived from the grantee. <em>Montgolfier, </em>in 1768, made a formal renunciation, or release, in favour of the heirs of the <em>Bishop </em>of <em>Quebec. Mackie </em>claimed as one of the heirs, and was admitted to be an heir by the release of <em>Montgolfier. </em>From that period, <em>Mackie, </em>and the persons under him, have claimed the land, and exercised acts of ownership over it. Though the patent to <em>Dean </em>was granted in 1769, there is no proof of any possession under it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-7\">It may be objected, that the lease to <em>La Monte </em>was of lands in the seignory of <em>La </em>Gauchetiere, which had been resumed; but this was merely a name of description, the first grant having been made to <em>La Gauchetiere.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-8\">2. The title of <em>L'estebe </em>was protected by the capitulation of <em>Montreal, </em>and the treaty of 1763. The estates of the <em>French </em>inhabitants were preserved, and they had a right to sell. The power to emigrate was limited to eighteen months after the treaty, but not the power to sell, which was unrestrained, except that the sale was to be made to <em>British </em>subjects. By the modern law of nations, individuals in conquered countries, are secured in their rights of property.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> By the acts and declaration of the <em>British </em>government, the line drawn from the 45th <em>degree </em>of <em>north </em>latitude, was not to affect the king\u2019s new subjects holding titles to lands south of that line ; and it was provided, that actual settlers should have 50 acres of land for 3 acres improved. By the treaty of 1763, the <em>French </em>king merely renounced his right of sovereignty over <em>Canada; </em>the <em>French, </em>who chose to remain subjects of <em>Great </em>Britain, retained all their rights of property. Those who held legal tides under the <em>French </em>government, and were entitled to retain posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>sion of their lands, would continue to have a right' to hold them to the same extent, under <em>the' English </em>government. The act of parliament, of 14 <em>Geo. </em>III. c. 33. though relative to the province of Canada, shows the sense given by the <em>British </em>government to the treaty of 1763, which was to secure the rights of property to all the inhabitants of the country, who took the oath of allegiance to the crown of <em>Great Britain. </em>The only inquiry of the new government would be, whether the grants were valid at the time of the surrender by <em>France. </em>The conduct of Governor Nicoll, in confirming die <em>Dutch </em>grants, has been mentioned ; but that may have been for the purpose of raising money, and not because such confirmatory grants were absolutely necessary. Again, it is said, that die patent to Dean, connected with the treaty, is substantially a resumption of the <em>French </em>grant; but if the treaty confirmed and vested the rights under those grants, they could not be again divested by any acts of the <em>English </em>colonial government. The want of notice of these grants cannot be objected, as the <em>English </em>government was in possession of all the records. Again, it is not necessary for the defendant to prove, that the conditions of the royal grant were performed. <em>Dean </em>has no right to demand such proof. It belongs only to die crown, or those invested with the royal prerogative, to inquire into the performance of the conditions of the grants. The <em>English </em>government might enforce the performance in any manner it thought equitable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-8\">3. The property, at the time of the grant to Estebe, was within the boundary of the province of <em>Canada. </em>The <em>French </em>were the first possessors of this country.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In 1638, the country north of <em>Albany </em>was called by the Dutch, <em>Terra </em>Incognita.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> In 1674, <em>New France </em>was taken by the <em>English. </em>In 1678, Governor <em>Andross </em>speaks of the <em>lakes </em>as the northern boundary of <em>New-York. </em>In 1668, <em>New France </em>was restored by the English, without any specification of its limits. In 1672, <em>New-York </em>was retaken by the Dutch, who claimed-the country ten miles north of the <em>Hudson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>River.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The <em>French </em>held the country by right of prior discovery, and by right of conquest. Their rights were acquiesced in by the <em>Indians, </em>and the limits of Canada, as fixed by tire French, were recognised by the <em>English </em>in their treaties. The five nations did not reside within two hundred miles of the premises in question. If they had been driven from their lands by the French, their surrender and submission to the <em>English </em>could not transfer territory of which they were dispossessed. Besides, this subjection was very equivocal, and, at best, merely nominal. By the treaty of neutrality in 1686, the seventh article of the treaty of Ryswick, in 1677, the second article of the treaty of Madrid, in 1721, and the second article of the treaty of <em>Se</em>ville, in 1729, <em>France </em>was confirmed in all her territories and possessions, which she held, by discovery or conquest, in <em>America.</em><footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The fort of <em>Crown Point </em>was erected by the <em>French </em>in 1731. In 1732, the governor and council of the province of <em>New-York </em>inquired of the <em>Indian </em>commissioners, to whom the lands at <em>Crown Point </em>belonged; to the five nations, the river Indians, or the <em>French ? </em>This shows, that the <em>English </em>did not consider themselves as the proprietors of this part of the country, In 1757, the northern limits of the province of New-York, were wholly undefined. By the map of Evans, published in 1755, the <em>English </em>claimed their northern boundary, no farther than <em>Otter </em>Creek. The very name of Lake Champlain, shows its <em>French </em>origin. The grant to <em>Dellius </em>was vacated, without ever having been earned into effect. Under the law of nations, a possession acquired by conquest, or first discovery, is a rightful possession. The <em>French </em>exercised acts of ownership over the whole country to which their claim extended. They built forts, and began settlements. These were conquered, and restored, at different times, and no precise line was drawn between the <em>English </em>and <em>French </em>provinces. The line of jurisdiction established in 1768, between <em>Canada </em>and New-York, incontestibly proves, that the respective limits of those provinces was not before well ascertained. In establishing the line at the 45th degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>north latitude, provision is made that it shall not affect private rights acquired under the <em>French </em>government, prior to that period.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ASu\">\n<em>Emott,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amqd\">in reply, after making a few observations, was stopped by the court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\"> The report of the committee is as follows: <em>\u201c </em>That soon after his majesty was pleased, by his royal proclamation of the 7th <em>October, </em>1763, to declare the 45th degree of northern latitude, to be the boundary <em>between </em>this and the province of <em>Quebec, </em>divers tracts of land were granted under the great seal of this province, to the northward of <em>Crown Point, </em>on both sides the <em>Lake Champlain, </em>and chiefly to the reduced officers and soldiers, claiming his majesty\u2019s bounty, graciously promised by that proclamation; That Sir <em>Henry Moore, </em>and <em>M. Carlton, </em>the governors of the two provinces, fixed the place of latitude of 45, by actual observation, near the north end of the lake, in the month of <em>September, </em>1767, and that on the 12th of <em>August, </em>1768, his majesty was pleased to declare his approbation in privy council, and to direct in favour of his new <em>Canadian </em>subjects, that nothing in the order of that date contained, should affect the property of such as had possessions, under proper titles of lands, on the south side of the Une, the dominion of which, was not disputed on the part of the crown of <em>Great Britain ; </em>and that the said determination, should not operate wholly, to deprive them of such concessions, on the south side of the said line, wherein they had made actual settlements and improvements, although the said line might have been disputed by the crown of <em>Great Britain; </em>but that they should he entitled to so much of the said concessions as should be proportionate to their improvements, at the rate of fifty acres for every three that were improved, with proviso that grants should be sued out, under the seal of <em>New-York, </em>subject to the usual quit-rents, and that a grant to one person should not exceed <em>20,000 aeres. </em>The committee have examined the council books, and cannot discover that the government of <em>Quebec, </em>ever gave the least intimation to this province, of any <em>French </em>grants upon <em>Lake Champlain, </em>neither before, nor after the said order, of <em>August, </em>1768, until excited thereunto by your excellency\u2019s late proclamation; nor is there any entry to be found of any notification of such claim, by private persons, nor even of any application for any grant, or confirmation, under this government, for lands granted in <em>Canada, </em>before the surrender of that country. The committee therefore conceive that it was a natural and reasonable presumption, either that there was no such <em>French </em>grants, or that the grantees, and their assigns, considered them as invalid, and perhaps forfeited to the <em>French </em>crown, before the conquest, or that they declined the acceptance of <em>British </em>confirmations, subject to quit-rents, and new patent charges, intending' to set them up as sufficient, under the articles of capitulation, in the courts of law, upon the supposition, that they were within the ancient dominions of the crown of <em>France ; </em>and agreeably thereto, this government began again to grant lands in that quarter, and continued the practice, until your ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>cellency was pleased to communicate to the council his majesty\u2019s 50th instruction, prohibiting patents for lands, to the northward of <em>Crown </em>Point, claimed under <em>French </em>titles; and if the late grants of this province, are detrimental to these claimants, the committee are of opinion, that the blame falls upon themselves, as it is owing to their neglecting to give the information, naturally to be expected, if they intended to submit to, and take advantage of the royal order of the 12th <em>August, </em>1768. The committee observe, that among the papers now transmitted from <em>Quebec, </em>there are no <em>French </em>concessions, and ratifications of any of the lands mentioned in the list of those, said to be granted <em>en roture, </em>nor for several of these on the list <em>seigneuries, </em>besides those specified in Mr. <em>Cramache's </em>letter, to your excellency; nor is there a single petition sent, or preferred by either of those claimants, for a confirmation under this province, of any of their grants, which is the more extraordinary, as your excellency\u2019s proclamation, required a full exhibition of their titles, and the crown is greatly interested in the question, concerning the validity of the <em>French </em>claims in the articles both of quit-rents, and. escheats, their pretensions extending not only to a vast quantity of land, but to lands the more valuable for their contiguity to the forts and passes, and the navigable waters of the lake; and from the whole we conjecture, that this conduct is owing to their adopting an opinion, which deserves a serious attention, to wit: That the lands they claim, are situated to the northward of the ancient <em>JBritisk </em>claim, and that consequently they can maintain a title under the surrender, without the aid of the crown, and free from the usual reservations, restrictions, conditions, and quit-rents. With respect, therefore, to the lands southward of <em>Crown Point, </em>and to those to the northward of that fort, not within the limits of the <em>French </em>grants, we are of opinion that your excellency may issue patents for them, as lands to which the 50th article of the royal instructions has clearly no relation. Nor do we think, that article ought to he considered to prohibit the grant of those tracts, to which no <em>French </em>concessions, or ratifications, appear to be transmitted frOm <em>Quebec, </em>nor any excuse assign* ed for not laying them before this government, pursuant to the late proclamation, it being very plain from the instruction, that it was intended to restrain only new patents for lands, before claimed by titles derived from the <em>French </em>king, and prior to the surrender of <em>Canada, </em>and as clear that it was an indispensable duty of all such claimants, in justice to the crown, to give due notice of their claims. But in due deference to his majesty\u2019s authority, we advise, as to the lands northward of <em>Crown Point, </em>and included by the concession^ and ratifications, lately notified to this government, that all petitions for them or any part of them be sent home, together with copies of the <em>French </em>grants for his majesty\u2019s royal consideration. Several points of inquiry will arise upon those grants, concerning which, the committee choose not to decide, on account of their singular importance and delicacy : 1st. \"Whether a title, if good under the <em>French </em>government, will, by the surrender, be valid by our laws, without the royal confirmation j or in other words, whether the capitulation gives more to the <em>French </em>grantors, than an equitable right to be preferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>before others, in the application for a new grant. 2d, Whether those lands were not forfeited to the crown of France, by the conditions in the grants, before the surrender, and so became thereby transferred to his majesty, 3d. Whether they were not within the ancient <em>British </em>claim, and consequently never grantable by the crown of <em>France. </em>And upon this last question, the committee beg leave to remark, that the <em>British </em>claim of dominion, before the last wav, extended to the southerly bank of the river <em>St. </em>Lawrence, and by treaty, to all the country of the six nations in particular, of which the controverted grants are a part; and we find, that so early as the third of <em>September, </em>1696, a patent did pass to <em>Godfrey </em>Bellius, under the seal of this province, for lands, including some of those now claimed under the <em>Canadian </em>grants, greatly to the northward of <em>Crown </em>Point, of which the <em>French </em>were not possessed, till near forty years afterwards, to wit, about the year 1731; and whether it is imputable to a consciousness in the French, of their want of title, or to any other cause, the committee cannot help observing to &gt;our excellency, that, in fact, very few settlements, or improvements, were termed upon any of those <em>Canadian </em>grants, except about the <em>French </em>forts, at, or since the conclusion of the last peace ; the country near <em>Lake </em>Champlain, but for the late settlements under this colony, being, in general, in a wild and uncultivated state; and as it may be of essential moment to the reduced officers and soldiers, and others who have seated themselves in that district, that his majesty be fully informed of the numerous patents that have passed the seal of this colony, since the acquisition of <em>Canada, </em>we recommend it to your excellency&gt; to order the surveyor-general to frame a map, exhibiting the <em>French </em>grants -and <em>English </em>patents, to the northward of <em>Crown Point, </em>to be laid before liio majesty, with all convenient speed, with a list of the patentees, and an account of the quantity of land contained in their patents, and the quit-rents they are chargeable with; and for the security and satisfaction of the <em>French </em>grantees, we also advise, that, in the interim, the several papers referred to us, be filed in the secretary\u2019s office, and a copy of this report, and the order to be made-thereon, transmitted to the commander in chief of Quebec.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><em> </em>This article of the instructions of the king and council is as follow<em>s: </em>Whereas sundry persons, proprietors under titles derived from the crown of France, when that crown was in possession of <em>Canada, </em>of lands on that part of <em>Lake Champlain </em>now lying within our province of <em>New-York, </em>have humbly represented unto us, that several parcels of the said lands so claimed, have already been granted to other persons by letters patent, under the seal of our said province of <em>New-York, </em>and have, therefore, humbly prayed, that a proceeding so prejudicial to their rights, and pretensions, may receive our royal disapprobation: and, whereas, it appears both just and equitable, that the claims of persons, under such titles as aforesaid, should not be affected without the fullest examination thereof: It is therefore, our will and pleasure, and you are thereby directed, and required in no case to make any grants of lands, so claimed as aforesaid upon <em>Lake Champlain, </em>to the northward of <em>Crown Point, </em>within the province of <em>New-York, </em>until the peti <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>tions and proposals for grants of any part or parts of such lands, shall have been transmitted to one of our principal secretaries of state, in order to be laid before us, and until our approbation thereof shall have been signified to you, our said governor, or to the commander in chief of our said province, for the time being.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b187-9\"> <em>Smith\u2019s Hist. </em>N.

Such a claim might have been presented and urged to the government but it does not afford that evidence of legal title which can be recognised by this court.

This has been the uniform sense of our courts, from the first establishment of the <em>English </em>government in the colony of <em>New-York.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVE\">The claim set up in this case, under the <em>French </em>grant, is not a new pretension. These claims were a subject of discussion with the government, before the <em>American </em>revolution, though this, perhaps, is the first instance in which it has been attempted, in a court of law, to enforce the claim, in opposition to a grant under the great seal of the state.
