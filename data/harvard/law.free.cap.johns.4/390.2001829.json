This tree answered to the description in the plaintiff\u2019s deed. There were two other trees, apparently marked at the same time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\">The plaintiff having here rested his cause, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a nonsuit, on the ground, that no title had been shown in <em>Leonard Cole, </em>senior, and that no possession had been proved; but the motion was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">The defendant proved by <em>F. Schoonmaker, </em>aged 69 that captain <em>Joakim Schoonmaker, </em>was one of the trustees, named in the patent of <em>Rochester, </em>and lived on the north side of <em>Stoney Creek, </em>within a quarter of a mile of it, where his son <em>Joakim </em>afterwards lived; that the three sons of <em>Joakim, </em>had, as long ago as he could recollect, established divisions between their respective parts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>on the land possessed by them, on the south side of the <em>Stoney Creek; </em>they possessed lands, improved to the <em>Mill Creek ; </em>some of the family had a fence beyond it, extending to <em>Sander's Kill. </em>John, a grandson of captain Joakim, was in possession of the land occupied by the defendant; and was in possession when the witness was 10 or 12 years <em>old; </em>some of his fence was along the <em>Stoney </em>Kill, and south-west from the <em>Stoney </em>Kill, to the <em>Mill </em>Creek, nearly as the fence now runs <em>; </em>south of this, the land was claimed, as part of the 180 acres granted to captain Joakim, by the town of <em>Rochester. John </em>died in possession, before, or during the war. John, the son of captain Joakim, had once cleared land along the <em>Stoney </em>Kill, being about 20 or 30 acres, the outside fences of which are now the same as when he first knew it. He had also seen a fence, extending to <em>Mill </em>Creek, from the <em>Stoney Kill, </em>between the defendant and <em>Jacobus Schoonmaker ; </em>it was made of lopped trees ; and, in some places, had stakes a.nd riders. He did not know that the fence, forming <em>John's </em>western boundary, extended south to the <em>Mill Creek ; </em>but he knew well, that the fence between <em>Joakim </em>and John, extended to the <em>Mill Creek </em>all the fences appeared to be of some years standing. There was a road through the defendant\u2019s possession, which crossed the <em>Mill </em>Creek, and the low land adjoining the <em>Stoney </em>Kill, was cleared when he first knew it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-4\"><em>John </em>Depuy, aged 68 years, testified, that he lived near the family of the <em>Schoonmakers ; </em>that captain <em>Joakim, </em>had seven sons <em>; </em>that he has known the lands south of the <em>Stoney Creek, </em>from his earliest <em>remembrance; </em>that the low lands, in possession of three of those sons, appeared to be ancient clearings, when he first knew <em>them; </em>that he knew the defendant\u2019s possession, when a boy; it was then in possession of captain <em>Joakim's </em>son John, who died there, before the war, and was succeeded by his son, who was succeeded by the <em>defendant; </em>that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>outside fences of the farm stand now where they stood when <em>John </em>settled there; he was present when the proprietors of the <em>Grote Transport </em>tract divided it; that the defendant\u2019s <em>farm has been in fence, as it now is, as long as he could remember; </em>that the <em>low lands </em>have been improved as long as any in <em>Rochester; </em>the descendants of captain <em>Joakim, </em>claimed the north and south sides of the <em>Stoney Kill, </em>as their own <em>; </em>that the cleared lands were along the <em>Stoney </em>Creek, which is <em>low land; </em>the <em>low lands </em>were in fence in 1768, when the <em>Grote Transport </em>tract random line was run <em>; </em>that 50 <em>years ago, </em>he followed the outside fence of <em>John Schoonmaker''s </em>farm to the <em>Mill Creek, </em>and it was made of trees cut down, with cross stakes and riders, and high enough to keep out cattle; that the upland possession of the defendant, was cleared a great many years ago <em>; </em>that the inhabitants of <em>Rochester </em>cut wood, and made mill-stones, where they pleased, on the unimproved lands, not in fence, and between <em>Stoney </em>and <em>Mill Creeks ; </em>the low lands of <em>John Schoonmaker </em>were 8 or 10 acres, along the <em>Mill Creek; </em>and this possession he saw before <em>Josephat Dubois </em>died. ' He heard from the defendant\u2019s father, that the 80 and 100 acre deeds, covered the low lands of the family, south of the <em>Stoney Kill; </em>the fence of <em>John Schoonmaker </em>ran from the <em>Stoney </em>to the <em>Mill Creek; </em>he saw, when young, a brush fence, running part of the way down the <em>Mill Creek; </em>it had stakes and riders, and he saw it before the division of the <em>Grote Transport </em>tract. All the fences are now as when he saw them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-7\"><em>Ephraim Baker, </em>aged 62 years, testified, that he lived with old <em>Jacobus Schoonmaker, </em>when a boy j that he then, or about that time, saw a fence, running from the low land to the <em>Mill Creek ; </em>and that there is a fence there now: old <em>Jacobus Schoonmaker </em>went for rails, south of the <em>Mill Creek ; </em>the low lands were cleared when the witness first knew them ; the <em>Schoonmakers </em>used to cart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>rails from south of the <em>Stoney </em>Kill, when he was a <em>boy; </em>the low lands of <em>John, </em>son of <em>Jacobus, </em>were all in fence and staked and ridered. His present memory did not enable him to say, that the fence went further south than the low land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-4\"><em>Jacobus Wynkoop, </em>aged 71, and <em>Elias Miller; aged </em>62 years, testified to the same effect. <em>Miller </em>said he saw, when young, a fence, which extended to the <em>Mill </em>Creek, and crossed it, and ran down the same some distance <em>; </em>it was on the land, then occupied by <em>John Schoonmaker ; </em>this fence joined the fence said to belong to <em>Joakim s </em>beyond these fences, it was all commons. The low land was cleared, when he first saw it, and he was brought up within a mile and a half of it. He knew the division between <em>John </em>and <em>Joakim, </em>but does not know that it extended to the <em>Mill Creek; </em>the fences remained in the same places, until he moved away, in 1773. <em>John </em>used the land as his <em>own; </em>the upland was then all wood ; the low lands only were cleared. It was an old clearing when he first saw <em>it; </em>the fences were sufficient to keep out <em>cattle; </em>and there were bars which opened through them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\">The defendant then produced a <em>deed, </em>from the children of captain <em>Joakim </em>to <em>John </em>Schoonmaker, dated 20th <em>March, </em>1745.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-6\"><em>Frederick </em>Westbrook, aged 54, a witness for the plaintiff, testified, that 40 years ago, no upland was cleared, and there was no fence on the <em>Mill Creek ; </em>that 30 years ago he saw on the <em>Mill Creek, a </em>fence of lopped trees only, which appeared to have been recently made, and this possession fence ran up and down the <em>Creek, </em>for a short distance : <em>Lodowick Schoonmaker </em>told him, when he lived on the premises, 30 <em>years ago, </em>that he did not claim as far as the <em>Mill Creek, </em>but confined his claim to the fence running east and west.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number><em>Abraham T. E. De Witt, </em>testified, that in 1793 he saw no fence on the <em>Mill </em>Creek, and only the rail fence, running east and west, not far south of the defendant\u2019s house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-7\"><em>John </em>Miller, aged 64, another witness for the plaintiff, testified, that as to the existence of any fence, except that on the low land, that he had known the premises from a boy, and that there was no clearing on the low land, except five or six acres, at the old saw mill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-8\">The defendant then read in evidence, the <em>patent of </em>Rochester, dated 25th <em>June, </em>1703, and the records of <em>Rochester, </em>to prove that the grantors to <em>Leonard Cole, </em>were not trustees, at the time of the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-9\">The judge charged the jury, that the title of the plaintiff was valid, and that he was entitled to recover, unless the defendant had made out an <em>adverse possession, </em>commencing in the life-time of <em>Josephat Dubois, </em>and continued down uninterruptedly ; that the <em>deed </em>to <em>John Schoonmaker </em>was not located, and so could not aid the defendant; that there was not evidence of a continued possession, or of a sufficient <em>fence; </em>that only the possession of the low land along the <em>Stoney Creek </em>appeared to be adverse ; and he thought the plaintiff ought to recover the land possessed by the defendant, to the foot of the ridge, along the low land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-10\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-11\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-12\"><em>L. Elmendorf, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A20\">The lessors have not shown sufficient title to enable them to recover against the defendant. They proved a conveyance from the trustees of <em>Rochester </em>to <em>Leonard Cole, </em>senior ; <em>Leonard </em>Cole, the younger, conveyed to <em>Josephat Dubois ; </em>but there is no evidence of any possession in <em>Dubois, </em>or those from whom he claimed title. No acts of ownership appear to have been exercised by either of them. On the other hand, the defendant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>shown an adverse possession as far back as the memory of the oldest witnesses can reach; a possession of above sixty years. Now, an adverse possession of 20 years is sufficient to give a good title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-4\">Again, there is sufficient evidence of a <em>descent </em>cast. <em>John </em>the son of <em>Joakim Schoonmaker </em>died in possession, and was succeeded by his son, who continued in possession <em>; </em>and after his death, was succeeded by the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-5\">The deed -from the children of captain <em>Joakim </em>Schoonmaker, in 1745, to <em>John </em>Schoonmaker, was sufficiently located to entitle the defendant to the benefit of a possession ; and the judge was incorrect in directing the jury to disregard that deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-6\">The judge was also incorrect in his charge, in saying, that it was not enough merely to show a continued possession of 20 years, at a period of 40 years ago, but that an uninterrupted possession down to the present time should be shown, which would be a possession of 60 years. A continued adverse possession of 20 years gives a complete <em>title; </em>and there is no necessity for showing a continuation of the possession afterwards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-7\">As the defendant held under colour of title, the lopping of trees round woodland, connected with cultivated lands, is sufficient evidence of ownership, at least, 60 years ago; and no other evidence ought to be required.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-11\"><em>J. Tallmadge, </em>and Sudam, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzG\">The lessors have shown a regular paper title from the patent of Rochester. [E. <em>Williams, </em>for the defendant. We admit the paper title.] Then, have the lessors lost that title, for want of a possession? The possession of <em>John Schoonmaker </em>must enure to the benefit of the lessors, who have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>title by deed; and unless the defendant makes out ti clear adverse possession, the plaintiff must prevail. The lessors derive their title from government, which precludes the idea of a title in another. The possession' will follow and support the title of the plaintiff, unless an actual <em>ouster </em>is shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-15\">The widow of <em>Josephat </em>Dubois, took a life estate under the will,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and after her death, as she remained a widow, the estate descended to the three daughters, named in the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-16\">But it is said, that there has been a disseisin and descent cast, sufficient to <em>toll </em>the right of entry. A <em>disseisin </em>is an actual entry by wrong on him who has the freehold, and turning him out. There must be a tortious <em>ouster, </em>an actual expulsion, to constitute a disseisin, as distinguished from an intrusion or dispossession.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> There can be no disseisin by a person entering on vacant or uncultivated land <em>; </em>nor can there be a disseisin by a person who enters under colour of claim or title. The words of the 4th section of the statute of limitations,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> show that the disseisor must have no right or title to the lands' of which he dies seised, in order to toll the right of entry.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-17\">No disseisin can affect the right of a person not having a right of entry, at the time of the descent cast.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> During the life-time of the widow of the testator, the lessors had no right of entry. They cannot, therefore, be affected by any act, or <em>laches </em>of the tenant for life, or during the continuance of the particular estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-18\">Again, the lessors take the property as heirs at law, not as <em>devisees; </em>for where the' same estate is devised to a person, which he would have taken by descent, he may take by descent.<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark> Here the lessors may elect to take, either as heirs or devisees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-19\">The statute of limitations would not run against the lessors, during the continuance of the life estate, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>widow died in 1792 ; since that time the lessors have been <em>femes </em>covert, so that, since the death of <em>Josephat </em>Dubois, there has been no person who could bring an action of ejectment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-4\">Though there may have been a possession adverse to the tenant for life, for more than 20 years, it will not bar those in remainder or <em>reversion; </em>for the statute does not begin to run against the remainder-man or reversioner, until he has a right of entry. So that an estate may have been held adversely during a hundred years, and yet be recovered by a remainder-man.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The lessors do not derive their title through the particular <em>estate; </em>their claim is wholly independent of the widow, and cannot be affected by any possession adverse to her.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-5\">Again, to constitute such an adverse possession as will bar the real owner, it should not only be uninterrupted, but marked by definite boundaries.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> There must be a real and substantial inclosure j an actual occupancy, definite, positive and notorious.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-6\">The possession set up by the defendant, prior to the death of <em>J. </em>Dubois, is certainly not of this character, and the lessors are not to be affected by any subsequent acts. A mere possession, without colour of title, can never bar an adverse claim.<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-16\"><em>E. </em>Williams, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ45\">Whatever may have been the original right of the lessors, they have lost their remedy. <em>Joakim </em>Schoonmaker, the elder, was one of the original patentees ; and in the year 1729, made his will, devising all his estate, then, as we contend, in his possession, to his children, who, in 1745, executed deeds of release to each other, for their respective shares. This deed recites, that the seven sons of <em>Joakim </em>Schoonmaker, the elder, made a partition of the greatest part of the real estate devised to them, on the 6th April, 1731, and had each o\u00ed them, since that time, severally held and occupied their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>shares, according to such division. By that division, the premises in question, among other lots, fell to <em>John Schoonmaker.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-8\">The best evidence of a continued possession has been produced, that the nature of the case admits. Very aged witnesses prove a general reputation, and tradition as to the possession of <em>Joakim ; </em>and an ancient deed refers to the same possession. The deed to <em>John </em>does, in fact, cover the premises in question ; but whether it does or not, is immaterial. It is enough that he entered and took possession under the deed; thus entering under a colour or claim of right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-9\">The judge charged the jury, that the nature of the possession of <em>John </em>was such, that it must enure to the benefit of the real owner, or, in other words, that it was a mere <em>possession </em>fence, But this name given to the inclosure, by some of the witnesses, ought not to mislead the court, so as to destroy the right of the defendant. It was such a fence as had been invariably used in the country, for inclosing land for agricultural purposes. It was not made of mere lopped trees, but was sufficient to keep out cattle. <em>John </em>cultivated the low land, built a house on the ridge, and inclosed the upland.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-10\">If there was an adverse possession in Joakim, and, afterwards, in John, antecedent to the year 1751, then <em>Cole </em>was incompetent .to convey the premises to Dubois. But if there was not such an adverse possession against Cole, as to incapacitate him from conveying, still <em>Dubois </em>was dispossessed prior to 1751. If <em>Dubois </em>was out of possession, he could not devise in 1757; and then his children 'must take as heirs, and not as devisees. If they claim as heirs, what becomes of the particular estate in the wife, for life, on which so much of the argument of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel is founded i It is said, the lessors were <em>femes covert; </em>but if they took as heirs, they must take in 1757, and were bound to bring their action in twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>years, thereafter. The husband and wife might bring their action. The saving of the statute is only for ten years, after the disability is removed. The right of the husband and wife to bring the action is barred ; and this is an ejectment on the demise of the husband and wife.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-8\">Again, if a disseisor having been in the peaceable possession of land for five years, dies, a descent is cast, and <em>tolls </em>the right of entry, even of a <em>feme covert. </em>A <em>feme covert </em>may be disseised.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In the case of <em>Van Dyck v. Van Beuren </em>and <em>Vosbursgh,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court decided that there might be a disseisin of vacant land ; and that an exclusive perception of the rents and profits would work a disseisin, in spite of the true owner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-16\">It is said, that as the title comes from government, it excludes the idea of a title in <em>another; </em>and the possession of the defendant, or those under whom he claims, must enure to the benefit of the true owner. But all grants of lands are derived from, the government, and if this argument is to prevail, there would be no occasion for a statute of limitations.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9I\">delivered the opinion of the court. In this case, a regular paper title to the premises was shown to reside in those lessors of the plaintiff, who are daughters of <em>Josephat Dubois. </em>He died in the year <em>1757, </em>and by his will, an estate was given to his widow, for life, provided she remained his widow, (as she did,) and after her death, the remainder in fee to his daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-18\">1. The first, and, indeed, the only material question of law arising upon the case is, whether the lessors are not barred by the statute of limitations. Assuming it as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>fact, that <em>Dubois </em>was not disseised, and that no adverse possession existed against him, in his life-time, of the premises recovered, which are the uplands of <em>Stoney </em>Kill, it is then a settled position, that no subsequent disseisin or adverse possession, would bar the right of the lessors, if they brought their suit (as it appears they did) within 20 years after the death of the widow. Neither a descent cast, nor the statute of limitations will affect a right, if a particular estate existed at the time of the disseisin, or when the adverse possession began, because a right of entry in the remainder-man cannot exist, during the existence of the particular estate <em>; </em>and the <em>laches </em>of a tenant for life will not affect the party entitled\u00bb An entry to avoid the statute, must be an entry for the purpose of taking possession, and such an entry cannot be made during the existence of the life estate. <em>(Hunt </em>v. Bourne, 1 <em>Lutw. 779. </em>781, 782. 2 <em>Salk. </em>422. 1 <em>Burr. </em>120. 126, 7 <em>East, </em>311, 312. 319. 321.) .</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">2. The second material point made in the cause is, as to a disseisin or adverse possession, existing at the time of the death of Dubois, On this point, the testimony is contradictory, and must be very uncertain, from the great length of time which has elapsed since the death of Dubois, which was 51 years before the time of the trial. Five witnesses on the part of the defendant, testified to facts in favour of the existence of such adverse possession, though none of the facts tended to establish a disseisin, in the strictly technical sense of the term. Four witnesses on the part of the plaintiff, testified to facts contradicting the existence of any such possession. Considering the remoteness of the period to which the witnesses referred, the loose and uncertain tenor and manner of their testimony, the ambiguous nature of the possession set up, the contradictory and nearly balanced testimony upon the subject, and that the cause was tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>by a struck jury, eight of whom had a view of the premises, there is no probability that any new light can be thrown upon the subject. The court would have been as well, if not better satisfied, if the verdict had been the other <em>way; </em>but under the circumstances of the case, they do not think it would consist with the exercise of a sound discretion, to disturb the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
