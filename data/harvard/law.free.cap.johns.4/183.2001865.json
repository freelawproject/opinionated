John </em>Sharp, one of the defendants, and partner of <em>Robert </em>Sharp, the other defendant, was in England, and accepted the bill there, and a demand of payment was made here on <em>Robert </em>Sharp, who alleged, that he did not know on what account the bill was drawn, nor did it appear that the bill had ever been presented to the defendants, at the house in London, where it was made payable, and that the first knowledge he had of the bill, was an application here for the payment of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-4\">On taking the inquest in the cause, the only evidence offered to the jury was the bill of exchange, and a protest made in London, for non-payment. The protest stated, that the demand of payment was made of a clerk of the house where the bill was payable, according to the acceptance ; but did not mention that any demand had been made of the defendants. The jury, in assessing the damages, allowed interest at the rate of <em>7 per </em>cent\u201e</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-5\"><em>Harison </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b196-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AsT\">The holder of a bill of exchange need not show a demand of payment of the acceptor, any more than of the maker of a note. It is the business of the acceptor to show, that he was ready, at the day and place appointed, but that no one came to receive the money, and that he was always ready, afterwards, to pay. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Delafontaine, </em>(Ba<em>yley 78. </em>note <em>a.) </em>it was so decided. The bill having been drawn in England, and made payable there, the plaintiffs were entitled to <em>S per cent, </em>interest only. A sum must, therefore, be deducted from the verdict, equal to the difference between <em>S </em>and <em>7 per cent, </em>interest. The residue of the motion must be denied, and the plaintiffs are to pay the costs of the application.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
