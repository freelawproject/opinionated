The defendant having been held to bail, <em>Griffin, </em>in his behalf, now moved for his discharge, on filing common bail. It appeared that a similar application had been made to the recorder of <em>New-Tork, </em>in the last vacation, who had refused to discharge the defendant. On showing cause before the recorder, the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit stated, that he could not certainly know that the goods in question were actually shipped, yet he had no doubt that they were shipped, as he received a regular invoice of them, and a bill of lading signed by the <em>defendant; </em>that the goods were contained in trunks, one of which, on being opened, was found entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>empty, and several others partly empty, and from the appearance of the mats and ropes, the trunks had evidently been opened since the goods had been packed up; that the goods missing were demanded of the defendant, and the freight tendered, but they were never delivered ; and that the defendant\u2019s place of abode is at <em>Liverpool.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-8\">\n<em>Griffin</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAa\">insisted, that the affidavit of the plaintiff was defective, as it did not state with certainty, that the goods alleged to be lost were actually shipt, nor that they were embezzled by the defendant, or lost by his negligence, but merely a belief that they were so. That the contents of the trunks were unknown to the defendant, and the bill of lading expressly mentioned, \u201c contents unknown.\u201d He cited 1 <em>Sedon's </em>Practice, 112. and <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>(2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>100.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-9\"><em>Wells, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFb\">offered a supplementary affidavit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-10\"><em>T.
