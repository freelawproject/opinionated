The declaration stated, that one <em>Zachariah </em>Hoffman, now deceased, was, in his life-time, justly indebted to the intestate, in his lifetime, in divers sums of money, &amp;c. that the intestate, i<em>n </em>his life-time, was about to sue the heirs of the said <em>Hoffman, </em>for the recovery of the sums so due to him; \u201c that thereupon the said <em>Jacobus </em>Vanderlyn, in consideration that the said i?. <em>L </em>Elting, (the intestate, i in his life-time, at the special instance and request of the defendant, wou<em>l</em>d forbear to prosecute the heirs of the said <em>Z. </em>Hoffman, of . . . which the defendant, in right of his wife, was one, he, the defendant, undertook and faithfully promised the intestate, in his life-time, and since, to wit, on the 1st May, 1807, at, &amp;c. undertook and promised the plaintiff\u2019s administrators to pay them the several sums of money so due and owing from the said Hoffman, in his life-time, to the said Elting, in his life-time, &amp;c. that the said Elting, in his life-time, confiding in \"the said promise, &amp;c. did forbear to prosecute, &amp;c. for two years and longer, and hitherto hath forborne to prosecute, &amp;c. and that the plaintiffs, as administrators, since the death of Elting, have also forborne to prosecute,\u201d &amp;c. The defendant pleaded <em>non </em>assumpsit, and <em>non assumpsit infra sex </em>annos.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ApR\">The cause was tried at the <em>Ulster </em>circuit,\" in <em>September </em>last, when the jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3U\">A motion was made, at the last term, in arrest of judgment, on the following grounds :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AK9A\">1. Because the promise of the defendant was for the benefit of the heirs of <em>Hoffman </em>generally, and so within the statute of frauds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>2. Because the plaintiffs ought to have averred in their declaration, that the defendant, as one of the heirs, had received <em>assets </em>from the ancestor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-7\">3. Because a promise to pay, in consideration of an indefinite forbearance, is void.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-14\">Hawkins, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Auv\">1. The statute<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> which makes heirs liable on simple contracts, and specialties, for the debts of their ancestors, makes them jointly responsible. It is a contract, and as such must be joint. The defendant could only be answerable for his proportion of the debt, as one of the heirs. His promise, therefore, to pay the whole, was a promise to pay the debts of the other heirs ; it is a <em>parol </em>undertaking for the debt of another, and so within the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-15\">2. In every case, the plaintiff ought to allege in his deduration sufficient to entitle him to recover. The plaintiffs ought to have alleged that the defendant was heir and had <em>assets </em>by descent; for though the ancestor may have given a bond, or been indebted, it does not follow that the heir is liable, unless he has assets by descent.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> As the defendant was not impleaded as heir, he could not plead <em>rims per descent.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-16\">3. A forbearance generally, without specifying any time, is not a sufficient consideration to support an <em>assumpsit. </em>In <em>Lettwich </em>v. Hussey, and <em>Philips </em>v. <em>Sackford,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was decided, that a promise to forbear indefinitely, was not a good consideration. There must be some certain time limited.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> At least, the forbearance should be for a reasonable time.<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark> It is true, that where there is any lien lost, or benefit conferred by the forbearance, this will be a good consideration for the promise.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-17\">Sudam, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOe8\">1. The declaration need not state that the promise was in writing ; that fact must appear in evidence at the trial. If such a promise be stated, as, if in writing, would be valid under the statute, the court, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Verdict, will intend that it was proved to have been in writing, and the judgment cannot be arrested on that ground.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-4\">2. The plaintiffs do not charge the defendant as heir; it was not necessary, therefore, to allege that he had assets by descent. The action is founded on the promise of the defendant to pay the debt of the heirs. Under our statute, heirs are liable for the simple contracts of their ancestors, though not so in <em>England. </em>Where the declaration is against an executor or heir, on his own promise to pay, assets need not be alleged; for if there is a sufficient consideration, or the promise be valid, he is liable whether there be assets or not.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-5\">3. The cases cited from <em>Cro. Eliz. </em>have been overruled by subsequent decisions; and, particularly, in the case of <em>Mapes </em>v. Sidney,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> where it was laid down, that a forbearance to sue generally was a good consideration for a promise. If it appear that the plaintiff did forbear a reasonable time, it will be sufficient. By forbearing to sue, the plaintiff suffers a damage.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b250-8\"> 24th sess. c. 50.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b250-9\"><em> 2 Saund. </em>136.

There is no pretence for bringing the promise within the statute of frauds. Whether the promise was in writing\" or not, need not appear in the declaration. That is matter of evidence only; and after verdict, we must presume that it was in writing. Forbearance to sue is a sufficient consideration for a promise to pay the debt of another. (1 <em>Saund. </em>211. a. note.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">2. The defendant is not sued as heir, but on a promise to pay the debt of the heirs, and the question of assets does not, therefore, arise. Heirs, under our statute, are liable for the simple contract debts of their ancestor.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">3. The consideration of forbearance generally is sufficient, without setting forth a specific time. There was, in fact, a total forbearance for a long time, which brings the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>case within that of <em>Mapes </em>v. Sidney. <em>(Cro.
