Motion to Dismiss.</em>\n</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b601-8\">The defendant was sued as \u201cthe Burlington and Lamoille Railroad Company, a company organized under the laws of this State,\u201d etc. The service of the writ was like that required by the statute, on a corporation, by leaving a copy with its clerk. A motion was filed to dismiss on the' ground that the service was illegal; but it did not specify any error, or the method of correcting it. <em>Held: </em>(a) That, as there is a general law under which railroad corporations can be organized, it is presumed that the defendant is a corporation organized under this law; (b) That the motion \u2014 if the objection is available on motion \u2014is faulty in not pointing out both the defect and its correction.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-9\">MotioN to dismiss a writ on the ground that the service was illegal. Heard December Term, 1886, Veazey, J., presiding. Motion overruled. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-10\">The substance of the motion was that the writ had not been legally served. It appeared from the officer\u2019s return that he attached one car, and that he lodged a copy of the writ in the town clerk\u2019s office, where the car was attached, and that he also left a copy with the clerk of the defendant company.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b601-11\"><em>E. R. Hard, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-12\">The defendant in the mandatory part of the writ is described as 4 4 the Burlington and Lamoille Railroad Company, a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>pany,\u201d etc.; and there is nothing anywhere in the record which varies this description, or indicates what sort of a \u201c company\u201d the defendant is.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-5\">The question presented by this motion to abate must be determined by what appears upon the face of the process, unaffected by any extraneous fact or inference ; and the motion should prevail unless it appears by the record that the requirements of the statutes respecting the service of attachment process have been strictly complied with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-6\">It does not appear from the record in this case that the defendant is a corporation, an \u201cassociation or joint-stock company consisting of five or more members,\u201d or a \u201c partnership composed of five or more persons,\u201d in which cases, only, service can properly be made by copy to a clerk, etc., as provided by R. L. s. 873, and by the Act of 1882. Acts 1882, No. 71.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au6\">The suit must therefore be treated as one against a plurality of natural persons, insufficiently described; and the writ could be served only in the manner prescribed by R. L. ss. 871, 881, if, indeed, any service of so faulty a process could be effectual. The service, therefore, by copy to the clerk is insufficient.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b602-8\"><em>B. A. Hunt, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-9\">The writ was legally and sufficiently served. R. L. s. 873 ; Acts 1884, No. 99.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-10\">It was personal property that was attached and should have been attached as such. 31 Barb. 590; 47 Barb. 104; 52 N.

The defendant, as alleged in the writ, is the \u201cBurlington and Lamoille Railroad Company, a company organized under the laws of this State.\u201d The name of the defendant, \u201c Burlington and Lamoille Railroad Company,\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>well as the qualifying clause, \u201ca company organized under the laws of this State,\u201d is consistent with the defendant being a corporation upon which service of process can be legally completed only by delivering a copy to its clerk. Pleas in abatement are not favored, and no presumptions are made to uphold them. We have, and for several years have had, a general law under which railroad corporations could be legally organized. It is to be presumed, if any presumption is to prevail, that the defendant is a corporation organized under this law. It is alleged to be a railroad company. The duties of such a company are more or less of a public nature, and of such a character'that it is difficult to conceive of their exercise by a copartnership. Nor have we any statute authorizing the organizing copartnerships for the exercise of the functions required for the full construction, operation and transaction of the business of a railroad company. This company is alleged to have been organized under the laws of this State, clearly referring to the general law enacted for the organization of railroad companies as corporations. The rule, applicable alike to motions and pleas in abatement, is, that they must give the plaintiff a better writ, in that they not only point out the error, but also the method of correcting it. 1 Chit. Pl. 446. The motion is faulty in both of these requisites. It neither alleges nor denies the corporate existence of the defendant, nor in what respect the supposed service of the writ upon it is defective, nor in what manner it can be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The <em>pro forma </em>judgment of the County Court is affirmed, and cause remanded to be further proceeded with.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
