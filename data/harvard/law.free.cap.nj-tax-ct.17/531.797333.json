Borough of East Newark, </em>16 <em>N.J. Tax </em>568 (Tax 1997). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The assessed property is a collection of multistory, brick, mill-style buildings with 1,133,774 square feet of leasable space. The structures were built in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and the lots on which they are located, including parking areas, total 13.45 acres. Most of the leased space is used for light manufacturing. Other uses include office, outlet retail, and warehousing.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">Each party presented the report and testimony of an appraiser. Each appraiser established the property\u2019s value through capitalization of net operating income. <em>See Parkway Village Apartments Co. v. Township of Cranford, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>266, 270, 528 A.2d 922 (1987) (citing <em>Helmsley v. Borough of Fort Lee, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>200, 394 A.2d 65 (1978)). The establishment of net operating income requires a determination of the property\u2019s economic rent, or \u201cfair rental value,\u201d <em>Parkway, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 270, 528 A.2d 922, plus miscellaneous and additional income. Economic rent may differ from actual rent. <em>Parkview Village Assoc, v. Borough of Collingswood, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>21, 29, 297 A.2d 842 (1972). Economic rent is adjusted downward in light of anticipated vacancy and collection losses to yield effective gross income. Operating expenses are deducted from effective gross income to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>reach net operating income. The taxpayer challenges the Tax Court\u2019s findings regarding all of these elements. The court, however, utilized the taxpayer\u2019s capitalization rate, and it is not an issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Actual income \u201cis a significant probative factor in the inquiry as to economic income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 297 A.2d 842. The taxpayer\u2019s expert reported the following rent collected and additional income from parking, electric and water for relevant years:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AILz\">Rent Collected Additional Income Total</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">1991 3,078,667 263,941 3,342,608</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajo\">1992 2,116,028 229,256 2,345,284</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_8\">1993 2,433,544 344,974 2,778,518</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJk\">1994 3,192,431 454,394 3,646,825</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-21\">The taxpayer\u2019s expert established actual average annual vacancy rates of 19.35% for 1991, 29.02% for 1992, 32.08% for 1993, and 15.79% for 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-22\">It is apparent from the income and vacancy figures that negative macro-economic factors impacted the property\u2019s 1992 and 1993 performance. The property\u2019s performance in 1994 reflected an improved economic climate.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-23\">The taxpayer\u2019s expert used an economic rent of $3.23 per square foot of leasable space for a total potential gross income of $3,724,703. This was based on his analysis of the existing leases. The borough\u2019s expert opined that economic rent was $3.50 per square foot. He relied on more recent leases and, in addition, factored in automatic rent increases contained in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-24\">The taxpayer\u2019s expert stabilized additional income at $350,000, while the borough\u2019s appraiser used $566,000. The latter figure included expense items that tenants had to pay the landlord. The expert testified that these \u201cpass through\u201d expenses were included in operating expenses. The borough\u2019s appraiser adopted the more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>recent vacancy factor of 15%, while the taxpayer\u2019s expert used 20.99%.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The appraisers differed markedly regarding operating expenses. The taxpayer posited expenses at $2,205,544, while the borough\u2019s appraiser stabilized expenses at $1,851,096.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The following charts represent the conflicting opinions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">\n<em>Taxpayer\u2019s Income Approach Summary</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-Pr\">Potential Gross Income $3,724,703</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">Additional Income ( + ) 350,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-10\">Vacancy and Rent Loss (20.99%) (-) 781,656</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-11\">Effective Gross Income_(=) $3,293,047</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-12\">Operating Expenses (-) $2,205,554</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-13\">Net Operating Income</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-14\">(=) $1,087,493</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-15\">Tax Year Net Income Cap Rate Value</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3z\">1993 $1,087,493 13.61% $7^90,397</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANx\">1994 $1,087,493 13.78% $7,891,821</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aed\">1995 $1,087,493 13.83% $7,863,290</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-25\">The expert then rounded the value to $8,000,000 for 1993, and $7,900,000 for both 1994 and 1995.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-26\">\n<em>Borough\u2019s Income Approach Summary</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayv\">Potential Gross Income $3,968,213</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-27\">Additional Income ( + ) 566,888</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-28\">Plus parking income (+) 20,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-29\">Plus land rent (+) 67,500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-30\">Vacancy and Rent Loss(15%) (-) 693,390</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-31\">Effective Gross Income (=) $3,929,210</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-32\">Operating Expenses (-) $1,851,096</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUR\">Net Operating Income (=) $2,078,114</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Capitalization at 13.13%: (10.5% plus average effective tax rate of 2.63%)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">Tax Year Net Income Cap. Rate Value</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">1993-95 $2,078,114 13.13% $15,287,218</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap8\">The expert then rounded the value to $15,827,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The major differences on the income side of the analysis are in \u201cPotential Gross Income,\u201d \u201cAdditional Income,\u201d and the vacancy rate. The borough\u2019s expert\u2019s operating expenses were $354,458 less than the taxpayer\u2019s expenses. A major difference in the expense figure is due to the borough\u2019s expert\u2019s rejection of the taxpayer\u2019s actual expense items which appeared to be nonrecurring, such as asbestos removal, or in the nature of capital renovations. For example, 1991 actual expenses included $145,211 in \u201celectrical repairs,\u201d $417,533 for \u201crepair carpentry,\u201d and $308,774 for \u201casbestos removal.\u201d Expenses for 1992 included $465,685 for \u201casbestos removal.\u201d The borough\u2019s expert substituted an annual 2% expense allowance for repairs and an additional 2% for maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">The court found the borough\u2019s evidence to be more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">We recognize the unique role of the Tax Court in determining issues such as those before us. As noted in <em>Glenpointe Assoc. v. Township of Teaneck, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>37, 574 A.2d 459 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>391, 585 A.2d 392 (1990), \u201c[t]he judges presiding in the Tax Court have special expertise; for that reason their findings will not be disturbed unless they are plainly arbitrary or there is a lack of substantial evidence to support them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46, 585 A.2d 392. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A 2B:13-6b; <em>see also Pine St. Management Corp. v. City of East Orange, </em>15 <em>N.J.Tax, </em>681, 688 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>172, 675 A.2d 1121 (1996). Our scope of review in a case such as this \u201cis limited to determining whether the findings of fact are supported by substantial credible evidence with due regard to the Tax Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>expertise and ability to judge credibility .\u201d <em>Phillips v. Township of Hamilton, </em>15 <em>N.J.Tax, </em>222, 226 (App.Div.1995) (quoting <em>Southbridge Park, Inc. v. Borough of Fort Lee, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>91, 94, 492 A.2d 1026 (App.Div.1985)). <em>See also Romulus Dev. Corp. v. Township of Weehawken, </em>15 <em>N.J.Tax, </em>209, 211 (App.Div.1995); <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Township of Edison, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>290, 311, 604 A.2d 580 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">With a few exceptions, the taxpayer\u2019s contentions on appeal are attacks on the court\u2019s credibility decisions and the weight of the evidence. We are persuaded that the court\u2019s findings and conclusions were not arbitrary or unsupported in the evidence, particularly in light of the \u201cTax Court\u2019s expertise and ability to judge credibility.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Township of Hamilton, supra, </em>15 <em>N.J.Tax, </em>at 226 (quoting <em>Southbridge Park, Inc. v. Borough of Fort Lee, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>91, 94, 492 A.2d 1026 (App.Div.1985)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm substantially for the reasons expressed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The taxpayer contends that the court erred in admitting a borough exhibit and in not permitting cross-examination of the borough\u2019s expert regarding alleged violations of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. The taxpayer also argues that the court \u201cshould have given little weight to [the borough\u2019s expert] ... because [his analysis] was not included in his appraisal report.\u201d These contentions are without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E). The court\u2019s decisions in those respects were well within its discretion, and we perceive no likelihood of an unjust result.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-9\"> The Supreme Court recently reminded us, in a domestic violence case, that \"appellate courts should accord deference to ... factfinding\u201d by tribunals of special jurisdiction and expertise. <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 413, 713 A.2d 390 (1998). <em>Cf. Brady v. Board of Review, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>197, 210, 704 A.2d 547 (1997) (observing that the judicial capacity to review an agency\u2019s factfinding is limited). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>1 Plaintiff devoted considerable time, in its direct case and on cross-examination, attempting to establish that the location of the site for office use was inferior because of the lack of immediate access to major highways. I make no finding on this issue because, even if I were to accept plaintiffs position, my analysis would be unaffected. Plaintiff failed to present any evidence, such as rent or sales price comparisons, which would enable the court to quantify the impact of such alleged inferiority. In any event, the location of substantial office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>development in the vicinity of the subject property suggests that its location is not inferior.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
