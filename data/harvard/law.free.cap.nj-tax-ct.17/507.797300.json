The issue on appeal involves the amount of a claimed delinquency in sewer payments due from plaintiff to defendant which the Borough has applied against ordered tax refunds pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:4-134. Since there is no dispute over the amount of the tax assessment, Judge Andrew of the Tax Court correctly held that he lacked jurisdiction since the issue concerned the correctness of disputed sewer charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We have carefully considered the record as well as the contentions and supporting arguments of plaintiff. We affirm essentially for the reasons given in Judge Andrew\u2019s thorough opinion of July 11, 1997 reported at 17 <em>N.J. Tax </em>510 (Tax 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
