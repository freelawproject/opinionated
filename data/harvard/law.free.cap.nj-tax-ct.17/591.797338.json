Plaintiff had argued that it was entitled to offset its overpayment of corporate business taxes (CBT) against tax liabilities it incurred as the result of its merger with its parent company and a subsidiary company. In a comprehensive published opinion, the Tax Court judge rejected plaintiffs argument, concluding that the Director had \u201csatisfied <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:49 \u2014 16[(b)] fully in allowing only an offset of plaintiffs own premerger deficiencies with plaintiffs overpayments ... [and that the CBT] deficiencies of the other two entities cannot be offset with these funds.\u201d <em>Sea-Land Service, Inc. v.
