In 1982, Charles Ellerin and Louis Seidel decided to acquire four historic buildings in Westminster, Maryland, for commercial development. Ellerin and Seidel planned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>develop the properties through a limited partnership, Sherwood Square Associates (\u201cSherwood\u201d), of which they were the general partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Ellerin and Seidel financed their project through Fairfax Savings, F.S.B. (\u201cFairfax\u201d). Fairfax agreed to lend Sherwood a total of $5,700,000.00, made up of three separate loans. One loan was a conventional loan for $850,000.00.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The other two loans were Industrial Revenue Finance Bond (IRB) loans, acquired through the City of Westminster, in the amounts of $3,050,000.00 and $1,800,000.00 respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Because the buildings were initially little more than empty shells, Fairfax was concerned about security for its investment. Fairfax took mortgages on the property and buildings, but also insisted on personal guarantees from the project\u2019s principal investors. The nature and extent of these personal guarantees, and Fairfax\u2019s methods of securing them, are the subject of the litigation that ensued when, in 1985, Sherwood defaulted on the loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The major loan documents had been drafted, reviewed and approved by the parties before settlement. The loan documents for the transaction included a Loan Agreement and a Completion Guaranty for each IRB loan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Loan Agreements set out Sherwood\u2019s obligations with respect to developing the buildings and making payments on the loans, and created liabilities for Ellerin and Seidel in their capacities as general partners of Sherwood. The Completion Guaranties imposed personal obligations on Charles Ellerin and his wife Naoma, on Louis Seidel and his wife Gloria, and on Tri-Ess, a corporation owned by Ellerin and Seidel, that was the general contractor for the project. Fairfax submitted final drafts of the loan documents to the attorney for Ellerin and Seidel on or about December 22, 1982, and the attorney approved those documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The preapproved documents contained the following provisions governing the existence and duration of loan guarantees. Section 4.1 of the Loan Agreements made Sherwood and the individual partners liable only for breaches of undertakings specified in the Completion Guaranties, \u201cit being the intent that the Land, improvements and rents to issue therefrom shall constitute the sole security and source of funds for the repayment of the Loan\u201d once the buildings were completed. The Completion Guaranties themselves provided that \u201cthe obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall cease and be extinguished ... when the acquisition of the facility has been completed.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The obligations of the guarantors under the Completion Guaranties were to complete the buildings according to the specifications, and to secure additional financing to finish the project if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">The preapproved documents imposed no liability on Ellerin and Seidel for repayment of the debt once the buildings had been completed, either in their capacity as the general partners of Sherwood under the Loan Agreements, or in their capacity as guarantors of the project under the Completion Guaranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">It is undisputed that the preapproved loan documents were different from the documents signed at the settlement on December 29 and 30, 1982. The new Loan Agreements provided that neither Sherwood nor the individual partners would be liable for the loans if the event of default occurred \u201cat any time after the termination of the Completion Guaranty (pursuant to Section 8.1 thereof)----\u201d Section 8.1 of the new Completion Guaranties provided that the guarantors\u2019 obligations \u201cshall cease and be extinguished ... when the acquisition of the Facility has been completed and when the Facility Applicant [Sherwood] has fully complied with and satisfied the Rent Roll Requirement.\u201d The Rent Roll Requirement, a new addition to the Completion Guaranties, was defined to mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>the leasing of 70% of the total leaseable space in the finished buildings to tenants approved by Fairfax.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The new .obligations of the guarantors were listed in a rewritten section 3.1 of the Completion Guaranties. As in the original documents, the guarantors were required to complete the \u201cacquisition\u201d or construction of the project. A new section added to Section 3.1, however, imposed post-completion guarantees in the event that Sherwood \u201chas not fully complied with and satisfied the Rent Roll Requirement,\u201d but \u201c[i]n no event shall the aggregate liability of the Completion Guarantors under this subsection ... exceed $1,150,000____\u201d The parties remain divided over the liability of the parties under the loan documents signed at closing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Sherwood defaulted on the loans after the buildings were completed but before the Rent Roll Requirement was satisfied. Accordingly, Ellerin and Seidel would be free of liability under the documents approved on or about December 22, but would be liable for a disputed, but substantial, amount under the documents signed at settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">When Sherwood defaulted on the loans, Fairfax filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County three suits against Ellerin, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Seidel and their wives as guarantors, based on the Completion Guaranties, and two suits against Ellerin and Seidel, as general partners of Sherwood, based on the Loan Agreements. Confessed judgments docketed in these cases were vacated after the guarantors filed counterclaims. The counterclaims, setting forth tort causes of action for fraud or deceit, alleged that Fairfax had obtained the post-completion guarantees by fraud. In their counterclaims, the guarantors argued that after their attorney had approved the loan documents on or about December 22, Fairfax had fraudulently changed those documents to insert the post-completion guarantees contained in the documents ultimately signed at settlement, and that the guarantors had never been told of these changes. The guarantors demanded $6,000,000.00 in compensatory damages and $10,000,000.00 in punitive damages for the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The cases were tried for the first time in 1987. The trial was bifurcated, with the cases based on the Completion Guaranties tried first. During the month-long trial, Fairfax took the position that the guarantors had agreed to the changes in the loan documents. The guarantors introduced evidence that they knew nothing about the changes, and believed that the documents which they signed at settlement imposed no liability that could survive the completion of the buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In response to six questions on a special verdict sheet, the jury found, by clear and convincing evidence, that Fairfax\u2019s insertion of the post-completion guarantees into the final loan documents had been fraudulent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The jury also found that the guarantors had ratified the fraud by continuing with the project after they had learned what Fairfax had done. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>cording to the instructions on the verdict sheet, this finding required the jury to enter judgment in favor of Fairfax and against the guarantors, and barred the jury from awarding damages against Fairfax on the tort counterclaims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consequently, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Fairfax in the specified amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">After the jury verdict in the cases based on the Completion Guaranties, the circuit court granted Fairfax\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Ellerin and Seidel in the cases based on the Loan Agreements. The court entered judgment against Ellerin and Seidel for $5,263,688.75, the amount of the unpaid balance of the loans at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed based on the trial court\u2019s erroneous conclusion that, because Ellerin and Seidel had continued the contract with Fairfax, they were precluded from seeking damages for the fraud. <em>Ellerin v. Fairfax Sav. Ass\u2019n, </em>78 Md.App. 92, 109-111, 552 A.2d 918, 927-928, <em>cert. denied, </em>316 Md. 210, 557 A.2d 1336 (1989). The intermediate appellate court pointed out that, while the guarantors\u2019 continued performance might bar them from the remedy of rescission, they would still be entitled to tort damages based on the fraud.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Furthermore, the appellate court held.that the erroneous jury instructions had tainted the entire verdict. The Court of Special Appeals remanded the cases for a new trial on all issues, and this Court denied a petition for a writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>certiorari. The second trial began on September 25,1990, and ended almost a month later with a hung jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The cases were tried for the third time in 1990, with the liability phase of the trial tried separately from the damages phase. The verdict sheet at the liability phase asked only one question about Fairfax\u2019s alleged fraud:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">\u201cAre you persuaded that, when Mr. Ellerin signed the documents that he signed on December 29 and/or 30, 1982, neither he nor [his attorney] knew that additional personal guarantees had been inserted into [the Completion Guaranties and Loan Agreements]?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The jury answered \u201cyes\u201d to this question. The trial court did not instruct the jury on the elements of fraud. Although Fairfax made several objections to the jury instructions, it did not object to the court\u2019s failure to give an instruction on the elements of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The trial court held as a matter of law that the guarantors had ratified the contracts, so that they were liable to Fairfax for the balance then due on the loans. The damages phase of the trial was undertaken to establish the extent of Fairfax\u2019s liability in the guarantors\u2019 fraud action.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">At the damages phase of the trial, the court instructed the jury separately with respect to three different aspects of damages: the judgments entered against the guarantors, other compensatory damages, and punitive damages. In connection with punitive damages, the court told the jury that,, while it need not award punitive damages, it could award punitive damages in such an amount \u201cas in your sound judgment and discretion you find will serve to punish Fairfax for the conduct that you have found it engaged in in this case.\u201d The trial court refused Fairfax\u2019s request that the court instruct the jury with respect to the \u201cmalice\u201d required for an award of punitive damages. The court concluded that such an instruction was unnecessary in light of the jury\u2019s verdict on liability. As the court put it, \u201cWhat do you have to say [about malice] in a fraud case? They found fraud.\u201d The trial court\u2019s position was that actual malice was inherent in the elements of a tort action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>for fraud or deceit. In the court\u2019s view, if a plaintiff had established the elements of the tort action, he had necessarily established actual malice. Fairfax objected to the court\u2019s failure to instruct on actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The jury awarded both compensatory and punitive damages in the fraud action. The compensatory award included the full amount of the earlier judgment in favor of Fairfax, as well as compensatory \u201cemotional damages\u201d of $1,350,000.00 for Ellerin, and $625,000.00 each for Louis and Gloria Seidel. The total compensatory award against Fairfax, not including the amount that would be set off against Fairfax\u2019s judgment, was $2,650,695.00. The jury assessed the amount of punitive damages at $6,000,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Fairfax appealed. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the award of compensatory damages on the ground that Fairfax had failed to preserve for appellate review the issues raised concerning liability, including the issue of whether the trial court had erred in failing to instruct the jury on the elements of fraud. <em>Fairfax Savings v. Ellerin, </em>94 Md.App. 685, 695-696, 619 A.2d 141, 145-146 (1993). The Court of Special Appeals vacated the award of punitive damages and ordered a new trial, holding that the trial court should have instructed the jury concerning the malice necessary to support a punitive damages award and holding that Fairfax had fully preserved this issue for appeal. The Court of Special Appeals went on to state (94 Md.App. at 714, 619 A.2d at 155):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">\u201c[Sjomething more than simple, garden variety fraud is necessary to support a punitive damages award\u2014there must be a breach of fiduciary duty, or gross fraud, or other extraordinary or exceptional circumstances from which actual malice may be inferred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Both sides filed petitions for a writ of certiorari. Fairfax sought review of the issues relating to liability and to compensatory damages. Ellerin and the other guarantors challenged the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 grant of a new trial on punitive damages. We denied Fairfax\u2019s petition and granted the guar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>antors\u2019 petition. Therefore, the issue before us relates to the basis for punitive damages in an action of fraud or deceit.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The policy underlying awards of punitive damages in Maryland has been articulated in our cases for over a century. In <em>Phil., Wilm. &amp; Balt. Railroad Co. v. Hoeflich, </em>62 Md. 300, 304 (1884), in which the plaintiff was wrongfully ejected from a railroad car, this Court explained that punitive damages penalize a defendant for his wrongfulness or \u201cmalice\u201d (62 Md. at 307):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">\u201c[T]o entitle one to such damages there must be an element of fraud, or malice, or evil intent ... entering into and forming part of the wrongful act. It is in such cases as these that exemplary or punitive damages are awarded as a punishment for the evil motive or intent with which the act is done, and as an example or warning to others. But where the act, although wrongful in itself, is committed in the honest assertion of a supposed right\u2014or in the discharge of duty, or without any evil or bad intention, there is no ground on which such damages can be awarded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">We have recently reaffirmed that this is the basis for awarding punitive damages. In <em>Owens-Illinois v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 601 A.2d 633 (1992), the Court set forth the standards governing awards of punitive damages in non-intentional tort cases. In doing so, we reviewed the purpose of punitive damages under Maryland law (325 Md. at 454, 601 A.2d at 649-650):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">\u201c \u2018[T]he purposes of punitive damages relate entirely to the nature of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u2019 <em>Schaefer v. Miller, </em>[322 Md. 297, 321, 587 A.2d 491, 503 (1991) ].... [T]he availability of a punitive damages award ought to depend upon the heinous nature of the defendant\u2019s tortious conduct. <em>Schaefer, </em>322 Md. at 321-322, 587 A.2d at 503. <em>See, e.g., Vancherie v. Siperly, </em>243 Md. 366, 373-374, 221 A.2d 356, 360 (1966); <em>McClung-Logan v. Thomas, </em>226 Md. 136, 148, 172 A.2d 494, 500 (1961); <em>Davis v. Gordon, </em>[183 Md. 129, 133-134, 36 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>699, 701 (1944) ]; <em>Heinze v. Murphy, </em>180 Md. 423, 431-432, 24 A.2d 917, 921-922 (1942); <em>Nichols v. Meyer, </em>139 Md. 450, 457, 115 A. 786, 788 (1921); <em>Baltimore and Ohio R.R. Co. v. Boyd, </em>63 Md. 325, 334-335 (1885).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">\u201cAwarding punitive damages based upon the heinous nature of the defendant\u2019s tortious conduct furthers the historical purposes of punitive damages\u2014punishment and deterrence. <em>Schaefer v. Miller, supra, </em>322 Md. at 321, 587 A.2d at 503; <em>Embrey v. Holly, </em>293 Md. 128, 142, 442 A.2d 966, 973 (1982); <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank v. Fid. &amp; Dep. Co., </em>283 Md. 228, 232, 389 A.2d 359, 361 (1978). Thus, punitive damages are awarded in an attempt to punish a defendant whose conduct is characterized by evil motive, intent to injure, or fraud, and to warn others contemplating similar conduct of the serious risk of monetary liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2z\">Furthermore, in <em>Adams v. Coates, </em>331 Md. 1, 13, 626 A.2d 36, 42 (1993), the Court stated that the policy explained in <em>Zenobia </em>generally \u201cshould govern any award of punitive damages,\u201d including punitive damages arising from intentional torts. <em>See also Komornik v. Sparks, </em>331 Md. 720, 725, 629 A.2d 721, 723 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Accordingly, with regard to most types of tort actions, Maryland law has limited the availability of punitive damages to situations in which the defendant\u2019s conduct is characterized by knowing and deliberate wrongdoing. In <em>Owens-Illinois v. Zenobia, supra, </em>this Court rejected a gross negligence standard for the availability of punitive damages in non-intentional tort cases. We specifically overruled the negligence and product liability cases which had permitted punitive damages to be awarded on the basis of \u201cimplied malice,\u201d where implied malice was defined as \u201cgross negligence.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Court held that punitive damages may only be awarded in such cases when \u201cthe plaintiff has established that the defendant\u2019s conduct was characterized by evil motive, intent to injure, ill will, or fraud, <em>ie., </em>\u2018actual malice.\u2019 \u201d 325 Md. at 460, 601 A.2d at 652.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Thus, in this case it is appropriate to examine the elements of the tort of fraud or deceit for the purpose of determining to what extent the tort inherently involves the state of mind and conduct which is ordinarily required for the allowability of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">This Court recently summarized the elements of the tort action of fraud or deceit in <em>Nails v. S &amp; R, </em>334 Md. 398, 415-416, 639 A.2d 660, 668-669 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">\u201cIn order to recover damages in an action for fraud or deceit, a plaintiff must prove (1) that the defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff, (2) that its falsity was either known to the defendant or that the representation was made with reckless indifference as to its truth, (3) that the misrepresentation was made for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff, (4) that the plaintiff relied on the misrepresentation and had the right to rely on it, and (5) that the plaintiff suffered compensable injury resulting from the misrepresentation. <em>Everett v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec., </em>307 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Md. 286, 300, 513 A.2d 882, 889 (1986); <em>Martens Chevrolet v.

Baltimore Trust Co., </em>102 Md. 1, 13, 61 A. 301, 306 (1905); <em>Boulden v. Stilwell, </em>100 Md. 543, 552, 60 A. 609, 610 (1905); <em>Cahill v. Applegarth, </em>98 Md. 493, 499-504, 56 A. 794, 795-797 (1904); <em>Robertson v. Parks, </em>76 Md. 118, 131-133, 24 A. 411, 412-413 (1892); <em>McAleer v. Horsey, </em>35 Md. 439, 452-454 (1872).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">In deciding whether the second and third elements describe the kind of evil motive or bad intent which may justify a punitive damages award in Maryland, we first consider the requirement that the defendant\u2019s representation be made with an intent to defraud the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In what is still the leading Maryland case on the tort of fraud or deceit, <em>McAleer v. Horsey, </em>35 Md. 439 (1872), our predecessors described the intent that characterizes the tort as follows (35 Md. at 453):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">\u201c \u2018An action cannot be supported for telling a bare naked lie, <em>ie., </em>saying a thing which is false, knowing or not knowing it to be so, and without any intention that another should rely upon the false statement and act upon it; but if a falsehood be knowingly told, with an intention that another should believe it to be true and act upon it, and that person does act upon it and thereby suffers damage, the party telling the falsehood is responsible in damages in an action for deceit____\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Therefore, recovery in a tort action for fraud or deceit in Maryland is based upon a defendant\u2019s deliberate intent to deceive. <em>See also Nails v. S &amp; R, supra, </em>334 Md. at 415, 639 A.2d at 668; <em>B.N. v. K.K., </em>312 Md. 135, 149, 538 A.2d 1175, 1182 (1988); <em>Martens Chevrolet v. Seney, </em>292 Md. 328, 333, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>439 A.2d 534, 537 (1982); <em>Appel v. Hupfield, </em>198 Md. 374, 378-379, 84 A.2d 94, 96 (1951); <em>Gittings v. Von Dorn, </em>136 Md. 10, 15, 109 A. 553, 554 (1920); <em>Donnelly v. Baltimore Trust Co., </em>102 Md. 1, 13, 61 A. 301, 306 (1905); <em>Robertson v. Parks, </em>76 Md. 118, 132, 24 A. 411, 413 (1892).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The other mental element of fraud, and perhaps the most troublesome element of the tort, is the requirement concerning the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the falsity. The plaintiff in an action of fraud or deceit must prove that the defendant either knew that the representation was false or made the representation with \u201creckless indifference\u201d as to its truth. With regard to the \u201creckless indifference\u201d alternative, although several Maryland cases use the phrases \u201creckless indifference\u201d or \u201creckless disregard,\u201d the words do not signify a representation which the defendant, through negligence, believes to be true. Instead, the words seemed to be used in fraud cases to connote the defendant\u2019s awareness that he does not know whether the representation is true or false.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Thus in <em>Robertson v. Parks, supra, </em>76 Md. at 131, 24 A. at 412, Chief Judge Alvey for the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">\u201cIt is not necessary in all cases to show that the defendant <em>knew </em>at the time that the representation made by him was false in fact. It is sufficient if the statement be made for a fraudulent purpose and without a <em>bona fide </em>belief in its truth by the defendant, with the intention of inducing the plaintiff to do an act----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">And later the Court reiterated (76 Md. at 132, 24 A. at 413):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxI\">\u201cIt is only necessary to show that the defendant pretended to a knowledge which he must, according to principles of reason and good faith, have known that he did not possess at the time of the misrepresentation made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">In <em>Cahill v. Applegarth, </em>98 Md. 493, 56 A. 794 (1904), this Court reversed a judgment for the plaintiff in a fraud case. The trial court in that case had instructed the jury that it might find fraud if the defendant\u2019s representations \u2018\u201cwere either known to the defendant to be false, or by the exercise of ordinary care ... ought in your judgment to have been known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>by him to be false.\u2019 \u201d 98 Md. at 499, 56 A. at 795. Recognizing that this instruction substituted negligence for knowledge of the falsity, this Court concluded that only a defendant\u2019s knowledge that a representation was false, or his knowledge that he did not know whether the statement was true or false, would suffice in a tort action of fraud or deceit (98 Md. at 502, 56 A. at 797):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">\u201cThe general rule undoubtedly is that in actions for deceit there must be knowledge of the falsity, by the party making the representation, and hence scienter must be expressly alleged and proven, or there must be such allegations and proof as import knowledge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The Court in <em>Cahill v. Applegarth, supra, </em>held that no representation believed by its speaker to be true can give rise to a cause of action in tort for fraud or deceit, no matter how false the representation is, or how negligent the speaker\u2019s belief may be. The Court emphasized (98 Md. at 502, 56 A. at 796):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAu\">\u201c \u2018The representation upon which it is based must be shown not only to have been false and material, but that the defendant when he made it knew that it was false, or not knowing whether it was true or false and not caring what the facts might be, made it recklessly, paying no heed to the injury which might ensue. Misjudgment, however gross, or <em>want of caution, </em>however marked, <em>is not fraud.' \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Consequently, a defendant is liable in a tort action of fraud or deceit only if he knows that his representation is false, or is recklessly indifferent in the sense that he knows that he lacks knowledge as to its truth or falsity. In addition, the defendant must intend to mislead the plaintiff; his misrepresentation must in fact mislead the plaintiff, and the plaintiff must suffer injury resulting therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Although Maryland cases since <em>McAleer v. Horsey, supra, </em>35 Md. 439, have consistently stated that the tort of fraud or deceit may be committed by a defendant who is recklessly indifferent to the truth of the statement that deceives the plaintiff, there appears to be no decision of this Court sustaining a judgment in favor of the plaintiff on this basis. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>fraud cases in this Court have generally involved findings or allegations that the falsity of the representation was actually known to the defendant. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s motives have invariably been dishonest, corrupt or immoral. <em>See, e.g., Nails v. S &amp; R, supra, </em>334 Md. at 403, 639 A.2d at 662; <em>B.N. v. K.K., supra, </em>312 Md. at 153, 538 A.2d at 1184; <em>Everett v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec., </em>307 Md. 286, 300-301, 513 A.2d 882, 890 (1986); <em>James v. Weisheit, </em>279 Md. 41, 43, 367 A.2d 482, 484 (1977); <em>Schmidt v. Millhauser, </em>212 Md. 585, 130 A.2d 572 (1957); <em>Gittings v. Von Dorn, supra, </em>136 Md. 10, 109 A. 553; <em>Boulden v. Stilwell, </em>100 Md. 543, 60 A. 609 (1905); <em>Buschman &amp; Cook v. Codd, </em>52 Md. 202 (1879); <em>McAleer v. Horsey, supra, </em>35 Md. at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">When a tort was committed willfully and with knowledge of the wrong, instead of by ignorance, mistake or negligence, this Court very early held that it was committed with the requisite \u201cbad motive\u201d to allow punitive damages. Thus, in <em>Ridgely v. Bond &amp; Wife, </em>17 Md. 14, 20-21, 22-23 (1861), an action of trespass <em>quare clausum fregit, </em>this Court agreed that one who \u201cmay innocently appropriate his neighbor\u2019s property, supposing it to be his own,\u201d is liable only for compensatory damages, but when he \u201cdoes so, knowing it not to be his own, he is liable in vindictive damages.\u201d <em>See Schindel v. Schindel, </em>12 Md. 108, 122-123 (1858) (\u201cThe man who, from bad and malicious intentions, commits a trespass, ought, in justice, to be dealt with more harshly than one who acts ... ignorantly\u201d); <em>Barton Coal Co. v. Cox, </em>39 Md. 1, 30 (1873) (action of trespass <em>quare clausum fregit </em>and trespass <em>de bonis asportatis </em>where the Court held, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthat knowledge on the part of the defendant, that the <em>locus in quo\u2019 </em>was not its own lands, at the time the trespasses were committed, entitled the plaintiffs to exemplary damages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">More recently, this Court has reaffirmed the principle that punitive damages liability must be based on the defendant\u2019s conscious wrongdoing. In <em>Owens-Illinois v. Zenobia, supra, </em>325 Md. at 460, 601 A.2d at 652, the Court held that \u201c[i]n a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>non-intentional tort action, the trier of facts may not award punitive damages unless the plaintiff has established that the defendant\u2019s conduct was characterized by evil motive, intent to injure, ill will, or fraud, <em>ie., </em>\u2018actual malice\u2019.\u201d Applying this principle to products liability cases, the Court held that \u201cactual malice\u201d in the context of products liability included \u201c(1) actual knowledge of the defect on the part of the defendant, and (2) the defend\u00e1nt\u2019s conscious or deliberate disregard of the foreseeable harm resulting from the defect.\u201d <em>Owens-Illinois v. Zenobia, supra, </em>325 Md. at 462, 601 A.2d at 653. The Court further explained the knowledge requirement as follows (325 Md. at 462, 601 A.2d at 653-654):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\">\u201cThe knowledge component, which we hold is necessary to support an award of punitive damages, does <em>not </em>mean \u2018constructive knowledge\u2019 or \u2018substantial knowledge\u2019 or \u2018should have known.\u2019 More is required to expose a defendant to a potential punitive damages award. The plaintiff must show that the defendant <em>actually </em>knew of the defect and of the danger of the product at the time the product left the defendant\u2019s possession or control.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">As we have discussed, the Maryland cases concerning fraud or deceit have typically involved the form of the tort which is characterized by the defendant\u2019s deliberate deception of the plaintiff by means of a representation which he knows to be false. We believe that the defendant\u2019s actual knowledge of falsity, coupled with his intent to deceive the plaintiff by means of the false statement, constitutes the actual malice required to support an award of punitive damages. <em>See </em>Sedgwick, <em>A Treatise on the Measure of Damages </em>\u00a7 367 (8th ed. 1891), (\u201cit is difficult to see how a fraudulent tort can be accomplished without a malicious intent\u201d). From our earliest decisions to the present day, this Court has consistently listed \u201cfraud\u201d among the types of dishonest or immoral conduct for which punitive damages are recoverable. <em>See, e.g., Komornik v. Sparks, supra, </em>331 Md. at 727, 629 A.2d at 725 (defining \u201cactual malice\u201d as conduct \u201ccharacterized by evil motive, intent to injure, ill will, or fraud\u201d); <em>Adams v. Coates, supra, </em>331 Md. at 13, 626 A.2d at 42 (punitive damages are not available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>in the \u201cabsence of malice or fraud\u201d); <em>Owens-Illinois v. Zenobia, supra, </em>325 Md. at 462, 601 A.2d at 653 (describing \u201cthe \u2018evil motive,\u2019 \u2018intent to defraud,\u2019 or \u2018intent to injure,\u2019 which generally characterize[ ] \u2018actual malice\u2019 \u201d); <em>Davis v. Gordon, </em>183 Md. 129, 133, 36 A.2d 699, 701 (1944) (\u201c \u2018to entitle one to [punitive] damages there must be an element of fraud, or malice, or evil intent\u2019 \u201d); <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co. v. Boyd, </em>63 Md. 325, 334-335 (1885) (requiring fraud, malice, or evil intent); <em>Phil., Wilm. &amp; Balt. Railroad Co. v. Hoeflich, supra, </em>62 Md. at 307 (same). <em>See also Jannenga v. Johnson, </em>243 Md. 1, 5, 220 A.2d 89, 91 (1966) (equating \u201cactual fraud\u201d with conduct \u201ccompelled by malicious motives\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Consequently, the elements of the tort of fraud or deceit in Maryland, where the tort is committed by a defendant who knows that his representation is false, include the type of deliberate wrongdoing and evil motive that has traditionally justified the award of punitive damages.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">On the other hand, when a particular fraud or deceit action is based on the alternative form of the knowledge element, namely a \u201creckless disregard\u201d as to the truth of the representation, the traditional basis for the allowability of punitive damages is not present. As we have earlier explained, \u201creckless disregard\u201d in this context does not mean a situation where the defendant honestly, but negligently, believed that the representation was true. Nevertheless, it does not mean actual knowledge of the falsity. Under the principles set forth in several of our earliest cases, and reaffirmed in <em>Owens-Illinois v. Zenobia </em>and other recent cases, \u201creckless disregard\u201d or \u201creckless indifference\u201d concerning the truth of the representation falls short of the mens rea which is required to support an award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Likewise, other conduct, recognized by the law and sometimes labeled \u201cfraud,\u201d falls short of the act of deliberate . deception required for actual malice in this context, and is not sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award. For example, while \u201cconstructive fraud\u201d has been recognized for certain purposes in Maryland, it does not necessarily involved the type of dishonest or immoral conduct that is required to support an award of punitive damages.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See Jannenga v. Johnson, supra, </em>243 Md. at 5, 220 A.2d at 91; <em>Whitehurst v. Barnett, </em>161 Md. 444, 157 A. 737 (1932). Similarly, the \u201cfraud\u201d that justifies rescission of a contract generally does not require proof of wrongful conduct.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Steele v. Goettee, </em>313 Md. 11, 22, 542 A.2d, 847, 853 (1988); <em>Creamer v. Helferstay, </em>294 Md. 107, 116-117, 448 A.2d 332, 337 (1982); <em>Babb v.

Taylor, </em>6 G. &amp; J. 54, 58 (1833).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The Court of Special Appeals in this case correctly held that \u201cactual malice must be proven for recovery of punitive damages in an action for fraud.\u201d <em>Fairfax Savings v. Ellerin, supra, </em>94 Md.App. at 710, 619 A.2d at 153. Neverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>less, the intermediate appellate court further held that proof of fraud, even when based on the defendant\u2019s actual knowledge of the falsity, was not a sufficient predicate for punitive damages liability. The court was of the view that \u201cadditional proof\u2019 of some further aggravating circumstances was needed if punitive damages were to be recovered. 94 Md.App. at 712-713, 619 A.2d at 154. In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Special Appeals relied on <em>Russell v. Stoops, </em>106 Md. 138, 66 A. 698 (1907), and <em>Fowler v. Benton, </em>245 Md. 540, 226 A.2d 556, <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 851, 88 S.Ct. 42, 19 L.Ed.2d 119 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">In <em>Russell v. Stoops, supra, </em>this Court reversed a judgment for the plaintiff in a fraud action \u201cfor error in not sustaining the demurrer to the declaration,\u201d as well as for other errors committed by the trial court. 106 Md. at 147, 66 A. at 701. In dicta, and without citing a single case, the Court in <em>Russell </em>quoted from an encyclopedia of the time as follows (106 Md. at 143-144, 66 A. at 700):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">\u201c Tn ordinary cases the recovery of exemplary, punitive, or vindictive damages will not be allowed in an action of deceit; but such damages may be allowed where the wrong involves some violation of duty springing from a relation of trust or confidence, or where the fraud is gross, or the case presents other extraordinary or exceptional circumstances clearly indicating malice and wilfulness and calling for an extension of the doctrine.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">In <em>Fowler v. Benton, supra, </em>245 Md. at 552-553, 226 A.2d at 564, the Court, again as dicta, repeated the same quotation. The holding in <em>Fowler </em>was that the issues relating to punitive damages had not been preserved for appellate review. In light of the numerous cases in this Court taking the position that \u201cactual malice\u201d to support an award of punitive damages includes fraud, and in light of the elements of a tort action for fraud or deceit, the mere quotation from an encyclopedia in the <em>Russell v. Stoops </em>case furnishes little authority for the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The quotation from the encyclopedia in <em>Russell v. Stoops </em>may well have reflected developments in the law of fraud in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>those jurisdictions which , had expanded the tort to include liability for negligent or grossly negligent misrepresentations. This situation exists today in a number of jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Renaut, </em>387 Pa.Super. 299, 306, 564 A.2d 188, 192 (1989); <em>Hines v. Amole, 4 </em>Ohio App.3d 263, 269, 448 N.E.2d 473, 479-480 (1982); <em>Moore Ford Co. v. Smith, </em>270 Ark. 340, 346-347, 604 S.W.2d 943, 947 (1980); <em>Mayfield Motor Co., Inc. v. Parker, </em>222 Miss. 152, 159, 75 So.2d 435, 437 (1954); <em>Rosenberg v. Howle, </em>56 A.2d 709, 712 (D.C.1948). In many of those jurisdictions which have expanded the tort of fraud to also encompass negligent falsehoods, proof of fraud alone generally does not entitle a plaintiff to punitive damages. Rather, additional aggravating circumstances are required before punitive damages may be awarded. <em>See BWX Electronics, Inc. v. Control Data Corp., </em>929 F.2d 707, 712-713 (D.C.Cir.1991) (applying <em>Feltman v. Sarbov, </em>366 A.2d 137, 141 (D.C.1976)); <em>German Auto, Inc. v. Tamburello, </em>565 So.2d 238, 240 (Ala.1990) (\u201cPunitive damages may be awarded if there is a finding of intent to deceive or defraud____ However, if the representation was mistakenly and innocently made, then only compensatory damages are recoverable\u201d); <em>Smith v. Renaut, supra, </em>387 Pa.Super. at 309, 564 A.2d at 193; <em>Gardner v. Jones, </em>464 So.2d 1144, 1149-1150 (Miss.1985) (vacating punitive damages award based on a negligent misrepresentation \u201c[bjecause there is no evidence in this record of actual fraudulent or malicious intent on the part of [the defendant]\u201d); <em>Ray Dodge, Inc. v. Moore, </em>251 Ark. 1036, 1043, 479 S.W.2d 518, 522 (1972) (holding that if \u201cthere was evidence tending to show that [the defendant] intentionally performed a deliberate act with the intention of misleading a prospective purchaser about a material matter to his injury, it was proper to permit the jury to consider the award of exemplary or punitive damages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In contrast with changes in the law in some jurisdictions, the tort of fraud or deceit in Maryland has remained the same since 1872, when our predecessors defined it in <em>McAleer v. Horsey, supra, </em>35 Md. 439. <em>See Martens Chevrolet v. Seney, supra, </em>292 Md. at 333, 439 A.2d at 537. This Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>repeatedly refused to expand the tort to encompass liability for negligent or grossly negligent representations. In <em>Cahill v. Applegarth, supra, </em>98 Md. at 502, 56 A. at 796, the Court emphatically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\">\u201c \u2018The gravamen of the action is actual fraud, and nothing less will sustain it.... Misjudgment, however gross, or <em>want of caution, </em>however marked, <em>is not fraud. </em>Intentional fraud, as distinguished from a mere breach of duty or <em>the omission to use due care, </em>is an essential factor in an action for deceit.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Later, in <em>Boulden v. Stilwell, supra, </em>100 Md. at 552, 60 A. at 610, the Court again stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am3\">\u201c[t]he foundation of the action is actual fraud, and nothing short of this will suffice. Consequently, a misrepresentation believed by the speaker to be true, though induced by his ignorance or negligence, will not sustain an action for deceit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The Court in <em>Donnelly v. Baltimore Trust Co., supra, </em>102 Md. at 13, 61 A. at 306, indicated that one who negligently makes a misrepresentation might be liable in an action other than fraud or deceit, \u201cbut he is not liable in this form of action\u2014 which has as its basis actual fraud----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">In <em>Babb v. Bolyard, supra, </em>194 Md. at 608-609, 72 A.2d at 16, the Court pointed out that, \u201c[i]n some states the action for deceit has been expanded ... to cover, besides actual fraud, negligent misrepresentation,\u201d but that in Maryland, \u201c\u2018[t]he foundation of the action is actual fraud and nothing short of this will suffice.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Appel v. Hupfield, supra, </em>198 Md. at 379, 84 A.2d at 96 (\u201cBut the law is equally clear in Maryland that there can be no recovery in an action for deceit on the ground of negligent misrepresentation\u201d). <em>See also Schmidt v. Millhauser, supra, </em>212 Md. at 592, 130 A.2d at 575; <em>Holt v. Kolker, </em>189 Md. 636, 639, 57 A.2d 287, 288 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Other jurisdictions, like Maryland, that restrict the tort of fraud or deceit to its traditional elements, generally hold that proof of fraud, without more, is sufficient for the availability of punitive damages. <em>See, e.g., O\u2019Leary v. Industrial Park </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number><em>Corp., </em>211 Conn. 648, 651, 560 A.2d 968, 970 (1989); <em>Amber Properties v. Howard Elec. &amp; Mech, </em>775 P.2d 43, 46 (Colo. App.1988); <em>First Interstate Dev. v. Ablanedo, </em>511 So.2d 536, 539 (Fla.1987) (\u201c[P]roof of fraud sufficient to support compensatory damages necessarily is sufficient to create a jury question regarding punitive damages. This is so because intentional misconduct is a necessary element of fraud\u201d); <em>Nappe v. Anschelewitz, Barr, Ansell &amp; Bonello, </em>97 N.J. 37, 50, 477 A.2d 1224, 1231 (1984) (\u201cit is especially fitting to allow punitive damages for actions such as legal fraud, since intent rather than mere negligence is the requisite state of mind\u201d); <em>Shaver v. N.C. Monroe Constr. Co., </em>63 N.C.App. 605, 616, 306 S.E.2d 519, 526 (1983) (\u201cpunitive damages may be recovered as a matter of law in fraud cases, because fraud, by its very nature, involves the element of aggravation or intentional wrongdoing\u201d). Furthermore, where the torts of intentional fraud and negligent misrepresentation are distinct within a single jurisdiction, different punitive damages standards have been applied to each. <em>Compare, e.g., McMullin v. Murphy, </em>89 Or.App. 230, 234, 748 P.2d 171, 173 (1988) (holding that \u201cevidence sufficient to establish intentional fraud is also necessarily sufficient to support the requisite findings for the imposition of punitive damages\u201d) <em>with Schmidt v. Pine Tree Land Development Co., </em>291 Or. 462, 466, 631 P.2d 1373, 1375 (1981) (in banc) (requiring, in the case of reckless misrepresentation, something more than the elements of the tort to support punitive damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Consequently, although some jurisdictions require proof of more than fraud for the availability of punitive damages, while other jurisdictions make punitive damages available on the basis of proof of fraud alone, the underlying basis for punitive damages awards in fraud actions is ordinarily the same\u2014the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the falsity and deliberate wrongdoing. In our view, a person\u2019s actual knowledge that his statement is false, coupled with his intent to deceive another by means of that statement, constitute the \u201cactual malice\u201d required for the availability of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">In the present case, the trial court held that the \u201cactual malice\u201d required to support an award of punitive damages is inherent in the elements of a tort action for fraud or deceit. This holding was, of course, too broad, as the trial court did not, and could not have been expected to, anticipate the distinction which we have drawn between actual knowledge of the falsity and \u201creckless indifference.\u201d Moreover, the jury which awarded the punitive damages had not been instructed on the elements of the tort. In addition, the specific factual finding on the verdict sheet did not reflect the elements of fraud or deceit. The jury\u2019s sole factual finding in connection with the alleged fraud was that, \u201cwhen Mr. Ellerin signed the documents that he signed on December 29 and/or 30, 1982, neither he nor [his attorney] knew that additional personal guarantees had been inserted into [the Completion Guaranties and Loan Agreements].\u201d The jury did not expressly find that any officer or agent of Fairfax knew that the documents had been changed without the guarantors\u2019 knowledge or consent, or that any agent of Fairfax intended to deceive the guarantors into undertaking additional guaranty obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In light of the holding of the Court of Special Appeals that Fairfax, at the liability stage of the trial, had failed to preserve for appellate review any issue concerning jury instructions on the elements of fraud, and in light of this Court\u2019s denial of certiorari with respect to that holding, we have no issue before us concerning the award of compensatory damages. Nonetheless, the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the elements of fraud is pertinent to the award of punitive damages. This jury was at no time instructed on the appropriate basis for a punitive damages award, and, as held by the Court of Special Appeals, this issue was fully preserved for appellate review. Thus, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the award of punitive damages should be vacated and the case remanded for a new trial on punitive damages. The new trial should be conducted in accordance with the principles set forth in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>In both the Court of Special Appeals and in this Court, Fairfax has also challenged the punitive damages award on other grounds, including the argument that the amount of the punitive damages award was excessive. Since we have ordered a new trial on punitive damages, we shall, for the guidance of the trial court on remand, comment on one feature of Maryland law concerning punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Since the earliest days, this Court has held that punitive damage awards must not be disproportionate to the gravity of the defendant\u2019s wrong. <em>See, e.g., Embrey v. Holly, </em>293 Md. 128, 141-142, 442 A.2d 966, 973 (1982) (\u201cpunitive damages ... must relate to the degree of culpability ... and ... ability to pay\u201d); <em>Schloss v. Silverman, </em>172 Md. 632, 644, 192 A. 343, 348 (1937) (pointing out, with respect to punitive damages, that \u201cthe \u2018punishment [must] fit the crime\u2019\u201d); <em>Moore v. Schultz, </em>31 Md. 418, 424 (1869) (punitive damages \u201cshould not be disproportioned to the enormity of the case\u201d). Upon request, a jury should be instructed that punitive damages should not be disproportionate to either the wrongfulness of the defendant\u2019s conduct or the defendant\u2019s ability to pay. Moreover, like any award of damages in a tort case, the amount of punitive damages awarded by a jury is reviewable by the trial court for excessiveness. <em>See, e.g., Banegura v. Taylor, </em>312 Md. 609, 624, 541 A.2d 969, 976 (1988); <em>Conklin v. Schillinger, </em>255 Md. 50, 64, 257 A.2d 187, 194 (1969); <em>Turner v. Wash.

Ellerin and Seidel contend that the loan documents, taken as a whole, imposed post-completion liability on them for the entire amount of both IRB loans, $4,850,000.00, until 70% of the buildings were leased. Since the Loan Agreements exculpated Sherwood and the partners only when the Completion Guaranty was terminated \"pursuant to Section 8.1 thereof,\" and since Section 8.1 of the Completion Guaranty defined termination to include satisfaction of the Rent Roll Requirement, Ellerin and Seidel argue that they incurred post-completion liability under the Loan Agreement for the entire amount of the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">Fairfax, on the other hand, insists that Ellerin and Seidel could incur a maximum post-completion liability of only $1,150,000.00 for each loan, the amount specified in the Completion Guaranties. While Fair-fax concedes that the loan documents can be read as Ellerin and Seidel suggest, it argues that such an interpretation is the result of carelessness and haste in preparing the documents on the part of Fairfax\u2019s outside counsel, Weinberg &amp; Green. Fairfax in its brief points to testimony from one of Weinberg <em>&amp; </em>Green\u2019s attorneys, to the effect that reading the loan documents to impose full post-completion liability on Ellerin and Seidel under the Loan Agreements was \"not [his] intent in drafting the documents and was a mistake.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b283-6\">. The six questions tracked the elements of a tort action for fraud or deceit in Maryland. The jury found that Fairfax had knowingly inserted the guarantees into the loan documents without the guarantors\u2019 knowledge, that the inclusion constituted a false representation of material fact or the concealment of a material fact that Fairfax had a duty to disclose, that the misrepresentation or concealment induced the guarantors\u2019 belief that they would not incur post-completion liability, that the guarantors relied on Fairfax for their belief that they had no post-completion liability, that the guarantors\u2019 reliance on Fairfax was justifiable, and that the guarantors suffered damage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\">.

We have recently seen several multi-million dollar punitive damages awards for alleged tortious conduct in the course of commercial activity. As previously discussed, punitive damages are intended to punish and deter \"heinous\" or \"outrageous\u201d conduct. <em>See Schaefer v. Miller, </em>322 Md. 297, 321, 587 A.2d 491, 503 (1991) (concurring opinion). As stated by the Court in <em>Embrey v. Holly, supra, </em>293 Md. at 142, 442 A.2d at 973, \"[p]unitive damages, in essence, represent a civil fine____\" In this connection, it is noteworthy that the largest maximum fine prescribed by the Maryland General Assembly for any single criminal offense is $1,000,000.00 under the drug kingpin statute, Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 286(g)(2)(ii). The greatest maximum fine for a so-called \"commercial\u201d crime is $500,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>000.00 under the Maryland antitrust statute, Code (1975, 1990 Repl. Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 11-212 of the Commercial Law Article. Article 27 of the Maryland Code includes numerous fraud offenses, with the largest maximum fine for any of these being $10,000.00. <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 174 (setting $10,000.00 maximum penalty for the crime of fraudulent misrepresentation by a corporate officer or agent); Art. 27, \u00a7 230D ($10,000.00 maximum penalty for Medicaid fraud).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">There are other pertinent considerations in fixing an amount of punitive damages, and we do not suggest that criminal monetary penalties should provide a cap for punitive damage awards. Nonetheless, in determining whether an award of punitive damages is proportionate to the defendant\u2019s misconduct, a court may consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the legislative policy reflected in statutes setting criminal fines.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b303-4\">BELL, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Af0\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The majority quite properly rejects the notion, espoused, and, indeed, held by the Court of Special Appeals, \u201cthat proof of fraud, even when based on the defendant\u2019s actual knowledge of its falsity, was not a sufficient predicate for punitive damages liability\u201d and \u201cthat \u2018additional proof of some further aggravated circumstances was needed if punitive damages were to be recovered.\u201d 337 Md. 216, 237, 652 A.2d 1117, 1127. I also agree with the majority that proof of \u201cactual malice\u201d is a prerequisite for recovery of punitive damages in a fraud action; the mental aspect of the tort mandates that one who perpetrates the tort have \u201cactual knowledge\u201d that the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>ment is a misrepresentation. The majority defines \u201cactual knowledge\u201d to exclude the situation in which the perpetrator is consciously aware (has actual knowledge) that he or she does not know whether the representation is true or false. It is with this proposition that I do not 'agree. It is my view, in other words, that the requisite mental state authorizing consideration of punitive damages is inherent in the elements of fraud or deceit, as that tort has traditionally been defined by this Court. I fully agree with the circuit court in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">It has long been the law of Maryland and, thus, well settled, that a defendant, intending to mislead the plaintiff and fully aware that he or she does not know whether the representation he or she makes is true or false, commits the tort of fraud or deceit. <em>E.g., Robertson v. Parks, </em>76 Md. 118, 131, 24 A. 411, 412 (1892). The rationale underlying the rule is that making a representation of a fact, with intent to deceive and actual knowledge that the speaker does not know whether it is fact or not, is as much a misrepresentation as one made with actual knowledge of falsity and that actual knowledge of the former is as reprehensible as actual knowledge of the latter. Fully recognizing the state of the law, <em>see </em>337 Md. at 229-233, 652 A.2d at 1123-1125, but noting that \u201cMaryland cases concerning fraud or deceit have typically involved the form of the tort which is characterized by the defendant\u2019s deliberate deception of the plaintiff by means of a representation which he knows to be false,\u201d the majority nevertheless \u201crefines\u201d the actual knowledge prong of the tort, to include only that situation. <em>Id. </em>337 Md. at 234, 652 A.2d at 1126. And it does so, fully cognizant that, as traditionally understood, the tort countenanced no amount of negligence, however gross. <em>See </em>337 Md. at 236-239, 652 A.2d at 1127-1128. There is absolutely no basis for the majority\u2019s change of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">I also agree with the circuit court\u2019s judgment, which is reflective of heretofore well established principles. Thus, in my humble opinion, just as inexorably as night follows day, the jury\u2019s determination that punitive damages were warranted in this case follows from its earlier finding that the appellees\u2019 conduct constituted fraud or deceit. That this is so is obvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>from even a cursory review of what transpired in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Although the liability phase of the trial was tried separately from the damages phase, the same jury tried both. Consequently, that jury was fully aware of the conduct, on the basis of which it assessed punitive damages. It is true that the court did not instruct the jury as to the elements of fraud or deceit. But the court did instruct the jury in terms of the conduct alleged by the plaintiffs to have been fraudulent. In that regard, the court advised the jury that if the defendant slipped the guarantees in without telling the plaintiffs or without the plaintiffs knowing that they had been slipped in, that\u2019s fraud.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, it was agreed that such conduct was fraud. That this is so is reflected in comments made by the trial court in the presence of all counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">Now, in this case the only issue for the jury is were they [the plaintiffs] put on notice of that fact [the insertion of the guarantees]. It is conceded that they should have been. So, I guess you can argue the case whichever way you wish. If you are comfortable with sort of outlining the elements of fraud, that\u2019s f\u00edne. But everybody concedes that if the notice wasn\u2019t given, then there was a fraud,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATc\">and by the question that was propounded to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">Are you persuaded that, when [the appellant] signed the documents that he signed on December 29 and/or 30, neither he nor [his attorney] knew that additional personal guarantees had been inserted into [the completion guarantees and loan agreements]?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Having previously determined that the defendant had engaged in conduct which constituted fraud or deceit, the jury had only to decide in the damages phase of trial, whether that conduct was sufficiently egregious as to warrant the award of punitive damages. That is precisely what the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>instructed. It told the jury that notwithstanding its prior finding, punitive damages need not be awarded, but that it could award punitive damages in such an amount \u201cas in your sound judgment and discretion you find will serve to punish [the appellee] for the conduct you have found it engaged in in this case.\u201d Because the jury was instructed on fraud, <em>albeit </em>in terms of conduct, as opposed to its elements, to which the defendant did not interpose any objections, and the parties agreed that the jury\u2019s resolution of the factual dispute in favor of the plaintiffs would constitute the conduct engaged in by the defendant as fraud or deceit, there was no reason, as the trial court asserted, to give it a further instruction on \u201cmalice.\u201d This is consistent with the court\u2019s holding with respect to the mental state required for fraud or deceit. As I see it, therefore, the trial court correctly concluded that the plaintiffs necessarily established that the defendant acted with the actual malice required for an award of punitive damages once they proved that the defendant acted fraudulently. I would hold that the trial court did not err in refusing to give the requested \u201cmalice\u201d instruction. Thus, in addition to reversing the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, I would instruct that court to affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">I am also troubled by footnote 13, in which the majority sets forth the statutorily imposed maximum fines for criminal offenses, commercial crimes or fraud offenses. While the majority notes that \u201c[t]here are other pertinent considerations in fixing an amount of punitive damages\u201d and, thus, the criminal monetary penalties cannot provide a cap for a punitive damages award, it specifically advocates that \u201cin determining whether an award of punitive damages is proportionate to the defendant\u2019s misconduct, a court may consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the legislative policy reflected in statutes setting criminal fines.\u201d 337 Md. at 242 n. 13, 652 A.2d at 1130 n. 13. If the majority is not suggesting that the monetary penalties constitute a cap and other pertinent considerations do impact on the fixing of punitive damages, it is difficult to understand the purpose of the footnote. Referring in punitive damages instructions to these maximum monetary penalties, but telling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the jury it is not a cap, would only confuse the jury and, very likely, would tend to usurp the jury function.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\">. That there was, in this case, \"actual knowledge\u201d, in the sense that the majority defines it, cannot be disputed. One party cannot <em>slip </em>a guarantee into loan documents, without <em>actual knowledge </em>that the other party does not know it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
