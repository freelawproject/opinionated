The principal issue presented by the claimant\u2019s petition concerns default procedures in arbitration when malpractice claims are asserted against multiple defendants. We shall hold that, where a common basis of liability had been alleged against two defendants, one of whom failed to answer, a finding in favor of the non-defaulting defendant that the common basis of liability is not proven inures to the benefit of the defaulting defendant. On the health care provider\u2019s petition the principal issue concerns possible prematurity in the filing of the claimant\u2019s notice of rejection of an adverse award. We shall hold that the claimant\u2019s notice was effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">The claimant is Lydia T. Curry (Curry). The defaulting health care provider is Hillcrest Clinic, Inc. (Hillcrest). The co-defendant health care provider who timely answered is Dr. Sheo P. Sharma (Sharma). We distill from Curry\u2019s arbitration complaint that Hillcrest operated an abortion clinic in the Baltimore Metropolitan area where Sharma directed and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>trolled the staff. In March 1988 Curry, then approximately seventeen weeks pregnant, presented at the clinic for the purpose of obtaining an abortion. In the course of an attempted abortion Sharma allegedly perforated Curry\u2019s uterus and colon. The abortion was successfully completed the next day at Johns Hopkins Hospital where the physicians \u201crepaired, the uterine defect, fashioned a Hartman\u2019s Pouch, and completed a rectosigmoid colostomy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Curry filed a complaint with the Health Claims Arbitration Office (HCAO) against Sharma and Hillcrest. Each count of her complaint alleged that \u201c[t]he clinic is liable under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>for the actions of Dr. Sharma.\u201d Sharma was served, appeared, and answered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hill-crest was served on March 5, 1990, but it did not answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Section 3-2A-02(d) of the Act provides that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided, the Maryland Rules of Procedure shall apply to all practice and procedure issues arising under this subtitle.\u201d The procedure upon default for failure to answer the complaint is not prescribed in the Act or in the rules adopted by the HCAO Director under CJ \u00a7 3-2A-03(b)(3). Consequently, Maryland Rule 2-613 governs such defaults. That rule provides for an. order of default, notice of the entry of the order of default, a motion to vacate the order of default, entry of judgment, and \u201cfinality\u201d of the default judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Following Hillcrest\u2019s failure to answer, the next step in the procedural overview of this action was the entry by HCAO, at Curry\u2019s request, of an order of default. HCAO sent notice of the order of default to Hillcrest, which Hillcrest received, but Hillcrest filed no motion to vacate the order of default. Curry then prepared, and the HCAO Director signed, a paper writing titled \u201cOrder Entering Award by Default.\u201d This document \u201cORDERED that an award of default is entered in favor of [Curry against Hillcrest] in an amount to be determined by the [arbitration] panel on the issue of [Curry\u2019s] damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">More than two weeks after the \u201caward by default\u201d Hillcrest moved to \u201cset aside entry of default judgment.\u201d The motion was denied by the chairwoman of the panel. Hillcrest\u2019s motion did not contend that Sharma\u2019s answer operated as a denial of liability for Hillcrest as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The contention that Hillcrest benefited from Sharma\u2019s defenses was first raised in a motion <em>in limine </em>filed with the arbitration panel three days before the hearing on the merits. The panel deferred ruling on the motion <em>in limine </em>until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>conclusion of the hearing. Hillcrest was permitted to participate in the hearing only with respect to possible damages. At the end of the arbitration the panel decided that Sharma was not negligent as to certain alleged conduct and that, although he was \u201cnegligent in failing to carefully and fully inform the subsequent treating physicians,\u201d that \u201cnegligence was not the proximate cause of Ms. Curry\u2019s injuries.\u201d Under the panel\u2019s findings, there was no liability on Sharma\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">With respect to Hillcrest, the panel further concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">\u201cGiven that Defendant Hillcrest\u2019s Motion in Limine to Benefit from Sharma\u2019s Defenses and to Limit Damages were orally granted at the hearing and that the panel found that Ms. Curry\u2019s injuries were not the proximate [result] of negligence caused by Defendants, FINAL JUDGMENT OF NO LIABILITY IS ENTERED FOR DEFENDANT HILLCREST;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Curry filed with HCAO a notice of rejection of the award, and she brought an action to nullify the award in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Her complaint in court consisted of three counts. Count I, claiming against both Hillcrest and Sharma, repeated the allegations contained in Curry\u2019s health claims arbitration complaint. Indeed, Curry alleged that she was entitled to a default judgment against Hillcrest in the circuit court on Count I because those allegations were verbatim the allegations of the arbitration claim. Count II of the circuit court complaint claimed only against Sharma. Count III made allegations against Hillcrest, in addition to those set forth in Count I, for the purpose of asserting a negligence claim against Hillcrest that would be independent of, and distinct from, any negligence of Sharma.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">In the circuit court Curry preliminarily petitioned to vacate the panel\u2019s award in favor of Hillcrest on the ground that the panel had exceeded its authority. See CJ \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06(c) and 3-224(b)(3). Curry contended that Sharma\u2019s having prevailed on the merits in arbitration did not relieve Hillcrest of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>default. Curry also moved for a default judgment based on Hillcrest\u2019s default in arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The circuit court vacated the award, stating that the defense established by a non-defaulting defendant inures to the benefit of a defendant in default \u201conly when the answering defense extinguishes the Plaintiff s/Claimant\u2019s entire right of action, such as a statute of limitations defense.\u201d The circuit court would not rule, however, that Hillcrest was precluded from defending the malpractice action in the circuit court. That court also rejected the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Curry\u2019s \u201cappeal\u201d from health claims arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">At trial on the merits before a jury in the circuit court the verdict was in favor of both Sharma and Hillcrest on all counts. Judgment was entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Curry appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and Hill-crest cross-appealed from the vacating of its award. Hillcrest also sought to dismiss Curry\u2019s appeal. <em>Curry v. Hillcrest Clinic, Inc., </em>99 Md.App. 477, 638 A.2d 115 (1994). That court held that Curry\u2019s \u201cappeal\u201d to the circuit court was not to be dismissed as premature because Curry had substantially complied with the Act\u2019s provisions for proceedings in a circuit court following an adverse award in health claims arbitration. <em>Id. </em>at 488-95, 638 A.2d at 120-24. The intermediate appellate court, although finding it unnecessary to decide whether Sharma\u2019s defense inured to the benefit of Hillcrest, additionally stated that the force of that doctrine, relied upon by the panel\u2019s chairwoman, was \u201cquestionable\u201d in this State. <em>Id. </em>at 496, 638 A.2d at 124. The Court of Special Appeals, by distinguishing <em>Bailey v. Woel, </em>302 Md. 38, 485 A.2d 265 (1984), rejected Curry\u2019s contention that she was entitled to a default judgment against Hillcrest in the circuit court. <em>Bailey </em>held that a claimant who put on no case in arbitration, based on a tactical decision, had failed to comply with the Act\u2019s condition precedent for instituting a medical malpractice action in the circuit court. The Court of Special Appeals noted that in Curry\u2019s matter there had been a \u201cfull hearing, and, based on the evidence adduced, the panel made a determination of no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>liability with respect to Sharma, and the Chairperson made a determination of no liability with respect to Hillcrest.\u201d 99 Md.App. at 501, 638 A.2d at 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Thereafter this Court granted cross-petitions for certiorari that raise basically the same issues presented to the Court of Special Appeals. Because that court in a reported opinion had cast doubt on the viability in this State of the common law doctrine under which certain defenses by a non-defaulting defendant can inure to the benefit of a defaulting defendant, we considered the status of the doctrine to be a matter of public importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In Part I, <em>infra, </em>of this opinion we shall address two issues that logically precede analysis of the default issues, which we address in Part II. Additional facts will be stated hereinafter, as required for an understanding of the particular arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Hillcrest contends that the circuit court erred in denying the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Curry\u2019s circuit court complaint. The argument rests on CJ \u00a7 3-2A-06(a), the relevant portion of which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">\u201cA notice of rejection must be filed with the Director and the arbitration panel and served on the other parties or their counsel within 30 days after the award is served upon the rejecting party____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">Hillcrest contends that Curry filed its notice of rejection with the Director before Curry had been served officially with the award, and that the sanction for this deviation from the ordained procedure is dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">What transpired in the matter at hand is not entirely clear from the record, and it is the subject of some dispute between the parties. The facts most favorable to Hillcrest\u2019s preliminary contention are these. The panel chairwoman signed two documents on February 15, 1991. One is entitled \u201cFinal Opinion and Order.\u201d It states that \u201cjudgement[s] of no liabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>ty\u201d are respectively entered for Sharma and Hillcrest. That document makes no assessment or apportionment of costs. The second document is a preprinted form of HCAO entitled \u201cArbitration Panel Determination\u201d (APD). The APD contains a section headed \u201cCOSTS,\u201d in which the chairwoman inserted, \u201csplit evenly between the parties (3).\u201d Both documents were among the enclosures to a letter dated February 18,1991 from the chairwoman to HCAO. The \u201cDocket Management Docket Cover\u201d of HCAO records the filing of the opinion and order on February 21, 1991, the filing of Curry\u2019s notice of rejection of award and the filing of a copy of her action to nullify on February 22, 1991, and the filing of the APD on February 25, 1991.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Hillcrest contends that there can be no award without assessing arbitration costs and making any apportionment of them. Hillcrest relies on CJ \u00a7 3-2A-05(f)(l) which states that \u201c[t]he award shall include an assessment of costs, including the arbitrators\u2019 fees.\u201d Hillcrest also relies on a regulation of the HCAO Director promulgated as Maryland Regs.Code (COMAR), tit. 1, \u00a7 03.01.12.E which reads in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">\u201cForm of Award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">\u201c(1) Within 5 days after the close of the hearing, the arbitration panel shall submit to the Director a written award that concisely states the following information:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">(a) [Relating to liability];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">(b) [Relating to damages, if applicable];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">(c) The arbitration costs and any apportionment made</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">under \u00a7 D above____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">We shall assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that a document is not \u201cthe award\u201d under CJ \u00a7 3-2A-06(a) until costs have been assessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>and any apportionment thereof made.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Absent an effective notice of rejection and action to nullify, the award in a health claims arbitration may be filed with an appropriate circuit court and confirmed by that court, in which event the award constitutes a final judgment of that court. <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 3-2A-05(i). On the other hand, an effective notice of rejection and filing of an action to nullify can result in a trial of the malpractice action in a circuit court. In this respect filing a notice of rejection and an action to nullify in compliance with \u00a7 3-2A-06(a) and (b) is somewhat analogous to noting an appeal where the appeal is a de novo trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Against the foregoing background, we agree with the analysis by the Court of Special Appeals that Curry substantially complied with the requirements of the Act for instituting an action to nullify in the circuit court. Further, Hillcrest\u2019s position rests on a very restrictive reading of \u201cwithin 30 days after the award is served\u201d in \u00a7 3-2A-06(a). The argument necessarily assumes that a notice of rejection filed before the commencement of the thirty day period is void so that, although it remains noted on the docket of HCAO, it has no efficacy that continues forward in time into the thirty day period. That was the result obtained under former Md.Rule 1012.a dealing with appeals to the Court of Special Appeals. <em>See Eastgate Assocs. v. Apper, </em>276 Md. 698, 350 A.2d 661 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>(1976); <em>Sapero &amp; Sapero v. Bell Air Plumbing &amp; Heating Contractors, Inc., </em>41 Md.App. 251, 396 A.2d 317 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">A change in that former result was effected under Title 8 of the Maryland Rules, \u201cAppellate Review in the Court of Appeals and Court of Special Appeals,\u201d adopted effective July 1, 1988. Now, under certain circumstances, a prematurely noted appeal to the Court of Special Appeals is not to be dismissed. Rule 8-602(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">\u201cA notice of appeal from a ruling, decision, or order that would be appealable upon its entry on the docket, filed after the announcement of the ruling, decision, or order by the trial court but before entry of the ruling, decision, or order on the docket, shall be treated as filed on the same day as, but after, the entry on the docket.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">We have previously noted the legislative directive in \u00a7 3-2A-02(d) under which \u201cthe Maryland Rules of Procedure shall apply to all practice and procedure issues arising under\u201d the Act, except as otherwise provided. It is consistent with that legislative directive to interpret filing \u201cwithin 30 days after the award is served\u201d in \u00a7 3-2A-06(a) to include a notice of rejection filed before service of the award on the rejecting party, if the notice of rejection is filed, as here, after the decision has been announced and if that notice of rejection remains uncountermanded on the docket at the time the award is formally served.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">For these reasons the circuit court correctly denied Hill-crest\u2019s motion to dismiss Curry\u2019s action to nullify.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Curry suggests that the complaint on which the arbitration was tried alleged negligence by Hillerest employees that was separate from that of Sharma so that the panel chairwoman exceeded her powers when she ruled that Sharma\u2019s defense inured to the benefit of Hillerest. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">First, it is doubtful that this issue has been preserved. Curry\u2019s motion for a default judgment in the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>rested exclusively on classifying Hillcrest\u2019s default as a deliberate one which fell within the rule of <em>Bailey v. Woel, </em>302 Md. 38, 485 A.2d 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Further, whether Hillcrest by its default admitted actionable negligence on the part of employees other than Sharma is a matter of interpretation of the arbitration complaint. We have seen that Curry specifically expanded her allegations in circuit court beyond those pleaded in arbitration in an effort to assert as the basis for Hillcrest\u2019s liability negligence that was independent of Sharma. The negligent acts or omissions alleged in the arbitration complaint were attributed to Sharma alone or to \u201cthe defendants,\u201d with two exceptions. One of the latter allegations is that \u201cSharma and the staff\u2019 were aware that the attempted abortion had resulted in serious bodily harm to Curry who was not told of the nature and extent of that harm. The other allegation is that \u201cSharma and the [sjtaff\u2019 were charged with follow up care. The panel chairwoman had heard Sharma\u2019s evidence when Hillcrest\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>was granted. She ruled, in effect, that Hillcrest\u2019s admissions, by its default, of the arbitration allegations had been negated by the actual proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Inasmuch as the record of the arbitration is not before us, there is no way in which we can review whether Curry\u2019s proof established negligence on the part of Hillcrest employees that was independent of Sharma. The allegations, however, attribute to the staff the same conduct that is attributed to Sharma, and the entire panel, although finding negligence by Sharma in follow up care, nevertheless held that Sharma\u2019s negligence was not a proximate cause of Curry\u2019s injuries. Accordingly, the identical conduct attributed to Hillcrest\u2019s staff was also either non-negligent or not a proximate cause of Curry\u2019s injuries, insofar as the panel was concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">From the fact that the entire panel decided that there was no liability on Sharma\u2019s part it also follows that the chairwoman did not usurp the panel\u2019s function in applying to Hillcrest the legal conclusion that flows from the panel\u2019s finding. We discuss that governing legal doctrine in Part II.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Curry\u2019s argument that she should have been permitted to proceed to a damage inquisition against Hillcrest in the circuit court has two steps. The first step requires error by the panel chairwoman in relieving Hillcrest of its default in arbitration. The second step requires characterizing that default as a failure to satisfy the Act\u2019s condition of arbitrating, precedent to bringing a circuit court malpractice action. In the latter connection Curry submits that a health care provider who deliberately fails to arbitrate should be precluded from presenting a defense for the first time in the circuit court malpractice action, just as the injured plaintiff in <em>Bailey v. Woel, supra, </em>was precluded from presenting for the first time in circuit court a case of liability against a health care provider. Because Curry\u2019s argument fails at its first step, we need not address the second step.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Underlying the first step of Curry\u2019s argument is the mistaken notion that the order of default in arbitration was a judgment of liability that could not be disturbed. Curry asserts that \u201c[gjoing into the [arbitration] hearing, Curry had an award by default against Hillcrest, not just an order of default.\u201d Brief for the Petitioner at 43. Curry further submits that \u201c[a]n award, or judgment by default is a final determination as to liability. <em>Himes v. Day, </em>254 Md. 197, 254 A.2d 181 (1969).\u201d Brief for Petitioner at 43. Under Md.Rule 2-613, however, dealing with defaults by a defendant\u2019s failure to plead, there is no judgment until damages have been assessed. <em>See </em>Rule 2-613(e). Consequently, Curry\u2019s \u201caward of default\u201d had no legal effect beyond reiterating that an order of default had been entered and that a motion to vacate the order of default had been denied. Moreover, <em>Himes v. Day </em>on which Curry relies was decided under the procedure in effect prior to the 1984 revision of Title 2 of the Maryland Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>Banegura v. Taylor, </em>312 Md. 609, 541 A.2d 969 (1988), is dispositive. The defendant in that case had been served with a civil complaint alleging rape of the plaintiff. An order of default was entered in November 1984, and the notice of default sent by the clerk, but there was no response by the defendant. On January 4,1985, at the request of the plaintiff, the court entered a \u201cjudgment\u201d of default. Thereafter on February 4, 1985 the defendant moved to strike the default \u201cjudgment,\u201d but the motion was denied. A judgment for substantial damages was entered against the defendant, who appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion that court \u201cdismissed the appeal as to the judgment by default, finding it untimely, and affirmed the judgment as to damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614-15, 541 A.2d at 972. This Court granted certiorari. Before us, the plaintiff argued \u201cthat the order of January 4, 1985, was a final judgment on the issue of liability, and that the time for appeal expired thirty days after its entry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 541 A.2d at 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Judge McAuliffe, writing for the Court, could not have made the correct procedure more plain.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">\u201cIf [plaintiff] were correct concerning the nature of the January 4 order, her analysis of the effect of the later motion to strike would be sound. <em>Unnamed Atty. v. Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n, </em>303 Md. 473, 486, 494 A.2d 940 (1985). She is wrong, however, in treating the order of January 4 as a judgment. It was not a judgment\u2014indeed it served no function at all and must be considered a nullity. [Plaintiff] in seeking that order, and the court in granting it, were adhering to a default procedure that existed under former Maryland Rule 310, but which was changed by the adoption of Rule 2-613, effective July 1, 1984. Under the former procedure, a default judgment could be entered for failure of a defendant to plead, and when entered, became a final and appealable judgment as to liability. <em>Himes v. Day, </em>254 Md. 197, 254 A.2d 181 (1969).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">\u201cUnder the current procedure, which was in effect when [defendant] defaulted, the <em>order </em>of default was correctly entered, but a <em>judgment </em>should not have been entered until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>there had been satisfactory proof of damages. Rule 2-613(e). The amendment to the rule was specifically designed to avoid piecemeal appeals, and no appeal may be taken from the entry of an order of default. <em>Adams v. Mallory, </em>308 Md. 453, 459-60, 520 A.2d 371 (1987); <em>O\u2019Connor v. Moten, </em>307 Md. 644, 647 n. 2, 516 A.2d 593 (1986). Likewise, an immediate appeal could not have been taken from the denial of [defendant\u2019s] motion to strike the default order. That order was interlocutory, because it did not dispose of the entire claim. Rule 2-602. As an interlocutory order, it was subject to revision within the general discretion of the trial court until a final judgment was entered on the claim. <em>Henley v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>305 Md. 320, 328, 503 A.2d 1333 (1986).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s] motion to strike, filed more than thirty days after the entry of the order of default, must be viewed as a request that the trial court invoke its authority to revise an order intended to be final in nature, but which was, in fact, interlocutory. A trial judge possesses very broad discretion to modify an interlocutory order where that action is in the interest of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">312 Md. at 618-19, 541 A.2d at 973-74. <em>See also Carter v. Harris, </em>312 Md. 371, 374 n. 2, 539 A.2d 1127, 1128 n. 2 (1988); P. Niemeyer &amp; L. Schuett, <em>Maryland, Rules Commentary </em>472-73 (2d ed. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Curry also bases an argument on Rule 2\u2014613(f) that is relevant to the foregoing analysis. She submits that \u201c[o]nce judgment was granted to Sharma, [the chairwoman\u2019s] revisory power as to the award against Hillcrest applied only to the amount of damages entered.\u201d Brief for the Petitioner at 22. Rule 2\u2014613(f) provides that \u201c[a] default judgment entered in compliance with this Rule is not subject to the revisory power under Rule 2-535(a) except as to the relief granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Curry correctly recognizes that the reason for the limitation on revisory power in subsection (f) \u201cis to avoid giving the defendant in default two opportunities to set it aside.\u201d <em>Niemeyer &amp; Schuett, supra, </em>at 473. Curry\u2019s submission is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>when, in this multiple defendants arbitration, judgment was entered in favor of Sharma, the \u201cjudgment\u201d as to liability on the part of Hillcrest became final and not subject to revision per subsection (f) of Rule 2-613.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">This submission by Curry rests on the same defect exposed by <em>Banegura, v. Taylor. </em>Subsection (f) does not operate unless and until \u201c[a] default judgment [has been] entered in compliance with\u201d Rule 2-613. \u201cRule 2\u2014613(f), which creates a limited exception to Rule 2-535, is also applicable only to final judgments.\u201d <em>Quartertime Video &amp; Vending Corp. v. Hanna, </em>321 Md. 59, 65, 580 A.2d 1073, 1076 (1990). No judgment was ever entered against Hillcrest because damages were never assessed against Hillcrest. The only award, or judgment, entered on the claim against Hillcrest was in favor of Hill-crest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Thus, the issue before us reduces to whether the panel chairwoman acted correctly in striking the interlocutory order of default as to Hillcrest. If so, the first step of Curry\u2019s two-step argument falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The common law doctrine applied by the chairwoman in vacating the order of default is sometimes called the <em>Frow </em>doctrine, a name derived from <em>Frow v. De La Vega</em>, 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 552, 21 L.Ed. 60 (1872), in which the doctrine was applied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Frow </em>involved a civil action alleging that eight defendants, including Frow, jointly undertook to defraud the plaintiff. Frow defaulted, a decree <em>pro confesso </em>was taken against him, and a final decree absolute thereafter entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>against him. Subsequently, at trial of the remaining defendants, the merits were decided adversely to the plaintiff. Reversing the judgment against Frow the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">\u201cIf the court in such a case as this can lawfully make a final decree against one defendant separately, on the merits, while the cause was proceeding undetermined against the others, then this absurdity might follow: there might be one decree of the court sustaining the charge of joint fraud committed by the defendants; and another decree disaffirming the said charge, and declaring it to be entirely unfounded, and dismissing the complainant\u2019s bill. And such an incongruity, it seems, did actually occur in this case. Such a state of things is unseemly and absurd, as well as unauthorized by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">\u201c... But a final decree on the merits against the defaulting defendant alone, pending the continuance of the cause, would be incongruous and illegal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">15 Wall, at 554, 21 L.Ed. at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The Frow doctrine is widely accepted. See 1 H.C. Black, The <em>Law of Judgments </em>\u00a7 209, at 310-12 (2d ed. 1902); 3 A.C. Freeman, <em>Law of Judgments </em>\u00a7 1277, at 2653-56 (5th ed. 1925); 6 J.

Turner &amp; Newall, Ltd., </em>797 F.2d 151 (3d Cir.1986) (Where plaintiff in asbestosis case was found to have assumed the risk, <em>Frow </em>was not applied because trial record did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>support the factual predicate that defaulting defendants supplied quantities of asbestos fiber similar to that of successful defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Curry cites <em>International Controls Corp. v. Vesco, </em>535 F.2d 742, 746 n. 4 (2d Cir.1976), as questioning the continued force of <em>Frow. </em>That court, nevertheless, immediately followed the language relied upon by Curry by saying that \u201c[i]n any event, at most, <em>Frow </em>controls in situations where the liability of one defendant necessarily depends upon the liability of the others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\"><em>\u201cFrow </em>stands for the proposition that if at trial facts are proved that exonerate certain defendants and that as a matter of logic preclude the liability of another defendant, the plaintiff should be collaterally estopped from obtaining a judgment against the latter defendant, even though it failed to participate in the proceeding in which the exculpatory facts were proved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\"><em>Farzetta v. Turner &amp; Newall, Ltd., </em>797 F.2d at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Whatever the full scope of the <em>Frow </em>doctrine may be, it certainly operates where the conduct of the defendant who appeared and successfully defended on the merits is the sole basis for liability of a defaulting defendant under the principle of <em>respondeat superior. </em>Motor tort cases have so held. <em>See Plott v. York, </em>33 Cal.App.2d 460, 464, 91 P.2d 924, 926 (1939) (\u201cWhere ... the real actor, who is liable personally notwithstanding his acting for his employer, is not guilty, it necessarily follows that his employer for whom he was acting cannot be held.\u201d); <em>Gangl v. Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>37 Mass.App.Ct. 561, 641 N.E.2d 709, 711 (1994) (\u201cA finding that the agent or servant is not negligent compels a similar finding, as a matter of law, for the [defaulting] principal or master.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">We do not share the concern of the Court of Special Appeals that our prior cases have left the <em>Frow </em>doctrine of questionable vitality in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number><em>Lingan v. Henderson, </em>1 Bland 236 (Md.Ct.Chanc.1827), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>1 Bland 283 (Md.1830), is the first reported case in Maryland dealing with defaulting co-defendants. In 1807 Lingan conveyed a parcel of land to Henderson for a future promise to pay. Lingan and Henderson died intestate before the money could be paid. Lingan\u2019s widow sued Henderson\u2019s survivors, <em>ie., </em>his three children, his widow, and her husband. Two of the children failed to answer, and Lingan\u2019s widow requested a decree <em>pro confesso </em>against them. The third child had answered and claimed that the statute of limitations barred Lingan\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The Court of Chancery distinguished between defenses which went to the whole of the matter and those that only covered one defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">\u201cWhence it appears, that in equity as at law, where the defence made by any one defendant extends only so far as to cover nothing more than the interest of him by whom it is made, the plaintiff may yet have relief, if he establishes his claim against the other defendants; but that where the defence made by one defendant goes to the whole cause of complaint, and the plaintiff fails to establish his case in opposition to such defense, he cannot be relieved in any way whatever, although his claim should be confessed by the other defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 261. Like the Supreme Court in the later <em>Frow </em>decision, the Court of Chancery focused on the need for consistent judgments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">\u201c[I]t is a well settled rule, in equity as well as at law, that any defence coming from any one of a plurality of defendants, which goes to the whole, and shows, that the plaintiff has no cause of suit, effectually precludes the Court from giving relief in any way whatever against any other defendant ... because a plaintiff can only obtain relief upon the strength of his own title, and by shewing, that it is good against all the world as well as against each one of the then defendants; and also, because every Court of justice must act consistently, and cannot be allowed to contradict itself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>by saying, in the same decree, in the same case, that the plaintiff has no cause of suit whatever; and also, that he has a just and well founded cause of complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">1 Bland at 275. In the end, judgment was entered for the plaintiffs as the Court of Chancery determined that the defenses offered by the defendants were not supported by the facts. <em>Id. </em>at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The defendants appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed as to all defendants, but without opinion. 1 Bland 283. This Court\u2019s rationale was later stated to have been that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avg\">\u201c[t]he bill presented no case warranting relief, but by a decree for the reconveyance of the land by the heirs of Henderson; or payment of the purchase money by the administratrix. To neither of which remedies did the complainants shew, themselves entitled upon the proof. The Court of Appeals therefore, could not have done otherwise than as they did, reverse the decree and dismiss the bill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALv\"><em>McCormick v. Gibson, </em>3 G. &amp; J. 12, 19 (1830). <em>See also Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co. v. Trimble, </em>51 Md. 99, 110 (1879) (\u201cThe case of <em>[Lingan </em>] was reversed by the Court of Appeals because the complainants were not entitled to relief upon the merits as disclosed by the proof.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\"><em>McCormick </em>presented the question of whether a valid statute of limitations defense pled by one defendant-would inure to the benefit of a defaulting defendant. The action was a creditor\u2019s bill against the heirs and devisees of a debtor whose personal estate was insufficient to pay the debts. <em>McCormick, </em>however, held that the defense of limitations \u201cis a mere statutory bar, intended only for the protection of those who seek shelter under its wings.\u201d 3 G. &amp; J. at 17. Further, the defendants\u2019 interests that the action sought to reach were \u201cseveral and distinct, and not joint; the claim against each being in proportion to the amount devised to him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18. Thus, the defendant who successfully pled limitations protected only his share from the relief claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\"><em>See also Simms v. Lloyd, </em>58 Md. 477 (1882) (because limitations must be specially pled, plea of limitations by one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>defendant does not inure to another defendant who has not so pleaded, or who has not pleaded at all).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Historically, Maryland law recognizes the <em>Frow </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Curry also makes a frontal assault on any continued recognition of <em>Frow </em>by urging the view of default judgments applied in <em>Fred Chenoweth Equip. Co. v. Oculus Corp., </em>254 Ga. 321, 328 S.E.2d 539 (1985). There an equipment supplier sued Oculus, a subcontractor, on their contract and sued the general contractor and its surety on the payment bond. Oculus defaulted, and the trial court entered a default judgment. Oculus appealed, and the intermediate appellate court overturned the judgment in light of <em>Frow, </em>ruling that the judgment should await an adjudication as to the liability of the non-defaulting defendants. The supplier appealed and argued that there were two separate causes of action in the case and that the liability of Oculus was not strictly joint. The Supreme Court of Georgia found it unnecessary to analyze this argument, basing its \u201copinion instead on the rejection of the defaulting-joint-defendant-rule.\u201d 328 S.E.2d at 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The Georgia court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">\u201cWe view the matter differently and decline to follow that rule. Considering the case before us, the default judgment against Oculus did not reach the merits of the claim on the contract. The default judgment merely determined that Oculus failed to follow the procedural requirement that a timely answer be filed. The consequence of this failure was that judgment was entered against Oculus. When the claim against Deepwater and Aetna on their bond is pursued in the trial court it will be necessary to decide the merits of the contract claim because there is no liability on the bond unless there is first liability on the contract. Should it be determined Oculus has no liability on the contract we view this as neither absurd nor inconsistent with the default judgment against Oculus. Oculus suffered judgment be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>cause of its failure to answer the complaint and was therefore denied an opportunity to litigate the merits. This is no less than and no greater than the harshness existing in a default judgment against a single defendant. The merits are not reached because of the default. It may be that other defendants will go on to prevail on the merits but we do not think this should relieve Oculus of its default.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6Y\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The Third District Court of Appeal of Florida is the only court outside of Georgia that has cited and applied <em>Chenoweth. Behar v. Jefferson Nat'l Bank at Sunny Isles, </em>519 So.2d 641 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 So.2d 167 (Fla.1988). These decisions appear to rest on the premise that a default judgment is primarily a punitive measure that sanctions the breach of the procedural regulation. Maryland law, on the other hand, does not weigh the balance so heavily against the truth seeking function of adversary litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In Maryland a default judgment is considered more akin to an admission of liability than to a punitive sanction. In <em>Hopkins v. Easton Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>171 Md. 130, 134, 187 A. 874, 876 (1936), this Court said that a default results in \u201cthe tacit admission by the defendant in default of the truth of the allegations of the bill of complaint as they are averred.\u201d In <em>Pacific Mortgage &amp; Inv. Group, Ltd. v. Horn, </em>100 Md.App. 311, 332, 641 A.2d 913, 923 (1994), the Court of Special Appeals stated that \u201c[a] judgment by default constitutes an admission by the defaulting party of its liability for the causes of action set out in the complaint.\u201d And finally, in <em>Gotham Hotels, Ltd. v. Owl Club, Inc., </em>26 Md.App. 158, 173, 337 A.2d 117, 125 (1975), the court held that \u201cfailure to plead ... constituted an admission ... of liability for the cause of action set forth in the declaration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The federal courts agree. <em>See Thomson v. Wooster, </em>114 U.S. 104, 111, 5 S.Ct. 788, 792, 29 L.Ed. 105, 107 (1885) (\u201cto take a bill <em>pro confesso </em>is to order it to stand as if its statements were confessed to be true\u201d); <em>Greyhound Exhibit-group, Inc. v.

The panel chairwoman not only had the discretion to strike the order of default and enter an award for Hillcrest, but also, under the <em>Frow </em>doctrine, a refusal to have done so would have been an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
