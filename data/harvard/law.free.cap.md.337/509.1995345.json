For the reasons set forth below, we shall hold that a new trial is required under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">David Mitchell, the petitioner, was charged with theft, eluding the police, and driving on a revoked license. On February 5, 1993, he appeared in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, where he requested a postponement, and the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I am requesting a postponement until I can finish paying my lawyer off, because I went to Social Services and I\u2019ve been to everybody and I can\u2019t get a Public Defender. I have to pay for my own attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">\u201cAnd I\u2019m a roofer. And with the type, with the way the weather\u2019s been lately, I haven\u2019t worked enough to pay rent, really.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: You were brought before a District Court commissioner on September the 19th, 1992. The commissioner advised you of your right to counsel, told you that if you didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for a lawyer, that you had the right to ask the Public Defender to provide a lawyer for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-11\">\u201cHave you gone to the Public Defender\u2019s Office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-12\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: When did you go there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-14\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I went there right after that court date and they said I have to pay for my own attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. And the commissioner also said, if you can\u2019t get a lawyer on your own or the Public Defender will not provide a lawyer for you, you must notify the Court of that matter as soon as possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">\u201cFurther told you, do not wait until the date of your trial to get a lawyer. And if you don\u2019t have a lawyer before the trial date, you may have to go to trial without one. That was back on September 19th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">\u2018You appeared on the 21st of September before Judge Jung, who again advised you of those same rights, and told you about getting a lawyer, and advised you that if you appeared without counsel, that you could be caused to go to trial without a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">\u2018You then appeared before Judge Foos on November the 12th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: November the 12th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: And asked for a postponement. And Judge Foos granted you that postponement to get an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-10\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I haven\u2019t been to court all them times..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-12\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I haven\u2019t been to court all the times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: You were arrested, taken before a commissioner. And before you were released, you were taken before a judge who reviewed your bail. That\u2019s the first two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-14\">\u201cOn November the 12th, you were before Judge Foos for trial. You asked for a postponement. He granted it so you could get a lawyer. And he again advised you of your right to counsel, the importance of counsel. He advised you that your next appearance in court without a lawyer would be a waiver of your right to a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-15\">You then appeared on February the [4th] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>... yesterday before Judge Pytash. I don\u2019t know whether you asked for a postponement again or not. Did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: And she denied that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">And you prayed a jury trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">\u201cYou\u2019re here. You\u2019re entitled to a jury trial. You\u2019ve had ample opportunity to get counsel. You\u2019ve been advised on numerous occasions to get a lawyer. You\u2019ve had a postponement to get a lawyer. You were told the next appearance without counsel would constitute a waiver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">\u201c[You sjhowed up without counsel. I have determined it is a waiver of your right to counsel by your failure to do that which was explained to you many times. Your request is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Mitchell was convicted after a non-jury trial and timely noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court in an unreported opinion determined that, under Maryland Rule 4\u2014215(d)<footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the trial court had not conducted a sufficient inquiry into Mitchell\u2019s reasons for appearing without counsel. Rather than order a new trial, however, the Court of Special Appeals ordered a limited remand under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Md.Rule 8-604<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to determine whether Mitchell\u2019s reasons for appearing without counsel were meritorious, indicating that if the trial court found the waiver valid, its judgment would stand; if, however, the circuit court found that the waiver was invalid, Mitchell would be entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Mitchell directs us to <em>Moore v. State, </em>331 Md. 179, 626 A.2d 968 (1993), a case with numerous similarities to the one at bar, for the proposition that the Rule 4-215(d) inquiry is mandatory, and the trial court\u2019s failure to conduct that inquiry requires a new trial. Petitioner also contends that only issues subsidiary to the trial may be determined on remand and relies on <em>Gill v. State, </em>265 Md. 350, 289 A.2d 575 (1972), in arguing that the error committed here was not subsidiary to the trial, but directly affected it. Further, he emphasizes the prejudice that he will suffer if he is asked to shoulder the burden of proving events which occurred over two years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The State analogizes this case to a successful Batson<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> challenge, where a criminal case is often remanded to determine whether a prosecutor had race-neutral reasons for using a peremptory strike. The State also emphasizes that only historical facts must be determined on remand, distinguishing this case from those in which the voluntariness of a waiver is at issue. Finally, the State contends that <em>Moore </em>is inapposite here, as Mitchell\u2019s reason for appearing without counsel was an issue subsidiary to the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals agreed with the State, relying on its earlier decision in <em>Moreland v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 78, 510 A.2d 261 (1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">\u201cIn the case at hand, appellant similarly volunteered that he had not completed payments to his attorney because the weather had hampered his ability to work as a roofer and he had trouble paying his rent. He also volunteered that the Public Defender\u2019s Office had told him several months before that he was financially ineligible for representation. The circuit court here, as in <em>Moore, </em>made no further inquiry. Thus, although, as in <em>Moore, </em>the \u2018record reveals the existence of information relevant to the [defendant\u2019s] reason\u2019 for appearing without counsel \u2018[without further inquiry\u2019 it cannot \u2018be determined whether those reasons were meritorious.\u2019 <em>[Moore </em>] [331 Md.] at 186 [626 A.2d 968]. It could be that appellant had funds, or the ability to obtain them, and made no good faith attempt to obtain private counsel and did not qualify for, or never sought representation from, the Public Defender. Alternatively, it could be that appellant did seek representation from the Public Defender, was denied it, diligently sought and obtained private counsel and then fell on hard times and was unable to pay his private counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">\u201cThus, as in <em>Moreland, </em>the \u2018facts relating to the waiver issue are ambiguous.\u2019 68 Md.App. at 84-85 [510 A.2d 261].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A68\">Following the decision in <em>Moreland </em>to order a limited remand rather than a new trial, the intermediate appellate court determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">\u201cthe waiver inquiry was subsidiary to the criminal trial; the court\u2019s error in failing to obtain more information was not committed during the trial itself. Accordingly, we believe that, as in <em>Moreland, </em>a limited remand is appropriate here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT9\">We disapprove of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Moreland. </em>Accordingly, we shall hold that a limited remand was not appropriate because the issue of whether Mitchell waived his right to counsel was not subsidiary to the criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Mitchell cites <em>Martinez v. State, </em>309 Md. 124, 522 A.2d 950 (1987), in support of his contention that failure to conduct a mandatory inquiry prior to trial mandates a new trial rather than a limited remand. In <em>Martinez, </em>the defendant gave an affirmative response to the trial court\u2019s question asking if any person made him a promise or threat to have him give up his right to a jury trial. Despite this response, the trial court found that Martinez had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to a jury trial. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals ordered a limited remand to determine the voluntariness of the jury trial waiver. We reversed Martinez\u2019s conviction, noting that Md.Rule <em>4-246 </em>requires the defendant\u2019s waiver to be on the record before the trial commences, and found a new trial to be the appropriate remedy for the trial court\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The State attempts to distinguish <em>Martinez </em>by noting that Rule 4-246, as opposed to Rule 4\u2014215(d), specifically requires that the waiver be on the record before the trial commences. We have, however, interpreted Rule 4\u2014215(d) as prohibiting a trial court from proceeding before making an explicit determination regarding waiver of the right to counsel whenever the defendant appears without counsel. <em>See Thompson v. State, </em>284 Md. 113, 126, 394 A.2d 1190, 1196 (1978). We also addressed the specifics of the Rule 4-215(d) inquiry in <em>Moore:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIx\">\u201c(W]hat the rule mandates is that the defendant be allowed an opportunity to explain the reason for appearance without counsel \u2018sufficient to allow the court to determine whether the reason is meritorious.\u2019 We believe, however, that the record must also be sufficient to reflect that the court actually considered those reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">* * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">While the rule does not require the conduct of an inquiry in any particular form, this does not mean that the court may ignore information relevant to whether the petitioner\u2019s inaction constitutes waiver; the court is not relieved of the obligation to make such inquiry as is required to permit it to exercise discretion required by the rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>331 Md. at 186-187, 626 A.2d at 971-72. Inquiry into the merits of a defendant\u2019s reasons for appearing without counsel must be conducted on the record <em>prior to </em>trial; therefore, <em>Martinez </em>is not distinguishable on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Without exception, we have ordered a new trial in cases involving a trial court\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 4\u2014215(d). <em>See, e.g., Williams v. State, </em>321 Md. 266, 582 A.2d 803 (1990); <em>Maus v. State, </em>311 Md. 85, 532 A.2d 1066 (1987); <em>Snead v. State, </em>286 Md. 122, 406 A.2d 98 (1979); <em>Thompson v. State, </em>284 Md. 113, 394 A.2d 1190 (1978). The Court of Special Appeals has also ordered a new trial in every case involving a Rule 4-215(d) violation except <em>Moreland, </em>the case on which it relied in reaching its decision in this case. <em>See, e.g., Evans v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 573, 581 A.2d 435 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">If the necessary inquiry under Rule 4-215(d) was subsidiary to the trial or in no way affected the trial, it could be accomplished by a hearing on remand; if the inquiry was not subsidiary, however, a new trial must be ordered. <em>See Gill v. State, </em>265 Md. 350, 357, 289 A.2d 575, 579 (1972). The key to determining the propriety of the limited remand is whether the required inquiry was so intertwined with the trial that a limited remand could cause the defendant to suffer great prejudice. The controlling factor is not, as the intermediate appellate court stated, whether the error occurred <em>during </em>the trial; it is whether the error adversely affected the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">If the case at bar were remanded for a determination of whether Mitchell\u2019s reason for appearing without counsel was meritorious, Mitchell would have to reconstruct his actions of over two years ago. He must also recall the dates and contents of conversations with representatives of the Office of the Public Defender, in addition to how much money had been paid and how much money was owed to the private attorney he had previously attempted to retain. The potential prejudice to Mitchell is obvious, and a limited remand in this case would be fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Prejudice to the defendant is also what distinguishes this case from a <em>Batson </em>challenge. Here, the burden is on the defendant to prove a meritorious reason for appearing without counsel. In a <em>Batson </em>case, the burden is on the State to prove a race-neutral reason for a peremptory challenge on remand. In those types of cases, the attorneys are much more likely to have made detailed records that are maintained in a file, making it much easier to reconstruct what occurred several years earlier in a trial. Mitchell, on the other hand, has no such advantage in reconstructing what occurred before his first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">This case is much like <em>Martinez </em>and other cases in which the knowing and voluntary nature of a jury trial waiver is at issue. In those cases, our concern has been that there could be subtle coercion that would not appear on the record. <em>See, e.g., Martinez, </em>309 Md. at 135, 522 A.2d at 955-56. There is also a \u201c[djanger that the trial judge might impermissibly consider a defendant\u2019s post-waiver conduct in judging the validity of the waiver.\u201d <em>United States v. Kimmel, </em>672 F.2d 720, 726 (9th Cir.1982) (Reinhardt, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Limited remand cannot be used to correct procedural defects at the trial level when the procedure involved is so intertwined with the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel that a limited remand would cause unfair prejudice. Failure to conduct the Rule 2-415(d) inquiry at the proper time, therefore, mandates a new trial. The exact circumstances in the instant case under which the original inquiry should have occurred cannot be recreated, and we cannot require the defendant to meet that burden. The interests of justice simply would not be served by ordering a limited remand in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH THE DIRECTION TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BAL</em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>\n<em>TIMORE COUNTY FOR A NEW TRIAL.
