The form was approved by MIA on March 12, 1993 without holding a hearing. On March 31, 1993, a number of individual pharmacists and the Maryland Pharmacists Association<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (the Pharmacists), requested a hearing, complaining, <em>inter alia, </em>about the new reimbursement formula.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>On May 11,1993, Donald Brandenberg, an Associate Insurance Commissioner, held a hearing in response to the Pharmacists\u2019 request, to determine whether the contract form should be approved. Mr. Brandenberg began, over objections from the Pharmacists, by characterizing the proceeding as \u201can informational hearing,\u201d and inviting all present, on both sides of the dispute, to speak. Counsel for the Insurance Commissioner explained why the matter was not a quasi-judicial proceeding, necessitating an adjudicatory hearing. All who wished to speak were allowed to do so, and the Associate Commissioner reviewed numerous documents submitted into the record. On July 12, 1993, the Associate Commissioner issued an order approving a modified version<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the contract form, concluding that there was no basis on which to disapprove it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The Pharmacists sought judicial review of the Associate Commissioner\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, and BCBSM successfully moved to intervene. Judicial review of the decision was conducted on the record. Following a hearing on January 3, 1994, the court issued an order affirming the Associate Commissioner\u2019s decision. The Pharmacists appealed that judgment to the Court of Special Appeals. Prior to any consideration of the case by the intermediate appellate court, we issued a writ of certiorari on our own motion to consider the four issues raised by the appellants: (1) whether appellants should have been granted an adjudicatory hearing on their complaints before the Associate Insurance Commissioner; (2) whether the Associate Insurance Commissioner improperly shifted the burden of proof onto the appellants; (3) whether the Associate Insurance Commissioner\u2019s approval of the proposed contract form was supported by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>evidence before him; and (4) whether we should consider the for-profit status of a BCBSM subsidiary. 335 Md. 341, 643 A.2d 441. We shall hold that the appellants were not entitled to- an adjudicatory hearing. In light of that holding, we need not address the second and third questions presented. We will not consider appellants\u2019 fourth issue, as we find nothing in the record to indicate that it was raised at the hearing before the Associate Commissioner; therefore, the issue was not preserved for judicial review. <em>E.g., Mayor and City Council of Ocean City v. Taber, </em>279 Md. 115, 126, 367 A.2d 1233, 1239 (1977). Therefore, we shall affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The Pharmacists contend that they were entitled to an adjudicatory or quasi-judicial hearing before the Associate Insurance Commissioner with all the rights which attach to such a hearing, such as the right to cross examine witnesses. They claim that the informational or quasi-legislative hearing which they were afforded was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">It is well settled that a party is entitled to a quasi-judicial hearing before an administrative agency only if that type of hearing is required by statute or regulation or mandated by constitutional due process concerns. <em>Sugarloaf Citizens Ass\u2019n v. Northeast Md. Waste Disposal Auth., </em>323 Md. 641, 652, 594 A.2d 1115, 1120 (1991). We therefore first turn to the statutory provisions governing administrative hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Article 48A, \u00a7 356 requires that the terms and provisions of any contract to be executed by a non-profit health service plan with those who provide health services to the plan\u2019s subscribers, be submitted to the Insurance Commissioner for approval. Section 356 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">\u201c(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014No corporation subject to the provisions of this subtitle shall amend its certificate of incorporation, its bylaws, the terms and provisions of contracts executed or to be executed with hospitals, physicians, chiropodists, chiropractors, pharmacists, dentists, psychologists, or optometrists, and the terms and provisions of contracts issued, or proposed to be issued, to subscribers of the plan, until such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>proposed amendments have been first submitted to, and approved by, the Insurance Commissioner ... Each amendment shall be on file for a waiting period of 60 working days before it becomes effective.... A filing shall be deemed approved unless disapproved by the Commissioner within the waiting period or any extension thereof. The Commissioner shall disapprove or modify the proposed change or changes if the table of rates appears by statistical analysis and reasonable assumptions to be excessive in relation to benefits, or if the form contains provisions which are unjust, unfair, inequitable, inadequate, misleading, deceptive, or encourage misrepresentations of the coverage. In determining whether to disapprove or modify the form or table of rates, the Commissioner shall give due consideration to past and prospective loss experience within and outside this State, to underwriting practice and judgment to the extent appropriate, to a reasonable margin for reserve needs, to past and prospective expenses both countrywide and those specifically applicable to this State, and to all other relevant factors within and outside this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">&gt;}: s}c sfc Jjc # sje</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">\u201c(c) <em>Failure to comply with filing </em>requirements.\u2014If at any time subsequent to the applicable review period provided for in subsection (a) of this section, the Commissioner finds that a filing does not meet the requirements of this section, the Commissioner shall, after a hearing held upon not less than 10 days\u2019 written notice to the filer, specifying the matters to be considered at the hearing, issue an order to the filer specifying in what respects the Commissioner finds that the filing fails to meet the requirements of this section, and stating when, within a reasonable period thereafter, the filing shall be no longer effective----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Sections 354 through 361H of Art. 48A comprise subtitle 20 of that Article and exclusively govern non-profit health services plans. Section 361B of subtitle 20 at the time of the hearing before the Associate Insurance Commissioner in the instant case provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>\u201cAll decisions and findings of the Commissioner made under the provisions of this subtitle are subject to review by the court in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 242B of this article.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Section 242B of Art. 48A, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">\u201c(1) <em>Hearing before </em>Commissioner.\u2014Any insurer or rating organization aggrieved by any order or decision of the Commissioner under this subtitle made without a hearing, may within thirty (30) days after notice of the order to the insurer or organization, make written request to the Commissioner for a hearing thereon____ Within twenty (20) days after the conclusion of such hearing the Commissioner shall affirm, reverse or modify his previous action, specifying his reason therefor, and shall give a copy of such order or decision to all interested parties____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">\u201cThe order shall contain specific findings of fact by the Commissioner in relation to the matter before him, such findings to be supported by a preponderance of the evidence on consideration of the record as a whole____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">\u201cNothing contained in this subtitle shall require the observance at any hearing of formal rules of pleading or evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">\u201c(2) <em>Judicial review of decisions of </em>Commissioner.\u2014All orders or decisions of the Commissioner shall be subject to review by appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u201cIf the Circuit Court for Baltimore City finds that the Commissioner\u2019s order or decision is not supported by the preponderance of the evidence on consideration of the record as a whole, or is not in accordance with law, the court shall reverse or modify the Commissioner\u2019s order or decision in whole or in part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">A form of contract to be entered into by a non-profit health plan, such as BCBSM, and a group of providers, such as pharmacists, must be submitted to the Insurance Commissioner for approval. Art. 48A, \u00a7 356(a). No hearing of any type is required prior to the Commissioner\u2019s approval of the contract. <em>See Id. </em>Indeed, an amendment \u201cshall be deemed approved unless disapproved by the Commissioner ...,\u201d after the expiration of a 60 day waiting period following the filing. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, a hearing is expressly required any time the Commissioner finds, subsequent to approval of a form of contract, that the contract does not meet the requirements of this section. Art. 48A, \u00a7 356(c). Additionally, Art. 48A, \u00a7 242B(1) provides \u201c[a]ny insurer or rating organization aggrieved by any order or decision of the Commissioner under this subtitle <em>made without a hearing, </em>may ... make written request to the Commissioner for a hearing thereon\u201d (emphasis added). Clearly, therefore, no hearing at all is required by Art. 48A, \u00a7 356(a). <em>See Johns Hopkins Hosp. v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>302 Md. 411, 413, 488 A.2d 942, 943 (1985) <em>(\u201cAlthough not required by </em>[Art. 48A \u00a7 356(a) ] <em>to hold public hearings, </em>the Commissioner did conduct public hearings ...\u201d (emphasis added)). Furthermore, if the Commissioner issues an order or makes a decision without holding a hearing, Art. 48A, \u00a7 242B(1) unambiguously limits the right to request a hearing to an aggrieved insurer or rating organization. The Pharmacists in the instant case do not fall under either category.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Moreover, the legislative intent behind the enactment of these provisions must be determined in light of the constraint placed upon the General Assembly by Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>\u201c[t]hat the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers of Government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other; and no person exercising the functions of one of said Departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">For that reason we have held that the General Assembly, in providing for judicial review of actions by administrative agencies, may not confer upon the courts the ability to review quasi-legislative decisions by substitution of the court\u2019s judgment, as to the wisdom of the administrative action, for that of the agency. <em>Department of Natural Resources v. Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. 211, 334 A.2d 514 (1975). We there concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">\u201cIn those instances where an administrative agency is acting in a manner which may be considered legislative in nature (quasi-legislative), the judiciary\u2019s scope of review of that particular action is limited to assessing whether the agency was acting within its legal boundaries ...; furthermore, when an agency is acting in a fact-finding capacity (quasi-judicial) the courts review the appealed conclusions by determining whether the contested decision was rendered in an illegal, arbitrary, capricious, oppressive or fraudulent manner. <em>Storch v. Zoning Bd. of Howard Co., </em>267 Md. 476, 487 (including footnote 2), 298 A.2d 8 (1972); <em>Crown Central v.

Instead, any court review would ordinarily be limited to determining whether the agency acted constitutionally, <em>Storch v. Zoning Bd. of Howard Co., </em>267 Md. 476, 487, 298 A.2d 8, 14 (1972); <em>Crown Central v. City of Baltimore, </em>258 Md. 82, 89-90, 265 A.2d 192, 196-197 (1970); <em>M. &amp; C.C. of Balt. v. Biermann, </em>187 Md. 514, 523, 50 A.2d 804, 808 (1947); or \u2018whether the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>was acting within its legal boundaries,\u2019 <em>Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res. v. Linchester, supra\u201d </em>(citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Under Art. 48A, \u00a7 356, in determining whether he would approve or disapprove of the price which BCBSM would pay for the drugs supplied by the Pharmacists, the focus of the Associate Insurance Commissioner was properly upon the \u201cproposal as it relates to those who are to be insured under the plan.\u201d <em>Johns Hopkins Hosp. v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>302 Md. 411, 420, 488 A.2d 942, 947 (1985). Thus, his concern was, and should have been, upon whether that price which BCBSM would pay the Pharmacists unfairly affected the subscribers to BCBSM\u2019s plan. That policy determination was quasi-legislative in nature in so far as the Pharmacists were concerned. We and the Court of Special Appeals have consistently treated hearings under \u00a7 242B regarding rates and forms as a legislative function. <em>See Johns Hopkins, </em>302 Md. at 418, 488 A.2d at 945; <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r v. Blue Shield, </em>295 Md. 496, 513, 456 A.2d 914, 924 (1983); <em>Maryland Fire Underwriters Rating Bureau v.

Co., </em>49 Md.App. 258, 270-71, 431 A.2d 727, 733-34 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Appellants argue that they are entitled to a full adjudicatory hearing under several additional theories outside of \u00a7\u00a7 356 and 242B: (1) by statute, under the Administrative Procedures Act, Md.Code (1984, 1993 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-101 to 10-305 of the State Government Article; (2) by statute, under Md.Code (1994), Art. 48A, \u00a7 35; and (3) under a due process claim. We reject all three of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\"> \u201c[T]he APA itself does not grant a right to a hearing.\u201d <em>Sugarloaf, </em>323 Md. at 652, 594 A.2d at 1120. Only a decision in a <em>contested case </em>can be challenged through judicial review under the APA. Md.Code (1984, 1993 Repl.Vol., 1994 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article. \u201c[T]he mere fact that a statute calls for a hearing is not in and of itself sufficient to make the subject of that hearing a \u2018contested case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Donacam Assocs., 57 </em>Md.App. 719, 726, 471 A.2d 1097, 1101 (1984) , <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>302 Md. 501, 489 A.2d 26 (1985) .</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">A contested case is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF8\">\u201ca proceeding before an agency to determine:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">(i) a right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege of a person that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">(ii) the grant, denial, renewal, revocation, suspension, or amendment of a license that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">Md.Code (1984, 1993 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 10-202(d)(1) of the State Government Article. The proceedings before the Commissioner in this case were to obtain information as to whether the proposed contract form was \u201cunjust, unfair, inequitable, inadequate, misleading, deceptive, or eneourage[d] misrepresentations ...\u201d Art. 48A, \u00a7 356(a). The proceedings did <em>not </em>involve a right, duty, statutory entitlement, privilege or license; therefore, the proceedings were not a contested case under the definition found in Md.Code (1984, 1993 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 10-202(d)(1) of the State Government Article. Hence, the decision was not subject to judicial review under the APA because the proceedings fail to meet the contested case requirement in Md.Code (1984, 1993 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>In a related approach, Appellants argue that they are entitled to an adjudicatory hearing under the APA by way of Md.Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 35. This provision states that \u201ca hearing held under this section shall be conducted in accordance with [the APA].\u201d Art. 48A, \u00a7 35(a)(4)(i). We need not address this particular contention on the merits. While paragraph (a)(2) of this section may require the Commissioner to hold a hearing, the language requiring a hearing under the APA was added to \u00a7 35 by Ch. 59, \u00a7 1 of the Acts of 1993, and was not effective until June 1, 1993. The proceedings before the Commissioner in this case, which occurred prior to the effective date of that amendment,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> are, therefore, not governed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Finally, Appellants argue that denial of an adjudicatory hearing in this case denied them their right to due process. We have recognized that \u201ca \u2018judicial\u2019 or \u2018trial-type\u2019 hearing is not a requirement of procedural due process where an administrative agency does not act in a quasi-judicial capacity and the facts to be determined are \u2018legislative\u2019 rather than adjudicative in nature.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop, Inc., </em>280 Md. 686, 711, 376 A.2d 483, 497 (1977); <em>see Sugarloaf, </em>323 Md. at 670, 594 A.2d at 1129. \u201c[I]t is the nature of the dispute, rather than the stage of the proceedings, that determines whether or not a matter is a contested case.\u201d <em>Modular Closet Sys., Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>315 Md. 438, 444, 554 A.2d 1221, 1224 (1989); <em>see also Woodward &amp; Lothrop, </em>280 Md. at 712, 376 A.2d at 497 (\u201cit is the nature of the decision\u2019s fact-finding process, not the ultimate effect of the decision, that determines the party\u2019s right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>to an adjudicatory hearing\u201d). As discussed above, Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have consistently treated the Commissioner\u2019s authority to approve rates and forms as a quasi-legislative function. Under <em>Woodward &amp; </em>Lothrop,. therefore, the failure of the commissioner to grant Appellants\u2019 request for an adjudicatory hearing in this case, was not a violation of Appellants\u2019 right to due process. The Associate Commissioner did not err in refusing to hold an adjudicatory or quasi-judicial hearing on the Pharmacists\u2019 complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.
