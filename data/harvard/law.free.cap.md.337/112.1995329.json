Our answer is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">The petitioner, Eugene Franklin Goldsmith, was charged with committing sexual child abuse, second degree rape, second and third degree sexual offense, and unnatural and perverted sexual practices on his adopted stepdaughter, whom we shall call Laura.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The criminal information charged that the crimes had been committed on various occasions \u201con or between January 1, 1978 and December 81, 1981.\u201d Laura, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>was 25 years old at the time of trial, testified that the crimes had occurred when she was between the ages of and 13 or 14. The criminal charges were not instituted until more than 10 years after the alleged commission of the last criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Aware that the complaining witness was in therapy with a psychologist, the petitioner sought access to her psychotherapy records. Psychotherapy records are privileged under Maryland Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 9-109, which codifies the privilege for communications between a patient and psychiatrist or psychologist. That privilege, which we will refer to as the \u201cpsychotherapist-patient privilege\u201d or simply \u201cthe privilege\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">\u201c(b) <em>Privilege </em>generally.\u2014Unless otherwise provided, in all judicial, legislative, or administrative proceedings, a patient or his authorized representative has a privilege to refuse to disclose, and to prevent a witness from disclosing, communications relating to diagnosis or treatment of the patient\u2019s mental or emotional disorder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00a7 9-109. There are six exclusions to the' statutory privilege, none of which would be applicable to the instant case. <em>See </em>\u00a7 9\u2014109(d)(1)\u2014(6). Therefore, Laura has a psychotherapist-patient privilege which she is unwilling to waive and which is entitled to protection unless and until it must yield to Goldsmith\u2019s constitutionally protected rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Goldsmith first filed a \u201cMOTION FOR THE ISSUANCE OF A SUBPOENA FOR PRODUCTION OF TANGIBLE EVIDENCE PRIOR TO TRIAL\u201d pursuant to Md.Rule 4-264. In that motion, he alleged (1) that the complainant has been in treatment with Dr. Gombatz, a psychologist, for over four years, and (2) that a police detective related that it took years of counseling for the complainant to summon the courage to bring these charges against her stepfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The reasons given for the request were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">\u201cThe issue involved in the Defendant\u2019s demand for the complainant\u2019s psychological treatment records is one of credibility. It is important to keep in mind that, unlike the scenario in <em>Zaal [v. State, </em>326 Md. 54, 602 A.2d 1247 (1992),] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>where the victim was a 12 year old child, the complainant in this case is a 25 year old adult who has been in counseling for over four years. The conduct alleged in the criminal information occurred between 1978 and 1981. The Defendant would proffer that the complainant moved from his residence in the summer of 1983. According to the testimony of Detective Madison at the preliminary hearing, the alleged abuse ceased two years prior when the complainant was 15 years old. The Defendant has not seen or had contact with the complainant since 1983. In this situation, the Defendant submits that the Court must give him some latitude in obtaining information that may enable him to confront his accuser in some meaningful way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The defendant requested that a \u201c[s]ubpoena be issued pursuant to Md.Rule 4-264\u201d to Michael Gombatz, Ph.D., commanding Dr. Gombatz to produce \u201c[a]ll documents including but not limited to reports, summaries, psychological testing, interview notes, diagnosis, and correspondence, that reflect and relate in any way to your treatment and counseling of [the complainant].\u201d The subpoena requested the documents and records be produced at the law offices of the defense counsel in Towson, Maryland. The State filed a response alleging the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">\u201c1. A doctor patient privilege exists which can only be waived by the patient. [The complainant] has not waived this privilege, [citing <em>Beckette v. State, </em>31 Md. App. 85, 355 A.2d 515 (1976)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">2. These records are not subject to the Maryland Rules of Discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">3. To allow a victim\u2019s psychiatric records to be given to the defense violates her privacy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">4. Her psychiatric records are not relevant to the criminal charges against the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">A hearing was held on the defendant\u2019s motion, and there was no proffer of any likelihood that relevant information would be obtained by reviewing the records. The proffer made by the defense counsel was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\u201cYour Honor, I think that what\u2019s required under <em>Zaal, </em>and my understanding of it, is a nominal showing of relevance. And I think here where the issue is going to be the credibility of the Plaintiff, I would say to you that in the affidavit that Detective Madison attached to her arrest warrant of my client, she indicated that the complainant had been in counseling. And we later, at the preliminary hearing, found that it was with Dr. Gombatz for a period of over four years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">Where the facts are that you have an adult bringing charges that go back over ten years where, obviously, there\u2019s a question about the complainant\u2019s emotional state, and I think that\u2019s tied into the credibility. I mean, I simply don\u2019t know what her emotional state is. I think this in a way goes back to the fact that there have been no\u2014you know, the complainant\u2019s mother hasn\u2019t been interviewed. We don\u2019t know\u2014other than Detective Madison said today, something about the mother being emotionally unstable. I mean, that\u2019s news to me. But I mean, I think it\u2019s a fact that needs to be looked into.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">But in terms of confrontation rights, it seems to me that the Defendant, in all the facts of this case, being charged with conduct that happened over a decade ago, where you know that the Defendant has been in counsel\u2014not the Defendant, the complainant has been in counseling for over four years. I think that the\u2014I think where credibility is the make or break issue, I think that some relief under <em>Zaal </em>whether that means that the court review these records in camera or preferable to the Defendant, would be that I, under some sort of monitored format, be allowed to look at these records.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The substance of the defense counsel\u2019s proffer was that the incidents at issue occurred over 10 years prior to trial, that the victim was in counseling, and the defense counsel complained \u201cI simply don\u2019t know what her emotional state is.\u201d The defendant\u2019s motion for issuance of a discovery subpoena to produce records at defense counsel\u2019s law office was denied by written order dated September 1, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>It is quite clear that the motions judge precluded the <em>pretrial </em>discovery review of Dr. Gombatz\u2019s records. The defense was not precluded from calling Dr. Gombatz when the case actually went to trial. The defendant requested and was issued a subpoena pursuant to Md.Rule 4-265 for Dr. Gombatz to appear and produce his records at trial. The motions judge did not need to determine whether the defendant might be able to elicit exculpatory evidence from the psychotherapist at trial. Thus, the court did not hold that Laura\u2019s privilege outweighed the defendant\u2019s constitutional <em>trial </em>rights. As defense counsel made clear on the first day of trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] The state has filed two motions to quash my subpoena, my trial subpoena <em>duces tecum. </em>One was to a psychologist named Dr. Gombatz. I think that we\u2019ve resolved ... through discussions with the state I think we have resolved Dr. Gombatz\u2019s situation ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] ... which is that he\u2019s under subpoena. We\u2019ve put him on call. If it becomes appropriate during the course of the trial that I could call him. He\u2019s under subpoena.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Although Dr. Gombatz was placed on call at trial by agreement of the parties, he was never called to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">At trial, Laura testified that the petitioner sexually abused her for approximately 5!/\u00bf years, up until she was about 14 years old. She said that the sexual activity, which included fondling, fellatio, cunnilingus, and on one occasion, attempted sexual intercourse, occurred on a regular basis, \u201cmore than twice a week.\u201d Laura testified that her mother moved out of the family home when she was 15. She did not tell her mother that Goldsmith had sexually abused her because she felt that her mother would neither have cared nor done anything about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">When she was 17 and graduated high school, Laura moved from Goldsmith\u2019s home. She testified that at that time she reported the sexual abuse to the Department of Social Ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>vices. That agency\u2019s report, which was introduced in evidence, reveals the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">\u201c[Laura] informed Mrs. Purdon that, her father had \u2018thrown her out\u2019 after she graduated from high school. She mentioned that her father had sexually abused her when she was 9 years old to 12 years old---- She had an appointment to discuss this with Protective Services, but did not appear. Numerous attempts were made to contact her, however, she did not return any messages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">This case was not investigated further as the allegations were vague and the \u2018victim\u2019 apparently did not wish to discuss the matter with Protective Services or the police. There is insufficient information to pursue this case and no finding is possible. The 181 is completed for statistical purposes only.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Laura testified that before going to the Department of Social Services, she also told her boyfriend about being sexually abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">A diary kept by Laura in 1979, 1980 and 1981, was introduced into evidence by the defendant. The entries contain no hint of any sexual activity or impropriety between the defendant and the complaining witness. An entry in 1981 does discuss sexual activity between the complaining witness and a boyfriend, and states that \u201cI\u2019m glad he was my first.\u201d Responding to questions about this entry, Laura explained that she did not write about sexual activity with Goldsmith because she shared the books with her friends, allowing them to look at the diary and occasionally even write in it with her. Additionally, she explained that she \u201cwanted to block all of those things from my memory and that\u2019s why I talked about it like it was my first time. It was my first time with a boyfriend ... a real boyfriend, somebody who was legitimate to have a sexual relationship with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">Goldsmith denied sexually abusing his stepdaughter. He testified that he first heard about the allegations approximately five years before trial, when a custody battle with his former wife over his son seemed imminent. He explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>his former wife told him that Laura had come forward and said she had been molested by him, his brother, his father, and his uncle. Based on that conversation, and at the suggestion of a lawyer friend, he looked through his stepdaughter\u2019s old papers, found her diary, and photocopied the diary.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Although the jury acquitted him of second degree rape, Goldsmith was found guilty of sexual child abuse, second and third degree sexual offense, and unnatural and perverted sexual practices. He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment, 6 of which were suspended and, upon his release, placed on 5 years probation, conditioned upon payment of restitution, performing community service and undergoing psychiatric counseling. Goldsmith appealed to the Court of Special Appeals which, in an unreported opinion, vacated the restitution order, but affirmed the remainder of the judgment. We granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In the instant case, we are called upon to strike a balance between the competing interests of a witness\u2019s privilege and a defendant\u2019s federal and state constitutional rights to obtain and present evidence necessary to the defense. In weighing these compelling interests, we must keep in mind that an accused has limited pre-trial discovery rights, which may not outweigh a witness\u2019s privilege, whereas the accused\u2019s right to obtain and present exculpatory evidence at trial is entitled to far greater constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">At common law, a criminal defendant had no right to pre-trial discovery. See <em>State v. Haas, </em>188 Md. 63, 69, 51 A.2d 647, 650 (1947), <em>overruled on other grounds, In re Petition for Writ of Prohibition, </em>312 Md. 280, 305, 539 A.2d 664, 676 (1988); <em>see also </em>Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Jerold H. Israel, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 20.1, at 836 (2d ed. 1992) (\u201cAmerican courts, relying on the English precedent, adopted a common law rule holding that the judiciary lacked any inherent authority to order pre-trial discovery in criminal eases.\u201d). Over time, we have expanded the common law and given the trial courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>some authority to either require or permit discovery. <em>See Kardy v. Shook, J., </em>237 Md. 524, 537, 207 A.2d 83, 90 (1965). Nevertheless, the right to pre-trial discovery is strictly limited to that which is permitted by statute or court rule or mandated by constitutional guarantees. <em>See </em>2 Charles E. Torcia, <em>Wharton's Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 334, at 547 (13th ed. 1990) (noting that \u201c[ajbsent a statute providing otherwise, the defendant is not entitled, as a matter of right, to the discovery or inspection of evidence in the possession of the prosecution\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>LaFave &amp; Israel, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 20.2, at 843. We therefore must look to our statutes, court rules, and constitutional requirements to determine the propriety of the present defendant\u2019s right to pre-trial discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">PRE-TRIAL DISCOVERY UNDER MARYLAND RULE 4-264</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Pre-trial production of \u201cdocuments\u201d or \u201cother tangible things\u201d under Md.Rule 4-264 is discretionary, requiring a motion and a court order. As such, it does not guarantee^ criminal defendant the absolute right to subpoena and examine the private records of every private individual or entity that may conceivably possess exculpatory records. The rule does not mandate that a defendant have unfettered access to all prior statements of a witness in the form of notes taken by third parties. A judge is given discretion whether to order a subpoena under the rule. Furthermore, Md.Rule 4-264 specifically excludes the discovery of privileged information that is at issue in the present case. The rule states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">\u201cOn motion of a party, the circuit court may order the issuance of a subpoena commanding a person to produce for inspection and copying at a specified time and place before trial designated documents, recordings, photographs, or other tangible things, <em>not privileged, </em>which may constitute or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>contain evidence relevant to the action. Any response to the motion shall be filed within five days.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Thus, nothing in Md.Rule 4-264 permits the discovery of Laura\u2019s privileged psychotherapist records.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Our recent decision in <em>Zaal v. State, </em>326 Md. 54, 602 A.2d 1247 (1992) also does not provide Goldsmith with a right to pre-trial discovery in the instant case. In <em>Zaal, </em>we were asked to determine a defendant\u2019s pre-trial right to subpoena the school records of his accuser. In reversing a denial of this subpoena, we noted that the alleged victim\u2019s school records were confidential but not privileged. <em>Zaal, </em>326 Md. at 76, 602 A.2d at 1258. We found that \u201cthe Maryland regulations do not provide, nor even indicate, that a student\u2019s education records are not discoverable pursuant to the Maryland Rules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In contrast, in the present case, psychotherapist records are privileged under \u00a7 9-109 and Md.Rule 4-264 specifically precludes such privileged records from pre-trial discovery. Our decision in <em>Zaal </em>did not pertain to or authorize pre-trial discovery of privileged records. Thus, we hold that Md.Rule 4-264 means what it says and precludes pre-trial discovery of a victim\u2019s privileged psychotherapist-patient records. We now consider whether Goldsmith has any constitutional right to the pre-trial discovery he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRE-TRIAL DISCOVERY</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The Supreme Court has not recognized a constitutional right to pre-trial discovery. In <em>Weatherford v. Bursey, </em>429 U.S. 545, 97 S.Ct. 837, 51 L.Ed.2d 30 (1977), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">\u201cThere is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case, and <em>Brady [v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) ] did not create one; as the Court wrote recently, \u2018the Due Process Clause has little to say regarding the amount of discovery which the parties must be afforded____\u2019 <em>Wardius v. Oregon, </em>412 U.S. 470, 474, 93 S.Ct. 2208, 2212, 37 L.Ed.2d 82 (1973).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number><em>Weatherford, </em>429 U.S. at 559, 97 S.Ct. at 845-46, 51 L.Ed.2d at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">In <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987), the Supreme Court dealt with the issue of a criminal defendant\u2019s pre-trial access to confidential state agency records. The defendant was charged with criminal sexual assault on his daughter. He sought access to the records of the Pennsylvania Children and Youth Services (CYS), which was the state agency charged with investigating child abuse. A statute made the records confidential, but provided CYS may disclose reports pursuant to a court order. The trial court did a partial <em>in camera </em>review of the records and refused to order disclosure. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed and concluded that defense counsel was entitled to review the entire file for useful evidence. The Supreme Court reversed in part and affirmed in part the judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. at 61, 107 S.Ct. at 1003, 94 L.Ed.2d at 60. A majority of the United States Supreme Court held that the defendant did not have a right to full access to the records and <em>in camera </em>examination by the trial judge could satisfy any federal constitutional rights the defendant may have to obtain exculpatory information from the agency\u2019s records. <em>Id. A </em>significant difference between <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie </em>and the instant case is that the records in <em>Ritchie </em>were those of a government agency. The holding in <em>Ritchie </em>was based at least in part on due process and the prosecution\u2019s obligation to turn over evidence in its possession which is favorable to the accused and material to guilt. <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. at 57-58, 107 S.Ct. at 1001-02, 94 L.Ed.2d at 57-58. The Court also stated: \u201cWe express no opinion on whether the result in this case would have been different if the statute had protected the CYS files from disclosure to <em>anyone, </em>including law-enforcement and judicial personnel.\u201d 480 U.S. at 57 n. 14, 107 S.Ct. at 1001 n. 14, 94 L.Ed.2d at 57 n. 14. Another difference in <em>Ritchie </em>was that the Pennsylvania statute making the CYS records confidential created only a qualified privilege similar to the qualified privilege created for the school records in <em>Zaal. </em>Addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>tionally, the statutes in <em>Ritchie </em>and <em>Zaal </em>permitted disclosure pursuant to a court order. The Supreme Court noted: \u201cThis is not a case where a state statute grants CYS the absolute authority to shield its files from all eyes---- Given that the Pennsylvania Legislature contemplated <em>some </em>use of CYS records in judicial proceedings, we cannot conclude that the statute prevents all disclosure in criminal prosecutions.\u201d 480 U.S. at 57-58, 107 S.Ct. at 1001, 94 L.Ed.2d at 57-58 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In <em>Zaal, </em>this Court discussed the Supreme Court holding in <em>Ritchie. </em>We recognized that the Supreme Court \u201crejected defendant\u2019s confrontation clause argument, reasoning that it is a trial right, not one applicable to discovery.\u201d <em>Zaal, </em>326 Md. at 67 n. 6, 602 A.2d at 1253 n. 6 (citing <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. at 52, 107 S.Ct. at 999, 94 L.Ed.2d at 54). We adopted the Supreme Court\u2019s due process analysis and recognized that in <em>Zaal, </em>as well as in <em>Ritchie, </em>there may be a denial of due process when the <em>government\u2019s </em>records containing potentially exculpatory information were withheld from an accused. We stated in <em>Zaal </em>that the \u201cissue in the case <em>sub judice, </em>as was also the case in <em>Ritchie, </em>is a file required to be kept by a State agency....\u201d 326 Md. at 80, 602 A.2d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In <em>Avery v. State, </em>15 Md.App. 520, 292 A.2d 728 (1972), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>410 U.S. 977, 93 S.Ct. 1499, 36 L.Ed.2d 173 (1973), the Court of Special Appeals upheld a trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to compel production of psychiatric records of a victim where the victim claimed the records were privileged. The court held the psychiatrist was not a State agent and stated: \u201cWhere, as here, the witness claimed the privilege, no suppression of evidence by the State is involved within the contemplation of such cases as <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, 83 S.Ct. 1194 [ (1963) ] or <em>Giles v. Maryland, </em>386 U.S. 66[, 87 S.Ct. 793, 17 L.Ed.2d 737 (1967) ].\u201d <em>Avery, </em>15 Md.App. at 537, 292 A.2d at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">As in <em>Avery, </em>the psychotherapist-patient privileged records at issue in the instant case were not kept by a state agency or required to be kept by a state agency. Therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>no disclosure is required under <em>Brady.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, not only does Md.Rule 4-264 prohibit discovery of the privileged records requested by Goldsmith, but nothing in <em>Ritchie, Zaal, </em>or <em>Avery </em>would constitutionally require the pre-trial discovery sought by Goldsmith of a private psychotherapist\u2019s records which are \u201cshielded from all eyes,\u201d state or defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Finally, numerous decisions of this Court have held that in a criminal case neither the State nor the defendant have unlimited pre-trial discovery rights. Those decisions have also made it clear that a criminal defendant has no right to pretrial discovery by deposition or other forms of pre-trial discovery for information possessed by third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In <em>Evans v. State, </em>304 Md. 487, 499 A.2d 1261 (1985), a death penalty case, Judge Eldridge, writing for the Court, pointed out that it is \u201cclear that the defendant had no right to insist upon a pretrial deposition or pretrial interrogation of [the witness] and that the trial judge did not err in quashing the subpoena that would have required [the witness] to attend the pretrial hearing.\u201d 304 Md. at 509, 499 A.2d at 1272. Similarly, in <em>Kardy, supra, </em>this Court held that a criminal defendant has neither a state nor federal constitutional right to take the deposition of a potential witness. We also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9V\">\u201cThe defendant and his counsel are at perfect liberty, as they always have been in this State, to interview and interrogate any prospective witness, subject, of course, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the witness\u2019 acquiescence in such interrogations. And the defendant and his counsel may take an affidavit from any prospective witness, <em>if the witness he willing. </em>But these matters are entirely different from forcing and requiring a witness to make a pre-trial deposition.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS5\">237 Md. at 541, 207 A.2d at 92-93.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Neither due process, compulsory process nor the right to confront adverse witnesses establishes a pre-trial right of a defendant to discovery review of a potential witness\u2019s privileged psychotherapy records. Thus, we find no common law, court rule, statutory or constitutional requirement that a defendant be permitted pre-trial discovery of privileged records held by a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">PRIMA FACIE SHOWING REQUIRED FOR PRE-TRIAL DISCOVERY OF NON-PRIVILEGED RECORDS</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Even if the records in the instant case were not privileged, but were merely confidential, we would nonetheless hold that the motions judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to issue the pre-trial subpoena and declining an <em>in camera </em>review of those records.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">In a very recent case, <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 626 A.2d 946 (1993), Judge Bell, writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">\u201cTo be sure, a party to ongoing litigation may subpoena, without advance notification having to be given to the other party, a third party\u2019s records for use at the trial. When, however, the records sought are \u2018confidential,\u2019 before disclosure will be ordered, the moving party must show, usually at a hearing, some connection between the records sought, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the issue before the court, and the <em>likelihood </em>that information relevant to the trial would be discovered. <em>Zaal v. State, </em>326 Md. 54, 83, 602 A.2d 1247, 1261 (1992).\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\"><em>Harris, </em>331 Md. at 161, 626 A.2d at 958. In <em>Zaal, </em>we also recognized that \u201c[t]o overcome a privacy interest in ... records, some relationship must be shown between the charges, the information sought, and the likelihood that relevant information will be obtained as a result of reviewing the records.\u201d 326 Md. at 81-82, 602 A.2d at 1261. Thus, to obtain pre-trial discovery of confidential records, <em>Zaal </em>and <em>Harris </em>require the defendant to show a likelihood of obtaining relevant information.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\"><em>Zaal </em>and <em>Harris </em>both establish that with confidential records, it is the defendant who bears the burden of establishing the need for pre-trial disclosure. <em>See Zaal, </em>326 Md. at 83, 602 A.2d at 1261; <em>Harris, </em>331 Md. at 161, 626 A.2d at 958. In the instant case, Goldsmith did not establish a need for the records. Goldsmith asserted only that Laura\u2019s credibility would be an issue at trial. He did not establish that discovery of the records would likely lead to relevant information. Rather, he sought \u201csome latitude in obtaining information that may enable him to confront his accuser in some meaningful way.\u201d There was <em>no </em>showing of any likelihood of obtaining information relevant to the defense in the records.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, there clearly was no repressed memory syndrome in the instant case. The records of the Department of Social Services establish that the victim had reported the sexual abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>to that Department years before she went into counseling. Even before she went to the Department of Social Services, she confided to her boyfriend about her stepfather\u2019s sexual abuse. The only thing her therapy did was give her the courage to renew the charges she made years before to the Department of Social Services. Goldsmith did not meet his burden to establish \u201cthe likelihood that relevant information will be obtained as a result of reviewing the records.\u201d <em>Zaal, </em>326 Md. at 82, 602 A.2d at 1261. Thus, even had the requested records not been privileged, the motions judge did not abuse his discretion in determining not to issue the requested pre-trial discovery subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">DISCLOSURE OF PRIVILEGED RECORDS AT TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Although we found no constitutional right to pre-trial discovery of the records at issue in the present case, we wish to distinguish between a defendant\u2019s right of access to information during pre-trial discovery as opposed to the defendant\u2019s constitutionally based right <em>at trial </em>to fairly present a defense. In holding that a defendant has no right to pre-trial discovery of privileged records held by a third party, we recognize that the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights at trial may outweigh the victim\u2019s right to assert a privilege. We note that the Supreme Court has found that there are circumstances where, at trial, the right to claim a privilege must yield to a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to confrontation and compulsory process. <em>See Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 319, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1112, 39 L.Ed.2d 347, 355 (1974) (holding that \u201cthe right of confrontation is paramount to the State\u2019s policy of protecting a juvenile offender\u201d); <em>see also Com. v. Two Juveniles, </em>397 Mass. 261, 491 N.E.2d 234, 238 (1986) (considering the need for disclosure of communications to sexual assault counselor and noting that \u201cin certain circumstances the absolute privilege ..., must yield at trial to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>constitutional right of a criminal defendant to have access to privileged communications\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In the instant case, Goldsmith was denied a <em>pre-trial </em>discovery subpoena for records under Md.Rule 4-264, the issuance of which would have abrogated the psychotherapist-patient privilege in order to secure pre-trial <em>discovery </em>leads. Goldsmith was issued, not denied, a <em>trial </em>subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>pursuant to Md.Rule 4-265 for Dr. Gombatz and his records. We note that Md.Rule 4-265, like Md.Rule 4-264, precludes the use of a subpoena to obtain privileged records. However, as distinguished from o\u00far analysis of the defendant\u2019s right to pre-trial discovery information, the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to a fair trial may outweigh the right of the victim to assert a privilege at the trial stage. Therefore, although we hold that the psychotherapist-patient privilege protects a doctor from having to furnish information for pre-trial discovery review, the privilege may not always protect a doctor from furnishing exculpatory evidence at. trial pursuant to a trial subpoena or subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>under Md.Rule 4-265.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">There are reasons for not permitting <em>pre-trial </em>discovery of privileged information, but permitting, on proper showing, trial production of privileged exculpatory evidence. As one court recognized with regard to pre-trial discovery of privileged information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>\u201c[W]e note the prematurity of this issue. At this time, we do not know whether the victim will testify, nor to what she would testify at the time of trial. Any decision on the merits of the issue at this time would, of necessity, be speculative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><em>People v. Dist. Court, City &amp; Cty. of Denver, </em>719 P.2d 722, 726 n. 2 (Colo.1986). After the victim testifies on direct examination, the trial judge will be in a better position to evaluate what is exculpatory evidence and what is irrelevant. The balancing of the defendant\u2019s need for exculpatory information against the need to protect the victim\u2019s psychotherapist-patient privilege will be a much more informed decision at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In addition, a subpoena for tangible evidence before trial under Md.Rule 4-264 is <em>only </em>for documents or other tangible evidence; it is not a subpoena for witnesses and it does not permit examination of witnesses. Thus, if we were to permit pre-trial <em>in camera </em>review in the instant case, assuming the victim had hourly psychotherapy once a week for four years and that Dr. Gombatz kept detailed notes of those sessions, the trial judge would have to review <em>in camera </em>the notes of approximately 200 hours of therapy sessions. In contrast, a trial subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>under Md.Rule 4-265 covers the witness as well as documents or tangible evidence. Therefore, when conducting an <em>in camera </em>review under Md.Rule 4-265, the trial judge may be able to enlist the psychotherapist\u2019s assistance in locating relevant portions of the notes, as well as interpreting the notes. Thus, an <em>in camera </em>examination of the witness and the records summonsed at trial under Md. Rule 4-265 is far more efficient than an <em>in camera </em>review of the records alone subpoenaed pre-trial under Md.Rule 4-264. Furthermore, a trial subpoena is used to secure specific relevant information in a case that is actually going to trial. In considering whether to quash a trial subpoena or to conduct an <em>in camera </em>examination pursuant to a trial subpoena, the trial judge will know that the case is going to trial and that the privileged material will actually be needed for a trial defense. In addition, the trial judge will be in a better position to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>determine what the contested issues are and evaluate the relevancy of the information the defense is seeking.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">It is conceivable that a trial subpoena under Md.Rule 4-265 for a witness and documents, which may be privileged, could be reviewed pre-trial on a motion to quash or a motion for a protective order. Even if we assume the motions judge was ruling on a motion to quash a trial subpoena for exculpatory evidence, there was no error in denying disclosure with or without <em>in camera </em>review because Goldsmith did not satisfy the strong burden of proof needed to establish the necessity for the privileged information sought. In <em>Zaal, </em>we required a showing of the \u201clikelihood that relevant information will be obtained as a result of reviewing the records\u201d in order to obtain pre-trial disclosure of merely confidential records. 326 Md. at 82, 602 A.2d at 1261. Because of the privileged nature of the records involved in the present case, the burden of proof required of the defendant to establish a need for disclosure may be higher than that required in <em>Zaal. </em>In <em>Two Juveniles, supra, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts assessed the required showing for a defendant to override a statutory absolute privilege for juvenile records. The court recognized that \u201c[i]n general, an assertion that inspection of information is needed only for a possible attack on credibility has been rejected because, if upheld, such a broad right of discovery would substantially destroy the privilege.\u201d <em>Two Juveniles, </em>491 N.E.2d at 239. In <em>Com. v. Clancy, </em>402 Mass. 664, 524 N.E.2d 395 (1988), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts further clarified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">\u201cthe individual seeking to override the privilege of another bears the burden of establishing a legitimate need for the privileged information sought. <em>[Two Juveniles, </em>397 Mass. 261,] 269, 491 N.E.2d 234. <em>Cf. United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 867, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 3446, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 [ (1982) ] (defendant must make some plausible showing of how the testimony of witnesses claimed to be necessary under the compulsory process guarantee of the Sixth Amendment would have been both material and favorable to defense). We also warned that this burden would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>met simply by a showing that the information was likely to be relevant, material, or unavailable from other sources. <em>[Two </em>Juveniles,] 397 Mass, at 269, 491 N.E.2d 234. <em>See State v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 109-110, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2400, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976) (mere possibility that undisclosed information might aid defense does not establish materiality).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah6\">524 N.E.2d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">As we previously indicated, there was an insufficient showing by Goldsmith of the likelihood that the records contained exculpatory information. The mere assertion that the records in question <em>may </em>contain evidence useful for impeachment is insufficient to override an absolute statutory privilege, even at the trial stage. We agree with the Supreme Court of Michigan that in assessing a defendant\u2019s right to privileged records, the required showing must be more than the fact that the records \u201cmay contain evidence useful for impeachment on cross-examination. This need might exist in every case involving an accusation of criminal sexual conduct.\u201d <em>People v. Stanaway, </em>446 Mich. 643, 521 N.W.2d 557, 576 (1994) (footnotes omitted). We cannot permit a privilege to be abrogated even at the trial stage by the mere assertion that privileged records <em>may </em>contain information relevant to credibility. To do so would virtually destroy the psychotherapist-patient privilege of crime victims. It has long been recognized that privileges, by their very nature, restrict access to information which would otherwise be disclosed. <em>See </em>1 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 72, at 269 (John W. Strong ed., 4th ed. 1992). The rationale for this restriction has been our recognition of the social importance of protecting the privacy encompassed by specified relationships. Such privacy interests cannot be negated by the mere assertion of the possibility of impeachment evidence. A defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to a fair trial simply do not stretch that far.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">We therefore hold that in order to abrogate a privilege such as to require disclosure at trial of privileged records, a defendant must establish a reasonable likelihood that the privileged records contain exculpatory information necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>for a proper defense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the present case, the defendant did not establish the likelihood that the records sought would provide exculpatory information.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At most, Goldsmith made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>only a speculative assertion that the records might be relevant for impeachment. He had no right to pre-trial discovery review of the privileged records and he failed to establish the requisite need to warrant a judge ordering disclosure of the privileged information at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

We further note that pre-trial discovery of Laura\u2019s records is not provided for under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500 (1982), which requires that after a witness testifies, prior statements in the state's possession must be disclosed to the defense. The Jencks Act constitutes a trial right rather than a discovery right. It requires that a witness testify before his or her statements are disclosed. <em>See Collins v. State, </em>318 Md. 269, 568 A.2d 1, <em>cert. denied, </em>497 U.S. 1031, 110 S.Ct. 3296, 111 L.Ed.2d 805 (1990); <em>Carr v. State, </em>284 Md. 455, 397 A.2d 606 (1979). Further, only those statements in the hands of the state are discoverable. <em>See Bruce v. State, </em>318 Md. 706, 725-26, 569 A.2d 1254, 1264 (1990). In the instant case, Goldsmith was denied a pre-trial subpoena for psychotherapist records. He was not denied a trial subpoena for Dr. Gombatz, the psychotherapist. Additionally, the psychotherapist records in the instant case were not in the hands of the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b187-10\">. We note that most jurisdictions have held that a criminal defendant is not entitled to take discovery depositions of potential witnesses. Denial of such depositions has been held not to violate a defendant's constitutional rights to due process, compulsory process for obtaining witnesses, equal protection, or confrontation. <em>See </em>Annotation, Romualdo P.

There is another analogous area where this Court has held that there is no right to pre-trial discovery of records, but if a trial subpoena is issued, then upon a proper showing there may be a right to an <em>in camera </em>review of the records. For example, in <em>Martinez v. State, </em>309 Md. 124, 140, 522 A.2d 950, 960 (1987) and <em>Jones v. State, </em>297 Md. 7, 14-15, 464 A.2d 977, 982 (1983), we noted that a defendant may not be entitled to pre-trial disclosure of a witness\u2019s grand jury testimony, but the defendant may be entitled to the witness\u2019s grand jury testimony for cross-examination purposes after the witness testifies at trial or at a suppression hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b194-5\">. We note that Connecticut, Nebraska, and Michigan courts have held that, once a defendant satisfies this burden of establishing the need for the privileged materials, the witness claiming the privilege must waive the privilege to permit <em>in camera </em>review of the privileged records. Failure to waive the privilege to permit <em>in camera </em>review results in the witness\u2019s testimony being stricken. <em>See People </em>v. <em>Stanaway, </em>446 Mich. 643, 521 N.W.2d 557, 577 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>202 Conn. 259, 520 A.2d 1018, 1025 (1987); <em>State v.

If the judge accepts the defendant\u2019s proffer, the judge must review the records <em>in camera, </em>designating which portions of the records are relevant or irrelevant. <em>Bishop, </em>617 N.E.2d at 998. <em>(Cf. </em>footnote 8). 3) The judge must then provide access to the defense and prosecution as officers of the court to relevant portions of the records \"for the sole purpose of determining whether disclosure of the relevant communications to the trier of fact is required to provide the defendant a fair trial.\" <em>Id. </em>4) The defendant has the burden to establish that disclosure of the relevant portions of the privileged information sought is necessary to provide the defendant with a fair trial. Only if the defendant meets this burden shall the judge allow such disclosure. In making this determination, the judge should identify all information not disclosed and \"shall base his or her decision on written motions by the parties and an in camera hearing as the judge deems necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>5) Finally, \u201cthe judge shall determine the admissibility of the records that counsel may wish to introduce in a voir dire examination. In considering the admissibility of the records the judge shall be mindful of the requirements of the rape shield statute [Mass.Gen.L. ch. 233, \u00a7 21B (1992)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court noted that the duty of the court to disclose material information is ongoing, and the court should disclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>information initially withheld should it later become material. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Pennsylvania v.

This formulation of the issue apparently is based on the facts that the motions court\u2019s ruling was on the petitioner\u2019s \u201cmotion for the issuance of a subpoena for production of tangible evidence prior to trial\u201d and that, subsequent to that ruling, the petitioner \u201crequested and was issued a subpoena pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-265 for Dr. Gombatz to appear and produce his records at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119. Resolving the issue as formulated, the majority concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">It is quite clear that the motions judge precluded the <em>pretrial </em>discovery review of Dr. Gombatz\u2019s records. The defense was not precluded from calling Dr. Gombatz when the case actually went to trial____ The motions judge did not need to determine whether, the defendant might be able to elicit exculpatory evidence from the psychotherapist at trial. Thus, the court did not hold that Laura\u2019s privilege outweighed the defendant\u2019s constitutional <em>trial </em>rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">The majority has set up a highly vulnerable straw person, which it has proceeded easily to knock down. While, among its reasons for asking that the petitioner\u2019s subpoena for the psychotherapist\u2019s records be quashed, the State argued that the records are not subject to the Maryland Rules of Discovery, it did not make the argument, on the basis of which the majority affirms the trial court. In the trial court, neither party drew the distinction between a Rule 2-264 subpoena and a Rule 2-265 subpoena. Indeed, the only support the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>offers for the distinction and its conclusion that the trial court\u2019s ruling was based on that distinction is the colloquy in which the petitioner\u2019s counsel acknowledged reaching an agreement with the State in response to the State\u2019s motion to quash his \u201ctrial subpoena duces tecum.\u201d The petitioner\u2019s counsel did not, in that colloquy, concede the distinction the majority draws, he merely indicated that Dr. Gombatz would be called \u201c[i]f it becomes appropriate during the course of the trial that I could call him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Nor was the distinction the basis for the motions court\u2019s ruling. This is understandable because that was not the focus of the argument in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Certainly the majority does not direct our attention to anything in the record which would indicate that it was because the motion was a pretrial discovery motion, rather than an at trial subpoena duces tecum, that prompted the court\u2019s ruling. The record, in fact, belies the majority\u2019s conclusion in that regard. Having subpoenaed \u201c[a]ll documents including but not limited to reports, summaries, psychological testing, interview notes, diagnosis, and correspondence, that reflect and relate in anyway to [Dr. Gombatz\u2019s] treatment of [the complainant],\u201d the petitioner argued that access to these records, either directly through his counsel or by <em>in-camera </em>review by the court was necessary effectively to confront the complaining witness and defend himself against her accusations. It was in this context that the petitioner proffered;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">Your Honor, I think that what\u2019s required under <em>Zaal, </em>and my understanding of it, is a nominal showing of relevance. And I think here where the issue is going to be the credibility of the plaintiff, I would say to you that in the affidavit that Detective Madison attached to her arrest warrant of my client, she indicated that the complainant had been in counseling. And we later, at the preliminary hearing, found that it was with Dr. Gombatz for a period of over four years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">Where the facts are that you have an adult bringing charges that go back over ten years, where there\u2019s obvious<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>ly, there\u2019s a question about the complainant\u2019s emotional state, and I think that\u2019s tied into the credibility. I mean, I simply don\u2019t know what her emotional state is. I think this in a way goes back to the fact that there have been no\u2014you know, the complainant\u2019s mother hasn\u2019t been interviewed. We don\u2019t know\u2014other than what Detective Madison said today, something about the mother being emotionally unstable. I mean, that\u2019s news to me. But I mean, I think it\u2019s a fact that needs to be looked into.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">But in terms of confrontation rights, it seems to me that the Defendant, in all the facts of this case, being charged with conduct that happened over a decade ago, where you know that the Defendant has been in counsel\u2014not the Defendant, the complainant has been in counseling for over four years. I think that the\u2014I think where credibility is the make or break issue, I think some relief under <em>Zaal </em>whether that means that the court review these records <em>in-camera </em>or preferable to the Defendant, would be that I, under some sort of monitored format, be allowed to look at these records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Significantly, the petitioner\u2019s counsel referred to the <em>Zaal </em>case as well as the petitioner\u2019s confrontation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The motions court responded in a consistent fashion when ruling on the motion. Rather than focus on the distinction between a pretrial discovery right and at trial disclosure, the court distinguished between a witness\u2019 ability to perceive and a witness\u2019 veracity, reasoning that review of the privileged records hinged upon the former, rather than the latter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">The Court: Due process will set aside the privilege\u2014will require the privilege of patient-doctor to be set aside if it\u2019s a question of perception, if it\u2019s a question of credibility in the sense of a person being able to perceive things. But on your issue such as what you started to say was, \u201cOh, well suppose she had never told the doctor about this before,\u201d that has nothing to do with perception. That might have to do with\u2014* * * [i]t might have to do with her credibility or honesty, yes. But you\u2019re not going to get\u2014due process will not allow\u2014will not require the privilege to be set aside for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>that purpose * * * If it\u2019s a capacity issue, you get it. If it\u2019s not capacity, you don\u2019t. Capacity to perceive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. Rather than affirm on the pretrial/at trial dichotomy upon which the majority relies, it did so on the alternative bases that the trial court was without power \u201cto override the victim\u2019s refusal to waive the patient/psychologist privilege\u201d and that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s decision not to do so [in this case] was a proper exercise of discretion.\u201d Slip Op. at 9. It was to gain review of those two issues that the petitioner sought, and we granted, certiorari.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\"><em>Zaal </em>is particularly relevant to the issues this case <em>actually </em>presents: Whether the psychologist/patient privilege is absolute\u2014remains inviolate even in the face of a defendant\u2019s legitimate and reasonable need to discover arguably useful information protected by the privilege\u2014and whether the procedure we enunciated in that case strikes a proper balance between a victim\u2019s privacy interests in confidential records and the due process discovery rights of a defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Zaal </em>in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>volved the propriety of a defendant charged with child sexual abuse obtaining the pretrial discovery, for relevant impeachment information, of the school records of the child he was accused of abusing, when regulations promulgated to implement the timely Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 made \u201cmanifest that \u2018confidentiality and privacy of the student\u2019s education records are important considerations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>326 Md. at 76, 602 A.2d at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">To be sure, the primary focus in <em>Zaal </em>was on when the defendant himself, through counsel, should have direct access to the records. <em>See Id. </em>at 82, 602 Md. at 1261. This was so because the trial court resolved the threshold issue, the issue herein presented, in favor of the defendant. So it was that we discussed the special problem that cases turning on credibility pose\u2014discerning what evidence is impeachment evidence\u2014, <em>id., </em>and, with an eye toward providing judges with \u201cremedies which will take account of the rights of the accused and, at the same time, protect the interest of the victims,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 86, 602 A.2d at 1263, formulated options other than <em>in camera </em>inspection by the judge alone, to be used in the review of confidential, sensitive matters. <em>Id. </em>at 84-87, 602 A.2d at 1262-1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The majority recognizes that <em>Zaal </em>involved pretrial discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>ery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To rationalize the result it reaches in this case, as opposed to that reached in <em>Zaal, </em>the majority suggests that <em>Zaal, </em>like <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987), \u201c \u2018rejected defendant\u2019s confrontation clause argument, reasoning that it is a trial right, not one applicable to discovery.\u2019 \u201d Majority Op. at 125, quoting <em>Zaal, </em>326 Md. at 67 n. 6, 602 A.2d at 1253 n. 6, citing <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. at 52, 107 S.Ct. at 999, 94 L.Ed.2d at 54. It then asserts that the <em>Zaal </em>court adopted the Supreme Court\u2019s due process analysis, thus recognizing that \u201cthere may be a denial of due process when the <em>government\u2019s </em>records containing potentially exculpatory information were withheld from an accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125. The majority also relies upon <em>Avery v. State, </em>15 Md.App. 520, 292 A.2d 728 (1972), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>410 U.S. 977, 93 S.Ct. 1499, 36 L.Ed.2d 173 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">To be sure, in the <em>Zaal </em>decision, we reviewed the <em>Ritchie </em>decision in some detail. A major part of that review was in connection with our consideration of the issue of the extent to which an advocate should be afforded the opportunity to inspect confidential information for possible use in cross-examination. <em>See </em>Part IV of <em>Zaal, </em>326 Md. at 81-87, 602 A.2d at 1260-1263. It was in this context that we acknowledged the similarities, factually, between <em>Zaal </em>and <em>Ritchie; </em>indeed, we expressed the view that \u201c[p]rocedurally, this case and <em>Ritchie </em>are quite similar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81, 602 A.2d at 1260. At the same time, however, we reviewed, again in some detail, <em>Carr v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number><em>State, </em>284 Md. 455, 397 A.2d 606 (1979), in which we used the <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d; 347 (1974), analysis to resolve the issue \u201cwhether under the facts and circumstances of his criminal trial [a defendant] had a right to obtain and use the written statements of a State\u2019s witness for purposes of cross-examination or impeachment,\u201d <em>id., </em>284 Md. at 456, 397 A.2d at 606, and <em>Leonard v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 631, 637-39, 421 A.2d 85, 88-89 (1980), in which the Court of Special Appeals reiterated and explicated the principles enunciated in <em>Carr. </em>It is of some interest that we also factually compared <em>Zaal </em>to those cases. It is, therefore, inaccurate to even suggest that the <em>Zaal </em>court, like the <em>Ritchie </em>court, rejected the defendant\u2019s confrontation clause argument as being one applicable only to discovery. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 123. Likewise, it is inaccurate to even intimate that the <em>Zaal </em>court adopted the <em>Ritchie </em>court\u2019s due process analysis, ' thus placing the denial of due process squarely on the fact that \u201cthe <em>government\u2019s </em>records containing potentially exculpatory information were withheld from an accused.\u201d Majority Op. at 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Factually, of course, a state agency\u2019s records were involved in <em>Zaal. </em>That did not, however, play a decisive role in our analysis. Inde\u00e9d, it is quite clear that the <em>Zaal </em>opinion, unlike <em>Avery, </em>did not view the facts of that case as presenting a <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) or <em>Giles v. Maryland, </em>386 U.S. 66, 87 S.Ct. 793, 17 L.Ed.2d 737 (1967) situation. In addition to Part V of the <em>Zaal </em>opinion, <em>see also </em>footnote 2, (326 Md. at 62, 602 A.2d at 1251) in which the Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">The petitioner makes no contention, with good reason, that the records are discoverable pursuant to Maryland 4-263. That rule places the obligation on the State to disclose, but it presupposes that the information is in the prosecution\u2019s possession or under its control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In any event, the distinction that the majority draws between a state agency\u2019s files and a third party\u2019s file is really <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>one without a difference. Several courts have rejected its viability. <em>State v. Cressey, </em>137 N.H. 402, 628 A.2d 696 (1993); <em>State v. Gagne, </em>136 N.H. 101, 612 A.2d 899 (1992); <em>Commonwealth v. Miller, </em>399 Pa.Super. 180, 582 A.2d 4 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In <em>Cressey, </em>the Supreme Court of New Hampshire admonished the trial court for making a distinction between records that were under the control of a state agency and those under the control of a psychologist employed by a private mental health facility. Citing <em>Gagne, </em>the court characterized it as \u201ca distinction without a difference.\u201d 628 A.2d at 703, noting that \u201cbalancing the rights of a criminal defendant against the interest and benefits of confidentiality lies equally in both cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 703. The court also stated: \u201c[a] record is no less privileged simply because it belongs to a state agency. Likewise, the defendant\u2019s rights are no less worthy of protection simply because he seeks information maintained by a nonpublic entity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The argument was made in <em>Miller </em>that it made a difference whether the information the defendant sought to discover pursuant to his State constitutional confrontation and compulsory process rights was in the hands of a state agency or a private entity. Rejecting that argument, the same one made by the majority, the court said, \u201c[w]hen the nature of the evidence is such that denying a defendant the opportunity to review it in effect denies him his constitutional right to confrontation and compulsory process, he is entitled to review that evidence, regardless of whether it is in the hand of the commonwealth or a private institution.\u201d <em>Id., </em>582 A.2d at 708. <em>See also In re Doe, </em>964 F.2d 1325, 1329 (2d Cir.1992) <em>(in camera </em>review of private psychiatrist records permitted at discovery stage); <em>State ex rel.

Rather than the procedure enunciated in <em>Zaal </em>for resolving conflicts between a defendant\u2019s due process discovery rights and the privacy interests of a victim or the State in potentially relevant records, however, the intermediate appellate court adopted the procedure this Court announced in <em>Hamilton, Superintendent v.

Noting that <em>Ritchie </em>both involved a statutory conditional privilege, which did not preclude all use of the protected information, and made clear that a defendant\u2019s rights are not without limitation, the court concluded that \u201ca compelling public interest would justify the total nondisclosure of information [protected by the psychologist-patient privilege].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court then concluded that the public interest is served by the psychologist-patient privilege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">Patient confidence is essential for effective treatment.

The privilege thus serves the public interest in promoting a society in which the general well-being of the citizenry is protected. We find that this public interest is especially compelling where, as here, the victim of a crime has sought post-assault treatment knowing that her testimony would be a necessary part of the prosecution\u2019s case. Indeed, the fact that the legislature determined confidential information was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>inadmissible as evidence under the statutory privilege demonstrates a recognition of this public policy consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6\"><em>Id. </em>at 126-127 (footnotes and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Whether the privilege outweighed the accused\u2019s interest in discovering information useful to the defense was the next issue the court addressed. As to it, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">Having reviewed the language of the statutory privilege enacted by our legislature and having given consideration to the public policies underlying the absolute privilege as well as the relevant cases in this and other jurisdictions, we find that the interests protected by the privilege are substantial. We are, of course, cognizant of the heavy weight afforded to appellant\u2019s interest in disclosure of the victim\u2019s file. Nonetheless, in weighing the public interests protected by shielding the file with those advanced by disclosure, we conclude that the balance tips in favor of non-disclosure. Nor do we believe that our decision today will unduly infringe on the rights of the accused. First, we note that as a matter of constitutional law, our courts have upheld testimonial privileges which bar a criminal defendant from obtaining or using confidential communications.... Here, the privilege only limits access to statements made during the course of treatment by the psychologist. It does not foreclose all lines of defense questioning. Likewise, the privilege does not unfairly place the defense in a disadvantageous position; like the defense, the prosecution does not have access to the confidential file and, thus, cannot use the information to make its case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 129-30 (citations omitted). Additionally, the court declared that the interest protected precludes even <em>in camera </em>review by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">We decline to compromise what we have determined is an absolute privilege from disclosure. As we noted above, the purpose of the psychologist-client privilege is to aid in the effective treatment of the client by encouraging the patient to disclose information fully and freely without fear of public disclosure. We deem this purpose and the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>considerations to be of paramount concern. Subjecting the confidential file to <em>in camera </em>review by the trial court (as well as the appellate courts and staff members) would jeopardize the treatment process and undermine the public interests supporting the privilege. Simply stated, an absolute privilege of this type and in these circumstances requires absolute confidentiality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 131 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Other courts, indeed, the majority that have considered the question, including, as we have seen, the Court of Special Appeals, <em>see Reynolds, supra., </em>hold that the psychologist-patient privilege is not absolute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>E.g.

With but few exceptions, the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights of confrontation, compulsory process, and/or due process are vindicated through use of an <em>in camera </em>proceeding in which the court alone reviews the privileged material for relevant usable evidence. <em>E.g.

Trammell, </em>435 N.W.2d at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\"><em>Bishop </em>is typical of the rationale employed by these courts. In that case, the court recognized the competing interests as being, on the one hand, the need to minimize the danger that the exclusion of relevant evidence for a purpose other than enhancing the truth-seeking function will result in an innocent defendant being convicted and, on the other, the need to avoid \u201cthe chilling effect which routine disclosures [of privileged information] may have in preventing those in need from seeking that help.\u201d 617 N.E.2d at 994, quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Collett, </em>387 Mass. 424, 439 N.E.2d 1223, 1226 (1982). Underlying the interests in disclosure, the court noted, are the propositions that \u201cwhen relevant evidence is excluded ... for some purpose other than enhancing the truth-seeking func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>tion, the danger of convicting an innocent defendant increases,\u201d and that \u201cat a minimum ... criminal defendants have the right to .. put before a jury evidence that might influence the determination of guilt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. at 56, 107 S.Ct. at 1000, 94 L.Ed.2d at 56. In addition to the purpose for privileges\u2014prevention of the chilling effect of disclosures\u2014the court pointed out that disclosure \u201cserves as a disincentive to the maintenance of [the privileged] relationships.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Balancing these interests, the court recognized \u201cthat in <em>certain </em>circumstances a defendant must have access to privileged records so as not to undermine confidence in the outcome of trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 994-995.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Similarly, the court in <em>Adamski </em>held \u201cthat confidential or privileged information must be disclosed where a defendant\u2019s right to effective cross-examination would otherwise be denied.\u201d 497 N.W.2d at 548-50. The court pointed out that \u201c[i]t appears well settled as a matter of constitutional law that common-law or statutory privileges, even if purportedly absolute, may give way when in conflict with the constitutional right of cross-examination,\u201d and that \u201c[p]rivileges such as the one before us in this matter are intended to encourage society\u2019s interest in open discussion between persons in need and those from whom they seek help [but], [a]t the same time, however, privileges impede ability to present a defense by limiting the evidence available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The <em>Bishop </em>court, in defining its task, opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">The issue then devolves to the need to articulate a standard that judges can apply to identify those circumstances in which disclosure of the victim\u2019s records privileged by statute is required to provide the defendant a fair trial. It may be said that the controverted privilege shall be pierced in those cases in which there is a reasonable risk that nondisclosure may result in an erroneous conviction. Our charge, then, is to describe a standard that defines the line between a less inclusive standard (disclosure is not ordered when it should be ordered) and an overly inclusive standard (disclosure is ordered when it should not be ordered), resolving any doubt in favor of disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>617 N.E.2d at 995. The standard the court articulated required the defendant to meet a \u201cthreshold burden\u201d of showing \u201cat a minimum, a likelihood that the records contain relevant evidence to justify initial judicial review.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The cases holding that the privilege is not absolute, which I find persuasive, are consistent with the rationale we employed in <em>Zaal </em>and the Court of Special Appeals employed in <em>Reynolds. </em>Consequently, I would hold that the psychotherapist-patient privilege embodied in section 9-109(b) is not absolute. Accordingly, I would reverse' the judgment of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The State alternatively argued, and the majority today holds, that the trial court properly refused to disclose the subject records because the petitioner\u2019s proffer was inadequate. Although cognizant that <em>Zaal </em>enunciated a balancing test to resolve the competing interests of defendants in disclosure and of the victims and the State in non-disclosure of confidential information and enumerated relevant factors in that regard, they favor adoption of a more stringent test. Indeed, the test the majority 'announces is \u201ca reasonable likelihood that the privileged records contain exculpatory information necessary for a proper defense.\u201d Majority Op. at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Clearly, records protected by the psychologist-patient privilege enjoy a heightened level of protection, but as previously noted, the privilege is not absolute. Therefore, having determined that a defendant\u2019s interest in a fair trial may outweigh the privacy interest of a victim or the State in the information made confidential by the applicable privilege, this Court in <em>Zaal </em>fashioned a procedure by which those interests could be balanced. Notwithstanding that it did not specifically address the discoverability of privileged records and it endorses review options other than <em>in camera </em>review by the court alone, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>believe that the test it enunciated adequately addresses and balances the interests implicated in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Applying the <em>Zaal </em>test, I conclude that both the trial court and the Court of Special Appeals erred. The trial judge perceived the dispositive issue to be whether the petitioner\u2019s proffer made plausible that the psychotherapy records contained information bearing on the victim\u2019s <em>capacity to perceive. </em>It rejected any notion that the records could, or should, be reviewed for evidence useful in cross-examining the victim concerning her motivation, bias, and veracity. <em>Zaal </em>and the cases holding that the due process rights of a defendant can override a statutory privilege recognize that the purpose of review is not so limited. The Court of Special Appeals erred in holding, as a matter of law, that the \u201cneed to inspect\u201d threshold was not met in this case. The court should have considered and analyzed the petitioner\u2019s proffer in light of the <em>Zaal </em>standard. <em>Zaal, </em>326 Md. at 88, 602 A.2d at 1264. Therefore, the petitioner is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">At the threshold, a defendant is required to establish a \u201cneed to inspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81, 602 A.2d at 1260. In that regard, we noted in <em>Zaal </em>that where the defense relies heavily on credibility or matters similarly treated, whether the information would be useful in rebutting the plaintiffs case or impeaching the complaining witness \u201cdepends upon the circumstances, including context, and, to a large extent, the perception of the person interpreting it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82, 602 A.2d at 1261. To like effect, <em>see Bishop, </em>617 N.E.2d at 996 n. 6 and <em>Shiffra, </em>499 N.W.2d at 722. To meet the \u201cneed to inspect\u201d threshold, the defendant must proffer some relationship between the charges, the information sought, and the likelihood that review of the records will reveal relevant information. <em>Id. </em>at 81-82, 602 A.2d at 1260-1261. Therefore, taking into account the issues before the court and the seriousness of the charges facing the defendant, the proffer must not be frivolous, must place before the court the petitioner\u2019s legitimate concerns, and must give plausibility to the defendant\u2019s stated need to review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the records for relevant information. <em>Id. </em>at 83, 602 A.2d at 1262.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">We'made clear in <em>Stein </em>what was only implicit in <em>Zaal, </em>that the proffer of relevance could not be very specific since the defendant will not have seen the records and could not possibly know what was in them. 328 Md. at 30, 612 A.2d at 894. We did not, however, sanction or encourage fishing expeditions by counsel. We had required in <em>Zaal, </em>and continued to require in <em>Stein, </em>that counsel must proffer \u201ca reasonable possibility that review of the records would result in discovery of usable evidence____\u201d <em>Stein, 328 </em>Md. at 30, 612 A.2d at 894. Although the defendant need not show that the records actually contain material information, the proffer cannot be \u201cmerely a desperate grasping at a straw.\u201d <em>Bishop, </em>617 N.E.2d at 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The State argues<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that the petitioner\u2019s proffer is weaker than that in both <em>Zaal </em>and <em>Stein, </em>because it enumerates only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>two facts: the incident at issue occurred ten years earlier and the victim was in counseling. The majority agrees that the proffer is insufficient. Therefore, adopting the State\u2019s argument, the majority holds, as a matter of law, that the petitioner\u2019s proffer does not cross the \u201cneed to inspect\u201d threshold. Majority Op. at 132-135. I do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">In this case, the petitioner\u2019s proffer of relevance asserted that credibility was going to be a critical issue at trial. In support of that assertion he contended that the victim was in counseling; <em>ie., </em>10 years, had elapsed between the last alleged act of sexual abuse and the bringing of charges; that he had no contact with the victim for a considerable period of time and, hence, was without knowledge as to what her emotional state was; that the psychologist\u2019s records might show that the victim was delusional; that the victim may never have told her therapist about the alleged abuse, or may have done so only recently. He also noted that the victim told the police that it took years of counseling for her to summon the courage to bring the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">As we pointed out in <em>Zaal, </em>in addition to the specific proffer, the court must take into account the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the charges brought against the defendant, and the issue before the court. The query is, \u201c[H]as the petitioner placed before the court \u2018legitimate concerns and [given] plausibility to his stated need to review the records for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>relevant information[?]\u2019 \u201d <em>Zaal, </em>326 Md. at 83, 602 A.2d at 1262. Among the significant circumstances of this case is the amount of time that elapsed between the time of the alleged commission of the last criminal act and the filing of the complaint. This should be considered. Additionally relevant is the timing of the decision to undergo psychotherapy and its focus. Of particular interest here is that the psychotherapy occurred years after the incident giving rise to the criminal charges and the trauma at which the psychotherapy ostensibly is aimed. This factor is particularly important in this case in light of repressed memory syndrome, also known by opponents as false memory syndrome, a phenomenon which recently has gained nationwide attention.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Undoubtedly, a stronger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>threshold showing may be required to be proffered when the psychotherapy records sought are those of a victim who entered post-assault treatment, knowing that his or her testimony would be a necessary part of the prosecution\u2019s case, <em>see Kyle, </em>533 A.2d at 126, as opposed to one whose treatment is obtained, and continued, long after the event directly giving rise to the need for therapy has terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Although not directly so proffering in this case, the petitioner must have sought the records to effectively cross-examine the victim concerning the charges. Since the petitioner has not seen the records and cannot know what is in them, his proffer cannot be very specific. <em>See Stein, </em>328 Md. at 30, 612 A.2d at 894; <em>Bishop, </em>617 N.E.2d at 996, n. 6. As in <em>Zaal, </em>however, the petitioner\u2019s proffer, confirmed by the evidence adduced at trial, made clear that the critical issue in the case was clearly one involving credibility. The victim\u2019s version of the incident and that of the petitioner are diametrically and irreconcilably different. The lapse of time between the alleged incidents and their reporting, the fact that it was through counseling that she obtained the courage to bring the charges, and the fact that the counseling was obtained long after the acts alleged were committed, all raise the possibility that review of the counseling records will reveal relevant, useable information. Indeed, the latter two facts logically could suggest review in the interest of possibly discovering the source of the victim\u2019s memory of the events.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Determining that the \u201cneed to inspect\u201d threshold has been crossed does not end the court\u2019s task; it still must decide how the review will be conducted\u2014which of the options identified in <em>Zaal </em>it will order. In <em>Zaal, </em>this Court recognized that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u201c[juxtaposed against petitioner\u2019s proffer is the victim\u2019s legitimate [privacy] interest\u201d and that granting the defendant unrestricted access to the victim\u2019s confidential records could have adverse effects. <em>Id., </em>326 Md. at 83-84, 602 A.2d at 1262. It was in the interest of balancing these competing interests that we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">How significant that concern is, however, depends directly on the options available to the court; to the extent that the court has only two <em>options\u2014in camera </em>review by the court alone or ordering unqualified access of the records to the accused\u2014vindication of the victim\u2019s privacy rights may require a more restrictive attitude with respect to the accused\u2019s access to the victim\u2019s records. If there are other options, an intermediate position, perhaps, the accused\u2019s access may be expanded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 84, 602 A.2d at 1262. Noting that \u201c[w]here sensitive, matters are involved, it is the responsibility of trial judges to fashion remedies which will take account of the rights of the accused and, at the same time, protect the interest of victims,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86, 602 A.2d at 1263, we adopted the expanded <em>in camera </em>review proceeding enunciated in <em>Commonwealth v. Stockhammer, </em>409 Mass. 867, 570 N.E.2d 992, 1002 (1991)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to avoid a trial judge being required to perform that function <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>which is so foreign to its usual office. <em>Id. </em>at 86, 602 A.2d at 1263. At the same time, we sought to ensure that the defendant would have the benefit of the advocate\u2019s eye while protecting the victim\u2019s privacy. This was to be accomplished \u201cboth by virtue of the court order restricting dissemination of the information contained in the records and by proceedings to determine admissibility of information defense counsel deems relevant and usable ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87, 602 A.2d at 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">I realize that the records in this case are more sensitive than those at issue in <em>Zaal </em>and <em>Stein </em>and that the trial court has yet to determine the strength of the \u201cneed to inspect\u201d showing in relation thereto. When access to sensitive or confidential records is sought by a defendant, the trial court has three options, \u201cto review the records alone, to conduct the review in the presence of counsel, or to permit review by counsel alone, as officers of the court, subject to such restrictions as the court requires to protect the records\u2019 confidentiality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87, 602 A.2d at 1264. Which option it chooses is a matter within the court\u2019s discretion, although we offered factors to inform the exercise of that discretion. <em>Id. </em>The burden of proof does not change, merely the method of reviewing the material. It must also be pointed out that, when the court reviews the records alone, except as to information which, without regard to the perspective of the person conducting the review, has absolutely no possible relevance to the case, \u201cthe trial court\u2019s <em>in camera </em>review should not be conducted with preclusive intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 602 A.2d at 1264 (footnote omitted). To the extent that there is a question of the source of the victim\u2019s memory, <em>ie., </em>how it was \u201ctriggered\u201d, evidence bearing on that issue would appear to be \u201creadily identifiable,\u201d and, hence, would support court review alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Should it elect to review the records alone, as, indeed, it may decide to do, the court\u2019s purpose is not to act as advocate, but only to exclude from the parties\u2019 review material that could not logically be used by the defense in preparing its case. Finally, \u201c[t]he trial judge should mark and seal the records excluded so that the judge\u2019s determination in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>regard may be reviewed on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88 n. 15, 602 A.2d at 1264 n. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">As earlier indicated, the majority requires a showing of \u201ca reasonable likelihood that the privileged records contain certain exculpatory information necessary for a proper defense,\u201d as a prerequisite to disclosure of privileged information. Majority Op. at 133. Not only does this standard place on a defendant a burden of proof much higher than that required in <em>Zaal, </em>but, notwithstanding its protestations to the contrary, it makes the psychotherapist-patient privilege effectively absolute; establishing a reasonable likelihood of discovery of exculpatory information, requiring as it does a rather specific identification of what the sought after evidence is, is virtually impossible. See note 4 <em>supra. </em>A constitutional right incapable of being exercised is tantamount to no right at all; it is hollow, indeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">I repeat, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">ELDRIDGE, J., joins in the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-9\">. I do recognize, however, because it uses the term, \"ordinarily\u201d, that this Court has interpreted Maryland Rule 8-131(b) as occasionally permitting the decision of cases upon issues not previously raised. <em>See Crown Oil &amp; Wax Co. v. Glen Constr. Co., </em>320 Md. 546, 578 A.2d 1184 (1990); <em>Yarema v. Exxon Corp., </em>305 Md. 219, 503 A.2d 239 (1986); <em>Taub v. State, </em>296 Md. 439, 463 A.2d 819 (1983). The majority does not purport to exercise its discretion in that regard; rather, it proceeds as if the issue it chooses to base its decision upon was raised and decided throughout the litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\">. The questions presented in the <em>cert. petition </em>were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">1. Did the trial court err in refusing either to permit defense counsel to inspect the records of the complainant\u2019s treating psychologist or to conduct an <em>in camera </em>review of the record itself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">2. Did the trial court err in instructing the jury in response to the jury\u2019s question asking if an ex-wife can testify against her former husband?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">We granted <em>certiorari </em>to consider only the first question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b199-11\">. The majority \u201dhold[s] that Maryland Rule 4-264 means what it says and precludes pre-trial discovery of a victim\u2019s privileged psychotherapist-patient records.\u201d Majority Op. at 123. By way of distinguishing that case from this one, it makes much of the fact that the records in <em>Zaal v. State, </em>326 Md. 54, 602 A.2d 1247 (1992) were educational records, discoverable pursuant to a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena, as opposed to being records subject to a statutory privilege and of the fact that we acknowledged in <em>Zaal </em>that the regulations did not preclude discovery pursuant to the Maryland Rules. Of course we recognized, as the State points out, that the trial court\u2019s ruling was not based on the applicability of a privilege; \u2022 rather, it was premised on the general right to privacy provided by the regulations. It is perhaps of some interest to note that Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines a confidential communication as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Privileged communications such as those between spouses, physician-patient, attorney-client, confessor-penitent, etc. Such are privileged at the option of the spouse-witness, client-witness and penitent-witness. [A] Confidential communication is [a] statement made under circumstances showing that [the] speaker intended [the] statement only for [the] ears of [the] person addressed; thus if [a] communication is made in [the] presence of [a] third party whose presence is not reasonably necessary for the communication, it is not privileged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Black's Law Dictionary 298 (6th ed. 1990). Similarly, privileged communications are defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">Those statements made by certain persons within a protected relationship such as husband-wife, attorney-client, priest-penitent and the like which the law protects from forced disclosure on the witness stand at the option of the witness, client, penitent, spouse ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1198. As these definitions make clear, there is considerable overlap between a privileged communication and a confidential one. What perhaps distinguishes one from the other is the degree of sensitivity involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b201-6\">. The majority recognizes that \"[i]t is conceivable that a trial subpoena under Md. Rule 4-265 for a witness and documents, which may be privileged, could be reviewed pre-trial on a motion to quash or a motion for a protective order.\u201d Majority Op. at 132. Rather than simply recognizing that this is precisely what was sought to be done, it persists in continuing on the frolic it has chosen to pursue. This is reflected in the review standard it formulates: \"a reasonable likelihood that the privileged records contain certain exculpatory information necessary for a proper defense.\u201d Majority Op. at 133. As I understand that standard, without the benefit of reviewing the records, the defendant must be able to identify exactly what exculpatory evidence is being sought and the court must be able to inquire about exactly how that evidence would be exculpatory. The majority requires, in short, that the defendant be able to meet an impossible burden.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b204-6\">.
