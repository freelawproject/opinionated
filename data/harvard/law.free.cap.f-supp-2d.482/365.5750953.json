In their consolidated amended class action complaint, plaintiffs claim that defendants artificially inflated the value of Sierra\u2019s stock by issuing statements that contained material misrepresentations and omissions regarding various aspects of the company\u2019s future performance and business strategy. It does not allege that defendants misstated any past financial results. The complaint further asserts control person liability against three individual corporate officers pursuant to section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-17\">Defendants have now moved to dismiss the action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. They contend that the complaint does not plead securities fraud with the particularity required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Pub.L. No. 104-67, 109 Stat. 737 (codified in various sections of 15 U.S.C.) (\u201cPSLRA\u201d), and therefore should be dismissed. In addition, defendants claim protection under the PSLRA\u2019s \u201csafe harbor\u201d for forward-looking statements, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-18\">Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint is granted for the reasons set forth at length in this Opinion. In sum, the statements that form the basis of this action are broadly optimistic projections of future performance that plaintiffs allege are false or misleading. However, plaintiffs have not specified why or how these statements are false or misleading and therefore have not supplied sufficient facts in their lengthy complaint to support their allegations. The securities laws neither require corporate officers to adopt a crabbed, defeatist view of the company\u2019s business prospects nor permit dissatisfied shareholders to assert serious allegations of fraud based on the perfect hindsight afforded by the passage of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The complaint alleges the following relevant facts, which the Court assumes to be true for the purposes of this motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">A. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">This multidistrict litigation consists of nine separate class actions which were centralized in the Southern District of New York pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistriet Litigation and assigned to this Court for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings. (See Transfer Order of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation dated Aug. 22, 2005.) This Court subsequently consolidated the actions for pretrial purposes pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 42(a), appointed lead plaintiffs, approved their selection of lead counsel, and directed them to file a consolidated amended complaint. (See Order dated Dec. 16, 2005.) Subsequent to the filing of that complaint, defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated action.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">B. <em>The Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Sierra, a Canadian corporation with its principal place of business in British Columbia, is in the business of developing telecommunications products such as wireless data modems and mobile phones. (Am.Compl^ 7.) During the class period, Sierra\u2019s \u201ckey products\u201d were (1) the Air-Card, which is a PC card that enables laptop computers to connect to the internet; (2) embedded modules, which are built into handheld devices made by original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d); (3) vehicle-mounted modems and software that permits remote wireless access; and (4) the Voq Professional Phone, a multifunctional mobile device similar to a Blackberry or Treo. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">David B. Sutcliffe was Sierra\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer during all relevant times. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 8.) David G. McLen-nan became the Chief Financial Officer of Sierra in March 2004 and thereafter held that position for the remainder of the class period. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 9.) Jason W. Cohenour served as Sierra\u2019s Senior Vice President for Worldwide Sales until August 2004, at which time he became the company\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, a position which he held until October 2005. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 10.) As Sierra\u2019s senior officers, Sutcliffe, McLennan, and Cohenour (the \u201cSierra Officers\u201d) had access to non-public information pertaining to the company\u2019s finances, products, markets, and business prospects. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">The lead plaintiffs in this multidistrict class action are the National Elevator Industry Pension Plan, Cary Boyko, Andy Hua, John Travan, Roger S. Curry, and James M. Dowd. Each lead plaintiff purchased Sierra securities during the class period and claims to have been injured by defendants\u2019 conduct. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">\n<em>C.The Alleged Fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-15\">Plaintiffs contend that during the class period, Sierra \u201cengaged in a scheme to deceive the market ... that artificially inflated Sierra Wireless\u2019 securities ... by issuing false and misleading statements\u201d to the investing public about the company\u2019s major product lines and largest customers. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 95.) According to the complaint, Sierra held itself out as a \u201cmarket leader\u201d with \u201ca reputation in the wireless data industry for creating state-of-the-art, high-quality products.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24, 26.) However, this carefully cultivated public image was at odds with the alleged truth about Sierra\u2019s prospects: the company faced a rapidly eroding market position on several fronts. In time the truth about Sierra\u2019s diminished prospects emerged. On January 26, 2005 Sierra announced lackluster fourth quarter 2004 results and projected even worse performance in 2005. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 83.) This news triggered a major sell-off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>of Sierra stock, which fell by thirty-eight percent from the prior day\u2019s closing price. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">In support of these allegations, plaintiffs claim that Sierra failed to make adequate disclosures about six significant business events. According to the complaint, Sierra misled the investing public about: (1) its failure to win new business from palmOne, one of its largest customers; (2) the conclusion of its existing business with pal-mOne at the end of 2004; (3) its excess PC Card inventory, which Sierra planned to \u201cstuff\u2019 into its distribution channels; (4) the projected weakness of its PC Card business; (5) the inability of its \u201csmart-phone\u201d product to compete successfully in the market; and (6) its decision not to introduce a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (\u201cUMTS\u201d) product in 2005, despite publicly announcing its plans to do so. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29, 31, 33, 38, 42, 43, 96.) Each of these allegations is analyzed in detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\n<em>1. Sierra\u2019s Failure to Win New Business from palm One</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Sierra \u2014 a self-professed \u201cmarket leader\u201d in the distribution of embedded modules to OEMs \u2014 purportedly earned twenty percent of its total 2004 revenues from OEM sales to palmOne, which in turn utilized the modules in its popular \u201cTreo 600 smartphone.\u201d (Am.CompLH 26-27.) In 2003, palmOne planned to launch a new model of the Treo and was in the process of selecting a supplier to provide the embedded modules for the new version of that device. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 28.) Citing a \u201cformer palmOne new products material manager with personal knowledge of palmOne\u2019s business with Sierra Wireless,\u201d plaintiffs contend that palmOne informed Sierra executives in late 2003 that Sierra had not been chosen to supply the embedded modules for the new Treo phone. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 59.) Thus, prior to the start of the class period, Sierra allegedly knew that its OEM module revenues were likely to decline \u201cafter palmOne phased out sales of [the Treo 600] phone to make room for its next generation of phones.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">While allegedly aware of this adverse information, Sierra issued the following statements during the class period, which plaintiffs contend were false or misleading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">\u2022 On an April 19, 2004 conference call, Sutcliffe stated that he \u201cexpect[ed] OEM to continue to be a strong segment,\u201d noting that Sierra \u201cspent years investing in building up [its] portfolio of OEM clients and ... products, and are doing quite well in that area right now.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 58.) On the same call, Cohenour stated that, due to recent OEM wins, \u201c[w]e expect [OEM] to continue to be a healthy business for the foreseeable future.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-11\">\u2022 On May 4, 2004 \u2014 after an analyst had publicly stated that palmOne \u201chas plans to move away from Sierra Wireless\u201d for future Treo models \u2014 a Sierra press released announced that Veri-Fone \u201chas joined [its] growing roster of embedded module customers\u201d but did not mention Sierra\u2019s business prospects with respect to palmOne. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 62.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-12\">\u2022 In a July 21, 2004 press release, Sierra attributed the company\u2019s positive second-quarter performance in part to \u201c[d]emand for our ... embedded module [lines.]\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-13\">\u2022 On an October 27, 2004 conference call, Cohenour remarked that demand for Sierra\u2019s \u201cembedded modules continues to be strong.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 76.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">Plaintiffs claim that each of these statements is misleading because of Sierra\u2019s failure to acknowledge the impact of pal-mOne\u2019s decision not to award its OEM business for the next generation of Treo phones to Sierra.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\n<em>2. The Completion of the Existing pal-mOne Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">In a related claim, plaintiffs contend that Sierra knew its existing OEM business with palmOne would be completed by the end of 2004 and a significant reduction in its OEM sales would follow. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 70.) Plaintiffs claim that this knowledge made the statements listed in the previous section misleading, as well as Sierra\u2019s August 31, 2004 disclosure that it had failed to win the new Treo business, on the theory that Sierra should have also disclosed that all business with palmOne would cease at the end of 2004. <em>(Id. \u00b6 69.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\n<em>3. Excess PC Card Inventory and Channel Stuffing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Plaintiffs also allege that Sierra engaged in a \u201cscheme to stuff the [e]ompany\u2019s distribution channels with PC Cards that was far in excess of end user demand in order to meet quarterly earnings guidance.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 43.) Plaintiffs contend that such a scheme is itself unlawful and, in addition, caused Sierra\u2019s representations about the strength of its PC Card business to be materially false and misleading. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b643, 78.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\n<em>U. The Strength of the PC Card Business</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Plaintiffs further claim that Sierra made false and misleading statements about the strength of its PC Card business while knowing that this business was plagued with weaknesses. Specifically, plaintiffs point to the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">\u2022 On a January 28, 2004 conference call, Cohenour stated that Sierra was well-positioned to benefit from Verizon\u2019s national rollout of its CDMA EV-DO service, as Sierra was \u201calready providing EV-DO PC Cards to Verizon in support of their 2-city trial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 51.) In response to a question on Sierra\u2019s ability to compete in the PC Card market, Sierra responded that \u201conly the paranoids survive\u201d and noted that the company \u201calways anticipated that there will be competition.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 52.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-11\">\u2022 In a July 21, 2004 press release, Sut-cliffe commented on Sierra\u2019s positive second-quarter results, noting that \u201c[d]emand for our PC Card, embedded module and mobile product lines are fueling these results.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 62.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-12\">\u2022 On a July 21, 2004 conference call where Sierra presented a positive outlook for its business units, Cohenour observed that \u201cgoing forward, [we expect] PC Cards and Voq as a percentage of our revenue mix to trend up.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 63.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-13\">\u2022 On an October 27, 2004 conference call, Cohenour stated that \u201c[d]emand in Q3 for our EV-DO PC Cards remained strong ... and we\u2019re expecting this trend to continue in Q4. We also note that Verizon is continuing to expand its network aggressively, and that Sprint is also now planning to deploy. As an early innovator in the EV-DO space, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this network expansion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 76.) In response to how Sierra would fare against competitors in the EV-DO PC Card market, Cohenour expressed his belief that Sierra \u201cshould be able to win in the space [sic] of that expected competition.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 77.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-14\">Plaintiffs consider these statements false or misleading because during the class period, Sierra\u2019s PC Cards business faced stiff competition from low-cost competitors such as Novatel and Kyocera. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 37.) Given this competitive environment, plaintiffs assert that Sierra \u201ccould not \u2018survive\u2019 in the PC Cards market\u201d and Sierra either knew this reality or recklessly disregarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>it when it made the statements quoted above. (Id \u00b6 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\n<em>5. The Voq Professional Phone\u2019s Failure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In light of its purported setbacks in the OEM and PC Card markets, Sierra allegedly attempted to focus public attention on a new product \u2014 the Voq Professional Phone (\u201cVoq\u201d) \u2014 as a source of future revenue growth for the company. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b631.) Plaintiffs contend that this amounted to an elaborate ruse, as Sierra knew that \u201cit could not successfully break into the smartphone market with the Voq Professional Phone because major manufacturers ... dominated the market and had already established significant distribution channels for their smartphone products.\u201d (Id) In addition, plaintiffs claim that the Voq was \u201cpoorly designed and exhibited mechanical failures\u201d which defendants never disclosed to the investing public. (Id) In keeping with these dismal assessments, Voq sales accounted for less than two percent of the company\u2019s 2004 revenues and the phone was discontinued the following year. (Id \u00b6\u00b6 31, 50.)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">According to plaintiffs, Sierra \u2014 despite harboring little real hope for the Voq\u2014 made the following statements during the class period:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">\u2022 In a January 28, 2004 press release, Sierra stated that the Voq phone was among the \u201cnew products [expected] to drive future growth.\u201d (Id \u00b6 48.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">\u2022 On a January 28, 2004 conference call, Sutcliffe estimated that Voq \u201ccould be as much as 20 percent of total revenues.\u201d (Id \u00b6 49.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-10\">\u2022 On a July 21, 2004 conference call, Cohenour stated that he expected \u2018Voq as a percentage of our revenue mix to trend up.\u201d (Id \u00b6 63.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-11\">\u2022 On an October 27, 2004 conference call, Cohenour stated that fourth quarter 2004 growth would be driven by certain products, including the Voq phone and noted that \u2018Voq will be a significant positive contributor to our financial results.\u201d (Id \u00b6\u00b6 76, 81.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">These statements are alleged to be false and misleading because Sierra did not actually believe that it could succeed in the smartphone market due to (a) stiff competition and (b) the Voq\u2019s defective design.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">\n<em>6. Sierra\u2019s Failure to Introduce a UMTS Product in 2005</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-15\">Finally, plaintiffs report that Sierra repeatedly advised the public in a series of statements made during the class period that it planned to bring a UMTS product to market in 2005. (Id \u00b6\u00b6 54, 60, 67, 79.) However, despite these announcements, Sierra allegedly had no plans to do so because competitors already dominated the UMTS market. (Id \u00b6\u00b6 38, 55.) Plaintiffs claim that Sierra had decided in the beginning of 2004 not to develop a UMTS PC Card (id) and therefore, Sierra\u2019s announced plans to bring a UMTS product to market in 2005 were false and misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-16\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b411-17\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-18\">The Court will grant a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b) (6) only \u201cwhere it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can present no set of facts entitling him to relief.\u201d <em>Chosun Int\u2019l v. Chrisha Creations, Ltd., </em>413 F.3d 324, 327 (2d Cir.2005). When deciding a motion to dismiss, the Court assumes the truth of all facts asserted in the complaint and draws all reasonable inferences from those facts in favor of the plaintiffs. <em>See Shah v. Meeker, </em>435 F.3d 244, 246 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). Thus, at this stage of the proceedings, the Court\u2019s focus is on the sufficiency of the pleadings and not the weight of the evidence that might be pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>sented at trial. <em>See Chosun, </em>413 F.3d at 327. However, it is appropriate for the Court to consider \u201cany written instrument attached to [the complaint] as an exhibit or any statements or documents incorporated in it by reference, as well as public disclosure documents required by law to be, and that have been, filed with the SEC ....\u201d <em>Rothman v. Gregor, </em>220 F.3d 81, 88 (2d Cir.2000) (citing <em>Cosmas v. Hassett, </em>886 F.2d 8, 13 (2d Cir.1989); <em>Kramer v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>937 F.2d 767, 774 (2d Cir. 1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">B. <em>Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\n<em>1. Legal Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act forbids the use of \u201cany manipulative or deceptive\u201d practice \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any [registered] security.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b). Rule 10b-5 \u2014 which was promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to section 10 of the Exchange Act \u2014 states that it is \u201cunlawful for any person ... [t]o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading ... in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">To state a claim pursuant to section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, a plaintiff must adequately allege the following elements: \u201c(1) a material misrepresentation (or omission), (2) scienter, i.e., a wrongful state of mind, (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security, (4) reliance, often referred to in cases involving public securities markets (fraud-on-the-market cases) as \u2018transaction causation,\u2019 (5) economic loss, and (6) \u2018loss causation,\u2019 i.e., a causal connection between the material misrepresentation and the loss.\u201d <em>Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, </em>544 U.S. 336, 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">Complaints alleging securities fraud must also comply with the heightened pleading requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPSLRA\u201d). Fed. R.Civ.P. 9(b) requires that \u201cthe circumstances constituting fraud ... shall be stated with particularity\u201d in the complaint. A \u201ccomplaint making such allegations must \u2018(1) specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent, (2) identify the speaker, (3) state where and when the statements were made, and (4) explain why the statements were fraudulent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shields v. Citytrust Bancorp., </em>25 F.3d 1124, 1127-28 (2d Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Mills v. Polar Molecular Corp., </em>12 F.3d 1170, 1175 (2d Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">The PSLRA requires a complaint to \u201cspecify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b). While the PSLRA \u201cdoes not require that plaintiffs plead with particularity every single fact upon which their beliefs concerning false or misleading statements are based,\u201d plaintiffs must \u201cplead with particularity sufficient facts to support those beliefs.\u201d <em>Novak v.

Application to Plaintiff\u2019s Allegations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">a. <em>Sierra\u2019s Failure to Win New Business from palmOne</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Plaintiffs claim that a series of optimistic statements made by Sierra concerning its OEM module business are actionable because they were made when Sierra knew that it would not supply the modules for palmOne\u2019s next generation Treo. Plaintiffs do not contend that Sierra represented to the public that it expected to win the new Treo contract while knowing that, in fact, it had not won that business. Rather, they claim that Sierra\u2019s broadly optimistic statements about its OEM business were misleading because without the new Treo contract, Sierra\u2019s OEM business was essentially doomed. Because plaintiffs have failed to plead this claim with the requisite particularity, it is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Sutcliffe\u2019s comments on the April 19, 2004 conference call \u2014 where he stated that he \u201cexpect[ed] OEM to continue to be a strong segment\u201d (Am.Compl^ 58) \u2014 and Cohenour\u2019s comments on the same call\u2014 where he expressed his expectation that OEM would \u201ccontinue to be a healthy business for the foreseeable future\u201d (id.)\u2014 constitute broadly optimistic pronouncements on the future of Sierra\u2019s OEM business. In general, such statements are considered \u201cexpressions of puffery and corporate optimism [which] do not give rise to securities violations.\u201d <em>Rombach v. Chang, </em>355 F.3d 164, 174 (2d Cir.2004). The Second Circuit has explained the rationale for this principle: \u201c[Companies must be permitted to operate with a hopeful outlook ... [and] are not required to take a gloomy, fearful or defeatist view of the future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, if a corporation issues an optimistic statement that lacks a basis in fact or is undermined by non-disclosed facts of which the speaker is aware, the statement may be actionable under the securities laws. <em>See In re IBM Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>163 F.3d 102, 107 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201cStatements regarding projections of future performance may be actionable under section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 ... if the speaker does not genuinely or reasonably believe them.\u201d) (citations omitted). In order to succeed on this type of claim, however, plaintiffs \u201cmust do more than say that the statements ... were false and misleading; they must demonstrate with specificity why and how that is so.\u201d <em>Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 174. This requirement is consistent with the heightened pleading standard mandated by Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA for allegations of securities fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">As plaintiffs observe, Sierra\u2019s failure to win the new palmOne business \u2014 which they contend was clear to Sierra executives by the end of 2003 \u2014 would not impact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>sales figures until 2005 (Am.ComplV 33) and in the meantime Sierra was purportedly exploring other options to boost its revenue <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 31). Therefore, when Sierra\u2019s officers announced that they \u201cex-peet[ed] OEM to continue to be a strong segment\u201d and a \u201chealthy business for the foreseeable future,\u201d Sierra did not necessarily have any reason to fear an imminent collapse of its OEM business, and plaintiffs\u2019 allegations do not indicate that they should have. Indeed, for the remainder of the year, OEM sales \u2014 including OEM sales to palmOne \u2014 appear to have been strong, and it was only in the first quarter of 2005 that OEM sales fell, thus prompting plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of securities fraud.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 72, 84.) Thus, plaintiffs have not adequately demonstrated that Sierra\u2019s failure to win new business from palmOne was so significant and irreversible a blow to its OEM unit that it undermined the company\u2019s optimistic statements about that business generally. Without such a showing, plaintiffs\u2019 claim arising from the April 19 statements do not satisfy the requirement of particularity mandated by Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The May 4, 2004 announcement that VeriFone had joined the \u201cgrowing roster of embedded module customers\u201d is similarly not actionable, because plaintiffs have not adequately pled that it is false or misleading. Plaintiffs claim that the statement is contradicted by palmOne\u2019s decision not to award the new Treo business to Sierra. However, plaintiffs concede that palmOne remained a Sierra customer through the end of 2004 <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 72) and plaintiffs do not claim that Sierra lost any OEM customer during this period or that VeriFone did not in fact become a Sierra customer. Therefore, the May 4, 2004 statement was literally true. In addition, Sierra\u2019s failure to win new business from an existing customer does not so undermine this statement as to make it misleading because no reasonable investor would believe that Sierra\u2019s announcement indicated that it always won every business opportunity from its \u201cgrowing roster\u201d of OEM customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim arising from the July 21, 2004 press release attributing Sierra\u2019s positive second-quarter performance to OEM demand suffers from the same defect: Plaintiffs have not adequately pled that this statement is false or misleading. Plaintiffs do not allege that Sierra\u2019s OEM business was not strong in the second quarter of 2004, but instead urge that this statement was misleading because of the likely adverse effects of not winning the new palmOne business. While palmOne\u2019s decision may have presented an obstacle to Sierra\u2019s future OEM performance, it did not contradict, undermine or refute the statement of historical fact made in the July 21, 2004 press release \u2014 that OEM demand contributed to Sierra\u2019s second-quarter performance \u2014 and plaintiffs do not question that statement\u2019s accuracy. Therefore, this statement is not actionable under the federal securities laws. <em>See, e.g., In re WorldCom, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>303 F.Supp.2d 385, 387 (S.D.N.Y.2004) (holding that an \u201caccurate description of historical prices\u201d cannot support a securities fraud claim); <em>In re Duane Reade Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>No. 02-cv-6478, 2003 WL 22801416, at *6, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21319, at *23 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2003) (The \u201cdisclosure of accurate historical data does not become misleading even if less favorable results might be predictable by the company in the future.\u201d) (quoting <em>In re Sofamor Da-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>nek Group, Inc., </em>123 F.3d 394, 401 n. 3 (6th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">For the same reason, Cohenour\u2019s comment on the October 27, 2004 conference call that the \u201cembedded modules [business] continues to be strong\u201d is not actionable, as plaintiffs do not contend that OEM demand was in fact weak when Cohenour described it as \u201cstrong.\u201d In addition, by the time that statement was made, Sierra had already disclosed that it had not won the new Treo business. (Am.Compl.l 69.) As a result, Cohenour\u2019s comment was made at a time when the investing public was well aware that Sierra would not supply palmOne with embedded modules for the new Treo, and therefore the statement could not have been misleading even under plaintiffs\u2019 theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">To be sure, Sierra\u2019s inability to obtain the new Treo business from palmOne was a significant setback for the company. However, plaintiffs have not adequately pled that this setback was so insurmountable that it rendered Sierra\u2019s positive statements about its OEM business materially misleading. <em>See Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 173-74 (rejecting allegations of fraud based on the nondisclosure of events that were \u201cconsistent with unremarkable circumstances short of financial peril or instability.\u201d). Indeed, Sierra publicly disclosed that it did not win the new Treo business in August 2004, a full four months before that loss would begin to impact 2005 earnings. For these reasons, plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on the above statements fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">b. <em>The Completion of the Existing pal-mOne Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Plaintiffs contend that the statements listed in the previous section \u2014 as well as Sierra\u2019s August 31, 2004 disclosure that it had failed to win the new Treo business without commenting on the status of its existing palmOne business \u2014 are misleading because Sierra knew its existing OEM business with palmOne would be completed by the end of 2004 and a significant reduction in its OEM sales would follow. (Am.Compl.1ffl 69, 70.) Plaintiffs cite nothing to support their claim that Sierra knew that its existing business with palmOne would conclude at year end prior to publicly disclosing this fact on October 27, 2004 <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 72) and therefore have failed to plead this claim with particularity as required by Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">Under Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA, plaintiffs must \u201csupply sufficient specific facts to support their allegations.\u201d <em>Novak, </em>216 F.3d at 314. This pleading requirement can be met by \u201cproviding documentary evidence and/or a sufficient general description of the personal sources of the plaintiffs\u2019 beliefs\u201d including well-placed confidential sources. <em>(Id.) </em>Here, however, plaintiffs supply no facts whatsoever to support their allegations that Sierra knew about the termination of its existing business with palmOne prior to Sierra\u2019s public disclosure to that effect on October 27, 2004. All plaintiffs offer are conclusory allegations that Sierra knew its palmOne business was winding down at the same time that it issued generally positive statements about its OEM business unit. These allegations do not satisfy the heightened pleading requirements applicable in this case and, as a result, plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on Sierra\u2019s alleged undisclosed knowledge of the imminent completion of palmOne\u2019s OEM contract are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">c. <em>Excess PC Card Inventory and Channel </em>Stuffing<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">In support of their allegation that Sierra engaged in a \u201cscheme to stuff the [c]ompa-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>ny\u2019s distribution channels with PC Cards that was far in excess of end user demand\u201d (Am.ComplJ 43), plaintiffs point to the comments of a former Sierra marketing director, who stated that \u201cthere was a pretty solid amount in the inventory [of PC Cards] as far as product sitting out there, meanwhile, the next competitors came in.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43, 78.) This statement appears to suggest that Sierra had produced a significant quantity of PC Cards and faced stiff competition in selling them, but it does not imply that Sierra coerced its customers to accept more PC Cards than they wanted and therefore does not support plaintiffs\u2019 channel-stuffing claim. <em>See Gavish v. Revlon, Inc., </em>No. 00-cv-7291, 2004 WL 2210269, at *17, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19771, at *52 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2004) (\u201c[T]here is nothing inherently improper in pressing for sales to be made earlier than in the normal course ....\u201d) (quoting <em>Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc., </em>194 F.3d 185, 202 (1st Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Next, plaintiffs turn to an anonymous \u201cfounder\u201d of AirPrime \u2014 a wireless technology company acquired by Sierra \u2014 who claims that \u201cSierra was stuffing the distribution network in an effort to make its earnings numbers that they had forecast to Wall Street.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 78.) While plaintiffs may rely on confidential sources to satisfy the pleading requirements of Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA, the source must be \u201cdescribed in the complaint with sufficient particularity to support the probability that a person in the position occupied by the source would possess the information alleged.\u201d <em>See Novak, </em>216 F.3d at 314. Plaintiffs do not indicate that an AirPrime founder \u2014 with an unspecified role (if any) at Sierra during the class period \u2014 would be in a position to know about Sierra\u2019s strategy for selling its PC Cards and whether that strategy included channel stuffing. In effect, the former AirPrime founder merely parrots the conclusory allegations contained in the complaint. As a result, plaintiffs have not satisfied the heightened pleading requirements for their channel-stuffing claim, which is therefore dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">d. <em>The Strength of the PC Card Business</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Sierra made false and misleading statements about the strength of its PC Card business while knowing that this business was plagued with weaknesses also falls short of the standard for pleading claims of securities fraud. This claim is premised on plaintiffs\u2019 belief that Sierra faced stiff competition from low-cost competitors in the PC Cards market and Sierra could not compete successfully in this competitive environment. (Am.Compl.U 37, 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">As discussed previously, corporate executives are not required to adopt a \u201cgloomy, fearful or defeatist view of the future\u201d under the securities laws. <em>Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 174 (internal quotation marks omitted). Even so, they are not permitted to make optimistic statements that they do not \u201cgenuinely or reasonably believe\u201d to be true. <em>In re IBM, </em>163 F.3d at 107. While plaintiffs claim that Sierra could not have reasonably believed in its ability to compete against lower-cost rivals in the PC Cards market, they fail to allege any specific fact that provides support for this assertion. Plaintiffs do offer specific support for their claim that the market for PC Cards was competitive and that Sierra\u2019s cards were priced at the high end of the market (Am.ComplY 42), but the mere fact that the market was competitive does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>suggest that Sierra knew that it could not successfully compete in it. As a result, the claim is conclusory and therefore barred by Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA\u2019s requirement that securities fraud be pled with particularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In addition, plaintiffs consider Cohen-our\u2019s statements on the October 27, 2004 conference call to be actionable on the alternative grounds that these statements were undermined by Sierra\u2019s knowledge that it would not be Verizon\u2019s PC Card supplier for the planned EV-DO network expansion. In support of this assertion, plaintiffs rely on a \u201cformer Sierra Wireless marketing director\u201d who represents that Sierra \u201cknew by the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2004 that Verizon Wireless had rejected Sierra Wireless as a PC Cards supplier for its nationwide EV-DO rollout.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43, 78.) As additional support for this claim, plaintiffs point out that Verizon\u2019s practice \u2014 according to two Novatel officers who dealt with Verizon\u2014 was to inform its suppliers of expected demand at least three months in advance of placing orders. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 43.) According to plaintiffs, this corroborates the marketing director\u2019s assertion that Sierra would have been aware of a decline in demand from Verizon at the beginning of the fourth quarter. <em>(Id.) </em>Thus, plaintiffs have adequately pled that Sierra knew that it would not supply PC Cards for Verizon\u2019s nationwide EV-DO rollout.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">While plaintiffs have adequately pled Sierra\u2019s knowledge that it would not be Verizon\u2019s PC Card supplier for the nationwide rollout, this fact does not make Cohenour\u2019s October 27, 2004 statements false or misleading. At the conference call, Cohenour explained that \u201cVerizon is continuing to expand its network aggressively\u201d and that \u201cSprint is also now planning to deploy\u201d an EV-DO network. <em>(Id. </em>1f 76.) In other words, Cohenour described the adoption and expansion of EV-DO technology by mobile service providers. Next, he observed that Sierra was \u201can early innovator in the EV-DO space\u201d which he believed made Sierra \u201cwell positioned to benefit from this network expansion\u201d and \u201cto win\u201d business despite \u201cexpected competition.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 76-77.) In these remarks, Cohen-our did not claim that Sierra had won or expected to win the contract for Verizon\u2019s EV-DO network roll-out, which would have been false in light of Sierra\u2019s knowledge that it had not won that business. Instead, Cohenour expressed his belief that Sierra was in a position to benefit from the accelerating adoption of EV-DO technology by mobile service providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">While losing the Verizon contract was surely a setback for Sierra, plaintiffs have not alleged facts showing that the loss would have invalidated Sierra\u2019s belief that it was \u201cwell positioned\u201d to benefit from other Verizon EV-DO contracts, Sprint\u2019s EV-DO network or the potential EV-DO business of other companies. It is too far a leap to assume that the failure to win a single contract from a single customer\u2014 even a large and important one such as Verizon \u2014 would completely undermine Sierra\u2019s expectations in an expanding field where it had been an early innovator. <em>See Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 173-74. Having failed to allege facts showing that Sierra\u2019s failure to win the Verizon contract was so serious a loss that it made misleading Sierra\u2019s belief that it was \u201cwell positioned\u201d to compete in the EV-DO market, plaintiffs have failed to plead this claim adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>pursuant to the standards set forth in Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">e. <em>The Voq Professional Phone\u2019s Failure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">With respect to Sierra\u2019s optimistic statements about the prospects of its Voq Professional Phone (\u201cVoq\u201d), plaintiffs contend that these statements are false and misleading because Sierra did not actually believe that it could succeed in the smart-phone market due to (a) stiff competition and (b) the Voq\u2019s defective design. However, these allegations are inadequately pled and therefore cannot survive defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Plaintiffs fail to allege any facts showing that Sierra knew it could not succeed in the smartphone market due to intense competition. As with many of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, this is simply a conclusory allegation that cannot withstand the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA. <em>In re Scholastic, </em>252 F.3d at 72-73 (\u201c[Unsupported general claims\u201d and \u201cbare pleadings\u201d in a securities fraud action cannot survive a motion to dismiss).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">However, plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the Voq presented mechanical problems is supported by the comments of a \u201cformer Sierra Wireless staff engineer who had personal knowledge of Sierra Wireless\u2019 development of the Voq.\u201d (Am. Comply 50.) He claims that Sierra was \u201ca year late\u201d to the smartphone market and \u201cthere were a lot of mechanical problems with it because their design team had never designed a phone before.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Even assuming the truth of these observations, they do not indicate that Sierra\u2019s optimistic statements about the Voq were false or misleading. Sierra did not represent that its design and development of the Voq had been flawless from inception. In fact, it is to be expected that a manufacturer would face some mechanical difficulties when embarking on a new product line, and the staff engineer does not suggest that the Voq\u2019s \u201cmechanical problems\u201d were more substantial than would be expected, or that they were insurmountable, or that Sierra believed that they doomed the product offering. Furthermore, plaintiffs do not allege that Sierra failed to remedy these problems or that the Voq was, in fact, plagued with mechanical problems when it was released. In short, plaintiffs have not alleged that the Voq\u2019s mechanical problems were so severe that they undermined Sierra\u2019s expectations of success. <em>See Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 173-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Moreover, the staff engineer does not state when Sierra first learned of the Voq\u2019s mechanical problems or even if any problems existed when the defendants made the optimistic statements noted above. In order for a statement to be false or misleading, a plaintiff must allege that the speaker was aware of adverse information at the time he spoke. <em>See In re IBM, </em>163 F.3d at 107. Plaintiffs have not pled \u2014 and the staff engineer has not alleged \u2014 that Sierra or Sierra\u2019s officers were aware of Voq\u2019s mechanical problems when they made any of the statements listed above. This lack of temporal specificity further dooms plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Sierra\u2019s optimistic statements about Voq were contradicted by its mechanical problems. <em>Rothman, </em>220 F.3d at 91 (\u201cAlthough the [plaintiffs] do not have to fix the exact date and time that [defendants] became aware that recovering royalty payments through future sales would be unlikely, they must supply some factual basis for the allegation that the defendants had reached this conclusion at some point during the time period alleged.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">In the final analysis, plaintiffs\u2019 complaints about the Voq phone fall within the category of \u201cfraud by hindsight.\u201d Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>tiffs believe that Sierra\u2019s decision to develop the Voq was misguided: it alienated palmOne (Am.Compl^ 32); it embraced a disfavored Microsoft platform <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 34); it was not likely to succeed based on the competitive environment <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 50); and it was outside Sierra\u2019s core competency <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 89). Indeed, Sierra ultimately did abandon the Voq product line in 2005. <em>(Id.) </em>Accepting all of this as true, it is possible that Sierra\u2019s decision to develop the Voq was ill-advised, but bad business decisions are not actionable under the securities laws, <em>see Rothman, </em>220 F.3d at 90 (\u201cGenerally, poor business judgment is not actionable under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.\u201d), and therefore plaintiffs\u2019 claims concerning the Voq phone are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">f. <em>Sierra\u2019s Failure to Introduce a UMTS Product in Early 2005</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claims arising from a series of statements in which Sierra advised the public that it planned to bring a UMTS product to market in early 2005 are premised on the belief that Sierra actually had no plans to do so. (Am.Compl.lffl 38.) In support of this claim, plaintiffs contend that (1) Sierra\u2019s entry in 2005 would have been too late as other UMTS manufacturers had \u201calready established significant shares of the UMTS market\u201d sufficient to block late entrants and (2) Sierra had decided \u201cas early as the beginning of 2004 against developing a UMTS PC Card.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38, 55.) Therefore, from plaintiffs\u2019 perspective, Sierra\u2019s announced plans to bring a UMTS product to market in early 2005 were false or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Plaintiffs do not allege any particular facts showing that Sierra\u2019s planned 2005 entry into the UMTS market would have been blocked by competitors who already dominated the market, nor do they allege that such facts were before Sierra when it announced its plans to launch a UMTS product in the first half of 2005. At most, plaintiffs contend that Sierra must have known \u2014 or was reckless not to have known \u2014 that introducing a UMTS product in 2005 would be futile, but plaintiffs have alleged no facts in support of that contention. Therefore, plaintiffs have failed to plead their claim with sufficient particularity. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b); <em>Novak, </em>216 F.3d at 313-314 (While the PSLRA \u201cdoes not require that plaintiffs plead with particularity every single fact upon which their beliefs concerning false or misleading statements are based,\u201d plaintiffs must \u201cplead with particularity sufficient facts to support those beliefs.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Plaintiffs further rely on the observations of a \u201cformer Sierra Wireless product manager\u201d who claims that Sierra had \u201cdecided as early as the beginning of 2004 against developing a UMTS PC Card.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 38.) Even if this Court were to assume that this product manager was in a position to know Sierra\u2019s plans with respect to UMTS product development, <em>see Novak, </em>216 F.3d at 314 (a confidential source must be \u201cdescribed in the complaint with sufficient particularity to support the probability that a person in the position occupied by the source would possess the information alleged\u201d), his statement that Sierra had no plans to develop a UMTS <em>PC Card </em>does not make Sierra\u2019s announcements of its plans to develop a UMTS <em>product </em>false or misleading. Indeed, in each of the announcements that plaintiffs claim are misleading, Sierra refers only to a \u201cUMTS product,\u201d not a \u201cUMTS PC Card.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 54, 60, 67, 79.)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Looking at the statements in context, it is clear that Sierra consistently distinguished between a UMTS product and a UMTS PC Card. For instance, on an April 19, 2004 conference call, Cohenour responded to a question about the production of a \u201cUMTS card\u201d by correcting the questioner\u2019s assumption. Cohenour explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>that \u201cwe want to stay nimble on what product variant we do first. And, product variance, you can guess what they may be. They may be PC cards. They may be embedded modules. It might be VOQ. So, we\u2019re staying nimble on that.\u201d (Declaration of Jaculin Aaron (\u201cAaron Decl.\u201d), Ex. R: Sierra\u2019s Q1 2004 Earnings Conference Call at 9.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Similarly, on an October 27, 2004 conference call, Sutcliffe clarified that \u201cSierra had not been specific, that the first product, or any particular product in the UMTS category will be a PC Card.\u201d (Aaron Decl., Ex. T: Sierra\u2019s Q3 2004 Earnings Conference Call at 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\">Based on this well-maintained distinction between a generalized UMTS <em>product </em>on one hand, and a specifically UMTS PC <em>Card </em>on the other, no reasonable investor would have believed that Sierra\u2019s announced plans to bring one of the possible UMTS products to market in early 2005 necessarily entailed the introduction of a UMTS PC Card. Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that Sierra had no plans to launch a UMTS PC Card in 2005 does not make the company\u2019s statements concerning its UMTS product plans false or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">In addition, Sierra\u2019s UMTS announcements are protected by the PSLRA\u2019s \u201csafe harbor\u201d because each was \u201cidentified as a forward-looking statement, and ... accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(c)(l)(A)(i). To determine whether cautionary language is meaningful, courts undertake a two step process: \u201cFirst, they identify the allegedly undisclosed risk\u201d and then \u201cread the allegedly fraudulent materials \u2014 including the cautionary language \u2014 to determine if a reasonable investor could have been misled into thinking that the risk that materialized and resulted in his loss did not actually exist.\u201d <em>Halperin v. eBanker USA.com, </em>295 F.3d 352, 359 (2d Cir.2002) (discussing analysis in context of analogous \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine). If the court determines that \u201cno reasonable investor could have been misled about the nature of the risk when he invested\u201d then the \u201ccomplaint fails to state a claim of securities fraud\u201d and must be dismissed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Here, the allegedly undisclosed risk was that Sierra would not introduce a UMTS product in the first half of 2005 despite having announced its plans to do so. A reasonable investor would have been on notice that that this risk existed based on the cautionary statements accompanying each of Sierra\u2019s announcements concerning UMTS. On the January 28, 2004 conference call, Cohenour observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">[F]rom a UMTS network launch standpoint, as you have mentioned, we have seen some noise, in particular out of Europe, a little bit out of AT &amp; T. Over the course of 2004 we expect to see limited commercial service launches by carriers \u2014 both in Europe and in North America. We are watching that very closely; we do indeed have a plan to bring a UMTS product to market. But I wouldn\u2019t expect to see that until early 2005 and that\u2019s when we believe the networks will be deployed in critical mass and there will actually be a significant user base and opportunity to sell the products through.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>(Aaron Decl., Ex. Q: Sierra\u2019s Q4 2003 Earnings Conference Call at 7.) Based on these comments, a reasonable investor would have been aware that Sierra\u2019s UMTS plans were contingent on Sierra projections of when a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of networks and a \u201csignificant user base\u201d would arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">On Sierra\u2019s next quarterly conference call \u2014 held on April 19, 2004 \u2014 Cohenour explained that Sierra had not yet selected a \u201cform factor\u201d (or a product format) for the UMTS technology, noting that the company wanted to \u201cstay[] nimble on that.\u201d <em>(IcL, </em>Ex. R: Sierra\u2019s Q1 2004 Earnings Conference Call at 9.) He then expressed Sierra\u2019s \u201cexpectation that] the first product variant will be launched in the first half of 2005.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Also on that call, Sut-cliffe responded to a question about the timing of a UMTS product launch by saying that the company was \u201cnot planning to indicate any changes to market introduction timing ... [for] the UMTS product family, which ... we\u2019re going to start introducing in the first half of '05. And I don\u2019t think we want to suggest that we\u2019re going to change those timeframes at this point.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 8.) Taken together, these statements indicate: (1) Sierra\u2019s planned launch of a UMTS product was at such an early stage that the company had not yet selected a product format and (2) changes to the product launch timeframe may be necessary, even though Sierra felt no need to alter it \u201cat this point.\u201d A reasonable investor could not have read these statements to foreclose the risk that subsequent events could compel Sierra to alter its product launch timeline such that no UMTS product would be introduced in the first half of 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Similarly on the July 21, 2004 conference call covering Sierra\u2019s second quarter performance, Cohenour reiterated that Sierra had not \u201cspecified what product form factor will hit the market first. But we do anticipate that our first UMTS product will hit the market in the first half of 05.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>Ex. S: Sierra\u2019s Q2 2004 Conference Call at 7.) Sutcliffe later explained that Sierra did not plan to rush into the UMTS market because Sierra \u201cwould prefer to enter the market with a product that has significant differentiation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 11.) These statements indicate that Sierra\u2019s deliberations on how to enter the UMTS market were on-going and that the important decisions \u2014 including the selection of a product form factor and how to adequately differentiate the product offering \u2014 remained unresolved. With those circumstances in mind, Sierra predicted an early 2005 launch date. In light of the stated contingencies, however, no reasonable investor would take that prediction as a guarantee against the risk that a UMTS product would not come to market.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Finally, during the third quarter conference call held on October 27, 2004, Cohen-our responded to a question on the timing of a UMTS product launch by reiterating Sierra\u2019s prior guidance that a UMTS product was expected to come to market during the first half of 2005. He then elaborated that Sierra had laid out \u201ca product road map for which \u2014 which form factors we\u2019ll come to market with first, and that\u2019s something from a product \u2014 from a commercial announcement point of view we\u2019re just not ready to do yet.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>Ex. T: Sierra\u2019s Q3 2004 Conference Call at 9.) As with the statements discussed above, these comments would put a reasonable investor on notice that Sierra\u2019s plans to launch a UMTS product in 2005 were contingent on other factors, thus creating a risk that the product would not be launched as planned.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Because each forward-looking UMTS statement cited by plaintiffs as false or misleading was accompanied by meaningful cautionary language, the statements are considered immaterial under the PSLRA safe harbor. <em>See In re Gilat Sat</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>ellite Networks, Ltd., </em>No.02-ev-1510, 2005 WL 2277476, at *12, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41996, at *35 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 19, 2005) (\u201cOnce a court determines that a forward-looking statement is accompanied by cautionary language sufficiently meaningful as to render it incapable of being reasonably relied upon, it is immaterial as a matter of law\u201d under the PSLRA.); <em>see also Halperin, </em>295 F.3d at 357. Therefore, these statements are not actionable under the securities laws, and plaintiffs\u2019 claims arising from them are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">C. <em>Section 20(a) Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"AlR\">In addition to their section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims, plaintiffs also assert control person liability against the Sierra Officers \u2014 Sutcliffe, McLennan, and Cohenour \u2014 pursuant to section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Section 20(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqT\">Every person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable under any provision of this title or of any rule or regulation thereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such controlled person to any person to whom such controlled person is liable, unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a). In order to establish control person liability, a plaintiff \u201cmust show a primary violation by the controlled person and control of the primary violator by the targeted defendant.\u201d <em>SEC v. First Jersey Sec., Inc., </em>101 F.3d 1450, 1472 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">As discussed above, plaintiffs have not adequately alleged that the \u201ccontrolled person\u201d \u2014 in this case Sierra \u2014 has violated the Exchange Act. Thus, plaintiffs cannot state a claim for control person liability against the Sierra Officers and therefore plaintiffs\u2019 claims brought pursuant to section 20(a) of the Exchange Act are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">D. <em>Compliance with Rule 11(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Pursuant to its statutory obligation, this Court finds that the parties and counsel in this matter have complied with Rule 11(b). <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(c)(l); <em>Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 178 (\u201cThe PSLRA mandates that, at the end of any private securities action, the district court must \u2018include in the record specific findings regarding compliance by each party and each attorney representing any party with each requirement of Rule 11(b).\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(c)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">Because plaintiffs have not pled their securities fraud claims with the requisite level of particularity, they have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Therefore, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is granted without prejudice. If plaintiffs intend to submit a second amended complaint, they shall do so within 21 days of the entry of this Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-5\">.
