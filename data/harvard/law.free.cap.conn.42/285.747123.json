Guthrie, during their lives, and that the said Elisha Wheeler and his heirs have no right to or interest in said estate, or any part of it, except as trustee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>and that after the termination of the life estates named in said will, and the fulfillment of the trusts therein specified, the fee of said property reverts to the petitioners, the sole legal heirs of, said William Guthrie.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-5\">That the said Elisha Wheeler claims that, under the provisions of said will, he is the sole legal owner of the fee of all of said estate, after the termination of the lives of the said Polly Ann Guthrie, Albert' Guthrie, and John B. Guthrie, and that ho is now the legal owner and holder of all of said estate of every name and kind, charged only with the payment of the rents, profits and income of said estates during the lives of the said Polly Ann, Albert, and John B. Guthrie, and that he has full right and power to sell all of said property subject to said trusts; and that he threatens to make such sale of such estate subject only to said life estates; that the sale of such estate, by said Wheeler, subject to said life estates, would greatly injure your petitioners, and jeopardize their said inheritance and reversionary right in said property, and that the claim of the said Wheeler to be the owner of all said property, subject only to said life estates, depreciates in value said inheritance and reversionary interest, and prevents the petitioners from selling and disposing of their said reversionary interest, or pledging the same, or in any manner realizing the true and just value of said inheritance; and that the petitioners are in danger of being compelled to expend large sums of money to recover said property after the termination of said life estates, and that they are without adequate remedy at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-6\">Your petitioners therefore pray the court to order and decree that the said Elisha Wheeler shall be enjoined from claiming and holding himself out to the world as the owner in fee of said estate, after the termination of said life estates, and from selling, or offering to sell and dispose of said estate and fee subject to said life estates, or in any other manner to dispose of or convey said estate or any interest therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-7\">The respondent demurred to the petition, and the case was reserved, upon the demurrer, for the advice of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>H. B. Harrison </em>and <em>H. B. </em>Munson, in support of tlio demurrer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-5\">I. The testator was undertaking to dispose of <em>all </em>his estate, finally and absolutely. Courts will not construe a will in such a way as to leave part of the estate intestate, unless such a construction is \u201c absolutely forced upon them.\u201d 2 Redf. on Wills, 442.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-6\">2. The petitioners claim that the will, by its implication, gives the whole estate, substantially, to them, as heirs at law. If the testator had intended such a gift the will would have said so. On the contrary it does not mention the name of Ebenezer Guthrie, and states specifically what it gives to Albert and John. If the testator had intended to give more to the last two he would not have stopped there.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-7\">3. They claim also that the will gives nothing to the respondent. But the testator in his will says that, \u201c subject to \u201d certain specified trusts, he gives \u201c all \u201d his estate, \u201c real, personal and mixed,\u201d to Elisha Wheeler, \u201c absolutely and in-fee simple.\u201d Plainer and stronger words could not be used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-8\">4. The devise to Wheeler is not in terms, and therefore not in meaning, a devise to him simply \u201c as trustee.\u201d Neither is it, in terms or in meaning, a devise to him simply \u201c upon \u201d certain trusts. It is in terms and meaning a devise to him personally\u2014by his name only, without any addition indicating that he takes in any special capacity. And it is a devise to him, in terms and in meaning, of \u201c all \u201d the estate, \u201c absolutely and in fee simple,\u201d \u201c <em>subject to </em>\u201d (that is, charged with) certain specified and strictly limited trusts. The words \u201c subject to \u201d are familiar and well understood. They have their peculiar shade of meaning. No other word can be substituted for them. The testator must be presumed to have known and felt their special significance. He selected them in preference to the word \u201c upon; \u201d and they must therefore bo interpreted in that precise sense in which their meaning <em>differs </em>from the meaning of tl*e word \u201cupon.\u201d The precise distinction which exists in meaning and legal effect between the words \u201c subject to \u201d and the word \u201c upon \u201d in cases like this, has been repeatedly pointed out and insisted upon by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>courts and commentators, and the words \u201c subject to \u201d have uniformly received in such cases the construction which we put upon them. 1 Jarman on Wills, (2d Am. ed.,) 457, 460, 462; 1 Hill on Trustees, 118,120; Tiff. <em>&amp; </em>Bui. on Trustees, 94; <em>King </em>v. <em>Denison, </em>1 Ves. <em>&amp; </em>B., 260; <em>Southouse </em>v. <em>Bate, </em>2 id., 396; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>1 Keen, 42; <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>13 Sim., 496; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>2 Mylne <em>&amp; </em>Cr., 684; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>53 Barb., 607; <em>Healey </em>v. <em>Toppan, </em>45 N.

Beach </em>and <em>Watrous, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-6\">The testator left no children, and no heirs at law but his three brothers, the petitioners. The respondent is not an heir, nor in any way related to the testator, and the case discloses no reason why the testator should desire to disinherit his blood relations in favor of this stranger. Under - these circumstances the law <em>inclines </em>to favor the heirs as against a stranger, if, in view of the language used, this can. be done. That they <em>may be </em>cut off is conceded; that they/ would be is unnatural, and therefore that they have been is. improbable <em>a priori. </em>The respondent claims that under, the; language of the will, all the estate not exhausted by the express <em>trusts </em>belongs to him. . Our claim, on the contrary;, is that he holds this undisposed-of portion of the estate as a-. resulting <em>trust </em>for the heirs at law. The question then is,, has the testator clearly indicated in this will, that the respon- - dent should have, as his own, the residue, which, is the great bulk of the estate, instead of his own brothers and their-\u2022children ? Perry on Trusts, \u00a7 \u00b0151; <em>Melvin </em>v. <em>Halloway, </em>2 Houst., 527; <em>Kellett </em>v. <em>Kellett, </em>3 Dow, 248; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>2 Brown Ch. R., 589, 595; <em>Hobart </em>v. <em>Countess of Suffolk, </em>2 Vern., 644.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-7\">1. It is to be observed that the will, is not drawn by ai, skilled hand. Probably no lawyer would begin a will as this is begun, or put the disposal of a part of the estate into-the item which provides for the payment of debts, or use-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>\u201c demise \u201d for \u201c devise,\u201d or use either in disposing of <em>personal </em>estate, or say \u201c subject to the following trusts,\u201d instead of \u201c upon the following trusts,\u201d if we are right in our construction, or \u201c subject to the following charges or payments,\u201d if we are not. Nor would one experienced in drawing wills designate the clause relieving the executors from bonds as if one of the <em>trusts </em>of the will. The court can see under the claim he now makes, that the respondent had a large interest in the drawing ot it, and can see also that he knew about it when it was drawn, for the second clause would not be likely to be there without his knowledge that it was to be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-5\">2. If the respondent was to be the owner of all this large estate, subject only to the express trusts named in it, why was lie <em>\u201cauthorized\u201d </em>to pay out of it the expense of certain suits by the second clause ? If the estate was his, no such authorization was needed. He could pay those expenses, of course, out o\u00ed the estate, if he chose to, or out of his private estate. It would be immaterial to him and to the testator which. If the whole estate was, however, <em>trust </em>estate, then if he was to prosecute suits without the consent of his \u2022co-executor, and the beneficiaries, or heirs at law, it might be .important -for his protection to have this authority expressly ;given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-6\">3. If this estate was all given to the respondent, subject \u25a0merely to certain specific charges or payments, why was Clark made co-executor ? Not surely to see that the beneficiaries under the trust clauses got their estates, for an executor has nothing to do with that; nor to look after the collection of claims, or the payment of debts. The respondent, upon his own theory, had a deeper interest to look after both these than anybody else could have. If he were alone trustee and executor, or if he and Clark were both trustees and executors, the claim that the trustees took a beneficial interest in this \u25a0 estate would be much stronger both in reason and upon .authority. <em>Dawson </em>v. Clarice, 18 Ves., 247.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-7\">4. But w.e deny that the claim, \u201c subject to the following 'trusts,\u201d .merely .creates a charge upon this estate, as the first clause in regard to payment of debts does, and as, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>perhaps, the second in regard to expense of litigation does. This clause means the same as if it read \u201c upon the following trusts,\u201d \u201c in trust as follows,\u201d \u201c for the following trusts,\u201d \u201c for the following purposes,\u201d \u201c subject to the following disposition thereof,\u201d \u201cin trust as follows,\u201d\u2014with any one of which forms of expression the trustee would not take a beneficial interest in the estate, but would hold it as a resulting trust for the heirs at law. This large estate can not be diverted from its natural channel upon any such technical ground as an assumed difference between the meaning of the clause \u201c subject to \u201d and the preposition \u201c upon.\u201d Perry on Trusts, \u00a7\u00a7 152,158,155 ; Tiff. <em>&amp; </em>Bullard on Trusts, 24, 26, 28,42,44, 99; Adams\u2019 Equity, 32; 2 Story Eq.

The plaintiffs fail to show any such interest in the subject matter as entitles them to the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The intent of the testator, as gathered from the will itself, the only legitimate mode of ascertaining it, is sufficiently clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">He gives his wearing apparel to be equally divided between Albert Guthrie and John B. Guthrie. He gives all his household furniture and housekeeping articles to his wife, Polly Ann Guthrie. He then says:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u201c I give, demise, and bequeath, all of my estate, both real and personal and mixed, excepting the said legacy to my said wife, hereinbefore named, to Elisha Wheeler, of Southbury, in said New Haven County, absolutely, and in fee simple, subject to the following trusts, viz.: <em>First. </em>The said Elisha Wheeler shall pay to my wife, Polly Ann Guthrie, annually, the entire rents and profits of the said entire estate which may remain after said debts and charges have been paid, so long as she lives, or to occupy and improve said entire estate during her natural life. <em>Second. </em>At and after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>decease of my said wife, then I direct the said Elisha Wheeler to pay to my brother, Albert Guthrie, the one half of the rents and profits of my said estate, annually, during his life, and likewise to pay the- other half of said rents and profits to my brother, John B. Guthrie, annually, during his life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">This is certainly very plain and explicit language. It not only does not require, but does not admit of construction. An estate is given to Elisha Wheeler, \u201c absolutely and in fee simple, subject to the following trusts, viz.\u201d [The trusts are then specified]. Now if we hold that Elisha Wheeler takes an estate less than a fee, or a fee encumbered with trusts or conditions in addition to those imposed by the testator, we make a new will. Elisha Wheeler is said to be a stranger in blood, and these plaintiffs are the heirs at law. It may be more wise and more just that they, rather than he, should possess this estate, and it may not be. To the testator the law gave the power of determining that question, and he has determined it. We have no power, if we had the inclination, which we-have not, to revise or change that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">The Supei\u2019ior Court' is advised to dismiss the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred; except Phelps, J., who did not sit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
