And that on said 4th day of January, the defendant, without the license or knowledge of the plaintiffs or any of them, took forcible possession of the dwelling house, effecting an entrance by breaking in the front door with an axe, and shortly after, on the same day, placed therein a certain German family, one of whose members was sick with the small pox; and that the family continued in the occupancy of the house until the 19th day of Eebruary following, when it was destroyed by fire. How the fire originated was not disclosed by the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-5\">The defendant did not deny that he broke and entered the house, as claimed by the plaintiffs, but offered evidence to prove that at the time a member of the family in question, which was then in the occupancy of a tenement house belonging to the defendant, upon the factory grounds of the Niantic Woolen Company, and in a comparatively thickly settled neighborhood, was sick with the small pox, and that there was danger that the disease would spread if the person thus affected should be permitted to remain where she then was, and that he entered and took possession of the plaintiffs\u2019 house for the purpose of placing the family therein, and for no other purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-6\">The defendant further offered evidence to prove, that he acted under the direction of one Richard W. Lee, a selectman of the town of East Lyme, and who was also president of the board of health of the town. He also offered evidence to prove that the destruction of the building by fire was not owing to any acts or neglect of his own, or of the family so by him placed in the house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-7\">The house was situated on the main road to New London, and from half to three-quarters \u2022 of a mile from the house from which the family were removed. It was distant from fifty to sixty rods from any other dwelling house, and about thirty-nine feet from the nearest track of the road, from which it was separated by a fence. There was no hospital in the town at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The defendant requested the court to charge the jury that if they should find that the removal of the family from the dwelling house which they were occupying to the house of the plaintiffs, was necessary to prevent the spread of the small pox; or, if the removal was made in pursuance of an order of the board of health, or of a health officer of the town of East Lyme, for the purpose of preventing the spread of the disease, the verdict should be in his favor, unless the jury should further find that the house was destroyed by his act or neglect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\">The court charged the jury that the acts of the defendant were a trespass, for which he was liable in damages to the plaintiffs to the extent they had suffered by reason of such acts, unless he was justified on one or other of the grounds set up in his plea and notice. As to the first portion of the defendant\u2019s request, the court charged them that the defendant had no individual right, without the license or permission of the plaintiffs, to enter and take possession of their house and to place the family therein, even though the jury should find, that to prevent the spread of the small pox such removal of the family was necessary. As to the second portion of the request, the court charged substantially as requested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-6\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for the sum of $480 damages and their costs; and the defendant moved for a new trial for error in the charge of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-7\">Hovey, in support of the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-8\">1. It is a well settled principle of the common law, recognized by the best elementary law writers and by uniform adjudications in the courts, that in cases of actual necessity, any individual may take, use or destroy private property, to prevent the spreading of a fire, the ravages of a pestilence, or any other great public calamity, without subjecting himself to personal responsibility. 2 Kent Comm., 838 ; Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 1; 2 Dillon Municip.

They may also order any person or family justly suspected or feared to have taken the infection of such disease, into confinement in a hospital, if there be one in the town to which they belong, or in some other place to be designated by them, there to remain as long as they shall! judge necessary to insure the safety of the town from such* infection. The statutes conferring these powers are, however, only regulations of the common law right which individuals possess in cases of actual necessity, to do whatever \u25a0 is necessary -to prevent the ravages of a pestilence or other-great public calamity. They constitute boards of health, health officers and health committees, agents to judge of the \u25a0 emergency and direct the performance of acts which any-individual may do at his peril without any statute at all. 2 Dillon Municip. Corp., \u00a7 757; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp;c. of N. York, 2 </em>Denio, 461, 479; <em>Wynehamer </em>v. <em>The People, </em>13 N.

The constitutional provision that \u201c the property-of 'no \u25a0 person shall be taken for public use without just compensation therefor,\u201d' does not entitle the plaintiffs to maintain.this, action against the defendant, or in any manner affect the rights of either of the parties. The removal of the -family-infected with the small pox into the house of\u2019 the plaintiffs having been necessary to prevent the spreading of that disease, was not the taking of private property,-for public, use within the meaning of that provision; but if it was, the. plaintiffs must look to the public for compensation, as the act. of the defendant in making the removal was a lawful,act.and'. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>subjected him to no personal liability in trespass or otherwise.

York, </em>2 Denio, 472, 484.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b162-5\"><em>Sheffield </em>and <em>Chadwick, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b162-6\">Phelps, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADd\">The defendant, claiming to be acting by authority of the board of health of the town of East Lyme, took forcible possession of' an unoccupied dwelling house belonging to the plaintiffs and placed in it a family infected with small-pox, and while it was so occupied it took fire and was destroyed. On a trial to the jury, the defendant claimed, and requested the court to charge, that if they should find that the removal of the family so infected into the plaintiffs\u2019 house was necessary to prevent the spread of \u2019 the disease, it would be justifiable, though done 'without the license or permission of the plaintiffs, and without authority from the board of health. The court did not comply with the defendant\u2019s request, but instructed the jury that unless the defendant acted by authority of the board of health or of some committee, officer or agent authorized by the board, \u2019he could not without the plaintiffs\u2019 permission take possession of their house.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">We think the instruction given was clearly correct. The statute has made all reasonable and practicable provision to prevent the spreading of such diseases, consistent with the right of domicil and property. It would be indeed extraordinary and hardly to be endured if the principle claimed 'by the defendant should be sanctioned by this court. The arbitrary selection by a private individual of the dwelling of another citizen to be used for the purposes of a pest-house .might generally be as wisely exercised as possible, but it would be liable to the greatest abuse, and might in some instances be made to gratify personal prejudice and ill feeling. The building selected might not always be, as in the present case, unoccupied, and of comparatively little value, .and the danger from the principle contended for would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>greater than that arising, under proper sanitary regulations, from the existence of the disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">We do not advise a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
