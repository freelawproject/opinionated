The defendant moved in arrest of judgment for the following reason: \u201c That said indictment doth not allege any time or place, when or where the mortal blow was struck, which is in said indictment charged to have been struck by said defendant, and that the same is a material allegation in said indictment.\u201d But the court overruled the motion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b233-5\"><em>D. </em>Foster, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFV\">cited Cro.
