An issue had been joined upon the question of the sanity and capacity of the testator to make a will, and the case was opened to the jury; but subsequently the appellant waived all exception to the sanity and capacity of the testator, and relied only upon the ground that the will had not been duly executed according to the requirements of law. This being a question solely for the court, the jury were discharged from its further consideration, and I proposed, at the request of both parties, to report the evidence from which the whole court will decide whether the will was duly executed and ought to be admitted to probate or not, and enter a decree accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-10\">\u201c Joshua Buck was an old man, and lived at Chatham; the will purported to bear date the fifth day of January, 1848, and to be attested by John Kenrick, Joseph Buck and Seth Bearse. It appears by the deposition of Tabitha Buck, the widow of the deceased, that the will was written by John Kenrick, Esq., the first attesting witness, and that he has since deceased. The executor offered the following evidence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-11\">Joseph Buck, who testified, after looking at the will: That attestation is my handwriting, and he assented to it as his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>will. The will was on the table; he was sitting by the fire in the same room. Mr. Bearse signed directly after me. Mr. Kenrick was there, I cannot say that I saw him sign it. Do not remember of particular conversation with Mr. Buck. I staid some time, should think half an hour, perhaps a little more or less. I had no thought of his being insane, or but what he was as capable of making a will as he ever was. I have long known him, say thirty years. I knew no difference in mind when he signed the will, from what he had been; his bodily health was impaired, as I thought, but not his mind. Nathan Buck came to call me. When I went into the house, Mr. Kenrick was there, the two old folks, Joshua Buck and his wife, and Mr. Bearse, the other witness. After it was signed, Mr. Kenrick said, Shall I take care of this will ? and Mr. Buck said yes. He assented that this was his last will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-5\">On cross-examination, he said: When I went into the room, Mr. Kenrick asked Mr. Buck if these were the men that he wished to attest his will, and, as near as I can now remember, he said yes. Mr. Kenrick then asked me to go and sign the will. I did not see the paper in Mr. Buck\u2019s hands. I did not see any one show it to Mr. Buck and ask him if it was his signature. Did not see him make the mark on the will. Don\u2019t know that he saw the will. Mr. Buck\u2019s distance from the table where the will lay, was about twelve or fifteen feet. Mr. Buck assented. Mr. Kenrick did not ask in so many words, of Mr. Buck, if that was his last will, but, as I understood, he meant that. He told me that Mr. Buck wanted me to sign it as a witness. Think this was in January, 1848. I cannot say that I had been there at any particular time previous. I was there generally three or four times a year, or once in two or three months, but I cannot recollect the time particularly. I had never heard anything about Mr, Buck\u2019s state of mind in regard to sanity, before signing the will. After I went in, I did not see pen put to paper, by anybody, till I put my name as witness (second in the order of signing, Kenrick being the first). On reexamination, he said: the will lay where Mr. Buck could see it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-6\">Seth Bearse testified as follows: This is my name as at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>testing witness. I put it there. I was called to go to Joshua Buck\u2019s. I went in with Joseph Buck. Mr. Kenrick was there. The table was nearly in the middle of the room. Mr. Buck, the testator, was nearly opposite the table, so as to look square on to the table, and three or four feet distant from it. As soon as I went in, Mr. Kenrick asked the old gentleman, \u201c are these the men ? \u201d and he said yes. Then Esquire Kenrick asked us to sign the will, Joshua Buck\u2019s will. Mr. Kenrick said: This is Joshua Buck\u2019s will, and he wants you to sign it as witnesses. He heard what Mr. Kenrick said, and expressed his assent, either by saying \u201c yes,\u201d or by nodding. Cannot say that he did it in words, but I do not say that he did not. I did not see him make the mark or take the paper in his hand. I did not see Mr. Ken-rick sign as a witness. Did not see the paper taken up at all I saw Mr. Joseph Buck, the witness, sign it, and I signed it right after. I do not remember that the attestation clause was read. Am confident the paper was not taken up from the table, till I signed it. Am confident the paper was where the old man could see it. Was there half or three quarters of an hour after the will was signed. I was particular in observing his act and the operations of his mind, in consequence of what I had heard, and I formed the opinion that he was as capable of doing an act requiring a sound mind, as he has been for fifteen or twenty years. I am of the same opinion now. He seemed bright and active as I have seen him before. I had known him more than thirty years. His bodily health was weak and feeble, but he got up and walked across the room whilst I was there.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-4\">On cross-examination, he said: \u201c I went in with Mr. Joseph Buck. I saw Joseph Buck sign the will. The testator, I think, did not change his place, a little distance from the table, till after the business of the will was finished. What Mr. Kenrick said when I first went in, was this. He turned round to the old gentleman and asked, \u201c Are these the men ? \u201d and he assented. He then asked us to put our names to it as witnesses, to which the old gentleman assented. I do recollect that he said the words; This is Joshua Buck\u2019s wiL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>I saw the will at the time, lying on the table. In saying that Joshua Buck assented, I can\u2019t say there was anything more than a nod of the head. I knew it was intended to express his assent. I stood near and saw his expression of countenance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-5\">James Long testified : 1 know the handwriting of Esquire Kenrick.

Mr. Kenrick came in, and he asked him if he could write a will which would stand law, and he said he could, and he then told him to sit down and do it, and when it was written, he told him to keep it and not let anybody have it while he was alive. His health was so that he was up, and about, and he appeared as sensible as he ever had.

He was about ten years older than I. Don\u2019t know anything of his eyesight, more than of other old men. I saw him often up to 1847. Have known him look over a deed and seem to understand it, reading with spectacles. Made a deed for him in 1846 or 1847. In January, 1846, wrote a will \u2014 this is it \u2014 sometimes he wrote his full name, and sometimes made his mark. In December, 1847, he executed this deed.

M. Day, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqZi\">1. The will must be signed by the testator. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>62, \u00a7 6. <em>2. </em>When a mark appears, instead of the testator\u2019s name, the inquiry is more close than in ordinary cases. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Dening, </em>8 Ad. &amp; Ell. 94. 3. The will must be signed by the testator before the attestation of the witnesses. Rev. Sts. c. 62, \u00a7 6. 4. When the testator does not sign the will in the presence of the attesting witnesses, there must be an acknowledgment by the testator that it is his will. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Ves. jr. 11; <em>White </em>v. <em>British Museum, </em>6 Bing. 310; <em>Dewey </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>1 Met. 353, and cases there cited. 5. Although this acknowledgment may be inferred from acts as well as from words, yet the acts must be definite in their character, and must point directly to such acknowledgment; so that if a mere reference is made to a paper in the possession of another person, and not held in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the testator\u2019s custody, or if it is folded up, and there is no pointing to or referring to the signature, and the testator publicly declares and acknowledges such d ocument to be his will, this would not be such acknowledgment as to supersede the necessity of an actual signature in the presence of the witnesses, and would not warrant a jury in finding that the will was duly signed in the presence of the witnesses. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>17 Pick. 375, 379.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-5\">6. It must appear that the testator knew that it was his will which the witnesses attested. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>17 Pick. 379; <em>White </em>v. <em>British Museum, </em>6 Bing. 310; <em>Dewey </em>v.

Sts. <em>c. </em>62, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-6\">The appellant deems the following leading facts proved by the evidence in this case:</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-7\">That the acts of acknowledgment by the testator were very indefinite and inconclusive, and related to a paper produced by another person than the testator, and at no time in the custody of the testator; that there was no pointing to or referring to the signature. That the testator\u2019s mind began to fail him a year before the alleged signing of the will. That the testator\u2019s eyesight was dim, and his health was very much impaired. The will was covered by other papers. There were but two attesting witnesses to the will. And generally, that the evidence in this case does not support the requirements stated in the legal points relied upon by th\u00e9 appellant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-8\"><em>G. Ma/rston, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMt\">1. It is settled that it is not requisite that all the witnesses should be present at the same time. <em>Dewey </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>1 Met. 352. 2. It is settled that if the witnesses are where the testator could see them attest the will, it is attested in his presence. 1 Met. 352.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-9\">3. It is not required that the testator should sign the will in presence of the attesting witnesses. 1 Met. 352. An acknowledgment of his signature is sufficient. And a recognition of the paper as his will, before the witnesses, is sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>to authorize their attestation to it, and to make it a good will. 1 Met. 352; 1 Ves. jr. 11; 1 Ves. &amp; Beames, 362; 6 Bing. 310; 7 Bing. 457; 1 Cr. &amp; Mees. 140; 10 Met. 56; 4 Kent Com. 572. Not what is said, but what is done at the execution, is to be regarded. If the testator acknowledge the paper as his will by acts, it is as effectual as if done in words. 6 Bing. 310; 1 Met. 354; 10 Met. 56. The question here is, whether, upon the evidence in the present case, it may reasonably be inferred that the testator signed his name to the instrument as and for his will, and that he afterwards acknowledged and recognized the paper as his will before the witnesses, either directly or by acts equivalent to an acknowledgment. What is the evidence? John Kenrick, the first subscribing witness, being dead, and his handwriting being proved, it is to be presumed that he would testify to the due execution of the will, as stated in the attestation clause. Even if there were no attestation clause, after the death of a witness or witnesses, \u201c a compliance with the statutory requisition in all its parts, would, it seems, even in the absence of express statement, generally be presumed.\u201d 1 Jarm. on Wills, 118; <em>Hands </em>v. <em>James, </em>Comyns, 531; <em>Croft </em>v. <em>Pawlet, 2 </em>Str. 1109.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-4\">It is to be presumed, from the order of the names, that John Kenrick signed as a witness before Buck and Bearse. It is proved, we say, by John Kenrick\u2019s signature, that the testator had signed the will before Kenrick attested it, and therefore it is proved to have been signed before Buck and Bearse attested it. John Kenrick states, under his handwriting, that the mark, \u201c his mark,\u201d is Joshua Buck\u2019s signature. The testator acknowledged the paper to be his will before all the witnesses, and requested Buck and Bearse to attest it and in so doing, he, in effect, declared that he had signed it as his will, and his signature is, in fact, to be presumed from those acts. The testimony proves clearly an acknowledgment of the paper as his will in presence of Kenrick, Buck, and Bearse, after it had been signed. It can hardly be supposed that the testator, who was by his own active agency procuring the authentication of the instrument by the requisite wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>nesses, would have omitted the first step necessary to its due execution, viz: the signature by himself. 1 Met. 354. The witnesses all concur that the testator was in comfortable health, and of sound mind. It is proved by Mrs. Buck that he was procuring the execution of the will by his own active agency, uninfluenced by any one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-6\">Upon the whole evidence it appears that the will was duly signed by the testator in presence of Kenrick; and being thus signed, he, by his acts, if not by his declarations, sufficiently recognized and acknowledged his own execution of it, to authorize the other two witnesses to attest and subscribe the same as witnesses thereto, in accordance with the provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-7\">The appellee is entitled to full costs if the decree of the court of probate is affirmed. If the decree should not be affirmed, he is entitled to costs of the travel and attendance of all witnesses brought to testify on the issue of sanity, incompetency having been the only reason of appeal filed, and after-wards withdrawn by the appellant. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>121, \u00a7 16; c. 83, \u00a7 47.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b387-8\">Dewey, J.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"A1Z\">All that is requisite to the due execution of a will is the actual signature of the same, written by the testator, or by some one in his presence and by his express direction, and that the will \u201cbe attested and subscribed, in the presence of the testator, by three or more competent witnesses.\u201d Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>62, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">The signature of the testator in this case was, so far as he personally subscribed it, a signature by making a X, but his name was appended to the cross to indicate the intended signature ; and, from the comparison of handwriting, it is quite obvious that it was thus written by John Kenrick, whose name is first borne on the list of attesting witnesses. It is proved that this witness had deceased before the trial; but the death of an attesting witness, or of all the attesting witnesses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>is not to defeat the validity of the will, if, in fact, duly executed. It changes the form of the proof, and allows of the introduction of secondary evidence of the due attestation and execution of the will. Such attestation is then to be shown, as it would be in the case of deeds, by proof of the handwriting of the witness. That being shown, <em>prim\u00e2 </em>facie, it is to be taken to be true, and to have been put there for the purpose stated in connection with the signature. It is to be assumed, as regards that witness, that he duly attested the will in the presence of and at the request of the testator. In considering the sufficiency and weight of the evidence to establish the due and proper execution of this will, the fact of the death of this witness, and the presumptions that arise from proof of his handwriting, are somewhat material. As regards this witness, if nothing appears in other parts of the evidence to control the presumption resulting from proof of his handwriting, it may be taken that, as to his attestation, it was properly made to the signature by the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The question then arises upon the attestation by the two remaining witnesses. Neither of these latter witnesses saw the testator write his name, or actually make his mark, which was the form of the signature. But it has long since been decided that it is not essential that an attesting witness to a will should see the testator sign his name. All that is necessary for him to know from the testator is that the signature of the will is his, or written by his direction, and adopted by him. Hence, if the witness be requested by the testator to sign his name to an instrument as an attesting witness, and the testator declares to the witness that the signature to the will is his, that is abundantly sufficient. But the adjudicated cases go further, and hold that the actual signature by the testator may be made known to the witness in other modes than an express declaration to the witness that the will is his. Any act or declaration that carnes by implication an averment of such fact is equally effectual. Hence it has been repeatedly held that a declaration by the testator to the witness, that the instrument is his will, or even a request by him to the witness to attest his will, or other varied form of expression implying that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>same had been signed by the testator, are either of them quite sufficient. The cases of <em>Ellis </em>v. Smith, 1 Ves. jr. 11; <em>Westbeech </em>v. Kennedy, 1 Ves. &amp; Beam. 362; <em>Hall </em>v. Hall, 17 Pick. 373; <em>Dewey </em>v. Dewey, 1 Met. 349; and <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Grosvenor, </em>10 Met. 56, fully sustain these positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The testimony reported for our consideration in the case, taken together, establishes clearly the fact that the testator, Joshua Buck, intended to execute a will, and did in fact execute some instrument supposed by him to be a will. He requested Mr. Kenrick to write a will; \u201c to write one that would stand.\u201d He knew two persons were called in to witness his will, in addition to Kenrick. This fact was brought distinctly before his mind,* and he assented to these persons as the witnesses he wished for that purpose. He saw these persons write their names to some paper. The request to these witnesses to attest his will was quite enough to authorize the inference that he had executed a paper as a will, and was equivalent to his acknowledgment that he had signed some paper as a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The only objection to the sufficiency of this evidence is, that possibly there may be some uncertainty whether the instrument to which these two persons appended their names was the paper to which the testator referred when he spoke of his will, or assented to Mr. Kenrick\u2019s statement in his behalf, to the witnesses, as to his executing the will. It is true that in the present ease, the paper to which the testator referred was not at the moment in his own hands, as it was in some of the cases cited. It is necessary that it be reasonably established by the evidence that this instrument is the same as the one referred to by the testator as his will. This paper was on the table; the testator was near by, within three or four feet, as one of the witnesses says, another placing him more remote. The paper now offered for probate is the paper written by Kenrick, and attested by him as is shown by the proof of the handwriting of Kenrick. If any fraud has been practised as to the substitution of any other paper, it must have been by the agency of Kenrick. There is nothing in the case to authorize any such charge of fraud, and certainly fraud is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>not to be presumed. In our opinion, it may be safely assumed that this is the instrument referred to, by the testator; and if so, the evidence is clearly sufficient to authorize the inference that he acknowledged the signature of the will to be his by his acts, though he did not expressly so state.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The court have not overlooked the circumstance that the form of signing this will by the testator was the making of a mark, and the name appended was written by Kenrick, the witness. Such form of signature is a perfectly legal one. It might in some cases furnish greater facility for fraudulent substitution of a false paper; but in the present case there is nothing to countenance any such supposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The court are of opinion that the decree of the judge of probate, allowing and admitting to probate this will, be affirmed, with costs in this court for the appellee.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\"> This and the four following cases were argued and decided at the October term, 1852, at Taunton, at which were present the Chief Justice, and Dewey, Metcalf, Bigelow, and Cushing, JJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
