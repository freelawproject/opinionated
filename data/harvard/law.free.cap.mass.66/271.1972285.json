Crawford.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b317-6\">Since <em>St. </em>1839, c. 161, no appeal lies to this court from the judgment of the court of common pleas upon a motion in arrest of judgment in a criminal case; but the remedy is by a bill of exceptions.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-7\">The defendant, being convicted by a justice of the peace, upon a complaint, containing two counts, for illegal sales of liquors, on the 4th of December, 1851, to be used in his house, contrary to Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>47, \u00a7 2, and sentenced to pay a fine of twenty dollars and costs, appealed to the court of common pleas. After judgment by default in that court, he filed a motion in arrest of judgment, because the complaint did not allege in the first count that the quantity sold was less than twenty-eight gallons, and in the second count, did not aver a sale of spirituous liquor, but only of \u201c intoxicating \u201d liquor. After the motion was filed, the district attorney entered a <em>nol. pros. </em>as to the second count, and the motion in arrest was overruled. The defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-8\"><em>A. V. Lynde, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFJ\">1. The judgment by default was upon both counts, and was erroneous, and after judgment, one count could not be <em>nol. pros, </em>or the judgment changed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuck, </em>20 Pick. 356; Common<em>wealth </em>v. <em>Stedmcm, </em>12 Met. 444.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-9\">2. There is no offence in a sale of spirituous liquors, as there is no statute against such sale, but only against a sale of intoxicating liquors. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>47, \u00a7\u00a7 1,2,3, as amended by <em>St. </em>1850, <em>c. </em>232, striking out the word spirituous, and inserting the word intoxicating. 2 Hale P. C. 170; Common<em>wealth </em>v. <em>Tuck, </em>20 Pick. 362.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>J. H. </em>Clifford, (attorney-general,) for the commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b318-5\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Aid2\">1. We are inclined to believe that it is not, necessary to allege the quantity sold to be less than twenty-eight gallons. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>12 Met. 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">2. The magistrate\u2019s jurisdiction, extending to twenty dollars, his judgment could be well maintained on the first count, even if the second count was bad; but intoxicating liquors includes spirituous liquors and something more. Spirituous liquor is intoxicating, and the complaint is the same as if it alleged a sale of \u201c rum,\u201d \u201c brandy,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">3. But this appeal was not rightly taken, and allowed. It should have come up upon exceptions. <em>St. </em>1839, <em>c. </em>161. The appeal must, therefore, be dismissed, without absolutely deciding the points of law presented, and the case remitted to the court of common pleas for their consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\n<em>Case remitted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
