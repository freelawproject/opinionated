United States, </em>815 F.2d 879, 881 (2d Cir.1987) (internal citations omitted). A challenge to a conviction based on a statute of limitations does not fall under this exception. <em>See United States v. Doyle, </em>348 F.2d 715, 718 (2d Cir.1965); <em>United States v. Hansel, </em>70 F.3d 6, 7 (2d Cir.1995) (per curiam). Because Londono-Jimenez pleaded guilty, he is precluded from raising this issue on appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
