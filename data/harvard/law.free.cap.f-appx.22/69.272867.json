Siragusa, <em>Judge) </em>dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. Johnson filed the complaint <em>pro se </em>against New York State, the Monroe County Child Support Enforcement Unit, and the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, alleging deprivation of several constitutional rights. By order entered in January 2001, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Johnson\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), and barred Johnson from filing any future actions in the district court without first obtaining the court\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-21\">Judgment was entered on January 8, 2001. Johnson filed a timely notice of appeal on January 16, 2001. For an unexplained reason, this notice of appeal was docketed in this Court under two separate docket numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-22\">On October 10, 2001, this Court, by order entered under Docket No. 01-7073, affirmed the district court judgment insofar as it dismissed Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims, and vacated the judgment and remanded the case on the issue of whether the sanctions imposed against Johnson were proper. Because this Court has al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>ready addressed the merits of Johnson\u2019s present appeal under Docket No. 01-7073, the appeal docketed under 01-7071 is dismissed as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
