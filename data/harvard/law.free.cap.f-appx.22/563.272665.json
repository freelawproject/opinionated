This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Seeking monetary, declaratory, and in-junctive relief, Richard filed a complaint against the Michigan Department of Corrections (\u201cMDOC\u201d); Reynolds, Hadley, and Neve, correctional officers employed by the MDOC at the Pine River Correctional Facility (\u201cPRCF\u201d), where Richard is incarcerated; the Inmate Benefit Fund, or prison store, at PRCF; and Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation. Richard alleged that the defendants are responsible for his addiction to cigarettes and that, as a result of his addiction, he has received misconduct tickets for smoking in his cell. Richard also alleged that Brown <em>&amp; </em>Williamson should have warned him that violation of the MDOC\u2019s smoking policy could result in misconduct tickets, the punishment for which could be \u201ctop lock (segregation).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The district court dismissed Richard\u2019s complaint as frivolous. Richard has filed a timely appeal. He requests oral argument. Richard has also filed a motion for imposition of sanctions, for entry of default, partial default and/or imposition of sanctions, and to supplement the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">We review de novo a judgment dismissing a suit as frivolous under \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2) and 1915A(b). <em>Brown v. Bargery, </em>207 F.3d 863, 866 (6th Cir.2000). A complaint \u201cis frivolous where it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Richard\u2019s complaint, as it lacks an arguable basis in law. <em>See id.; Brown, </em>207 F.3d at 866. First, Richard\u2019s claims against the MDOC and the Inmate Benefit Fund are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 66, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989); <em>Alabama v. Pugh, </em>438 U.S. 781, 782, 98 S.Ct. 3057, 57 L.Ed.2d 1114 (1978); <em>Abick v. Michigan, </em>803 F.2d 874, 876-77 (6th Cir.1986). Second, Richard failed to assert a \u00a7 1983 claim against Reynolds, Hadley, and Neve because he did not allege that they deprived him of a right secured by the federal constitution or laws of the United States. <em>See Flagg Bros. v. Brooks, </em>436 U.S. 149, 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 1729, 56 L.Ed.2d 185 (1978); <em>Mays v. Dayton, </em>134 F.3d 809, 813 (6th Cir.1998). Third, Brown &amp; Williamson is not a state actor for purposes of \u00a7 1983. Although private entities who act in concert with a state actor may be subject to suit under \u00a7 1983, <em>Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 27-28, 101 S.Ct. 183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980), Brown &amp; Williamson\u2019s actions in supplying cigarettes to MDOC prison stores for sale to the inmate population are not such a sufficiently close connection with the state as to render Brown &amp; Williamson a state actor for purposes of \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">Accordingly, the request for oral argument and all pending motions are denied and the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
