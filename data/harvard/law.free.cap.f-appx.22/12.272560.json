The court has accorded the arguments full consideration and has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for a published opinion. See D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">ORDERED that the Commission\u2019s November 15, 2000 decision in <em>Channel 32 Hispanic Broadcasters, Ltd., </em>15 F.C.C.R. 22,649 (2000) (Order), be affirmed. The Order granted three parties\u2019 petitions to deny the application of Channel 32 Hispanic Broadcasters, Ltd. (Channel 32) for a construction permit to build a new television station in Pueblo, Colorado. Channel 32 contends that the Order is inconsistent with 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(Z), which provides \u201c[w]ith respect to competing applications for ... construction permits for ... television stations that were filed with the Commission before July 1, 1997\u201d that the Commission shall \u201chave the authority to conduct a competitive bidding proceeding,\u201d \u00a7 309(Z )(1); \u201ctreat the persons filing such applications as the only persons eligible to be qualified bidders\u201d in a competitive bidding proceeding, \u00a7 309(Z )(2); and \u201cwaive any provisions of its regulations necessary to permit such persons to enter [a settlement] agreement\u201d to remove any conflict between their applications, \u00a7 309(Z )(3). Channel 32 claims that it and another company, the Word of God Fellowship, Inc. (Word), were competing applicants that had both filed before July 1, 1997. Channel 32 argues that because it and Word entered a settlement agreement, the Commission may not accept competing applications and bids for the Pueblo station. In response, the Commission asserts that we lack jurisdiction to review the petition for review because the Order \u201cis not a final order resolving the issue of the award of the license.\u201d Br. of Appellee at 16. We disagree; the Order <em>does </em>finally resolve the question whether Channel 32 will be subjected to competing bids or will instead be insulated from competition under \u00a7 309(Z). We therefore have jurisdiction over Channel 32\u2019s petition for review, <em>see </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a), but because \u201cthe provisions for judicial review contained in \u00a7\u00a7 402(a) and 402(b) are mutually exclusive,\u201d <em>Tribune Co. v. FCC, </em>133 F.3d 61, 66 n. 4 (D.C.Cir.1998) (quotation omitted), we cannot entertain the appeal Channel 32 brought pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b) and therefore dismiss it. Addressing the merits of Channel 32\u2019s petition for review, we deny it. Word never \u201cfiled\u201d a complete application with the Commission before the cut-off date as required under \u00a7 309(Z); it merely <em>submitted </em>an application that lacked the proper filing fee. <em>See </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.1116(a)(1), (a)(2) (while \u201c[a] defective fee may be corrected by resubmitting the application\u201d with the correct fee, \u201cthe date of resubmission with the correct fee will be considered the date of filing\u201d). Because the Commission rejected Word\u2019s application \u2014 and because Word did not resubmit it with the correct fee before July 1, 1997 \u2014 Channel 32\u2019s application was never subject to a \u201ccompeting application.\u201d Therefore, Channel 32 cannot avail itself of \u00a7 309(Z )\u2019s exclusive bidding and settlement provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. Rule 41(a)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
