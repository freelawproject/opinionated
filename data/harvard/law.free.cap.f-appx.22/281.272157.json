RApp. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201c \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Browder v.

Gracia\u2019s notice of appeal was filed by his counsel on June 6, 2000. Because Gracia failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny a certificate of appealability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-17\"> The parties consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) (1994).
