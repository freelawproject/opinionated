The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b44-17\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s judgment, filed January 24, 2001, be affirmed. An essential element of appellants\u2019 cause of action for legal malpractice \u2014 harm resulting from counsel\u2019s conduct \u2014 has already been determined against appellants in <em>Thomas v. Albright, </em>139 F.3d 227, 229 (D.C.Cir.1998), <em>aff'g in part and rev\u2019g in part Thomas v. Christopher, </em>169 F.R.D. 224 (D.D.C.1996). This court has previously determined that there was no basis for certifying a class under Rule 23(b)(3). <em>See Thomas, </em>139 F.3d at 236. The malpractice action could only survive if that determination were relitigated and found to be incorrect. Accordingly, the doctrine of issue preclusion bars appellants\u2019 action. <em>See Thomas v. Powell, </em>247 F.3d 260, 262-65 (D.C.Cir.2001), <em>aff'g Thomas v. Albright, </em>77 F.Supp.2d 114 (D.D.C.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-18\">The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
