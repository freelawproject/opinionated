Greenfields contends on appeal that its denial to Larue of access to the condominium\u2019s swimming pool was based on her post-petition delinquency, which is not subject to the automatic stay. Greenfields also asserts that a pool pass is not property of the bankruptcy estate, and therefore not protected by the automatic stay. Lastly, Greenfields contends that if it violated the stay, such violation was not willful, and therefore the bankruptcy court erred in imposing sanctions. We have previously granted the motion to submit the case for a decision on the briefs, without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-22\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8013; <em>In re Varat Enters., Inc., </em>81 F.3d 1310, 1314 (4th Cir.1996). Legal conclusions are reviewed de novo. <em>In re Bryson Props., </em>961 F.2d 496, 499 (4th Cir. 1992). We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the materials submitted in the joint appendix in light of the applicable standards of review and find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s decision upholding the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding of a violation and imposing sanctions. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>In re Larue, </em>Nos. CA-00-3295-AW; BK-00-15637 (D. Md. May 15 &amp; 21, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
