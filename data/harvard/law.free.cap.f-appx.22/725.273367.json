He asserts physical and psychological disabilities and challenges Liberty\u2019s denial of long-term disability benefits. Reviewing Liberty\u2019s actions for an abuse of discretion and finding none, the district court entered summary judgment for Liberty. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s choice of the standard of review, as well as its application of that standard to decisions by fiduciaries in the ERISA context. <em>Lang v. Long-Term Disability Plan of Sponsor Applied Remote Tech, Inc., </em>125 F.3d 794, 797 (9th Cir.1997). Here, we hold that the district court correctly applied an abuse of discretion standard of review. Mr. Meshkinfam fails to come forward with material, probative evidence tending to show that Liberty\u2019s self-interest caused a breach of the administrator\u2019s fiduciary duty to Mr. Meshkinfam.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Reviewed for abuse of discretion, Liberty\u2019s decision withstands scrutiny. Mr. Meshkinfam\u2019s evidence of disability was insufficient to prove he was disabled as defined by the terms of Liberty\u2019s disability plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">We therefore AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b767-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
