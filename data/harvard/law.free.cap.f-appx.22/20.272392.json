Carballo-Collazo, Josefina Carballo, their conjugal partnership, and Vivian Carballo-Arroyo (collectively, \u201cRAC\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for North American Packaging of Puerto Rico, Inc. (\u201cNAM-PAC\u201d) in this dispute over pension benefits and investment advice. The other named defendants were not served and they were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-20\">The district court found that RAC had failed to provide, in opposing summary judgment, \u201ca separate, short, and concise statement of the material facts as to which it is contended that there exists a genuine issue to be tried, properly supported by specific reference to the record.\u201d D.P.R. Loe. R. 311.12. RAC did indeed utterly fail to provide specific record citations. As the quoted rule provides, the court responded to RAC\u2019s omission by deeming admitted the facts as NAMPAC gave them in its own, proper statement. It then entered summary judgment for NAMPAC.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-21\">We have previously upheld the application of Local Rule 311.12 to appropriate cases. <em>E.g., Corrada Betances v. Sear-Land Serv., Inc., </em>248 F.3d 40, 43-44 (1st Cir.2001); <em>Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., </em>95 F.3d 86, 95 (1st Cir.1996); <em>Laracuente v. Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>891 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir.1989). Our review of the record convinces us that this is such a case. We remind counsel that compliance with the directives of the district courts is necessary to the orderly conduct of litigation, and that this Court is largely unsympathetic to noncompliant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>parties. <em>See Serra Lugo v. Mayaguez Consortium-Las Marias, </em>No. 01-1441, slip op. at 3-4 (1st Cir. Oct. 30, 2001), (per curiam). Accordingly, we also take the facts as set forth by NAMPAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The district court thoughtfully discussed the variety of reasons why RAC\u2019s claims failed. We have nothing to add to the district court\u2019s explanation of why NAM-PAC is not liable to RAC. 1st Cir. LoC. R. 27(c). The judgment of the district court is therefore <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-16\">. The district court also analyzed RAC\u2019s claims on their merits as though there had been no failure to comply with the Local Rules, and found them wanting on a number of grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
