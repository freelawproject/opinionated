Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but contends on Little\u2019s behalf that Little received ineffective assistance of counsel. Little has filed a pro se supplemental brief in which he contends his counsel was ineffective and that his plea was neither knowing nor voluntary. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-18\">Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are generally not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). To allow for adequate development of the record, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel must ordinarily be pursued in a 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp. 2000) motion. <em>United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994). An exception to this general rule applies when the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>King, </em>119 F.3d at 295. A review of the record does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance of counsel, and Little\u2019s ineffective assistance claims are therefore not cognizable in this direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-19\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Little contends his plea was not knowing because he did not know he would receive such a lengthy sentence. This court generally reviews the adequacy of a guilty plea de novo, but in the Rule 11 context, violations are evaluated for harmless error. <em>United States v. Damon, </em>191 F.3d 561, 564 n.2 (4th Cir.1999) (citing <em>United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 402 (4th Cir.1995)). A careful review of the record shows that any potential error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-20\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and find no error. Accordingly, we affirm Little\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
