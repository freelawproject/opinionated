Ruiz, </em>241 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir.2001). That briefing has been completed, and this case is ordered resubmitted for decision contemporaneously with the filing of this memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-18\"><em>Ruiz </em>controls this case, and requires that we vacate the sentence of Medina-Hernandez and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Medina-Hernandez challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K2.0 based on the prosecutor\u2019s having attached an unconstitutional condition to the offered plea bargain. That condition required waiver of rights to certain impeachment and affirmative-defense information to which Medina-Hernandez was entitled under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and its progeny. We may review the refusal to depart to ensure that it \u201cwas not guided by erroneous legal conclusions.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>264 F.3d 813, 815 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)); <em>see also Ruiz, </em>241 F.3d at 1161-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-23\">We conclude that <em>Ruiz </em>controls the merits of this appeal. <em>Ruiz </em>establishes that the condition was unconstitutional. <em>See Ruiz, </em>241 F.3d at 1163-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-24\">The government contends that Medina-Hernandez, unlike Ruiz, was not otherwise eligible for the \u201cfast-track\u201d downward departure, but the record indicates that the district court based its ruling on Medina-Hernandez\u2019s refusal to accept the condition of the plea agreement. The district court stated that the condition \u201cwas not an improper nor unethical nor unconstitutional paragraph for the government to insert in its tendered plea agreement and, <em>therefore, </em>[the court] declines to depart downward on the basis of 5K2 <em>for that reason.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). On this record, Medina-Hernandez is entitled to a hearing and to the district court\u2019s consideration of relief for the prosecution\u2019s unconstitutional action. <em>See id. </em>at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>The sentence of Medina-Hernandez is vacated and the matter is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with <em>Ruiz </em>and this memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b865-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-25\">.
