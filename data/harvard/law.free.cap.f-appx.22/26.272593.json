Specifically, he argues on appeal that the there was no evidence presented to the grand jury of an essential element of the charge to which he pled guilty. Before pleading guilty to Count Three of the Second Superseding Indictment, which charged him with conspiring to commit money laundering, Ce-ballos moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support it. At the time that he pled guilty, however, Ceballos agreed that all pending motions (which included the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>motion to dismiss the indictment) would be \u201cdeemed waived.\u201d On appeal, Ceballos again challenges the factual basis for the indictment, arguing that there was no evidence presented to the grand jury to support a finding that he knew that the money he helped transfer represented proceeds from an unlawful activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u201cThis circuit has ruled that a defendant who pleads guilty may not later contest the factual and theoretical foundations of the indictment to which he has pled.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera Ramos, </em>856 F.2d 420, 423 (1st Cir.1988). This appeal by Ceballos represents an effort to contest the factual foundation of Count Three of the indictment, to which he pled guilty. At his change-of-plea hearing, Ceballos specifically admitted that he knew that the money he helped transfer \u201ccame from drug transactions.\u201d Ceballos\u2019 appeal does not fall within any exception for challenges to \u201cjurisdictional facts\u201d alleged in the indictment. <em>See Valencia v. United States, </em>923 F.2d 917, 921 (1st Cir.1991).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Ceballos\u2019 conviction and sentence are <em>affirmed. See </em>Loc. R. 27(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\">. Ceballos' reliance upon <em>United States v. Frigerio-Migiano, </em>254 F.3d 30 (1st Cir.2001) is misplaced as appellant in that case did not plead guilty but appealed from a conviction following a trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
