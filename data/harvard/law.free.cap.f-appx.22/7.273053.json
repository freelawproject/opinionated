The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b49-16\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s judgment be affirmed. Appellant\u2019s petition challenges the validity of his conviction and sentence. Therefore, it is cognizable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and may only be filed in the sentencing court\u2014 the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. <em>See Charles v. Chandler, </em>180 F.3d 753, 755-56 (6th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (collecting cases). Because appellant previously filed a \u00a7 2255 petition, appellant should have filed a motion for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Appellant did not argue to the district court, nor in his brief, that \u00a7 2255 affords him an \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d remedy, and therefore, that his petition falls within the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-18\">The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
