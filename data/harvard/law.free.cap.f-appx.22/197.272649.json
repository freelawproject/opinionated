The court sentenced Ray to eighty-eight months\u2019 imprisonment on the firearm conviction and sixty months\u2019 imprisonment on the drug conviction. On appeal, Ray attacks the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. We have reviewed the record, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we find sufficient evidence to support Ray\u2019s convictions. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-19\">Accordingly, we affirm Ray\u2019s convictions and sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
