The district court sentenced Hicks to 360 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release. Hicks appealed from the</p>\n<p id=\"b724-18\">sentence imposed by the district court and we remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>See United States v. Hicks, </em>No. 00-2400, 2000 WL 1872701, at *1 (8th Cir. Dec.22, 2000) (unpublished per curiam opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-19\">The district court resentenced Hicks to 204 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release, and Hicks appeals. On appeal, Hicks\u2019s counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Hicks has filed a pro se supplemental brief, arguing his indictment and sentence still violate <em>Apprendi </em>Without considering the effect of Hicks\u2019s verbal agreement at resentencing to waive his right to appeal his sentence (and to seek certain other postconviction relief) in exchange for a sentencing concession, we reject Hicks\u2019s appeal and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-20\">Specifically, Hicks stipulated at resentencing to the sentence he received and thus he may not challenge it here. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995). Further, Hicks\u2019s sentence does not violate <em>Apprendi </em>because it is below the 240-month statutory maximum for a cocaine-base conspiracy without regard to drug quantity. <em>See United States v. Aguayo-Delgado, </em>220 F.3d 926, 934 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1026, 121 S.Ct. 600, 148 L.Ed.2d 513 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-21\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find there are no non-frivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-22\">Accordingly, we affirm and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
