On appeal, he alleges that the district court should have sentenced him under the fraud section of the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2F1.1 (1998), rather than the money-laundering section, USSG \u00a7 2S1.1. Jacobs also alleges that he should have received a downward adjustment for being a minimal or minor participant in the scheme under USSG \u00a7 3B1.2. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">First, we do not find that the district court erred in sentencing Jacobs under the money-laundering section of the Guidelines as he was indicted for and pled guilty to conspiracy to launder monetary instruments. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>202 F.3d 212, 217 (4th Cir.) (stating review standard), <em>cert. denied, </em>530 U.S. 1236, 120 S.Ct. 2675, 147 L.Ed.2d 286 (2000); <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>994 F.2d 1088, 1091 (4th Cir.1993) (same); USSG \u00a7 1B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Next, we do not find that the district court clearly erred by declining to find that Jacobs was a minor or minimal participant in the scheme under USSG \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>See United States v. Gordon, </em>895 F.2d 932, 934-35 (4th Cir.1990) (stating review standard); <em>United States v. Reavis, </em>48 F.3d 763, 768-69 (4th Cir.1995) (defining minor or minimal participant).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
