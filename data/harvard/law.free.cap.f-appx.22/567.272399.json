This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-20\">In 2000, King was tried by a jury and found guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The district court sentenced King to sixty-three months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. King appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-21\">In his timely appeal, King\u2019s counsel moves to withdraw and has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>King has not responded to his counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Although believing the appeal to be frivolous, appellate counsel has submitted the following issue for review: whether King was denied his right to a speedy trial in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">This case involves pre-indictment delay. On December 17, 1996, King was arrested on a fugitive warrant. When he was arrested, King had a .380 caliber pistol tucked in his waistband. King was returned to Maryland where he stood trial on a charge of armed bank robbery. That prosecution resulted in a hung jury. In March 1999, King was indicted in the Eastern District <em>of </em>Michigan for being a felon in possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Pre-indictment delay claims implicate a Fifth Amendment due process right against stale claims. <em>United States v. Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. 783, 789, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977) (discussing the \u201climited role\u201d that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment plays in protecting against excessive pre-indictment delay). Generally, the applicable statute of limitations insures this protection. <em>Id. </em>Pre-indictment delay warrants dismissal when a defendant can show substantial prejudice where the state intentionally delayed the prosecution to gain a tactical advantage. <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 324, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971); <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>118 F.3d 466, 475-76 (6th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>959 F.2d 63, 66 (6th Cir.1992). Defendant has the burden to show substantial prejudice. <em>Rogers, </em>118 F.3d at 475-76, 477 n. 10; <em>Brown, </em>959 F.2d at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The delay between King\u2019s initial arrest on December 17, 1996, and his indictment on March 2,1999 (a delay of approximately twenty-six months and two weeks), was not presumptively prejudicial. The Sixth Circuit has upheld longer pre-indictment delays without finding a due process violation. <em>Brown, </em>959 F.2d at 67; <em>United States v. DeClue, </em>899 F.2d 1465, 1468-69 (6th Cir.1990) (thirty-three month delay); <em>United States v. Atisha, </em>804 F.2d 920, 927-28 (6th Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>667 F.2d 566, 568 (6th Cir.1982) (delay of approximately five years).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Since King has not established a legal presumption of prejudice, he must show actual prejudice. But, he has not done so; he has not alleged the unavailability of witnesses, a loss of favorable witnesses, or any other prejudice to his defense. Moreover, King has not shown that delay was designed to obtain a tactical advantage. Thus, King was not denied due process by the pre-indictment delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">We have further examined the record in this case, including the transcripts of King\u2019s trial and the sentencing hearing, and conclude that no reversible error is apparent from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
