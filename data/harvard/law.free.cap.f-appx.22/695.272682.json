An Immigration Judge (IJ) found petitioners removable for remaining in the United States longer than permitted and denied the requested relief of asylum and withholding of removal; the Board dismissed their appeal. This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Having carefully considered the briefs and record, we affirm the denial of petitioners\u2019 claims. The IJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and the Board\u2019s dismissal of petitioners\u2019 appeal therefore must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">Alla Bogdan also asserts a claim for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Because this claim does not appear to have been raised in the administrative proceedings, and was not considered by either the IJ or the Board, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">Affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">A true copy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
