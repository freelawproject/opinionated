Miller appeals a district court judgment that dismissed his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit. The case has been referred to this panel pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. We unanimously agree that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-15\">Miller sued Ohio Governor Bob Taft, Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery, Judge Richard K. Warren, and \u201call Judges of the State of Ohio (Allen County Court of Common Pleas)\u201d. Miller challenged the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s Sexual Predator Registration and Notification Laws, Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2950, <em>et seq., </em>which he predicts will be used to classify him as a sexual predator at some time in the future. The district court concluded that Miller lacked standing to bring the suit and that he otherwise faded to state a constitutional claim. The district court dismissed Miller\u2019s suit as frivolous and certified that an appeal could not be taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-17\">In his timely appeal, Miller reasserts his constitutional claims. The defendants have not been served and have not filed a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-18\">Upon de novo review, <em>McGore v. Wrig-glesworth, </em>114 F.3d 601, 604 (6th Cir.1997), we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for the reasons articulated in that court\u2019s opinion and order entered on April 18, 2001.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
