Morderosian seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for extension of time to appeal its dismissal of his civil action. The district court entered an order on July 16, 2001 granting Morderosian thirty days in which to appeal its April 30, 2001 order denying him an extension of time to appeal. The court later emphasized in a July 31, 2001 order that Morderosian had until August 15, 2001 to note his appeal. We conclude the district court was without jurisdiction to so extend the appeal period because more than sixty days had lapsed since the April 30, 2001 order. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5)(e). In any event, Morderosian\u2019s notice of appeal was not filed until August 17, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-22\">Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We deny Mordero-sian\u2019s motion for oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
