Carr, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b640-13\">This matter is before the court upon initial consideration of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on September 17, 2001. In that document, he states that he appeals from all the orders entered in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-15\">Various orders were entered in the district court. The magistrate judge entered orders denying appointment of counsel, rejecting pleadings, denying a mental examination, denying discovery of certain files, and denying a motion to add additional defendants. The district court judge entered an order on June 1, 2001 partially dismissing the case and denied reconsideration of that order on July 11, 2001. A second order denying reconsideration was entered on July 26, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-19\">This court lacks jurisdiction over this appeal. The orders appealed did not terminate all issues presented in the litigation on the merits and were not final or appeal-able orders. <em>See Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, </em>449 U.S. 368, 373, 101 S.Ct. 669, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981); <em>Catlin v.. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945). Orders of a magistrate judge are not appealable unless the magistrate judge is given plenary jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1). <em>Tripati v. Rison, </em>847 F.2d 548, 548-49 (9th Cir.1988) (per curiam); <em>McGraw v. Connelly (In re Bell &amp; Beckwith), </em>838 F.2d 844, 848 n. 5 (6th Cir.1988); <em>Ambrose v. Welch, </em>729 F.2d 1084, 1085 (6th Cir.1984) (per curiam). The magistrate judge was not given plenary jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-20\">It is ordered that the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
