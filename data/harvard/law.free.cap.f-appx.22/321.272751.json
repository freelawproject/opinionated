He also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a transcript (Appeal No. 01-7339). We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinions and find no reversible error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny Johnson\u2019s pending motions for transcript, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeals on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>Nos. CR-98-922; CA-01-2114-6-20 (D.S.C. May 10, June 7, June 21, and Aug. 7, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-17\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-15\"> Upon demonstration by Appellant of proof of timely mailing of his motion for reconsideration such that it properly was subject to consideration pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), the district court reconsidered the motion on the merits under Rule 59(e), thereby rendering harmless its prior construction of the motion pursuant to Rule 60(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
