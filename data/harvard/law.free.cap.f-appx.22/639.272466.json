Barr-Carr and Bogdan also asserted various state-law claims against the City, the officers, the owner of a Citgo service station, and a Citgo employee. The parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge. Magistrate Judge Arlander Keys dismissed Bogdan\u2019s complaint for want of prosecution; he also dismissed Barr-Carr\u2019s complaint and ordered her to pay the defendants\u2019 costs and attorneys\u2019 fees as a sanction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. Magistrate Judge Keys concluded that Barr-Carr brought this litigation for an improper purpose-to harass the City and to fraudulently obtain a money judgmeni^after finding that she had concocted her claims and then attempted to support them by manufacturing evidence and repeatedly suborning perjury. Barr-Carr appeals, and we dismiss her appeal for noncompliance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-19\">Rule 28(a)(9)(A) specifies that an appellant\u2019s brief must contain the appellant\u2019s \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d Barr-Carr\u2019s brief fails to comply with Rule 28(a)(9); it contains no comprehensible argument and no citations to authority or to the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Barr-Carr fails even to mention the magistrate judge\u2019s order, except to say that \u201c[tjhis litigation and the horrific incidents were not concocted and brought before the court for an improper purpose.\u201d This bald assertion tells us nothing about why Barr-Carr thinks the magistrate judge erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-20\">Although we construe pro se filings like Barr-Carr\u2019s liberally, even pro se litigants are expected to include legal argument and some supporting authority in their briefs. <em>Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>(7th Cir.2001); <em>see also Members v. Paige, </em>140 F.3d 699, 702 (7th Cir.1998) (\u201c[R]ules apply to uncounseled litigants and must be enforced.\u201d). Litigants like Barr-Carr who fail to make legal arguments supported by authority forfeit appellate review of their claims, <em>Mathis v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>133 F.3d 546, 548 (7th Cir.1997), and \u201cshould expect that noncompliance with Rule 28 will result in dismissal of the appeal,\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>241 F.3d at <em>545-46 </em>(citing <em>McCottrell v. E.E.O.C., </em>726 F.2d 350, 351 (7th Cir.1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-21\">. We also note that Barr-Carr\u2019s brief lacks a jurisdictional statement, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(4); Cir. R. 28(a), and does not include a copy of the magistrate judge\u2019s order from which she appeals, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 30(a)(1)(c); Cir. R. 30(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
