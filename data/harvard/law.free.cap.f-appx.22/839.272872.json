Proud\u2019s evidence of deliberate indifference and clearly unreasonable actions include the District\u2019s questioning of the alleged harasser three weeks after she complained, the fact that the investigation took nearly six months to complete, and the fact that the District\u2019s representative recognized that the harassment would probably continue. Proud has raised genuine issues of material fact as to whether the District\u2019s response to and investigation of her sexual harassment complaint was \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d and \u201cclearly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See Reese v. Jefferson Sch. </em>Dist. <em>No. 14J, </em>208 F.3d 736, 739-40 (9th Cir.2000). In the face of disputed factual issues, the district court is precluded from granting summary judgment. <em>Little v.
