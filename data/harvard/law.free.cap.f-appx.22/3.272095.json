The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b45-17\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s motion to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 be affirmed. The only issue raised on this appeal is whether counsel for appellant\u2019s direct appeal of his conviction and sentence provided ineffective assistance in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution by failing to challenge the district court\u2019s decision to allow Detective Thomas\u2019 expert testimony. Even assuming counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, appellant has not shown that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional error, the result of the appeal would have been different. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-96, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>Smith v. Robins, </em>528 U.S. 259, 285, 120 S.Ct. 746, 145 L.Ed.2d 756 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-19\">The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
