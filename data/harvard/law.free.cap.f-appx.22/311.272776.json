Our review of the record discloses that the Commissioner\u2019s decision is based upon substantial evidence and is without reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm substantially on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Camp v. Massanari, </em>No. CA-00-186-1-C (W.D.N.C. May 15, 2001). Additionally, although Camp argues that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) rejected Dr. Richard Munschy\u2019s opinion without properly seeking additional information from the doctor, she has made no showing of prejudice. Thus, any error on the part of the ALJ was harmless. <em>See Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 458 (5th Cir.2000) (holding claim requires showing that additional evidence would have been produced that might have led to a different decision). We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-17\"> The case was decided by a magistrate judge upon the consent of both parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
