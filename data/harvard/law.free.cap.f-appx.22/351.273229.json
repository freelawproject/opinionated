R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-27\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing Atwood\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was entered on May 24, 2001. To be timely, Atwood would have had to note an appeal no later than July 23, 2001. Atwood\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on July 26, 2001.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Atwood filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>his motion to reconsider pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) more than ten days after the entry of the district court\u2019s order dismissing his \u00a7 2255 motion, so the time period for filing his appeal of that order was not tolled. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4). Therefore, Atwood\u2019s appeal is only timely as to the district court\u2019s order denying his subsequent motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">This court reviews denial of a Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See NOW v. Operation Rescue, </em>47 F.3d 667, 669 (4th Cir.1995) (per curiam). We have reviewed the record and conclude the district court\u2019s order denying Atwood\u2019s motion for reconsideration was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability, dismiss as untimely Atwood\u2019s appeal as to the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion, and dismiss as meritless his appeal as to the order denying reconsideration. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Dismissed by unpublished PER CURIAM opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-18\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the dates appearing on Atwood's pleadings are the earliest dates they could have been given to prison officials for mailing. <em>See </em>Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>R.App. P. 4(c); <em>Houston v.
