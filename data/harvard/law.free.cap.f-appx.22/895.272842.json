We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">Hernandez-Diaz contends that, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) describes a separate crime from subsection (a), as opposed to a sentencing factor. He further contends that the sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 1326(b) is limited to those aliens who have been removed, as opposed to deported, excluded, denied admission or voluntarily departed, and cannot apply to him because the indictment only alleged that he had been \u201cdeported.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">Hernandez-Diaz\u2019s contentions are unpersu'asive, because we have already determined that <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (holding that \u00a7 1326(b)(2) describes sentencing factor and is not an element of \u00a7 1326 offense). <em>See also United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir.2001) (examining IIRIRA amendments to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326); <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414-15 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001) (same, reviewing for plain error).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-17\">We have also previously concluded that there is no legally significant distinction between \u201cdeportation\u201d and \u201cremoval\u201d for purposes of the crime defined by \u00a7 1326(a) and the enhancement under \u00a7 1326(b). <em>United States v. Lopez-Gonzalez, </em>183 F.3d 933, 934-35 (9th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1126, 120 S.Ct. 957, 145 L.Ed.2d 830 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b938-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
