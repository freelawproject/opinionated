Co. (General Accident) voiding Express Textile\u2019s coverage and entitling General Accident to recover approximately $1.2 million paid on a claim for a fire at Express Textile\u2019s warehouse. The coverage was voided because the jury found that Express Textile knowingly made material misrepresentations in submitting the claim. Appellant contends that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that Express Textile\u2019s alleged misrepresentations would be considered material only if Express Textile believed the misrepresentations were material. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We address Express Textile\u2019s arguments by reviewing the jury instructions to determine if they accurately state the law. <em>Oviatt v. Pearce, </em>954 F.2d 1470, 1481 (9th Cir.1992). We conclude that the jury instruction on materiality correctly stated the law, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-18\">The court instructed the jury that \u201c[i]f the alleged misrepresentation concerns a subject which is reasonably relevant to General Accident\u2019s investigation, or if a reasonable insurer would attach importance to the fact misrepresented, then it is material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-19\">Under California law, materiality is determined from the perspective of the insurer. <em>See </em>Cal. Ins.Code \u00a7 334 (\u201cMateriality is to be determined not by the event, but solely by the probable and reasonable influence of the facts upon the party to whom the communication is due, in forming his estimate of the disadvantages of the proposed contract, or in making his inquiries.\u201d); <em>Holz Rubber Co., Inc. v. American Star Ins. Co., </em>14 Cal.3d 45, 120 Cal.Rptr. 415, 533 P.2d 1055, 1065 (1975) (holding materiality determined by probable and reasonable effect that truthful disclosure would have on insurer); <em>Merced County Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. State, </em>233 Cal.App.3d 765, 284 Cal.Rptr. 680, 684 (.1991) (\u201cMateriality is to be determined solely by the probable and reasonable effect which truthful answers would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>had upon the insurer; i.e., was the insurer misled into accepting a risk, fixing the premium of insurance, estimating the disadvantages of the proposed contract or making his inquiries.\u201d) (footnote and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Appellant argues that the following quote from <em>Cummings v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, </em>202 Cal.App.3d 1407, 249 Cal. Rptr. 568 <em>(1988), </em>supports his contention that Express Textile\u2019s misrepresentations should be considered material only if Express Textile believed the misrepresentations were material: \u201c[I]f the misrepresentation concerns a subject reasonably relevant to the insured\u2019s investigation, and if a reasonable insurer would attach importance to the fact misrepresented, then it is material.\u201d <em>Cummings, </em>249 Cal.Rptr. at 573. Appellee responds that <em>Cummings </em>does not require consideration of the insured\u2019s belief. Appellee argues that the use of the word \u201cinsured\u201d in this sentence is a typographical error and that \u201cinsurer\u201d was intended in both the first and second clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">We agree that <em>Cummings </em>does not support Appellant\u2019s argument. The court in <em>Cummings </em>summarized the holding in <em>Fine v. Bellefonte Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>725 F.2d 179 (2d Cir.1984). <em>Fine </em>indeed holds that the materiality element may be satisfied without considering the belief of the insured: \u201cThus the materiality requirement is satisfied if the false statement concerns a subject relevant and germane to the insurer\u2019s investigation as it was then proceeding.\u201d <em>Fine, </em>725 F.2d at 183. The other cases cited by Appellant are also unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">We also note that in any case, \u201c[t]he purpose of Rule 51 in general is to give the trial judge an opportunity to reconsider any ruling that he may have made, and if he is convinced that he is in error to reinstruct the jury <em>prior to its deliberation.\u201d Maheu v. Hughes Tool Co., </em>569 F.2d 459, 470 (9th Cir.1977) (citation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">Because we are satisfied that the district court correctly instructed the jury, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b790-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
