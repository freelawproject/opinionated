We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 HOSaia).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>We review the BIA\u2019s credibility finding for substantial evidence and must uphold the finding unless the evidence presented compels a reasonable factfinder to reach a contrary result. <em>See de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393 (9th Cir.1997). Although we give \u201csubstantial deference\u201d to credibility findings, such a finding must be supported by a specific, cogent reason. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">The BIA gave specific and cogent reasons that were supported by substantial evidence for finding Singh\u2019s testimony not credible. Because the inconsistencies or omissions identified by the BIA go to the heart of the asylum claim, Singh\u2019s appeal was properly dismissed. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Singh\u2019s eligibility for relief under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture because he failed to raise the issue before the BIA. <em>See Ortiz v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1148, 1152-53 (9th Cir.1999) (noting that an applicant is free to raise the issue before the BIA in the form of a motion to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b975-14\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b975-28\">.
