We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-21\">Harrell contends that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender pursuant to the United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1 because the 1988 attempted bank robbery conviction used to establish his career offender status should not have been considered a crime of violence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-22\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Riley, </em>183 F.3d 1155, 1157 (9th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1174, 120 S.Ct. 1204, 145 L.Ed.2d 1107 (2000). Whether a crime constitutes a crime of violence under the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 is a categorical test in this circuit. <em>Id. </em>at 1158. If the elements of the crime charged contain the use or attempted use of force, then we consider the crime violent. <em>United States v. Young, </em>990 F.2d 469, 470 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-23\">The elements of attempted bank robbery as set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) are: (1) knowingly (2) attempting to take any property or money or any other thing of value from a bank (3) by force and violence or by intimidation. <em>United States v. Darby, </em>857 F.2d 623, 624-25 (9th Cir. 1988). Because the elements of attempted bank robbery contain the use or attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>use of force, we consider the crime of attempted bank robbery violent. <em>See Young, </em>990 F.2d at 470, 472. Therefore, the district court properly sentenced Harrell as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b952-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b952-24\">. Although the statute under which Harrell was convicted in 1988 was not cited in the presentence report, the record contains sufficient evidence for us to conclude Harrell\u2019s conviction fell under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>258 F.3d 1120, 1124 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
