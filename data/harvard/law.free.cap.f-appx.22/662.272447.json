Because Nunez-Loya speaks Spanish but not English, a bilingual DEA agent spoke with him in Spanish, translated the consent-to-search form before Nunez-Loya signed it, and read the <em>Miranda, </em>warning in Spanish. Nunez-Loya filed a motion to suppress the drug-related evidence and his incriminating statements. The district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> denied the motion. Afterwards, Nunez-Loya pleaded guilty to the cocaine charge preserving for appeal his right to challenge the adverse ruling on the suppression issue. Discussion of Nunez-Loya\u2019s fact-specific arguments would serve no useful purpose because the district court resolved the credibility questions based on conflicting testimony in the government\u2019s favor, the district court\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous, and the controlling law is clear. After a careful review of the record, we conclude the district court\u2019s decision is clearly correct. We thus affirm without an extended opinion for the reasons stated in the magistrate judge\u2019s report adopted by the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b704-16\"> The Honorable Ortrie D.
