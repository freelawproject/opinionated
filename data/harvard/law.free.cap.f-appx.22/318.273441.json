Hart\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising the issue of whether the plea complied with Fed. R.Crim.P. 11. Hart filed a pro se brief arguing that his sentence was improperly calculated based on the drug quantity attributed to him, dangerous weapon enhancement, and his leadership role in the crime. Because our review of the record discloses no reversible error, we affirm Hart\u2019s conviction and sentence. Specifically, we find that Hart\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered after a thorough hearing pursuant to Rule 11. Regarding Hart\u2019s claim that he was improperly sentenced, we have considered Hart\u2019s sentence under the United States Sentencing Guidelines and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Hart\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. Accordingly, Hart\u2019s motion to substitute counsel is denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
