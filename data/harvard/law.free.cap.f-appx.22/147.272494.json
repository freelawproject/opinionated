Alton, III, appeals the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West Supp.2001) complaint. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, made after an evidentiary hearing, and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Alton v. Socks, </em>No. CA-98-2761 AW (D. Md. filed May 30, 2001; entered May 31, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b190-11\"> Alton, who was represented by counsel in the district court, failed to file objections to the magistrate judge's report in the time afforded him by the district court, waiving review of the magistrate judge's report by both the district court and this court. <em>See Wells v. Shriners Hosp., </em>109 F.3d 198, 200-01 (4th Cir. 1997). Notwithstanding this failure, the district court conducted a de novo review and denied relief on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
