Supreme\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1976), raising the issue of compliance with Fed. R.Crim.P. 11, but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Supreme filed a supplemental pro se brief arguing he did not intend to violate the law and that a mental defect prevented him from understanding the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Supreme\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
