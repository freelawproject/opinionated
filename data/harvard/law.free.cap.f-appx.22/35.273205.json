Colon\u2019s conviction related to his participation in the \u201cBlue Thunder\u201d organization, a massive and longstanding conspiracy to sell narcotics.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced to consecutive 20-year terms on each of his two counts of conviction, thus imposing an aggregate sentence of 480 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-16\">' On this appeal, Colon argues the following: (1) his trial attorney was ineffective because he failed to advise Colon to plead guilty after the district court ruled that certain unrelated evidence of police corruption that had led to the mistrial of Colon\u2019s co-defendants would not be admitted; (2) his trial attorney was ineffective because he purportedly misinformed Colon as to the maximum possible sentence were the jury to convict, as it ultimately did; (3) the district court erred in failing to grant him a downward departure; and (4) there was insufficient evidence for the jury to convict him on count X of the indictment, possession with the intent to distribute 83 glassines of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-17\">Having fully considered Colon\u2019s ineffective assistance claims on this direct appeal, <em>see United States v. Leone, </em>215 F.3d 253, 256 (2d Cir.2000), we find them to be without merit. With respect to Colon\u2019s contention that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to advise him to plead guilty after the district court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>refusal to admit evidence of police corruption from an unrelated case but involving the officers in his case, the trial counsel\u2019s advice to proceed to trial rather than to plead guilty was at the time strategically valid, even if ultimately unsuccessful. Specifically, given the scope of the trial \u2014 lasting six months and including the testimony of dozens of witnesses \u2014 it was a matter of reasonable trial strategy for Colon\u2019s attorney to believe that at some point in the trial the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>government would, either accidently or of necessity, \u201copen the door\u201d to the introduction of police misconduct. \u201cActions or omissions by counsel that might be considered sound trial strategy do not constitute ineffective assistance.\u201d <em>Mason v. Scully, </em>16 F.3d 38, 42 (2d Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Similarly, Colon\u2019s allegation that his trial attorney incorrectly estimated Colon\u2019s exposure under the Sentencing Guidelines does not constitute ineffective assistance. <em>See United States v. Sweeney, </em>878 F.2d 68, 70 (2d Cir.1989). This is because, in the course of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 proceedings prior to the district court\u2019s acceptance of a later-withdrawn plea of guilty on the same counts, the district court advised Colon that count one of the indictment alone \u201ccarries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.\u201d Colon was plainly on notice of the period of incarceration he faced if found guilty at trial, and thus has not established \u201ca reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different\u201d but for \u201ccounsel\u2019s [allegedly] deficient performance.\u201d <em>Mayo v. Henderson, </em>13 F.3d 528, 534 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">As for Colon\u2019s contention that the district court erred in failing to grant him a downward departure, we disagree. It is apparent from the record that the sentencing judge recognized her authority to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines, but chose not to do so on the facts of the case. This decision is not appealable. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>191 F.3d 326, 338-39 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Finally, Colon\u2019s contention that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to convict him on count X of the indictment is barred by the law of the case doctrine. <em>See United States v. Ben Zvi, </em>242 F.3d 89, 96 (2d Cir.2001) (stating \u201ca decision made at a previous stage of litigation, which could have been challenged in the ensuring appeal but was not, becomes the law of the case; the parties are deemed to have waived the right to challenge that decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">For these reasons, the judgment of conviction is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-14\">.
