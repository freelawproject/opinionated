Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b804-4\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Edgardo Ong, a native and citizen of the Philippines, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s denial of his application for suspension of deportation. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Whether or not Ong is a \u201ccrewman,\u201d he is ineligible for suspension of deportation because he was served with an Order to Show Cause before he had acquired seven years continuous presence in the United States. As a result, he is ineligible for suspension of deportation under the stop-time rule. IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(5). Ong\u2019s argument that this violates his due process rights is foreclosed by <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516-17 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Nor does it matter whether Ong belongs in the <em>Bamhonctr-Gomez </em>class, <em>see Barahona-Gomez v. Reno, </em>No. C 97-0895 CW (N.D.Cal., Sept. 17, 1997), <em>aff'd Barahona-Gomez v. Reno, </em>167 F.3d 1228, 1233 (9th Cir.1999), as he contends. Even if he were a class member, the <em>Barahona-Gomez </em>injunction merely enjoins the INS from deporting a class member who has been denied suspension of deportation but does not affect the underlying decision to deny suspension. <em>Id. </em>at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Finally, Ong must show both error and substantial prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge to deportation proceedings. <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000). Even if there were error on account of one judge\u2019s signing for another judge\u2019s decision, Ong has not shown that his case was prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b804-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
