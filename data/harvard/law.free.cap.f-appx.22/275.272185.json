Boykins argues the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction because the testimony of the government witness who participated in the transactions was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-25\">Whether a defendant\u2019s case is tried to a jury or the court, we review the verdict to determine \u201cwhether \u2018there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the government,\u2019 to support the conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Ismail, </em>97 F.3d 50, 55 (4th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Glasser v. United </em>States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942)); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>271 F.2d 596, 597 (4th Cir.1959). We do not review a witness\u2019s credibility in assessing whether the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction. <em>United States v. Hobbs, </em>136 F.3d 384, 391 n. 11 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-26\">We have reviewed the evidence and find, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, the evidence is sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>to support Boykins\u2019 conviction. Therefore, we affirm his conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
