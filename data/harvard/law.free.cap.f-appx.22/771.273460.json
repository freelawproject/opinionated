Petitioner was convicted on May 22, 1998 of driving under the influence of alcohol with prior convictions, in violation of California Vehicle Code \u00a7\u00a7 23152(b) and 23175.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-31\">In <em>United States v. Trinidad-Aquino, </em>259 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir.2001), we held that driving under the influence of alcohol and causing bodily injury, in violation of California Vehicle Code \u00a7 23153, is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. We reasoned that \u00a7 23153 could be violated through negligence, whereas a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d could be committed only with a mental state of at least recklessness. <em>See Trinidad-Aquino, </em>259 F.3d at 1144-1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>Section 23152 is similar to \u00a7 23153, but lacks the element of bodily injury. Like \u00a7 23153, it can be violated through negligence, as can \u00a7 23175.5, which criminalizes multiple convictions under \u00a7 23152 or \u00a7 23153.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">We therefore hold that Castillo-Galvan was not convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and accordingly was not convicted of an aggravated felony as defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b813-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
