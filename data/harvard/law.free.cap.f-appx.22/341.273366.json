We dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Fee\u2019s motion pursuant to Rule 35(b) was denied by the district court on June 5, 2001. Pee failed to file a notice of appeal from this order within the ten day period provided by Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). <em>See United States v. Breit, </em>754 F.2d 526, 528-29 (4th Cir.1985). We therefore dismiss Fee\u2019s appeal as it relates to the June 5 order for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">With respect to Fee\u2019s motion to reconsider, we have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the motion. <em>See id.; cf. Nilson Van &amp; Storage v. Marsh, </em>755 F.2d 362, 364 (4th Cir.1985) (holding a district court has jurisdiction to entertain motion for reconsideration filed in a criminal case from an order denying relief when the motion is filed before the order sought to be reconsidered becomes final). On that basis, we affirm the denial of relief on Fee\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
