Dutta (\u201cDutta\u201d) appeals pro se the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>see McHenry v.. Renne, </em>84 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th Cir.1996), and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">On February 23, 2000, Dutta filed a two-page document entitled \u201ccomplaint for discrimination.\u201d The named defendants were the Defense Logistics Agency, the Department of Defense, the United States government, and \u201cDoes 1-10 and other Employees of the U.S. Federal Government.\u201d By order entered May 15, 2000, the district court stated that Dutta\u2019s complaint failed to allege adequate grounds to demonstrate jurisdiction (Fed. R. Civ. Proc.8(a)(l)) and allowed Dutta to file an amended complaint by May 30, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">On May 30, 2000, Dutta lodged a second two-page \u201ccomplaint for discrimination.\u201d The complaint cited a \u2018Webstar\u201d [sic] definition of discrimination and alleged that the U.S. Government discriminated by refusing to pay him for developing his complex computer system for an automated work schedule. By order entered June 9, 2000, the district court ordered the May 30 complaint stricken and allowed Dutta until June 19, 2000 to filed a \u201cfirst amended complaint.\u201d The order stated that if such complaint does not conform the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the matter will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-15\">By order entered July 17, 2000, the district court dismissed the matter because Dutta failed to file an amended complaint by the order date. Dutta timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-16\">We agree with the district court that Dutta failed to comply with Rule 8(a). The record demonstrates that the district court adequately explained the deficiencies in Dutta\u2019s complaint, afforded him ample time to amend the complaint, and warned him that failure to follow the court\u2019s order would result in a dismissal of his action. <em>See McHenry, </em>84 F.3d at 1178-79. Accordingly, the district court was within its discretion to dismiss the action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b819-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
