Clark\u2019s counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he argues the court should have granted Clark\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 downward-departure motion. Clark has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-22\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude the issue raised by counsel is unreviewable because the district court was aware of its authority to depart from the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Lim, </em>235 F.3d 382, 385 (8th Cir.2000). Having found no nonfrivolous issues for appeal after reviewing the record independently in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-23\">A true copy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
