For the following reasons, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal in part, and grant a certificate of appealability and vacate the district court\u2019s order in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-23\">Futrell asserted in his \u00a7 2254 petition that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in that: (1) trial counsel failed to object to the declaration of a mistrial, thereby subjecting him to double jeopardy (Claim 1); (2) trial counsel failed to object to the jurisdiction of the trial court (Claim 2); and (3) trial counsel failed to protect him from double jeopardy by not objecting to the duplicitous indictment (Claim 3). The district court conducted de novo review of the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of relief on Claim 1, but declined to conduct de novo review of Claims 2 and 3, finding that Futrell failed to make specific objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation concerning those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-24\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) (2000), the district court is obligated to review de novo those portions of the magistrate judge\u2019s report to which specific objections are filed. <em>United States v. Schronce, </em>727 F.2d 91, 93 (4th Cir.1984). Although Fut-rell\u2019s objections are not artfully drawn, we conclude that they were sufficiently specific to warrant a de novo review of the entire magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion conducting a de novo review on Claim 1 and accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to deny relief on that claim and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>find no reversible error. The district court did not conduct a de novo review of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation concerning Claims 2 and 3. Consequently, although we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court as to Claim 1, <em>Futrell v. Catoe, </em>No. CA-00-1082-23-4 (D.S.C. Mar. 30, 2001), we grant a certificate of appealability as to Claims 2 and 3, vacate the district court\u2019s order denying relief on these claims, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART\\ VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
