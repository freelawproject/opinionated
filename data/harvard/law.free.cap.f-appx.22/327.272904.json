We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. To the extent, however, that the court dismissed claims challenging the validity of Land\u2019s institutional conviction and revocation of good time credits, we note that such claims are not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 absent a showing that the institu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>tional conviction supporting the revocation of good time credits has been overturned. <em>See Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 645-646, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997). A prisoner may challenge the revocation of good time credits only by way of habeas corpus. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). Accordingly, we modify the district court\u2019s order to reflect that Land\u2019s claims challenging the revocation of his good time credits, which would include all his claims other than his claim that he was improperly required to pay an administrative fee, should be dismissed without prejudice to his right to reassert such claims in a habeas action. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
