Nayada\u2019s evidence of past persecution includes a single incident of police questioning regarding her political affiliation, and villagers telling her father of threats of rape against Nayada. Nayada has failed to present evidence of past persecution or fear of future persecution sufficient to compel a finding contrary to that of the IJ. <em>See Chebchoub v. I.N.S., </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-20\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b886-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.

She also presented evidence that her father was beaten and her brother was stabbed. Finally, she presented evidence that several times, her family\u2019s crops were burned and their farm animals were killed. Nayada alleged that the Fijian military and ethnic Fijians did these things because Nayada\u2019s father and brother, although ethnic Fijians, were active in a predominantly ethnic Indian party. This evidence fits our circuits definition of past persecution as \u201cthe infliction of suffering or harm upon those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>who differ (in race, religion or political opinion) in a way regarded as offensive.\u201d <em>Prasad v. I.N.S., </em>47 F.3d 336, 339 (9th Cir.1995). Moreover, Nayada was persecuted on account of imputed political opinion because she was \u201ca member of a politically active family, other members of which have been persecuted in the past for their political beliefs.\u201d <em>Navas v. I.N.S., </em>217 F.3d 646, 659 (9th Cir.2000). The evidence in this case, therefore, compels a finding contrary to that of the IJ. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
