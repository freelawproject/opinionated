Deleston argues the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from the vehicle he was driving because the officers lacked probable cause to make the traffic stop. He avers that the court should have relied upon records offered to show that he was using his cell phone at the time his vehicle was stopped to reject testimony that the officers\u2019 actions were legitimately prompted by a reasonable belief that Dele-ston was violating a local noise ordinance. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-25\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings underlying its denial of a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>suppress for clear error, while reviewing its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). In addition, in reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). Under these standards, we conclude the district properly found the police officers\u2019 stop of Deleston\u2019s car was not pretextual and properly denied Deleston\u2019s motion to suppress evidence discovered in a consensual search of his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">For these reasons, we affirm Deleston\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not significantly aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
