White\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel states that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raises three contentions on White\u2019s behalf. White was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-18\">Counsel first contends that the district court erred in concluding that White was competent to enter a plea of guilty. We reject this contention because the district court\u2019s competency determination was amply supported by the record. <em>See Godinez v. Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 399, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993); <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960). Counsel next takes issue with the district court\u2019s denial of White\u2019s motion to substitute counsel. After reviewing the record and the district court\u2019s decision on the motion, we find no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Mullen, </em>32 F.3d 891, 895 (4th Cir.1994). Finally, counsel challenges the district court\u2019s denial of White\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Again, our review in response to this claim discloses no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-19\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. We grant White\u2019s father\u2019s motion to file a brief amicus curiae and affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. Finally, we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
