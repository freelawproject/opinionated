For the reasons discussed below, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss in part, and grant a certificate of appealability, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-22\">Following a guilty plea in Virginia state court to one count of credit card theft and one count of credit card fraud, Riddick was sentenced to a total of fifteen years in prison. Riddick did not file a direct criminal appeal, and his state habeas corpus petition was unsuccessful. He then filed this \u00a7 2254 petition alleging several grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court denied relief on all his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-23\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Ashe v. Styles, </em>67 F.3d 46, 50 (4th Cir.1995). Relief may be granted under \u00a7 2254 only if the state court\u2019s decision is contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state court\u2019s factual findings are presumed correct unless the applicant presents clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-24\">One of the issues Riddick raised in his \u00a7 2254 petition, signed under penalty of perjury, alleged that he was denied effec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>tive assistance of counsel because he asked counsel to seek reconsideration of his sentence and counsel did not comply. It is not clear from Riddick\u2019s pleadings whether he claims he asked counsel merely to seek reconsideration of his sentence in the trial court, pursuant to Va. S.Ct. R. 1:1, or whether he also asserts that he asked counsel to file a direct criminal appeal. The district court did not resolve this matter. Relying on an affidavit from Rid-dick\u2019s trial lawyer, in which she declares that he never asked her to appeal, the district court rejected Riddick\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Riddick\u2019s verified petition is the equivalent of an affidavit. <em>Williams v. Griffin, </em>952 F.2d 820, 823 (4th Cir.1991). If his petition is construed as alleging that counsel did not comply with his request to file an appeal, then it squarely conflicts with his trial lawyer\u2019s affidavit and the district court improperly relied upon counsel\u2019s affidavit in denying Riddick\u2019s claim. <em>Gray v. Spillman, </em>925 F.2d 90, 95 (4th Cir.1991); <em>Davis v. Zahradnick, </em>600 F.2d 458, 460 (4th Cir.1979). To the extent that Rid-dick\u2019s petition alleges that counsel did not comply with his request to seek reconsideration of his sentence in the trial court, it is not contradicted by counsel\u2019s affidavit. Thus, the district court still must address whether such an omission amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Cf. United States v. Witherspoon, </em>231 F.3d 923, 926 (4th Cir.2000) (declining to address merits of underlying ineffective assistance of counsel claim in 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2001) action where district court improperly made credibility determination based upon conflicting affidavits).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">We therefore grant a certificate of ap-pealability, vacate the portion of the district court\u2019s order concerning Riddick\u2019s claim that counsel did not comply with his request to pursue reconsideration or an appeal, whichever is meant, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Regarding the remainder of Riddick\u2019s claims, we have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and find no reversible error. Consequently, we deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss these claims on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Riddick v. Angelone, </em>No. CA-00-622-2 (E.D. Va. filed June 25, 2001; entered June 26, 2001). We deny Riddick\u2019s motion for discovery and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
