Cover contends that, absent an admission that his deportation had been based on commission of an aggravated felony, he could only be sentenced to a maximum of two years, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Even assuming that Cover did not admit that he had been deported based on a conviction for an aggravated felony, his argument on appeal was squarely rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Cover argues, however, that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was overruled by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We have recently rejected that very proposition. <em>See United States v. Latorre-Benavides, </em>241 F.3d 262, 264 (2d Cir.2001). We therefore reject Cover\u2019s claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-19\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
