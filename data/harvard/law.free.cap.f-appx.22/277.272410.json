For the reasons discussed below, we affirm in No. 00-4883 and, in No. 01M018, we reverse the order denying the Government\u2019s motion for reconsideration and remand for reimposition of Darity\u2019s original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Darity was convicted in 1997 of conspiracy to manufacture and distribute crack cocaine, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846 (West 1999), and sentenced to 384 months imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release. This court affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Darity, </em>No. 98-4090, 181 F.3d 92, 1999 WL 397722 (4th Cir. June 17, 1999) (unpublished), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1128, 120 S.Ct. 962, 145 L.Ed.2d 834 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Darity filed a \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court challenging his conviction and sentence under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Darity also claimed that he was improperly sentenced as a leader or organizer and that his attorney was ineffective for failing to stipulate to the facts surrounding his arrest. The district court granted Darity\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion in part, reasoning that <em>Apprendi </em>applied retroactively, and reduced Darity\u2019s sentence to 240 months imprisonment. The court denied relief as to Darity\u2019s other claims. The Government filed a motion to reconsider, arguing that <em>Apprendi </em>should not be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review. The district court denied the motion. Darity and the Government appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">In No. 00M883, our review of the record and the district court\u2019s opinion to the extent it denied relief on Darity\u2019s claims discloses no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of relief on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Darity, </em>No. CR-95-132 (W.D.N.C. filed Oct. 25, 2001; entered Oct. 30, 2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In light of our disposition in No. 01-4018, we deny as moot the Government\u2019s motion for summary reversal of the district court\u2019s order to the extent that it granted partial relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">In No. 01M018, the Government appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of its motion to reconsider the granting of relief on Darity\u2019s motion with respect to his claim under Apprendi In <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 573, - L.Ed.2d -, (2001) (No. 01-6715), we held that <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>Id. </em>at 146. The district court\u2019s order squarely conflicts with <em>Sanders. </em>We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s order denying the Government\u2019s motion for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>consideration and remand with instructions to reimpose Darity\u2019s original 384-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-10\"> Although we grant Darity\u2019s motion to file a supplemental pro se brief, we have reviewed his claims and find them to be without merit. See <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228 (4th Cir.2001) (holding that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is not unconstitutional in light of Apprendi).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
