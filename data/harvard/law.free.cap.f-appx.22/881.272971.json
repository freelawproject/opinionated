We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-17\">Barajas-Hernandez first challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for acquittal, based on his contention that the prosecution did not prove his prior conviction at trial as required by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This contention is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir.2001) (concluding, on de novo review, that <em>Apprendi </em>did not limit application of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) to cases where defendant admits prior conviction on the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-21\">Barajas-Hernandez next contends that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level enhancement to his sentence, because his 1988 conviction for aggravated assault was not considered an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) at the time of its commission. This contention is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Maria-Gonzalez, </em>268 F.3d 664, 669 (9th Cir.2001) (recognizing that 1996 amendment to definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d applies retroactively); <em>United States v. Mendoza-Iribe, </em>198 F.3d 742, 744 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1061, 120 S.Ct. 1572, 146 L.Ed.2d 475 (2000) (recognizing that 1996 amendment specifically applies regardless of date of prior conviction constituting aggravated felony).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b923-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
