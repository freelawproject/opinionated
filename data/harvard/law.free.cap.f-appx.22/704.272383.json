We affirm. Because the facts are familiar to the parties, we recount them only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-22\">1. The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of Flores\u2019 role in the unconsummated cocaine transaction. Flores denied that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>knowledge of, or intent to commit, the charged offenses concerning the sale of methamphetamine. The numerous similarities between the attempted cocaine sale and the methamphetamine sale tend to prove that Flores was aware of the nature of the second transaction. <em>United States v. Mayans, </em>17 F.3d 1174, 1181 (9th Cir. 1994). As we recently explained, \u201cRule 404(b) is a rule of inclusion. Unless the evidence of other crimes tends only to prove propensity, it is admissible.\u201d <em>United States v. Rrapi, </em>175 F.3d 742, 748 (9th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">2. Nor did the district court err by imposing a two-level sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice pursuant to Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3C1.1. It was not clearly erroneous for the court to conclude that Flores testified falsely regarding a material matter when he stated that the cocaine transaction was merely a ruse to deceive the confidential informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">3. The parties dispute whether Flores presented a motion for new counsel before sentencing, and whether the district court denied such a motion. <em>Compare </em>Appellee\u2019s Answering Brief at 32 (\u201c[T]he only motion <em>for new </em>counsel in this case was a motion for appointment of new counsel on appeal .... This motion was granted by the district court.\u201d) <em>with </em>Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 12 (\u201cThere is no question on this record that appellant made a motion for substitute counsel not just on appeal but at sentencing.... The record plainly evinces that the court was aware of appellant\u2019s request and denied it.\u201d). We find it unnecessary to resolve this dispute because we conclude that even if the court denied a request for new counsel at sentencing, as Flores contends, that denial was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">\u201cThe denial of a motion to dismiss counsel is a matter resting within the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Mills, </em>597 F.2d 693, 700 (9th Cir.1979). But \u201cthe court\u2019s discretion is not without limit.... [Rjefusal to allow the substitution of attorneys may result in a denial of the constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel if the defendant and his attorney are embroiled in an \u2018irreconcilable conflict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">When reviewing the denial of a motion to substitute counsel, \u201cwe consider three factors: (1) the timeliness of the motion and the extent of resulting inconvenience or delay; (2) the adequacy of the court\u2019s inquiry into the defendant\u2019s complaint; and (3) whether the conflict between the defendant and his attorney was so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Musa, </em>220 F.3d 1096, 1102 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">Even if Flores did make a timely motion for new counsel before sentencing \u2014 a matter we cannot discern with certainty from this record<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 our consideration of the remaining two factors persuades us that no abuse of discretion occurred. Besides translating and reviewing the various correspondences sent by Flores, the district court conducted a lengthy hearing with ample opportunity for Flores to speak, and inquired of Flores\u2019 counsel regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>nature and extent of the conflict. During the hearing, Flores\u2019 attorney stated: \u201cHe [Flores] has met with me by phone and in person so our communication is not blocked entirely.\u201d Afterwards, the court found \u201cno indication at all that Mr. Flores is unable to cooperate with his attorney,\u201d determining instead that Flores sometimes refused to cooperate as a means of protesting his indictment and conviction. Under these circumstances, it was within the court\u2019s discretion to conclude that no irreconcilable conflict existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">THOMAS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">I respectfully disagree that the district court considered and ruled upon Flores\u2019 request for substitute counsel. After noting the receipt of various letters from the defendant, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">[Court:] You have the right to review the probation office report and to discuss that report with your attorney. Did you know that you have that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">[Flores:] I have a question. I sent you three or four letters where I was asking for this attorney to be suspended so he would not be my attorney and because he\u2019s not helping me at all. The last time he saw right here that I gave it to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">[Court:] All right. Listen to my question, sir. Do you know that you have a right to look at the probation office report; do you know that?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">Later, the court noted for the record the defendant\u2019s non-cooperation with his attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">We\u2019re in a situation quite obviously where the defendant is obviously not in agreement with how this matter is going forward. So I\u2019m not going to ask him to agree to anything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">Later, in response to a sentence query about possible downward departure issues, Flores\u2019 counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-13\">The answer is \u201cno\u201d because Mr. Flores is really not communicating with me in a meaningful way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-14\">It is impossible for me to conclude from that discussion, or from any other part of the record, that the district court actually considered and issued a ruling on Flores\u2019 request for new counsel. Although a decision to deny new counsel might well have been entirely proper, a district court must respond to the request. \u201c \u2018A district court\u2019s failure to exercise discretion constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d \u2019 <em>Caudle v. Bristow Optical Co., </em>224 F.3d 1014, 1027 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Miller v. Hambrick, </em>905 F.2d 259, 262 (9th Cir.1990)). I can not discern any ruling, much less \u201csuch necessary inquiry as might ease the defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction, distrust and concern.\u201d <em>Hudson v. Rushen, </em>686 F.2d 826, 829 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-15\">Therefore, I must respectfully dissent on the question of the adequacy of the district court\u2019s consideration of Flores\u2019 motion for substitute counsel. In all other respects, I concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b746-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\">. Although the letters in which Flores initially requested new counsel were not submitted to this court, copies of at least some of those letters were made part of the district court record as \"Hearing Exhibit 2\u201d during the sentencing proceeding. We have procured Hearing Exhibit 2 from the district court, and now incorporate it into the appellate record pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 10(e)(2). It remains unclear, however, precisely which letters were received by the district court before sentencing, and when they were translated from Spanish into English.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
