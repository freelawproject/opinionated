Griesa presiding.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">On October 11, 1995, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York convicted Soler on five counts. <em>United States v. Soler, </em>1999 WL 1295331, *1 (2d Cir.1999). This Court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction on all counts, vacating and remanding only the second count\u2019s sentence. On remand, the district court refused to alter the sentence beyond the mandated adjustment. The district court also twice denied the defendant\u2019s Rule 33 motion for a new trial. <em>United States v. Soler, </em>2000 WL 385514, *1 (S.D.N.Y.2000)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">A district court\u2019s refusal to depart is reviewable only if the court misunderstood its sentencing authority. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>128 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.1997). The mandate rule requires that, on remand, a district court avoid consideration of issues decided either expressly or implicitly by the superior court unless \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d warrant further consideration. <em>See United States v. Ben Zvi, </em>242 F.3d 89, 95 (2d Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Uccio, </em>940 F.2d 753, 758 (2d Cir.1991). This Court\u2019s 1999 remand allowed the district court to alter only the Count Two sentence. <em>Soler, </em>1999 WL 1295331 at *2. Soler failed to demonstrate compelling circumstances permitting consideration beyond this mandate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court thus lacked the authority to grant additional departures; its refusal to do so is unreviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the Rule 33 motions for new trial for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Soler, </em>2000 WL 385514 at *1.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-13\">For the reasons set forth above, the district court\u2019s denial of the Rule 33 motions is AFFIRMED and the rest of the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-7\">. Soler argues that <em>United States </em>v. <em>Finley, </em>245 F.3d 199 (2d Cir.2001) prevents two \u00a7 924(c) findings in this case. Our holding in <em>United States v. Salameh, </em>261 F.3d 271 (2d Cir.2001), clarifies that <em>Finley </em>does not apply where, as here, two unique \"carryings\u201d occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
