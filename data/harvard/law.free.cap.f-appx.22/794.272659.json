We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 815 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam), and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">In opposition to defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Newton presented a letter he had sent to defendant advising him that his cell was covered in feces. Newton\u2019s letter to defendant was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material of fact as to whether defendant knew or should have known of, and disregarded a substantial risk of serious harm to Newton\u2019s health or safety. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b837-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
