Carroll\u2019s investment in the Sentinel EPE recycler leasing program entered into through the Clearwater Group partnership was a bona fide investment or simply a sham aimed at producing tax benefits. The United States Tax Court (Howard Dawson, J.) ruled that the investment was a sham and that the petitioners were not entitled to claimed partnership losses and investment and energy credits. Consequently, the court held petitioners hable for a deficiency with respect to their Federal income tax for 1981, for additions to tax under I.R.C. \u00a7 6653(a)(1) and (2) for neghgence or intentional disregard of rules or regulations, for the addition to tax under I.R.C. \u00a7 6659 for an underpayment of tax attributable to a valuation overstatement, and for additional interest under I.R.C. \u00a7 6621(c). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">We reject Appellants\u2019 argument that the Tax Court denied them due process by improperly relying on the record and conclusions in <em>Provizer v. Commissioner, </em>T.C. Memo.1992-177, <em>aff'd. per curiam without published opinion </em>996 F.2d 1216 (6th Cir. 1993). This claim borders on frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">We also reject Appellants\u2019 chahenge to the Tax Court\u2019s determination that the Clearwater investment program constituted an economic sham as well as Appellants\u2019 argument that the Tax Court improperly focused on the value of the machines rather than the possibility of profit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We also reject Appellants\u2019 challenge to the Tax Court\u2019s ruling that they were hable for the increased interest rate pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6621(c). Ultimately, the Tax Court found that based on the evidence before it, the Clearwater investment was tax motivated. We fail to see clear error and therefore defer to the Tax Court\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-15\">Finally, we affirm the Tax Court\u2019s negligence determination, as it was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Goldman v. Commissioner, </em>39 F.3d 402, 406 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-16\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-11\">. A comparison of the Sentinel EPE machine's fair market value (no more than $50,000) and the price \"paid\u201d ($1,162,667 price per machine) alone is a strong indication of the lack of economic substance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
