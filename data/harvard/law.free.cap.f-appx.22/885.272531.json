We have jurisdiction pursuant to <em>8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-17\">Where, as here, the BIA did not merely adopt the IJ\u2019s decision but conducted an independent review, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Garrovillas v. INS, </em>156 F.Sd 1010, <em>1013 </em>(9th Cir.1998) (citation omitted). Because the BIA left the IJ\u2019s positive credibility finding undisturbed, we accept Lopez-Mejia\u2019s testimony as true. <em>Khourassany v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 1096, 1100 (9th Cir.2000). We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 933 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-24\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that the guerillas\u2019 interest in Lopez-Mejia was not \u201con account of\u2019 a protected ground but because they thought she had knowledge about her eldest daughter\u2019s father, another guerilla. <em>See Aguilar-Escobar v. INS, </em>136 F.3d 1240, 1241 (9th Cir.1998). Although the record evidence supports Lopez-Mejia\u2019s contention that the government death squads sought her on account of actual or imputed political opinion, the evidence does not compel the conclusion that threats from the death squads, standing alone, establish past persecution. <em>See Lim, </em>224 F.3d at 936-37. The threats also fail to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution because the record evidence did not compel the conclusion that Lopez-Mejia\u2019s fear was objectively reasonable. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 934-35 (concluding petitioner\u2019s fear was well-founded where death threats were linked to petitioner\u2019s name appearing on a death list and evidence that others on same list had been killed). Therefore, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Lopez-Mejia is not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 964-65 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"A8UG\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
