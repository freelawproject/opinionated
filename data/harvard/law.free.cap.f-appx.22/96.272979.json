Gibbs and Wendell S. Rivers appeal their convictions and sentences of life and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, and 188 months\u2019 and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, respectively. Appellants argue their sentences violate <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the district court erred by not submitting to the jury an overt act in support of the conspiracy counts, and the Government made improper comments at closing argument. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">After a jury trial, Appellants were convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846 (West 1999) (Gibbs &amp; Rivers); conspiracy to use and carry firearms in relation to drug trafficking crimes, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c), (o) (West 2000) (Gibbs <em>&amp; </em>Rivers); using and carrying a firearm in relation to drug trafficking crimes, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1994) (Gibbs); felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2) (West 2000) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Gibbs); possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Gibbs); possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Gibbs); and using and carrying a firearm in relation to drug trafficking crimes, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Rivers).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">Under <em>Apprendi, </em>\u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490. Concerning a violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2001), \u201cthe specific threshold [drug] quantity must be treated as an element of an aggravated drug trafficking offense, <em>i.e., </em>charged in the indictment and proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150, 156-57 (4th Cir. 2001) (en banc) (footnotes omitted). The statutory maximum for cocaine and crack cocaine trafficking offenses under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b) is twenty years when drug quantity is not charged in the indictment and found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Promise, </em>255 F.3d at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">Rivers\u2019 sentence of 188 months\u2019 imprisonment is below the 240-month statutory maximum for a violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1) where no drug quantity is charged in the indictment. Therefore, Rivers\u2019 sentence does not violate <em>Apprendi. United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>v. Angle, </em>254 F.3d 514, 518 (4th Cir.2001) (en banc), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>Aug. 16, 2001 (No. 01-5838).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Gibbs did not raise an <em>Apprendi </em>claim in the district court; therefore, we review for plain error. To find plain error, Gibbs \u201cmust demonstrate that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that the error affected his substantial rights.\u201d <em>Promise, </em>255 F.3d at 154 (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). To affect substantial rights, Gibbs must show the error was prejudicial, that it \u201cactually affected the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>238 F.3d 537, 542 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Hastings, </em>134 F.3d 235, 240 (4th Cir.1998)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 2235, 150 L.Ed.2d 225 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">We conclude that under <em>White, </em>Gibbs cannot show his substantial rights were prejudiced. Gibbs received concurrent sentences of life imprisonment, twenty years\u2019 imprisonment, ten years\u2019 imprisonment, life imprisonment, and forty years\u2019 imprisonment. Under <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5G1.2(d), the district court was obligated to impose consecutive sentences on Gibbs\u2019 various convictions until it reached the total punishment of life imprisonment. <em>White, </em>238 F.3d at 542-43. The Government filed an information under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (1994); therefore, Gibbs\u2019 maximum penalty as to each of the drug counts was thirty years\u2019 imprisonment. By stacking Gibbs\u2019 sentences as mandated by USSG \u00a7 5G1.2, the district court was obligated to sentence Gibbs to 120 years\u2019 imprisonment. Consequently, Gibbs cannot show that his sentence of life imprisonment was \u201clonger than that to which he would otherwise be subject.\u201d <em>White, </em>238 F.3d at 542; <em>see also United States v. Roberts, </em>262 F.3d 286, 291 (4th Cir.2001) (applying the <em>White </em>analysis in the context of a life sentence). Therefore, Gibbs has not shown prejudice to his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">We reject the remainder of Gibbs\u2019 claims. We find no error in the court\u2019s jury instructions or the admission of the testimony regarding the murder of Audrey Stoeckle. As to the Government\u2019s closing argument, because Gibbs invited the Government\u2019s comments, and that the district court gave a curative instruction, we are satisfied that no prejudice resulted. <em>See United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 12-13, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985); <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>716 F.2d 1050, 1052 (4th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">We therefore affirm Gibbs\u2019 and Rivers\u2019 convictions and sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
