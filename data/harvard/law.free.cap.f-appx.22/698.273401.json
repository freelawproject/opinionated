Loeffler appeals the magistrate judge\u2019s order refusing to file her complaint because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and because the complaint and .accompanying application to proceed in forma pauperis were unsigned. Having carefully reviewed the record, it appears that the district court construed Loeffler\u2019s document entitled \u201cAppeal\u201d as a notice of appeal directly to this court; however we are convinced that Loeffler was attempting to appeal the magistrate judge\u2019s order to the district court as the order had specified she could do. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a) (within 10 days after being served with copy of magistrate judge\u2019s order in nondispositive matter, party may serve and file objections to order).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-18\">Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
