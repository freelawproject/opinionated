Schaefer, </em>509 U.S. 292, 113 S.Ct. 2625, 125 L.Ed.2d 239 (1993), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>Plaintiff Cheryl Whittle is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d with a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the meaning of the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA). In <em>Schaefer, </em>the Supreme Court held that a party who secures a remand under \u201csentence four\u201d of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d for purposes of the EAJA. <em>Id. </em>at 302. A party may prevail for this purpose without having obtained an award of benefits. <em>Id. </em>The 30-day clock for filing for EAJA fees begins to run upon a sentence-four remand, which is a final judgment for this purpose unless the district court retains jurisdiction. <em>Id,.; see also Holt v. Shalala, </em>35 F.3d 376, 379-80 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In this case, the EAJA clock began to run with the district court\u2019s first remand. Whittle\u2019s lawyer properly applied for EAJA fees at that time. We turn, then, to the merits of the fee request.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">The question is whether \u201cthe position of the United States was substantially justified.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). The government\u2019s position must be substantially justified at each step of the proceedings, <em>Kali v. Bowen, </em>854 F.2d 329, 332 (9th Cir.1988), and it bears the burden of showing substantial justification, <em>Flores v. Sha-lala, </em>49 F.3d 562, 569 (9th Cir.1995). The specific question is whether the government\u2019s position in defending the administrative law judge\u2019s dismissal when Whittle appeared without counsel was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d In view of <em>McNatt v. Apfel, </em>201 F.3d 1084 (9th Cir.2000), and its reasoning, we hold that the government\u2019s position was not substantially justified because it did not have a reasonable basis in the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED with instructions to award fees and expenses to Plaintiff Cheryl Whittle pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b894-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
