RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted 'without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Gary Handshy, proceeding <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint. Handshy is a prisoner in the custody of the state of Kansas. In his complaint, he alleged that computer chips were implanted in his body at the time of his birth and that prison officials were \u201chacking into\u2019\u2019 these computer chips to obtain information about him, control him, and \u201cpuppet master\u201d him. Concluding that the allegations were clearly delusional and frivolous, the district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">Handshy\u2019s brief on appeal does not contain a single citation to authority or any meaningful analysis of the propriety of the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint. Instead, Handshy\u2019s appellate brief simply reasserts the same delusional and frivolous allegations set out in his complaint. Upon <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s order of dismissal, Handshy\u2019s appellate filings, and the entire record on appeal, we conclude that this appeal is frivolous. Accordingly, this court DISMISSES this appeal pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">Despite our dismissal of this appeal, we remind Handshy that he remains obligated to continue making partial payments pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b) until the appellate filing fee is paid in full. This court\u2019s dismissal of Handshy\u2019s appeal as frivolous counts as a strike pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). The district court\u2019s dismissal of Handshy\u2019s complaint on that same ground also counts as a strike pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g). Handshy is reminded that if he accrues three strikes, he will no longer be able to proceed <em>in forma pau-peris </em>in any civil action filed in federal court unless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1015-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
