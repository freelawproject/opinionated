Killian filed a habeas motion under \u00a7 2255 on December 6, 1996. He claimed ineffective assistance of counsel for his attorney\u2019s alleged failures to perfect a direct appeal, to inform Killian that he was subject to a career offender enhancement, and to object to the Pre-Sentencing Report. On March 7, 2001, the district court found Killian raised a legitimate ineffective assis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>tance of counsel claim as to his attorney\u2019s failure to perfect a direct appeal pursuant to <em>United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39, 42 (4th Cir.1993). The court denied the remainder of Killian\u2019s ineffective assistance claims. It vacated Killian\u2019s original judgment and entered a new judgment to permit Killian a renewed opportunity to seek a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Although the district court granted Killi-an\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion insofar as it entered a new judgment, it denied the remainder of Killian\u2019s habeas claims. Because Killian has never had a direct appeal, however, taking further action on Killian\u2019s motion beyond granting his <em>Peak </em>claim was inappropriate. The district court should have dismissed the remaining claims without prejudice to Killian\u2019s right to file another habeas motion, if necessary, after a direct appeal. Moreover, as a criminal defendant has a right to counsel throughout the direct appeal, <em>see Douglas v. California, </em>372 U.S. 353, 357-58, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963), the district court should have appointed counsel for Killian when it made its ruling. Accordingly, we grant a certificate of appealability and vacate the district court\u2019s March 7 order to the extent it denied Killian\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claims other than his <em>Peak </em>claim, and remand with instructions for the district court to dismiss the <em>non-Peak </em>claims without prejudice. The district court is further instructed to appoint counsel for Killian to assist him with the pursuit of his direct appeal. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\n<em>VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
