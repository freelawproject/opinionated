Neither counsel has objected to the waiver of oral argument, and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. RApp. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-17\">In 1993, Brown filed her application for disability benefits, alleging that she suffered from low back and leg pain. Upon review of Brown\u2019s application, the administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded that she suffered from the severe impairment of a herniated disc, but she did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or equaled the requirements set forth in the Commissioner\u2019s Listing of Impairments. The ALJ also concluded that Brown retained the ability to perform a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>limited range of sedentary work. In light of her residual functional capacity (RFC), the ALJ determined that, while Brown could not perform her past relevant work, she had the ability to perform other work available in the national and regional economy. Therefore, Brown was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Following the Appeals Council\u2019s decision affirming the ALJ\u2019s determination, Brown sought judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Over her objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, concluded that substantial evidence existed to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision, and the court granted summary judgment for the defendant. In this timely appeal, Brown argues that: 1) substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that she is capable of performing other work; and 2) she suffers from disabling pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether the Commissioner\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence and whether the proper legal standards were employed in reaching the conclusion. <em>Garcia v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human </em>Servs., 46 F.3d 552, 555 (6th Cir. 1995). Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla of evidence but less than a preponderance, <em>Bell v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>105 F.3d 244, 245 (6th Cir.1996), and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Buxton v. Halter, </em>246 F.3d 762, 772 (6th Cir.2001). If supported by substantial evidence, the Commissioner\u2019s decision must be affirmed, even if the reviewing court would decide the case differently, <em>Felisky v. Bowen, </em>35 F.3d 1027, 1035 (6th Cir.1994), and even if the claimant\u2019s position is also supported by substantial evidence. <em>Bux-ton, </em>246 F.3d at 772; <em>Casey v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>987 F.2d 1230, 1233 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion regarding Brown\u2019s RFC and his determination that Brown was capable of performing other work in the regional and national economy. Additionally, the record reveals that Brown does not suffer from debilitating pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Accordingly, this court affirms the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
