We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Easter v. Angelone, </em>No. CA-00-242, (E.D. Va. June 6, 2001). We grant Easter\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pau-peris and deny his motions for appointment of counsel and for production of documents. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
