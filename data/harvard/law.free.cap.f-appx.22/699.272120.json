The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 151 months in prison and 3 years of supervised release. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and filed a brief raising the issue whether the district court erred in denying LaPointe\u2019s motion for downward departure based on the government\u2019s alleged bad-faith refusal to file a substantial-assistance departure motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The government argued in the district court that LaPointe had not provided substantial assistance, and we find that La-Pointe did not show that the government\u2019s refusal to file a motion was made in bad faith. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (defendant must show government\u2019s refusal to move for departure was not rationally related to any legitimate government purpose).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Moreover, following our independent review, see <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-11\">. The Honorable Ortrie D. Smith, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
