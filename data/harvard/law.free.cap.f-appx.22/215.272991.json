We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Robertson\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-22\">A party must file a notice of appeal within ninety days after the tax court enters its decision. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7483 (1994); Fed. R.App. P. 13(a). This appeal period is jurisdictional. <em>Spencer Med. Assoc, v. Commissioner, </em>155 F.3d 268, 269 (4th Cir. 1998). The tax court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on January 25, 2001. Robertson filed a timely motion to vacate or revise the decision, Tax Ct. R. 162, which was denied by order entered March 2, 2001. Therefore, notwithstanding his subsequent Rule 162 motions, Robertson had until May 31, 2001, to file his notice of appeal. <em>See Okon v. Commissioner, </em>26 F.3d 1025, 1026-27 (10th Cir.1994) (successive, post-decision tolling motions may not be tacked together to perpetuate the prescribed time for appeal). Robertson\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on July 10, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-23\">Accordingly, we grant the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely filed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
