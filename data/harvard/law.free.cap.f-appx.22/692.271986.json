Carter, </em>91 F.3d 1196, 1197-99 (8th Cir.1996) (per curiam). In this 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 proceeding, Carter claimed that his sentence was unlawful under <em>Ap-prendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and that the remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied relief, and Carter appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-16\">Even if his claim were cognizable in this collateral proceeding \u2014 which it is not, <em>see United States v. Moss, </em>252 F.3d 993, 999-1003 (8th Cir.2001) (concerning <em>Appren-di); United States v. Lurie, </em>207 F.3d 1075, 1077 (8th Cir.2000) (concerning whether \u00a7 2255 remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d) \u2014 relief would not be available to Carter, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (20 years imprisonment authorized for offense involving unspecified quantity of schedule I or II drugs); <em>United States v. AguayoDelgado, </em>220 F.3d 926, 934 (8th Cir.) (no <em>Apprendi </em>error where sentence was within range authorized by offense of conviction without regard to quantity), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1026, 121 S.Ct. 600, 148 L.Ed.2d 513 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-21\">Accordingly, we affirm. Carter\u2019s request for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-17\">. The Honorable David S. Doty, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, adopting the report and recommendation of the Honorable Arthur J. Boylan, United States Magistrate Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
