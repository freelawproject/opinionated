We have \u201cclearly stated that \u2018[t]he court\u2019s silence regarding authority to depart is not sufficient to indicate that the court believed it lacked power to depart.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Davoudi, </em>172 F.3d 1130, 1134 (9th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>United States v. Garcia-Garcia, </em>927 F.2d 489, 491 (9th Cir. 1991)). Here, the district court listened to defendant\u2019s argument supporting his request for a downward departure, and then proceeded to sentence Flores-Lopez without granting the departure. We assume that the district court assumed it had the authority to depart, but simply declined to exercise its discretion to do so. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>264 F.3d 813, 816 (9th Cir.2001). We lack jurisdiction to \u201creview a district court\u2019s discretionary decision refusing to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-22\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b935-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
