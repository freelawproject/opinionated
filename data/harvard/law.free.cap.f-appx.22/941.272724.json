Hickman\u2019s complaint alleges a hybrid Labor Management Relations Act \u00a7 301/National Labor Relations Act fair representation cause of action. We have jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>We review orders granting summary judgment de novo. <em>Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc). We review the interpretation of collective bargaining agreements de novo. <em>Simula, Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc., </em>175 F.3d 716, 719 (9th Cir.1999). We review denials of motions for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Minnesota Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Ensley, </em>174 F.3d 977, 987 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">The claimed basis for Hickman\u2019s discharge was \u201csevere misconduct.\u201d \u201c[Sjevere misconduct\u201d discharges do not require application of the procedural protections appropriate for \u201cjust cause\u201d discharges under the collective bargaining agreement. <em>\u201c[IJmmediate </em>discharge\u201d (emphasis added) is permitted for such misconduct. Hickman\u2019s act of misconduct, his second such act involving Summit\u2019s sole customer, qualified as \u201csevere misconduct.\u201d Hickman\u2019s discharge did not violate the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">Further, Hickman has not shown prejudice from any claimed procedural irregularity. Summit conducted a facially reasonable investigation by interviewing witnesses and soliciting Hickman\u2019s version of what happened. The grievance procedure provided for review by the Board of Adjustment. The Board heard testimony, including Hickman\u2019s denial of the reported misconduct, and upheld Summit\u2019s finding of severe misconduct. Board members testified that they simply did not find Hickman\u2019s version of events to be credible. Hickman does not question the Board\u2019s rectitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">The decision of the Board, half of whom were union members, was unanimous. Hickman has not shown that the conduct of the union in representing him throughout the grievance process was arbitrary, discriminatory or in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-12\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b983-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
