We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The ALJ found that Yarbrough was not disabled, and was not entitled to benefits, because he could perform available sedentary work. The ALJ properly rejected Yarbrough\u2019s testimony that excess pain rendered him unable to perform sedentary work. The ALJ offered specific, clear and convincing reasons why he found Yarbrough\u2019s testimony regarding the extent of his pain to be incredible. <em>See Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1282 (9th Cir.1996). The ALJ also properly rejected the testimony of Yarbrough\u2019s wife and friend regarding the extent of Yarbrough\u2019s pain because it was exaggerated and conflicted with available medical evidence. <em>See Dodrill v. Shalala, </em>12 F.3d 915, 919 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">The ALJ also properly rejected the opinion of Dr. Scoltock, Yarbrough\u2019s treating physician, that Yarbrough could not perform sedentary work. Dr. Scoltock based his estimates of Yarbrough\u2019s residual functional capacity upon Yarbrough\u2019s subjective complaints, which the ALJ found to be incredible. <em>See Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 605 (9th Cir.1989). The ALJ also noted major inconsistencies between Dr. Scoltock\u2019s responses to two questionnaires regarding Yarbrough\u2019s functional capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">We are not persuaded by Yarbrough\u2019s arguments on his remaining claims challenging the ALJ\u2019s finding as to the extent of his depression, the sufficiency of the hypothetical to the vocational expert, and the identification of transferrable skills. The ALJ applied the correct legal standards, and his decision finding that Yarbrough was not disabled is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Flaten v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Svcs., </em>44 F.3d 1453, 1457 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-10\">.
