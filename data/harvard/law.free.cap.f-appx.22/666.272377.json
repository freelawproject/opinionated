Jordan was sentenced to consecutive terms of life imprisonment. The Missouri Court of Appeals rejected Jordan\u2019s direct appeal and denied postconviction relief. <em>State v. Jordan, </em>943 S.W.2d 304 (Mo.Ct.App.1997). The court held the evidence was sufficient to sustain Jordan\u2019s convictions, and Jordan did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to object to State testimony that Jordan had \u201csquinched eyes,\u201d wasn\u2019t himself, and might have been a \u201clittle high or something\u201d on the night of the crimes. Jordan then filed a habeas petition in federal district court raising the same issues. The district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> denied Jordan\u2019s petition concluding the Missouri Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law and was not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (standard for granting habeas relief). The district court granted a certificate of appealability for us to consider the two issues. Having carefully reviewed the matter, we affirm. First, the child witness\u2019s testimony was not so self-contradictory that it was insufficient to support the convictions. Second, even if Jordan\u2019s attorney performed deficiently in failing to object to a different witness\u2019s testimony about Jordan\u2019s possible intoxication on the night of the crimes, the failure to object did not prejudice Jordan because the testimony was not central to the State\u2019s case and the attorney effectively cross-examined the witness on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">Accordingly, we affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\">The Honorable Jean C. Hamilton, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
