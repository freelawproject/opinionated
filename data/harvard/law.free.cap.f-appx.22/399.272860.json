Graham, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b441-23\">Thomas Anthony Chandler appeals pro se from a district court order that denied a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. His appeal has been referred to a panel of this court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, the panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed in this case. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-24\">Chandler pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). At a hearing on June 4,1999, he was sentenced to 210 months of incarceration and five years of supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). However, the district court\u2019s written judgment was not entered until June 15, 1999. Chandler did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-25\">On June 9, 2000, Chandler moved to vacate his sentence under \u00a7 2255, alleging: 1) that the court erroneously counted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>prior Arizona conviction when it sentenced him as an armed career criminal under \u00a7 924(e); and 2) that his attorney was ineffective because he did not bring this error to the court\u2019s attention. Chandler\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion indicated that he had been sentenced on June 4, 1999. Thus, the district court dismissed his case on July 10, 2000, as it appeared that the motion had not been filed within the applicable one-year limitations period. Chandler\u2019s motion to reconsider this judgment was denied, and he now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">In relevant part, \u00a7 2255 provides that a motion to vacate the sentence of a federal prisoner must be filed within one year of \u201cthe date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\u201d As noted by the district court, Chandler\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion indicates that he was sentenced on June 4, 1999. However, this date is not determinative because the final judgment in Chandler\u2019s criminal case was not entered until June 15, 1999. <em>See generally </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i). Moreover, it is now clear that the limitations period did not commence until the time for filing his direct appeal had elapsed. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>246 F.3d 655, 657-58 (6th Cir. 2001). Thus, Chandler\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was timely filed on June 9, 2000, the day on which it was given to prison officials for mailing. <em>See Towns v. United States, </em>190 F.3d 468, 469 (6th Cir.1999). Indeed, the motion was still timely on June 14, 2000, when it was actually filed by the district court clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings. <em>See </em>Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
