No reference was made in the indictment to Rodriguez\u2019s prior aggravated felony conviction, and Rodriguez neither admitted nor denied the earlier conviction during his plea colloquy. Rodriguez was sentenced principally to a 70 month term of imprisonment, a sentence that exceeded the two-year statutory maximum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) for illegal reentry following deportation, but fell within the twenty-year statutory maximum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) for illegal reentry following deportation subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony. Rodriguez now challenges this sentence, arguing that his prior felony conviction is an element of the offense that must be alleged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, not merely a factor permitting sentencing enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-24\">This claim is defeated by the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), that subsection (b)(2) of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 is a penalty provision and does not define a separate crime. Consequently, the Government need not charge the prior conviction in the indictment, nor prove it or obtain an ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>mission at the time of the plea. Rodriguez concedes that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>controls but raises this issue here to preserve it for further review in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which holds that any fact other than a prior conviction that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. As this Court has previously held, the <em>Apprendi </em>Court \u201ccarved out an exception that is applicable to violations of \u00a7 1326 by stating that the <em>Appren-di </em>requirement is applicable to facts \u2018[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Latorre Benavides, </em>241 F.3d 262, 264 (2d Cir.2001)(per curiam) (further citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
