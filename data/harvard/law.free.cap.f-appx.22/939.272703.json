We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-27\">The state court did not clearly err in holding that exclusion of prior incidents at the station did not render the trial fundamentally unfair. The evidence was neither relevant to a defense nor to the credibility of any witness. <em>Montana v. Egelhoff, </em>518 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>U.S. 37, 42, 116 S.Ct. 2013, 135 L.Ed.2d 361 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">The state appellate court held that the trial court\u2019s refusal to conduct an <em>in camera </em>inspection of a witness\u2019s otherwise privileged psychological records did not deny petitioner his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. After conducting an evi-dentiary hearing, the trial judge found that the witness\u2019s visits to a psychologist were unrelated to his testimony. Petitioner has not come forward with clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumptive correctness of this finding. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). Likewise, the state appellate court\u2019s holding was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law. <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 402-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring and delivering the opinion of the court).
