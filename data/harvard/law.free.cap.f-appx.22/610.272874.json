The case has been referred to this panel pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. We unanimously agree that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-17\">Dowell sued the Corrections Corporation of America (\u201cCCA\u201d) and more than two dozen individual defendants who worked for the CCA. He claimed that he was assigned to a prison cell with standing water on the floor, that he complained about the water, that nothing was done to correct the problem, that he suffered a slip-and-fall injury as a result of the defendants\u2019 failure to correct the situation, and that he has received inadequate medical care in the wake of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-19\">The district court dismissed Dowell\u2019s suit, without prejudice, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997(e) because Dowell failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-20\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Dowell\u2019s complaint without prejudice for failure to exhaust available administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-21\">Accordingly, Dowell\u2019s pending motions are denied, and we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for the reasons stated by that court in its order entered on April 18, 2001.
