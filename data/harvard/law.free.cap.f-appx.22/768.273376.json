Petitioner was convicted on May 14, 1998 of aggravated driving under the influence while one\u2019s license is suspended, revoked, or in violation of a restriction, in violation of Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 28-692 and 28-697.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-28\">In <em>United States v. Trinidad-Aquino, </em>259 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir.2001), we held that driving under the influence of alcohol and causing bodily injury, in violation of California Vehicle Code \u00a7 23153, is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. We reasoned that \u00a7 23153 can be violated through negligence, whereas a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d can be committed only with a mental state of at least recklessness. <em>See Trinidad-Aquino, </em>259 F.3d at 1144-1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-29\">Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 28-692 is similar to \u00a7 23153, but lacks the element of bodily injury. Like \u00a7 23153, it can be violated through negligence, as can \u00a7 28-697, which defines aggravated driving or actual physical control while under the influence as, inter alia, committing a violation of \u00a7 28-692 while one\u2019s driver\u2019s license is suspended, cancelled, revoked, or restricted. We therefore hold that Contreras-Sanchez was not convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and accordingly was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>not convicted of an aggravated felony as defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b811-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
