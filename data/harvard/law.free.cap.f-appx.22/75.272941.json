On appeal, he contends that a sentence longer than two years was improper under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the indictment did not allege his prior conviction of an aggravated felony, and such a conviction was neither admitted by him nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt. He concedes that \u201cthe sole issue presented on appeal\u201d (Letter from Tobar\u2019s counsel dated October 26, 2001) is governed by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Latorre-Benavides, </em>241 F.3d 262, 264 (2d Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 2013, 149 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2001), ruling that such a sentence is nonetheless permissible in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and that <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres; </em>however, Tobar pursues this appeal in order to preserve the issue for review in the Supreme Court (Letter from Tobar\u2019s counsel dated October 26, 2001). We conclude that the appeal lacks merit for the reasons stated in <em>Latorre-Bena-vides.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">We have considered all of Tobar\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
