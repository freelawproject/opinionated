George appeals pro se from a decision of the tax court determining tax deficiency for 1997 and imposing penalties. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a), and we affirm in part, and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-21\">We review de novo the tax court\u2019s conclusions of law and for clear error its findings of fact. <em>Kelley v. Comm\u2019r, </em>45 F.3d 348, 350 (9th Cir.1995). We review for abuse of discretion imposition of penalties and evidentiary sanctions. <em>See Larsen v. Comm\u2019r, </em>765 F.2d 939, 941 (9th Cir. 1985) (per curiam) (imposition of penalties pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673); <em>Smith v. Comm\u2019r, </em>800 F.2d 930, 934 (1986) (imposition of evidentiary sanctions).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-22\">The tax court properly found that George is subject to the federal system of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>taxation. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Romero, </em>640 F.2d 1014, 1016 (9th Cir.1981). The tax court acted within its discretion to impose a penalty under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673 because George pursued frivolous claims for purpose of delay. <em>See Grimes v. Comm\u2019r, </em>806 F.2d 1451, 1454 (9th Cir.1986) (per curiam). The tax court properly disallowed the deductions George urged in his proposed amended tax return, because George did not provide credible evidence to substantiate the deductions. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7491. The tax court acted within its discretion when it excluded documents George proffered at trial because, as George conceded, he did not provide the Commissioner with copies of the documents before trial, as required by the court\u2019s standing order. <em>See Smith, </em>800 F.2d at 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">As the Commissioner concedes, the tax court erred by failing to credit George for $2,154.48 in social security overpayments. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3101(a), 3121(a)(1); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 31.3101-2(a), 31.3121(a)(l)-l; 1997 Cost-of-Living Increase and Other Determinations, 61 Fed. Reg. 55346 (Oct. 25, 1996). We therefore remand for recalculation of George\u2019s deficiency in light of this credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED and REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b976-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
