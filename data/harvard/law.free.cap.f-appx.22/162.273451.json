The district court affirmed her conviction and sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>tenee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, Smith alleges that the district court erred by affirming the magistrate judge\u2019s decision to deny her motions to suppress her confession and certain evidence seized during a warrantless search of her pocketbook. Specifically, Smith alleges that her confession should have been suppressed because she was not advised of her rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and that officers should have obtained a warrant prior to searching her pocketbook. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">We review the magistrate judge\u2019s ultimate suppression decision <em>de novo, </em>but the underlying factual decisions are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). After reviewing all of the circumstances, we find that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required because Smith was not in custody when she made her confession. <em>Stansbury v. California, </em>511 U.S. 318, 322, 114 S.Ct. 1526, 128 L.Ed.2d 293 (1994); <em>United States v. Braxton, </em>112 F.3d 777, 781-83 (4th Cir.1997).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">We further find that the magistrate judge and district court properly denied Smith\u2019s motion to suppress marijuana found in her pocketbook. Smith did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy after leaving the pocketbook in a locker beyond the twenty-four hour rental period. <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>908 F.2d 281, 285 (8th Cir.1990). Moreover, Smith abandoned the pocketbook by failing to make any attempt to retrieve it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, it was not unreasonable for officers to inspect what appeared to be abandoned property to determine the owner\u2019s identity. <em>United States v. O'Bryant, </em>775 F.2d 1528, 1534 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order affirming the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of Smith\u2019s motions to suppress. We further affirm Smith\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court, and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-23\">. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3401 (West Supp.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\">. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3402 (West Supp.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\">.
