We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Smith contends on appeal that counsel did not inform him of the basis for the 1997 dismissal of his direct appeal until October 2000. Even if his discovery of the basis for dismissal could be considered newly discovered evidence, Smith did not exercise due diligence in obtaining that evidence, so he has not satisfied the timeliness requirements of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>Nos. CR-97-75; CA-01-950-AM (E.D.Va. July 24, 2001); <em>see also United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 151 (4th Cir.2001) (holding that claims under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), are not cognizable in proceedings pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
