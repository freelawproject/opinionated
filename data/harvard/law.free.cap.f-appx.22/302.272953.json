We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1994), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (1994); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The report and recommendation from which McLean appeals does not constitute an order over which this court may exercise jurisdiction. We therefore deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. McLean\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel, to remand the case, to stay the case, and for general relief are denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
