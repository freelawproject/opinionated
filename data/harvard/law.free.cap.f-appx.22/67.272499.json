She subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction seeking an award of interim benefits pending a final determination of her disability claim. The district court denied this motion. Moreover, on November 2000, the district court granted the Social Security Administration\u2019s (\u201cSSA\u201d) motion to dismiss her complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, because she had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. Perez appeals from both of these orders. We find no error in the district court\u2019s orders and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-22\">Perez filed her complaint while her request for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision was still pending before the Appeals Council. Appellant has therefore failed to exhaust her administrative remedies and, as a consequence, the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over her claim. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (to be entitled to judicial review, a claimant must exhaust administrative remedies by obtaining a final decision from the Commissioner); <em>Mathews v. Chater, </em>891 F.Supp. 186, 188 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (holding that a determination is only final after the Appeals Council has denied review or decided the case after review), <em>ajfd, </em>101 F.3d 681 (2d Cir.1996) (table).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-23\">This Court reviews an order granting or denying a preliminary injunction for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>abuse of discretion. <em>See Forest City Daly Hous., Inc. v. Town of North Hempstead, </em>175 F.3d 144, 149 (2d Cir.1999). The Social Security Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d) authorizes the payment of SSI benefits on an interim basis only if (1) an individual applying for SSI based on disability is determined to be presumptively disabled and otherwise eligible for SSI, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(a)(4)(B); (2) an ALJ has determined that a claimant is entitled to benefits, and the Commissioner\u2019s final decision is not issued within 110 days, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(a)(8)(A); or (3) a hearing is pending with respect to whether SSI benefits should have been terminated, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(a)(7)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction when the SSA had not yet determined whether appellant was \u201cdisabled\u201d within the meaning of the Social Security Act, and there was no claim that she was presumptively disabled. <em>See Fitzgerald v. Apfel, </em>148 F.3d 232, 234-35 (3rd Cir.1998) (holding that district court lacked jurisdiction over claim for interim benefits during pendency of administrative proceedings); <em>Doughty v. Bowen, </em>839 F.2d 644, 647 (10th Cir.1988) (holding that district court cannot order payment of interim benefits on remand where claimant was initially denied benefits and had never obtained a final judgment finding him disabled); <em>Taylor v. Heckler, </em>769 F.2d 201, 202 (4th Cir.1985) (holding that district court lacked authority to award interim benefits to claimant during pendency of district court\u2019s remand of action, after initial denial of benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Accordingly, for the reasons discussed, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
