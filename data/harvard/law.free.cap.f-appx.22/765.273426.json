We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-17\">Preacher contends that the district court erred by departing upward from criminal history category III category IV based on uncounted tribal convictions because: it failed to specify how the tribal court convictions had not been adequately represented in Preacher\u2019s criminal history; how Preacher\u2019s criminal history was more serious than other defendants in category III; and because the tribal court convictions are not of a sufficiently serious nature to warrant departure. We review de novo whether the grounds relied upon by the district court are sufficient to warrant an upward departure and for an abuse of discretion, the extent of such a departure. <em>United States v. Lopez-Alvarez, </em>970 F.2d 583, 589 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-18\">When departing upward, a district court must explain the reasoning for both the direction and degree of its departure in sufficiently specific language to allow us to conduct a meaningful review. <em>United States v. Streit, </em>962 F.2d 894, 902 (9th Cir.1992). Moreover, when, as here, a district court departs upward because a defendant\u2019s criminal history category under-represents the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct, the degree of departure must be guided by analogy to higher criminal history categories. <em>Streit, </em>962 F.2d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-19\">Here, the district court stated that Preacher had at least 10 and possibly 14 tribal convictions and that if these convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>tions had occurred in state court, his criminal history category \u201cwould have been at least a IV or V.\u201d Although tribal court convictions are not counted for purposes of calculating criminal history, they may be considered for purposes of assessing the adequacy of a defendant\u2019s criminal history under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(i). Our review of the record supports the district court\u2019s foregoing determination. Indeed, at the time of his conviction, Preacher had 5 criminal history points under the guidelines, placing him squarely in criminal history category III. Among Preacher\u2019s 14 uncounted tribal convictions were offenses which had they not been convictions in tribal court, would have increased Preacher\u2019s criminal history to at least category IV if not beyond. <em>See United States v. Goshea, </em>94 F.3d 1361, 1364 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Because the district court stated its reasoning with sufficient particularly to allow review, and because our review of the record shows that the district court\u2019s reasoning was sound, we determine that the district court did not abuse its discretion by departing upward to account for Preacher\u2019s tribal court convictions. <em>See id, </em>94 F.3d at 1364-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b808-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
