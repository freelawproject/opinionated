Bailey also claims that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Huey v. Stine, </em>230 F.3d 226 (6th Cir.2000), does not bar his claims because he is not challenging the misconduct, but simply that the force used to subdue him was excessive in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Bailey also raises several other issues that do not warrant mention.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-19\">Having reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the record, and the applicable law, we AFFIRM the judgment of the lower court for the reasons set forth in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s exhaustive opinion dated February 16,2001.
