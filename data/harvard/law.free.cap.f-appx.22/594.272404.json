Michael REVELS, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b636-13\">No. 01-3356.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b636-14\">United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b636-16\">Dec. 5, 2001.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b636-17\">Before KENNEDY, MOORE, and COLE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b636-18\">Michael Revels appeals his judgment of conviction and sentence. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-19\">In December 2000, Revels pleaded guilty to distribution of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. Revels was sentenced to 15 months of imprisonment. Revels has filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-20\">On appeal, Revels\u2019s counsel has filed a motion to withdraw and a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and he submits the following issue for review: whether Revels was entitled to a reduction in his offense level based on his minor role in the offense under USSG \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-21\">Upon review, we conclude that the record reflects that the district court properly sentenced Revels. A defendant may only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>seek review of his sentence on the grounds that: 1) the sentence was imposed in violation of law; 2) the sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the guidelines; 3) the sentence represented an upward departure from the applicable guidelines range; or 4) the sentence is a plainly unreasonable sentence imposed for an offense for which there is no sentencing guideline. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a); <em>United States v. Lively, </em>20 F.3d 193, 196-97 (6th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Lavoie, </em>19 F.3d 1102, 1103 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Revels has not presented any issues which fit these criteria. Revels\u2019s total offense level was 14 and his Criminal History Category Score was I. This resulted in a total guidelines imprisonment range of 15-21 months. Thus, Revels\u2019s sentence of 15 months was within the applicable guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Moreover, the district court properly denied Revels a reduction in his offense level based on his alleged minor role in the offense. <em>United States v. Owusu, </em>199 F.3d 329, 337 &amp; n. 2 (6th Cir.2000). To qualify for a reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2, a defendant must be less culpable than most other participants and substantially less culpable than the average participant. <em>United States v. Lloyd, </em>10 F.3d 1197, 1220 (6th Cir.1993). A review of the record reflects that Revels\u2019s role in the offense was pivotal or necessary to its success. Thus, the district court properly declined to grant Revels a reduction for being a minor participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">In addition, we have reviewed the record, including the transcripts of the plea and sentencing hearings, and have discovered no error warranting reversal of Revels\u2019s conviction or sentence. Revels entered a valid guilty plea. <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 749, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970). A review of the record reflects that Revels understood the rights he was waiving and the potential penalties associated with his crimes. In addition, Revels acknowledged his guilt to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
