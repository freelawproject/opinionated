We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-24\">Wainwright contends the district court erred by revoking his supervised release because there was no evidence that he violated the terms of his release. We review the district court\u2019s decision to revoke a term of supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Schmidt, </em>99 F.3d 315, 319-20 (9th Cir. 1996), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Palomba, </em>182 F.3d 1121, 1123 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-25\">Wainwright\u2019s contention is without merit. At the revocation hearing, evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>was presented that there was a struggle between Wainwright and his ex-girlfriend, and that his ex-girlfriend sustained some injuries. Because there was evidence that Wainwright committed an assault, the district court did not abuse its discretion by revoking Wainwright\u2019s supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Schmidt, </em>99 F.3d at 320 (noting violation of supervised release may be found by only by a preponderance of the evidence); <em>Washington v. Bland, </em>71 Wash.App. 345, 860 P.2d 1046, 1050-51 (Wash.Ct.App. 1993); Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 9A.36.041(1) (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b950-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-19\">. The government's motion to supplement the record is GRANTED. The government has requested we dismiss Wainwright\u2019s appeal under the fugitive disentitlement doctrine. As Wainwright has been returned to custody, we exercise our discretion not to dismiss his appeal. See <em>Ortega-Rodriguez v.
