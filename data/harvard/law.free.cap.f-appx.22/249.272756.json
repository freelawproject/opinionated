The district court found that Rodriguez-Montoya had been convicted of a prior aggravated felony, making the statutory maximum a twenty-year term of imprisonment. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Rodriguez-Montoya contends that he should have been sentenced under the provisions of \u00a7 1326(a), which provides a maximum sentence of two years, because the Government did not charge a violation of \u00a7 1326(b)(2) in the indictment. As Rodriguez-Montoya did not raise this objection below, we review his claim for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Because the Supreme Court has held that \u00a7 1326(b)(2) sets forth a sentencing factor rather than an element of the offense, this claim is without merit. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Moreover, we reject Rodriguez-Montoya\u2019s assertion that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was overruled by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1202, 121 S.Ct. 1214, 149 L.Ed.2d 126 (2001); <em>United States v. Gatewood, </em>230 F.3d 186, 192 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">We accordingly affirm Rodriguez-Montoya\u2019s sentence and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
