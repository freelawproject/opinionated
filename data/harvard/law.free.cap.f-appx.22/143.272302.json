We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See Judd v. United States, </em>No. CA-00-213 (S.D.W.Va. May 24, 2001). We also deny Judd\u2019s \u201cEmergency Motion for En Bane Rehearing of September 6, 2001 Order,\u201d which we construe as a motion for reconsideration of that order under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 27(b). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
