The district court determined they do not and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1981 claims. During the pendency of the appeal, this Court ruled on this issue in <em>Skinner v. Maritz, Inc., </em>253 F.3d 337 (8th Cir.2001). In <em>Skinner, </em>we held that under Missouri law the relationship between at-will employees and them employers is contractual and, accordingly, that such employees may maintain \u00a7 1981 actions against their employers. On the basis of <em>Skinner, </em>the order of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
