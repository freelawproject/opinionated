We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Krein v. Norris, </em>250 F.3d 1184, 1187 (8th Cir.2001) (jurisdiction will be raised sua sponte when there is indication it is lacking, even if parties concede issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-22\">The district court granted Jones-Bey an extension of time to file a notice of appeal in this case, but there is no indication that he filed the notice. Further, because Jones-Bey\u2019s motion for an extension of time to appeal was filed more than thirty days following entry of judgment, he was required to give defendants notice of his motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5)(B). Because he did not do so, the district court lacked authority to grant the extension. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number><em>See Bartunek v. Bubak, </em>941 F.2d 726, 728 (8th Cir.1991) (after initial 30-day appeal period expired, district court was without jurisdiction to act on ex parte motion to extend time; thus, its order granting motion was void). Jones-Be/s May 2000 premature \u201cNotice of Intent to Appeal\u201d the initial dismissal of two defendants, which the district court treated as a motion for reconsideration, does not provide a basis for saving any portion of the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
