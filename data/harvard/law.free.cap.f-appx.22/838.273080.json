Romaine\u2019s motion to broaden the certificate of appealability to include both issues is GRANTED. For the reasons that follow, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-16\">Romaine\u2019s appeal turns on whether his Petition for Review of the Arizona Superi- or Court\u2019s dismissal of his state Rule 32 Petition was \u201ctimely filed\u201d as a matter of Arizona law. Romaine\u2019s Petition for Review was due on September 18, 1995. As a matter of clearly established Arizona law, Romaine\u2019s Petition for Review was timely \u201cfiled\u201d on September 16, 1995, the date that it was signed and submitted by Romaine to prison officials for forwarding to the court. <em>State v. Rosario, </em>195 Ariz. 264, 987 P.2d 226, 228 (Ariz.Ct.App.1999); <em>Mayer v. State, </em>184 Ariz. 242, 908 P.2d 56, 58 (Ariz.Ct.App.1995). Because the Petition for Review was \u201cproperly filed,\u201d AED-PA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations was tolled throughout the time that Romaine\u2019s Rule 32 Petition was pending in Arizona state court. <em>Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 8, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000). Romaine\u2019s federal habeas petition was, therefore, timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-21\">The Arizona Court of Appeals, in its \u201clast reasoned opinion\u201d regarding Romaine\u2019s state Rule 32 Petition, incorrectly found that Romaine\u2019s Petition for Review was filed on September 19, 1995 (the day that it was received by the court), not on September 17, 1995 (the day that it was received by prison authorities), and incorrectly concluded, therefore, that it was untimely filed. <em>Lambright v. Stewart, </em>241 F.3d 1201, 1205 (9th Cir.2001). This conclusion is contrary to the above-described Arizona law that is \u201cclear, consistently applied, and well-established,\u201d <em>see Wells v. Maass, </em>28 F.3d 1005, 1010 (9th Cir.1994), and is not, therefore, an independent and adequate state ground precluding federal habeas review of Romaine\u2019s claims, <em>see Martinez v. Klauser, </em>266 F.3d 1091, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>We reverse the district court\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b880-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
