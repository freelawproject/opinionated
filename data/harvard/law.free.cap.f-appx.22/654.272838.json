After hearing testimony from several government witnesses, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> determined that Davis was responsible for slightly less than 15 kilograms of methamphetamine, and sentenced him to 240 months imprisonment and 4 years supervised release. On appeal, Davis\u2019s attorney has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Davis has filed a pro se supplemental brief and moved to dismiss counsel\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-19\">Counsel challenges the district court\u2019s drug-quantity calculation. Having reviewed the sentencing transcript, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in crediting the testimony of the witnesses. <em>See United States v. Santana, </em>150 F.3d 860, 864 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-20\">We understand Davis to argue that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); his indictment was defective because it charged him with a lower drug quantity than that for which he was sentenced; a pre-arrest search of his residence was illegal; and his counsel was ineffective. We reject these arguments. Davis\u2019s sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum for the charged drug quantity, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(viii); <em>United States v. Aguayo-Delgado, </em>220 F.3d 926, 933 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1026, 121 S.Ct. 600, 148 L.Ed.2d 513 (2000), and he waived his illegal-search claim by pleading guilty without a conditional plea agreement, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2); <em>United States v. Beck, </em>250 F.3d 1163, 1166 (8th Cir.2001). As to his assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel, such a claim should be raised in a postconviction proceeding. <em>See Santana, </em>150 F.3d at 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-21\">Having found no other nonfrivolous issues for appeal upon our independent review pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we affirm the judgment of the district court, deny Davis\u2019s motion, and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-17\">.
