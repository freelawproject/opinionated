The record does not contain a transcript of the hearing in which the court stated its reasons for dismissing the action. Abrams has the burden of including in the record on appeal a transcript of all parts of the proceedings material to the issues raised on appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 10(b); 4th Cir. Local R. 10(c). Appellants proceeding on appeal in forma pauperis are entitled to transcripts at government expense only in certain circumstances. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f) (1994). By failing to produce a transcript or to qualify for the production of a transcript at government expense, Abrams has waived review of the issues on appeal which depend upon the transcript to show error. <em>See Powell v. Estelle, </em>959 F.2d 22, 26 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Keller v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>827 F.2d 952, 954 n. 1 (4th Cir.1987). Accordingly, we therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge. We deny Abrams\u2019 motion to expedite and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED..</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
