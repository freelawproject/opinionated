We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. As to Pittman\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of his claim that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary, we dismiss on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Pittman v. Lee, </em>No. CA-99-246-1-MU (W.D.N.C. filed Mar. 26, 2001; entered Mar. 27, 2001). Pittman filed a motion to supplement his informal brief to raise an additional claim, namely that the district court erred by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing. Although we grant Pittman\u2019s motion, we find that the district court did not err by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing. Pittman\u2019s remaining claims are dismissed because a knowing and voluntary guilty plea waives all antecedent non-jurisdictional defects. <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973). Accordingly, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauper-is, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-19\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
