Amjad sought reopening in order to apply for an adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident on the basis of his marriage to a United States citizen. The BIA denied his motion in part because Amjad failed to attach the adjustment of status application, as was required under the regulations. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2.(c). We affirm the BIA\u2019s decision on that ground. Accordingly, we deny Amjad\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b799-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
