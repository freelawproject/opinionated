Those counts charged him under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1) with making false statements on IRS forms 5754, which he completed when claiming gambling winnings at racetracks. The government alleges that the forms he submitted were false because they omitted the persons who were actually entitled to the winnings, and thus created the false impression that all of the receipts should have been taxable to Greulich. Greulich completed the first part of the two-part form, entitled \u201cPerson to Whom Winnings are Paid,\u201d by listing himself. Part II of the form, which was labeled \u201cPerson to Whom Winnings are Taxable,\u201d instructed the person filling out the form to list all persons, including himself, entitled to any portion of the proceeds. Greulich failed to fill out this Part of the form at all, and thus failed to fist himself or any other persons. As a result he did not furnish <em>any </em>names of persons who were entitled to the payment. Accordingly, he did not violate the certification made under penalty of perjury that \u201cthe names ... <em>which I have furnished, ... </em>correctly identify each person entitled to any portion of the payment....\u201d (emphasis added). The conviction on these counts must therefore be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">In contrast, on the form 5754 that serves as the basis for count six, Greulieh listed two names in Part II of the form. The names he furnished, however, did not \u201ccorrectly identify each person entitled to any portion of [the] payment,\u201d because he omitted the name of Philip Ramirez, who was entitled to the funds. Accordingly, the conviction on that count is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">Greulich\u2019s conspiracy conviction is also affirmed. The object of the conspiracy was to obtain tax refunds to which Greu-lich was not otherwise entitled by overstating his losses on his tax return and submitting inaccurate tax forms. The testimony of his co-conspirator, as well as documentary evidence, established the necessary elements of this conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Lennick, </em>18 F.3d 814, 818 (9th Cir.1994) (listing elements).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">Finally, Greulich appeals his conviction on two counts of filing false tax returns. On both his 1995 and 1996 tax returns, Greulich attached forms containing false statements. His 1995 return included two forms W-2G, on which he certified that \u201cno other person is entitled to any part of these payments.\u201d However, the testimony showed that another gambler, James Wilkinson, was entitled to those payments. Greulich\u2019s 1996 tax return included as an attachment the untruthful form 5754 at issue in count 6. We affirm Greulich\u2019s conviction for false statements on these two tax returns because the forms containing misrepresentations were attached to his forms 1040 and therefore became \u201cintegral parts\u201d of that filing. <em>United States v. Ladum, </em>141 F.3d 1328, 1335 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">Greulich\u2019s convictions on counts three, four and five are REVERSED, his convictions on the remaining counts are AFFIRMED, and the case is REMANDED <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>for re-sentencing in light of this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-7\">.

In truth, there <em>were </em>such persons, and the government proved that the defendant knew that. Because the government proved that the defendant\u2019s declarations in Counts 3, 4 and 5 were wilfully and knowingly false, I would affirm the district court as to all counts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
