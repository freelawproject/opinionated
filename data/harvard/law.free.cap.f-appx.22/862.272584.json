Ascuncion Gonzalez-Melendres (\u201cPetitioner\u201d), a native and citizen of Mexico, petitions for review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), which found Petitioner removable from the United States based on his 1993 conviction for \u201cpossession of a firearm by a felon\u201d in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 12025(a). Petitioner is an alien who had permanent legal resident status in the United States since 1988, prior to the Immigration and Naturalization Service\u2019s is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>suance of the Order to Show Cause. We retain \u201cjurisdiction to determine whether jurisdiction exists\u201d and to conclude whether an alien has been convicted for the purpose of removal in immigration proceedings. <em>Flores-Miramontes v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 1133, 1135-36 (9th Cir.2000). We must dismiss an alien\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction, however, if it is determined that Petitioner was convicted under any law of the United States for a firearm offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(C) (1994). We review the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>although the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the meaning of the statute is entitled to deference. <em>INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 424-25, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Petitioner argues that the expungement of his 1993 conviction by order of the Superior Court of California on January 24, 1996, eliminates the conviction as a ground for removal in immigration proceedings. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Murillo-Espinoza v. INS, </em>261 F.3d 771 (9th Cir.2001), which held that convictions expunged under state rehabilitative statutes remain viable as grounds for removal in immigration proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 774: <em>see also Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. at 424, 119 S.Ct. 1439.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Because the Petitioner was convicted of a firearms offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A), we must dismiss this petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b904-27\"> This disposition is inappropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
