We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-25\">Patterson contends that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) amended 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), such that it describes a separate crime, not a sentencing factor. Patterson further contends that his sentence should not have been enhanced under subsection (b)(2) because it only applies to aliens who have been \u201cremoved\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>and the indictment to which he pleaded guilty only alleged that he had been \u201cdeported.\u201d We reject both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">We previously concluded that subsection (b)(2) is a sentencing factor, see <em>United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir.2001), and we are not persuaded by Patterson\u2019s arguments to the contrary. Moreover, we have already determined that there is no legally significant difference between deportation and removal for purposes of \u00a7 1326, and thus, Patterson\u2019s claim that subsection (b)(2) is not applicable to him because he pleaded guilty to deportation, not removal, is also rejected. <em>United States v. Lopez-Gonzalez, </em>183 F.3d 933, 934-35 (9th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, 528 </em>U.S. 1126, 120 S.Ct. 957, 145 L.Ed.2d 830 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b936-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
