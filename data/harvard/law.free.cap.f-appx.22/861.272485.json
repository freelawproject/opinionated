Misrahi claimed that Kaiser, her former employer, violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq., </em>and that she was entitled to punitive damages. The parties are familiar with the facts of this case, so we do not recount them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Because the summary judgment record establishes that she could not, \u201cwith or without reasonable accommodation, perform the essential functions\u201d of her position as an occupational therapist, Misrahi was not a \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d as defined by the ADA. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). Although the accommodations Misrahi proposed would have assisted her in performing many of the job\u2019s essential functions, undisputed facts show that someone other than Misrahi would still have had to perform some other essential job functions. Thus, Misrahi is not entitled to the protection of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12111(8), 12112.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b904-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
