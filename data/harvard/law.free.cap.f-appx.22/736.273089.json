INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-24\">The BIA\u2019s decision must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). To justify a reversal of the BIA\u2019s decision, the evidence must compel the opposite result. <em>Id. </em>at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-25\">The BIA did not err when it determined that Muong was not entitled to asylum. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>The evidence demonstrated that Muong and his family lived peacefully in New Zealand for over six years and obtained citizenship there. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(c)(2)(i)(B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.15(a); <em>Cheo v. INS, </em>162 F.3d 1227, 1229 (9th Cir.1998). Muong remained in New Zea-land considerably longer than necessary to arrange onward travel, and his living arrangements were not restricted by the authorities in New Zealand. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Muong was firmly resettled in New Zea-land before he came to the United States. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481, 112 S.Ct. 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Boravy Muong\u2019s motion for reconsideration of this court\u2019s July 13, 2001, order is denied. The Muongs\u2019 request for attorneys\u2019 fees is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b778-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
