The district court determined that McKeithan was an armed career criminal, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000), and sentenced him to a 180 month term of imprisonment. McKeithan appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-24\">McKeithan contends that his sentence as an armed career criminal under \u00a7 924(e) is unconstitutional under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We conclude, however, that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to McKeithan\u2019s enhanced sentence under \u00a7 924(e) because it is based on his prior convictions, a factor that was specifically excluded from the holding of <em>Apprendi. </em>Contrary to McKeithan\u2019s assertions, <em>Apprendi </em>expressly declined to revisit the holding of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), that prior felony convictions are merely sentencing enhancements, rather than elements of the offense. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 488-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>see also United States v. Skidmore, </em>254 F.3d 635, 642 (7th Cir.2001) (holding that Apprendi does not affect enhanced sentence under \u00a7 924(e)); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>242 F.3d 1028, 1035 (11th Cir.) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 2616, 150 L.Ed.2d 770 (2001); <em>United States v. Dorris, </em>236 F.3d 582, 586-88 (10th Cir.2000) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 1635, 149 L.Ed.2d 495 (2001); <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number><em>Mack, </em>229 F.3d 226, 235 n. 12 (3d Cir.2000) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 2015, 149 L.Ed.2d 1016 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">We therefore affirm McKeithan\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
