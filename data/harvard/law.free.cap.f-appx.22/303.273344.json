He was sentenced to one year and one day in prison and three years of supervised re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>lease on each count, to run concurrently, and $440 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Bennett argues the district court erred when it applied <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B5.1(b)(2) (2000) to enhance his sentence. Section 2B5.1(b)(2) provides for an offense level enhancement for a defendant who manufactured or produced counterfeit currency or possessed devices or materials used to counterfeit currency. This guideline, however, \u201cdoes not apply to persons who merely photocopy notes or otherwise produce items that are so obviously counterfeit that they are unlikely to be accepted even if subjected to only minimal scrutiny.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B5.1(b)(2), comment, (n. 4); <em>see United States v. Miller, </em>77 F.3d 71, 76 (4th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We review the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo and findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>253 F.3d 789, 791-92 (4th Cir. 2001). We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and joint appendix and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm Bennett\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
