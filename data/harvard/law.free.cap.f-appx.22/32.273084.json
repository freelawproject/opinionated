The district court determined that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant, a Texas firm, and dismissed the action on that basis. The court thereafter denied the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">We have scoured the record and carefully considered the parties\u2019 briefs and arguments. We conclude that this appeal is timely only as to the district court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Rodriguez-Antuna v. Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>871 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1989). Given the exiguous showing made by the plaintiff, that denial plainly was within the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 3 (\u201cPlaintiffs, if they had a case to make, should have made it in a timely fashion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">We add, moreover, that even if we were to consider the underlying question of personal jurisdiction, we would uphold the district court\u2019s order of dismissal. The plaintiffs reliance on the unsupported allegations in her complaint and memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss is manifestly insufficient to make out a prima facie case for <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Barrett v. Lombardi, </em>239 F.3d 23, 26-27 (1st Cir.2001); <em>Boit v. Gar-Tec Prods., Inc., </em>967 F.2d 671, 675 (1st Cir. 1992); <em>see also Donatelli v. Nat'l Hockey League, </em>893 F.2d 459, 463 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that a finding of general personal jurisdiction requires a showing of \u201ccontinuous and systematic contacts\u201d with the forum state).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">We need go no further. This appeal is groundless and, therefore, the judgment below may be summarily affirmed. <em>See </em>1st Cir. R. 27(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-9\">. While a motion to alter or amend a judgment may toll the running of the appeal period, the plaintiff\u2019s motion for reconsideration was not filed within ten days of the date of the entry of the judgment and, thus, did not operate to toll the appeal period. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) (fixing ten-day window). Since the plaintiff's notice of appeal was filed more than thirty days after the date of entry of judgment, it is untimely vis-a-vis the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1). The notice of appeal was, however, filed within thirty days of the district court's denial of the motion for reconsideration. It is, therefore, timely as to that order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
