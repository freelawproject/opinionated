Cowo seeks to have his conviction vacated and to be deported to Belize or, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the alternative, to have the case remanded for the district court to make a determination of whether he was prejudiced by the failure to be informed of his right to consular notification.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">We need not decide whether the failure to inform Cowo at the time of his arrest of his right to consular notification violated the Vienna Convention. The district court did not err in denying Cowo\u2019s motion to suppress. This court recently held in an en banc decision that \u201cirrespective of whether or not the [Vienna Convention] create[s] individual rights to consular notification, the appropriate remedies do not include suppression of evidence or dismissal of the indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Li, </em>206 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 956, 121 S.Ct. 379, 148 L.Ed.2d 292 (2000). Cowo argues that <em>Li </em>was wrongly decided. \u201cEven if we assume, for argument\u2019s sake, that in some extraordinary circumstance a panel might be warranted in declaring an earlier en banc decision obsolete and refusing to follow it, the appellant has offered no adequate justification for applying such a long-odds exception here.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Dutra Constr. Co., Inc., </em>230 F.3d 461 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Gilberto Cowo\u2019s conviction and sentence are <em>affirmed. See </em>Loc .R 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
