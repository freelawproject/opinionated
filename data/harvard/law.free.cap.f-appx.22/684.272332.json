The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted summary judgment to ap-pellee Max Mobley because he was not involved in the knee surgery decision. After an evidentiary hearing, the court (1) dismissed the claims against Dr. Arvindra Brar because she repeatedly treated Bar-field\u2019s knee condition, and his assertion that he required knee surgery was simply a disagreement over the proper course of medical treatment; and (2) dismissed the claims against Regina Jacob because she did nothing but respond to Barfield\u2019s grievances by reviewing his medical file. Barfield appeals these rulings. After de novo review of the record, we affirm for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s orders and deny Barfield\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-16\">.
