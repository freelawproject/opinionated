R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b951-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-23\">Raymundo Rangel-Nino appeals his 29-month, 1-week sentence after a guilty-plea conviction to being found in the United States after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. We have jurisdiction pursuant .to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and affirm, in part, and dismiss, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-24\">Rangel-Nino first contends the district court erred by not finding his prior assault and possession of cocaine convictions to be related pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). Because Rangel-Nino did not object at the sentencing hearing, we review sentencing determinations for plain error. <em>See United States v. Scrivner, </em>114 F.3d 964, 970 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-25\">Rangel-Nino\u2019s contention is without merit. Although the government concedes the district court erred, Rangel-Nino\u2019s substantial rights were not affected as his criminal history category would have remained the same. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>153 F.3d 1037, 1046 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-26\">Rangel-Nino also contends the district court erred by denying him a downward departure for overrepresentation of his criminal history score. The district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>discretionary decision not to depart downward from the sentencing guidelines, however, is not renewable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Lipman, </em>133 F.3d 726, 729 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">AFFIRMED in part, DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b951-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
