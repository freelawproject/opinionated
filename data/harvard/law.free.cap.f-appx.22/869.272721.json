Sanchez failed to appear at his deportation hearing, and was deported <em>in absentia. </em>He sought to have the order rescinded on the ground that he failed to receive notice of the hearing. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(c)(3)\u00ae; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.23(b)(4)(iii). His motion to rescind the <em>in absentia </em>order was denied by the IJ on June 16, 1997. Sanchez then filed a motion to reopen his deportation proceedings for purposes of applying for adjustment of status on June 18, 1997. In its decision, the BIA states that Sanchez was required to file his motion to reopen within 90 days of the IJ\u2019s decision of June 16, which represented the final administrative order in the case. Because the motion was filed only two days after the IJ decision, it was timely, and the BIA erred in denying it as untimely. We remand to the BIA with directions to consider on the merits Sanchez\u2019s motion to reopen for purposes of applying for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-23\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b911-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-26\">John Ashcroft is substituted for his predecessor, Janet Reno, as Attorney General of the United States.
