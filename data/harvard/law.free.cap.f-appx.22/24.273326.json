Sanchez-Alvarez appeals from the five-year mandatory minimum sentence he received following his guilty plea to one count of possession with intent to distribute heroin. He claims that the district court erred in denying him the benefit of the safety valve provision of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5C1.2 and 2Dl.l(b)(6). Specifically, Alberto Sanchez challenges the sentencing court\u2019s finding that he failed to meet the safety valve requirement that he truthfully provide the government with all information and evidence he has concerning the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. The sentencing court found that Alberto Sanchez had not been candid in his debriefing interview with U.S. Customs agents and that his testimony at the sentencing hearing was untruthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-21\">\u201cWe review for clear error the factual findings underlying the district court\u2019s determination that the safety valve was unavailable.\u201d <em>United States v. Woods, </em>210 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir.2000). The record indicates that following an evidentiary hearing at which defense counsel cross-examined the government\u2019s two witnesses and argued vigorously in favor of the application of the safety valve provision, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>district court, after carefully considering all the evidence, determined that the provision did not apply because Alberto Sanchez had not been truthful. That finding is amply supported by the record evidence. Under these circumstances, the sentencing court did not err in denying Alberto Sanchez the benefit of the safety valve provision. <em>See United States v. White, </em>119 F.3d 70, 74 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Alberto Sanchez objects that the district court should not have permitted U.S. Customs Agent Richard Roark to testify at the sentencing hearing about the meaning of encoded language used in a recorded telephone conversation between Alberto Sanchez and a co-defendant because Agent Roark was not qualified as an expert. Appellant\u2019s reliance upon Fed.R.Evid. 702 is misplaced. \u201cThe Federal Rules of Evidence do not pertain during the sentencing phase of a criminal trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>144 F.3d 104, 108 (1st Cir. 1998). Moreover, \u201c[e]ven in a trial setting, we often have permitted law enforcement officers, not formally trained as \u2018experts,\u2019 to furnish opinions based on their real-world experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Agent Roark\u2019s testimony easily satisfied the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 requirement that it possess \u201csufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a). Therefore, the district court did not err in considering his testimony in sentencing Alberto Sanchez.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Alberto Sanchez\u2019 sentence is <em>affirmed. See </em>Loe. R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
