We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-30\">Mustin contends his resentencing violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) because the firearm sentence enhancement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>under USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2) was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Although Mustin has not received a certificate of appealability (\u201cGOA\u201d) for this issue, we construe Mustin\u2019s notice of appeal as a request for a COA, and grant his request. <em>See Porter v. Adams, </em>244 F.3d 1006, 1007 (9th Cir.2001) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Mustin\u2019s contention, however, is without merit because his 120-month sentence is less than the 20-year maximum provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). As such, <em>Appren-di </em>is not implicated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Egge, </em>223 F.3d 1128, 1131 n. 1 (9th Cir. 2000); <em>see, e.g., United States v. Panaro, </em>266 F.3d 939, 954 (9th Cir.2001) (affirming USSG \u00a7 283.2(b)(1) enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b963-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b964-16\">. Mustin also contends the district court lacked jurisdiction. On March 30, 2001, we denied Mustin's request for a COA on this issue. As Mustin has not received a COA on this issue, we cannot entertain his appeal. <em>See </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
