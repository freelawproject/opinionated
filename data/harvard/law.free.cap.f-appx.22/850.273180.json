On de novo review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-26\">A. <em>Confrontation Clause \u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-27\">Petitioner first argues that the limitations on his cross-examination of B.J. Reynolds rise to the level of an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-28\">A trial judge may limit the scope of cross-examination without necessarily committing constitutional error. <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986). Petitioner had ample opportunity to cross-examine Reynolds as to coercion, favorable treatment, bias, and motive to lie. This fact distinguishes Petitioner\u2019s case from those on which he principally relies, <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974), and <em>Van Arsdall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-29\">Specifically, Petitioner\u2019s cross-examination disclosed that Reynolds did not want to testify, that the police had coerced him to do so, that he gave his statement because he was concerned that the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>otherwise would blame him for the murder, and that he received benefits such as immunity from prosecution for having given two different reports to police. Under these circumstances, the trial judge\u2019s decision to preclude additional cross-examination did not curtail Petitioner\u2019s confrontation rights unconstitutionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">B. <em>Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Petitioner also argues that the prosecutor violated his right to due process by improperly coercing Reynolds\u2019 testimony. In support he cites <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935); <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985); and <em>Webb v. Texas, </em>409 U.S. 95, 93 S.Ct. 351, 34 L.Ed.2d 330 (1972) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">In <em>Berger, </em>the prosecutorial misconduct was pronounced and persistent and had a cumulative effect on the jury. By contrast, the alleged misconduct in this case was not so pronounced or persistent, and did not take place in front of the jury. <em>Young </em>cited <em>Berger </em>in ruling that a prosecutor\u2019s statements in response to defense counsel\u2019s closing argument did not constitute \u201cplain error\u201d; it provides no additional support for Petitioner\u2019s argument. In <em>Webb, </em>the trial judge threatened a defense witness to keep him off the stand. That is unlike what happened here, where the prosecutor\u2019s effort was to require a witness to testify on behalf of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">None of the cited cases is controlling. Indeed, Petitioner\u2019s argument recognizes that the principles of the Supreme Court\u2019s cases would have to be extended before they would cover the kind of pressure allegedly placed on Reynolds. Because it would require this court to \u201c \u2018break[ ] new ground\u2019 \u201d to hold in Petitioner\u2019s favor, he must be denied relief. <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 381, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (quoting <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 301, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b892-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
