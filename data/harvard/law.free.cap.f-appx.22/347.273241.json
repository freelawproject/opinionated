Estrella claims the evidence was sufficient to prove her persecutor\u2019s mixed motive, her well-founded fear of persecution on account of her political opinion, and that she did not have an option of internal relocation. After a thorough review of the record, we conclude substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s findings that Estrella failed to establish that her fear and the incidents of extortion were related to her political opinion and that she failed to demonstrate her inability to relocate within the Philippines. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (West 1999); <em>Huaman-Cornelio v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995 (4th Cir.1992). We accordingly affirm the Board\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
