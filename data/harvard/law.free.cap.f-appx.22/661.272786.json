The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 324 months in prison and five years supervised release. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and filed a brief, and Smith has moved for appointment of new counsel. These pleadings argue that the district court should have imposed a lower sentence because Smith understood he would receive a ten-year sentence, the district court erred in assessing firearm and role enhancements, the government failed to prove drug quantity, the district court failed to consider U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c) in sentencing, and Smith did not understand what was happening at sentencing. Smith also asserts that his counsel was ineffective. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-21\">Smith\u2019s sentencing arguments fail because (1) he stipulated to a base offense level of 36 and acknowledged under oath at the plea hearing that he could receive a sentence ranging from ten years to life in prison and was waiving his right to a jury trial, <em>see Nguyen v. United States, </em>114 F.3d 699, 703 (8th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995); (2) he did not receive a firearm enhancement; (3) he waived his objection to the role enhancement by not requesting a ruling at sentencing, <em>see United States v. Hester, </em>140 F.3d 753, 762 (8th Cir.1998); (4) section 5G1.3(c) did not apply because Smith was not subject to an undischarged prison term; and (5) at sentencing, Smith informed the district court that he wanted to proceed with sentencing, had reviewed the presentence report with counsel, and understood the stipulations he was making, cf<em>. Nguyen, </em>114 F.3d at 709. Smith\u2019s ineffective-assistance claims are more appropriately presented in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>59 F.3d 767, 771 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-22\">We have conducted an independent review under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and conclude there are no other nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm, grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and deny Smith\u2019s motion for new counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-18\">. The HONORABLE MARK W.
