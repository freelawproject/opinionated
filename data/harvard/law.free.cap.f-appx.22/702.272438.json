NADCA filed counterclaims under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 <em>et seq., </em>seeking injunctive relief to prevent Bar-Meir from using the term \u201cNADCA\u201d and to transfer the domain name to NADCA. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted NADCA\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its counterclaims, permanently enjoined Bar-Meir from using the term \u201cNADCA,\u201d ordered Bar-Meir to transfer the domain name \u201cnadca.org\u201d to NADCA, and dismissed Bar-Meir\u2019s complaint with prejudice. The district court has not yet resolved NADCA\u2019s claim for damages. Bar-Meir appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-21\">We have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s interlocutory order granting both the injunction, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a), and summary judgment, <em>see Randolph v. Rodgers, </em>170 F.3d 850, 856 (8th Cir.1999)(court may review issues inextricably bound up with injunction). We conclude that the district court correctly granted summary judgment on NADCA\u2019s counterclaims under sections 32(l)(a) and 43(a)(1) of the Lanham Act, as the relevant factors support the court\u2019s finding that a likelihood of confusion exists from Bar-Meir\u2019s use of the NADCA trademark. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1114(1)(a), 1125(a)(1); <em>Luigino\u2019s, Inc. v. Stouffer Corp., </em>170 F.3d 827, 830 (8th Cir.1999)(discussing factors). We also conclude that summary judgment was proper on NADCA\u2019s counterclaim for cybersquatting, as the statutory factors point to Bar-Meir\u2019s bad-faith intent to profit from the mark. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d)(1)(A), (d)(1)(B)(i). Thus, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing a permanent injunction, <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1116(a); <em>Randolph, </em>170 F.3d at 856 (standard of review), and we affirm. We dismiss the appeal as to the remaining orders, as those issues are not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-22\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-18\">.
