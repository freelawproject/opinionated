We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Sharma v. INS, </em>89 F.3d 545, 547 (9th Cir.1996), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-16\">The Khans contend that the BIA abused its discretion by denying their motion to reopen. We disagree because the Khans\u2019 new evidence supporting their motion does not present a prima facie case for either asylum or withholding of deportation. <em>See Kaveh-Haghigy v. INS, </em>783 F.2d 1321, 1323 (9th Cir.1986); <em>Larimi v. INS, </em>782 F.2d 1494, 1497 (9th Cir.1986) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-21\">Although we agree that the BIA erred by requiring the Khans to address credibility in their motion to reopen, <em>see Khan v. INS, </em>No. 96-70133, 1997 WL 335015, at *1 (9th Cir. June 12, 1997), we conclude that the error was not prejudicial because the Khans failed to establish eligibility for asylum, <em>cf. Maroufi v. INS, </em>772 F.2d 597, 600 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-22\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b928-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-19\">.
