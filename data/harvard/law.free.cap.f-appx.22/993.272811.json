The magistrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>judge issued a lengthy report recommending that Mr. Lane\u2019s claims be summarily dismissed. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and dismissed the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Lane subsequently filed a \u201cPro Se Motion to Amend/Alter\u201d and a \u201cPro Se Motion for Relief from Judgement.\u201d (Doc. 88, 92). The district court denied both of these motions, and Mr. Lane now appeals those denials. Finding no error in the district court\u2019s decisions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">In his brief on appeal, Mr. Lane has moved to \u201cvoluntarily dismiss\u201d his first claim of error in the denial of his Motion to Amend/Alter. (Aplt Br. at 3.) Therefore, we need only address the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Lane\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion to reconsider. A district court\u2019s denial of such a motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Servants of Paraclete v. John Does, I-XVI, </em>204 F.3d 1005, 1009 (10th Cir.2000). Relief under such a motion is \u201cextraordinary\u201d and should \u201conly be granted in exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal, Mr. Lane argues that his motion to reconsider did not merely revisit issues already addressed, as the defendants claim, but that it- alleged the magistrate improperly \u201cweighed disputed facts\u201d in recommending dismissal of his claims. (Aplt. Br. at 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">An evaluation of the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, however, reveals that the magistrate carefully analyzed the facts as Mr. Lane alleged them, and found that they did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation under \u00a7 1983. Accordingly, he recommended dismissal of the claims. Finding no error in the magistrate\u2019s report, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mr. Lane\u2019s motion to reconsider. We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of that motion. We grant Mr. Lane\u2019s motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1035-8\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This Order and Judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">. Mr. Lane filed a separate appeal objecting to the dismissal of his case. The merits of his underlying case are discussed in that companion appeal. <em>See Lane v. Klingler, et al., </em>No. 01-6144.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
