He was sentenced to 211 months\u2019 incarceration and 60 months\u2019 supervised release. Wynn appeals, challenging his sentence and conviction under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Wynn argues that <em>Apprendi </em>has retroactive effect and thus invalidates his sentence and conviction because the district court sentenced him on the basis of drug amounts not submitted to the jury. We need not reach the issue of retroactivity because Wynn\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>claim is without merit. In <em>United States v. Nordby, </em>225 F.3d 1053, 1059 (9th Cir.2000), we held that an individual cannot be sentenced pursuant to <em>Apprendi </em>above the \u201cprescribed statutory maximum,\u201d which is the maximum punishment to which the defendant could be exposed \u201csolely under the facts found by the jury.\u201d In this case, the statutory maximum is prescribed by \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), which provides a maximum sentence of 20 years\u2019 incarceration and indefinite supervised release without regard to a finding of any drug amount. Because Wynn\u2019s sentence does not exceed the prescribed statutory maximum, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b897-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
