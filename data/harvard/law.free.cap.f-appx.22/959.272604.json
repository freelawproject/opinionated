R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-24\">The case is before this court on Robert Lee Downs\u2019 request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cGOA\u201d). Downs seeks a COA so he can appeal the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>denial of the motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence he filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (providing that the appeal of a final order disposing of a \u00a7 2255 motion may not be taken to a court of appeals unless a COA is issued).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Also before this court is appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss Downs\u2019 appeal. Appellee relies on Rule 4(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to support its argument that Downs\u2019 notice of appeal should have been filed within ten days after the district court entered its order denying his \u00a7 2255 motion. Appeals from the grant or denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, however, are governed by the time requirements applicable to civil appeals. <em>See Klink v. United States, </em>308 F.2d 775, 776 (10th Cir.1962). Rule 4(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that when the United States is a party in an action, the notice of appeal must be filed \u201cwithin 60 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.\u201d Rule 4(a)(4) details the effect of certain motions on the time for filing a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(4). We have reviewed the record and conclude that Downs\u2019 notice of appeal was timely filed. Appellee\u2019s motion is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Downs entered a conditional guilty plea to a count of possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute. Downs brought a direct appeal challenging the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence found in his vehicle. This court affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Downs, </em>151 F.3d 1301 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Downs then filed the instant \u00a7 2255 motion. In his motion, Downs raised several ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Downs also alleged that his due process rights were violated by: (1) the government\u2019s failure to disclose evidence in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963); (2) the government\u2019s use of leading questions during the direct examination of a police officer; and (3) the government\u2019s use of false testimony. Downs also claimed he was illegally stopped because of his race.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">The district court first determined that Downs should have raised two of the issues on direct appeal and, therefore, they were procedurally barred. Downs argues that the district court failed to consider whether the alleged ineffective assistance of his counsel constituted cause for the procedural default. We have reviewed the record and conclude that Downs did not present any evidence that demonstrated cause for the default. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>43 F.3d 491, 496 (10th Cir.1994) (\u201cA defendant is procedurally barred from presenting any claim in a section 2255 petition that he failed to raise on direct appeal unless he can demonstrate cause for his procedural default and prejudice suffered thereby....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">The court next considered each of Downs\u2019 ineffective assistance claims and concluded they were without merit. <em>See United States v.. </em>Cox, 83 F.3d 336, 341 (10th Cir.1996) (\u201cA defendant may establish cause for procedural default by showing he received ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d). The district court determined that Downs had not shown eonstitutionally-deficient performance on the part of his counsel or had not shown that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">Finally, the district court considered Downs\u2019 due process claims and rejected them on the merits. In particular, Downs failed to establish that the government had an obligation under <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>to produce photographs of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>drugs found in his vehicle. <em>See </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Downs claims these photographs show that the raw marijuana found in the trunk of his vehicle was tightly wrapped in plastic and bound with duct tape. Downs, however, provided no support for his unsubstantiated allegation that the wrapping made it impossible for the arresting officer to smell the marijuana. Thus, Downs did not demonstrate that the district court would have granted his motion to suppress if the government had provided the photographs to him and, consequently, failed to show that the photographs were material. <em>See United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985) (\u201c[Ejvidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Downs is not entitled to a COA unless he can make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Downs can make that showing by demonstrating that: (1) the issues raised are debatable among jurists, (2) a court could resolve the issues differently, or (3) the questions presented deserve further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">This court has reviewed Downs\u2019 application for a GOA and appellate brief, the district court\u2019s order, and the entire record before us. That review has uncovered no reversible error in the district court\u2019s disposition of Downs\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion. Thus, we conclude that the district court\u2019s disposition of Downs\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion is not deserving of further proceedings, debatable among jurists of reason, or subject to a different resolution on appeal. Accordingly, Downs has not made \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d and is not entitled to a COA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This court denies Downs\u2019 request for a COA and dismisses this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1001-25\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
