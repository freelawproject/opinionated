On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>An-ders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and filed a brief arguing that Garcia-Garcia should have received a downward departure because he took extraordinary actions in accepting responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-13\">At sentencing, the district court acknowledged its authority to depart, and thus its discretionary decision not to depart under the circumstances in this case is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Lim, </em>235 F.3d 382, 385 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-15\">Moreover, following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-16\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-14\">. The Honorable Richard G.
