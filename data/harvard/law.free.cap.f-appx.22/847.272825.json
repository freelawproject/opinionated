The district court did not err in finding loss in excess of <em>$800,000 </em>and imposing the eleven-level upward adjustment. Small was not entitled to reduce the amount of loss based on canceled checks, refunds or merchandise provided to victims because the requested reductions were in furtherance of Small\u2019s scheme, enabling him to stave off detection. <em>See United States v. Ciccone, </em>219 F.3d 1078, 1087 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-20\">When applying the vulnerable victim enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3A1.1(b)(1), the district court was not required to make an explicit factual finding that one or more of the victims was unusually vulnerable by virtue of being elderly. <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>219 F.3d 863, 866 (9th Cir.2000). The PSR provided the court with sufficient evidence that Small knew his telemarketing scheme targeted victims whose ages rendered them unusually vulnerable. The district court, therefore, did not plainly err in applying the vulnerable victim adjustment. <em>See United States v. Scrivener, </em>189 F.3d 944, 950-51 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-21\">Small\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b889-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
