Esseily, allegedly the victim of a robbery, submitted a FOIA request to the Mayor of New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>York City, Rudolph Giuliani, and to the New York City Police Department for \u201cany and all follow-up reports\u201d and \u201cinvestigative reports\u201d concerning the crime. Unsuccessful, Esseily filed a rambling complaint, charging Mayor Giuliani, <em>inter alia, </em>with \u201cprotect[ing][J]ewish criminals\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Construing Esseily\u2019s complaint indulgently, the district court deduced two claims: (1) the request under FOIA; and (2) a demand that unspecified private individuals be arrested and prosecuted. The district court held (1) that FOIA applies only to federal agencies and (2) that Esseily lacked standing to compel prosecutions of private individuals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">1. Under FOIA, governmental agencies must make certain documents available for public information purposes. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(a). The statute defines \u201cagency\u201d as an \u201cauthority of the Government of the United States.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1). Accordingly, FOIA applies only to federal agencies \u2014 not to state, city, and local bodies. <em>Grand Cent. P\u2019ship, Inc. v. Cuomo, </em>166 F.3d 473, 484 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">2. Standing is a threshold issue in every federal case. <em>United States v. Cambio Exacto, S.A., </em>166 F.3d 522, 526 (2d Cir. 1999). When a claimant lacks standing, the court has no subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case. <em>In re United States Catholic Conference, </em>885 F.2d 1020, 1023 (2d Cir.1989). It is well-settled that a private citizen has no judicially cognizable interest in the prosecutorial decision as to whether or not to prosecute another. <em>Linda R.S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 619, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
