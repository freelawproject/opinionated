We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-23\">Gilliam contends that his plea was not voluntary, because he entered the plea agreement based on the belief that his maximum sentence would be 25 years in prison, rather than 25 years to life. We review the district court\u2019s denial of this pre-AEDPA petition de novo, while we presume that the state court\u2019s findings of fact are correct. <em>Coley v. Gonzales, </em>55 F.3d 1385, 1386-87 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-24\">Gilliam\u2019s contention fails, given the state court\u2019s findings at an evidentiary hearing that Gilliam\u2019s counsel properly advised him of the maximum sentence, and that Gilliam initialed and signed a change of plea form which specified \u201c25 years to life\u201d as the maximum possible punishment based upon the plea. Gilliam\u2019s disputes are with factual determinations which we will not disturb. <em>Wells v. Maass, </em>28 F.3d 1005, 1011 (9th Cir.1994) (stating that petitioner failed to rebut presumption of correctness). The district court properly denied his petition. <em>Id. </em>at 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b745-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
