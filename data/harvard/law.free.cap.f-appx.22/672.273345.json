The parties entered into a plea agreement that did not set forth the amount of loss. At sentencing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> recognized a later stipulation by Burke that the government could prove a loss of $65,000 by preponderance of the evidence. Relying on the $65,000 amount of loss, the court imposed a sentence of twelve months and one day of imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release. Burke appeals her sentence, arguing that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) requires that the amount of loss be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Burke concedes that our cases interpreting <em>Apprendi </em>require a finding of proof beyond a reasonable doubt only when a factual determination other than the fact of prior conviction increases the sentence beyond the statutory maximum. <em>E.g., U.S. v. Aguayo-Delgado, </em>220 F.3d 926, 933 (8th Cir.2000). Conviction under \u00a7 1709 carries a statutory maximum of five years\u2019 imprisonment. The amount of loss determination here resulted in a sentencing range of twelve to eighteen months. Because Burke\u2019s sentence of twelve months and one day does not exceed the statutory maximum, <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Burke urges us to overrule <em>Aguayo-Delgado. </em>One panel of this court may not overrule the decision of a previous panel. <em>United States v. Womack, </em>985 F.2d 395, 399 (8th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>Dudley v. Ditt-mer, </em>795 F.2d 669, 673 (8th Cir.1986)), and thus we are without authority to consider her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-9\">. The Honorable Michael J. Davis, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
