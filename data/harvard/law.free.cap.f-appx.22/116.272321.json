We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Canady\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-23\">When the United States is a party, parties are accorded sixty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

Canady\u2019s notice of appeal is deemed to be filed no earlier than August 9, 2001.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Canady failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b158-17\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been given to prison officials for mailing. <em>See </em>Fed.
