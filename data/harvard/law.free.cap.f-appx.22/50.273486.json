Keenan, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b93-5\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the decision of the district court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Defendant Felipe Escobar appeals from the denial of a motion for modification of sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Escobar seeks to reduce his sentence pursuant to Amendment 518 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, adopted after his sentence was imposed. He contends on appeal that the district court erred in concluding that post-sentence modification is not permitted because Amendment 518 is not listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 161.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s decision. Section 1B1.10(c) governs reductions of sentence due to subsequent amendments and specifies which amendments a defendant may invoke under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Perez, </em>129 F.3d 255, 259 (2d Cir.1997). Amendment 518 is not included in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). Section 3582 is therefore inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">We have considered all of the defendant\u2019s contentions and find no merit in any of them. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
