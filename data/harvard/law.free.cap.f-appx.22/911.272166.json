We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-22\">Resendiz-Ortiz contends that he should not have received a sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) for a prior aggravated felony because in that prior Idaho state court proceeding he was incorrectly charged as an adult when he was actually under the age of 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-23\">This challenge to the validity of a previous state conviction is not cognizable on appeal from a federal sentence, unless the prior conviction was obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>See United States v. Myers, </em>41 F.3d 531, 535 (9th Cir.1994); <em>Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 496-97, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994).

We reject the government\u2019s jurisdictional challenges to this appeal as (1) the notice of appeal was timely filed, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A)(i) and Fed. R.App. P. 26(a); and (2) pursuant to his plea agreement, ResendizOrtiz expressly retained the right to appeal his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
