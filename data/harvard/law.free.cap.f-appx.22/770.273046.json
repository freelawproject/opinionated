Petitioner was convicted on April 16, 1998 of driving under the influence of alcohol for the third time, in violation of Nevada Revised Statutes \u00a7 484.379.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-31\">In <em>United States v. Trinidad-Aquino, </em>259 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir.2001), we held that driving under the influence of alcohol and causing bodily injury, in violation of California Vehicle Code \u00a7 23153, is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. We reasoned that \u00a7 23153 can be violated through negligence, whereas a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d can be committed only with a mental state of at least recklessness. <em>See Trinidad-Aquino, </em>259 F.3d at 1144-1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-32\">Like \u00a7 23153, Nevada Revised Statutes \u00a7 484.379 can be violated through negligence. It follows that a violation of \u00a7 484.379 is not a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d We therefore hold that Bhatti was not convict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>ed of an aggravated felony as defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b812-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
