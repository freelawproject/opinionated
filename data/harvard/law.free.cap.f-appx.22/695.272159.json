The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissed the suit with prejudice after both parties filed a stipulation for dismissal so that Malin could pursue his claims according to StarMark\u2019s dispute resolution policy, which required mediation and arbitration of all claims arising out of employment. Malin then moved pro se to reopen the case, asserting he never knowingly agreed to the dismissal stipulation. StarMark opposed the motion, and presented the affidavit of Malin\u2019s former attorney; he attested that he had fully discussed the stipulation with Malin, who had given his informed and unequivocal consent to it. Malin presented no sworn statement or other evidence contradicting his former attorney\u2019s affidavit. The district court denied the motion, and Malin appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-22\">We find the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion, because it was not clear error to credit the attorney\u2019s affidavit. <em>See Richards v. Aramark Se</em>rvs., <em>Inc., </em>108 F.3d 925, 927 (8th Cir.1997) (Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) standard of review). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-23\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-19\">. The Honorable Lawrence L.
