He does not, however, assert any due process claim. Conde-Reyes was found inadmissible by virtue of his two convictions for petty theft, which are crimes of moral turpitude for purposes of IIRIRA. <em>United States v. Esparza-Ponce, </em>193 F.3d 1133 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that petty theft under California law is a crime involving moral turpitude for purposes of IIRIRA). He entered the United States in 1984, and the offenses were committed in 1987 and 1988. This court does not have jurisdiction over Conde-Reyes\u2019 petition for review under IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rule \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G) because he is an immigrant deportable for having committed two crimes of moral turpitude within five years after entry.
