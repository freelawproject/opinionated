Fleming and Ellison Jackson (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) appeal from the district court\u2019s order dismissing without prejudice their 42 U.S .C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West Supp. 2001) claim. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-22\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing without prejudice Plaintiffs\u2019 selective prosecution and liberty interest claims is not appealable. <em>See Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993). A dismissal without prejudice is a final order only if \u201c \u2018no amendment [of the complaint] could cure the defects in the plaintiffs case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1067 (quoting <em>Coniston Corp. v. Village of Hoffman Estates, </em>844 F.2d 461, 463 (7th Cir.1988)). In ascertaining whether a dismissal without prejudice is reviewable in this court, we must determine \u201cwhether the plaintiff could save his action by merely amending his complaint.\u201d <em>Domino Sugar, </em>10 F.3d at 1066-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-23\">Because their complaint was dismissed without prejudice, Plaintiffs may yet file an amended complaint specifically alleging facts sufficient to state their claims under \u00a7 1983. Therefore, the dismissal order before us is not appealable. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction under <em>Domino Sugar. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
