We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review a dismissal based on a statute of limitations de novo, <em>Ellis v. City of San Diego, </em>176 F.3d 1183, 1188 (9th Cir.1999), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-20\">Because Bishop failed to file his action within two years of when he knew or should have known of his injuries, the district court properly dismissed his action as time barred. <em>See TwoRivers v. Lewis, </em>174 F.3d 987, 991 (9th Cir.1999) (applying a two-year statute of limitations to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims brought in Arizona pursuant to Arizona Revised Statute \u00a7 12-502).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-21\">Bishop\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b954-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
