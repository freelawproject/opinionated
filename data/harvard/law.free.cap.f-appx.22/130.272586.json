The Hager brothers appeal, raising several claims. We find no merit to the appeals; consequently, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">On September 1, 1999, members of the West Virginia State Police Special Response Team (\u201cSRT\u201d) and other law enforcement officers entered a heavily-wooded area where the Hager brothers were reportedly trespassing. They arrested Bobby Wayne as he traveled through the area on an all-terrain vehicle. He tried unsuccessfully to grab a handgun in his side holster to avoid arrest. While he was being handcuffed, he shouted, \u201cEverett, they\u2019re coming to get you. Everett, they\u2019re coming to get you.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the SRT arrested Everett, but not before he fired rounds from a machine gun at them.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Police found evidence of marijuana cultivation. There was a marijuana plant drying on the center console of Bobby Wayne\u2019s van and four packages of marijuana seeds in his house. It was the latter part of the marijuana growing season and, although officers found no areas with a large number of growing marijuana plants, they identified two areas in the vicinity of the campsites where the Hager brothers were arrested as marijuana patches. They concluded that these areas were marijuana patches because, in addition to four marijuana plants found in the first patch, the sites were clear cut and tilled, and three potting soil pots containing small quantities of potting soil, as well as a small shovel, were found at the second patch.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">A grand jury indicted the Hager brothers in a superceding indictment that charged each brother with unlawful possession of a machine gun, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 922(c)(1) and 924(a)(2) (West 2000) (Count One), and manufacturing and aiding and abetting the manufacture of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (West 1999) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1994) (Count Two). The indictment also charged Everett with using, carrying, and possessing a machine gun in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), (B)(ii) (West 2000) (Count Three), and Bobby Wayne with using, carrying, and possessing firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (Count Four). A jury convicted the brothers on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">The Hagers first argue that their convictions under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 922 and 924 are invalid because these provisions violate their Second Amendment right to bear arms. We previously have held that the Second Amendment does not create an absolute individual right to bear arms, but \u201conly confers a collective right of keeping and bearing arms which must bear a \u2018reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.\u2019\u201d <em>Love v. Pepersack, </em>47 F.3d 120, 124 (4th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>United States v. Miller, </em>307 U.S. 174, 178, 59 S.Ct. 816, 83 L.Ed. 1206 (1939)). To the extent that the Hagers argue that their firearms convictions violate the Second Amendment because they possessed them firearms in relation to their private militia activities, we need not address this claim. The Hagers successfully sought in the trial court the exclusion of any evidence of their membership in a militia or anti-government organization and, having excluded use of this evidence against them, they may not now hold up such evidence as a shield against them firearms convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Next, Bobby Wayne argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>on Count One concerning possession of a machine gun.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Evidence presented at trial showed that Bobby Wayne had purchased a machine gun matching the description of the weapon fired by Everett on the day of their arrests. The thirty-round magazine found in the machine gun matched the magazine described in a document found in Bobby Wayne\u2019s wallet. Bobby Wayne clearly knew his brother was close by and Everett fired the machine gun shortly after Bobby Wayne shouted a warning to him. Under the facts of this case, we find the evidence sufficient for the jury to find that Bobby Wayne had constructive possession of the machine gun. <em>See United States v. Gravenmeir, </em>121 F.3d 526, 528 (9th Cir.1997) (discussing elements of \u00a7 922(o) violation); <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 873 (4th Cir.1996) (discussing constructive possession).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Bobby Wayne also asserts that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction on Count Two, concerning manufacturing and aiding and abetting the manufacture of marijuana. In light of the cleared patches of ground in the heavily wooded area occupied by the Hagers, one of which contained a few growing marijuana plants, marijuana found in Bobby Wayne\u2019s van and home, the shovel and evidence of potting soil found at one of the sites, and testimony that Bobby Wayne discussed growing marijuana with his nephew and showed him one of the marijuana patches, we find that the evidence is sufficient to support Bobby Wayne\u2019s conviction on Count Two. <em>See United States v. Nelson, </em>6 F.3d 1049, 1053 (4th Cir.1993) (discussing elements of \u00a7 841(a) violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The Hagers also argue that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c). Everett fired a machine gun and Bobby Wayne was wearing a side holster with a handgun and attempted to draw the weapon when they were arrested. They were arrested in the vicinity of the marijuana patches. We find this evidence sufficient to support their \u00a7 924(c) convictions. <em>See United States v. Mitchell, </em>104 F.3d 649, 652 (4th Cir.1997) (discussing elements of \u00a7 924(c) violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Finally, Bobby Wayne argues that he was denied a fair trial because the district court refused to sever his trial from that of his brother. We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to sever and instead instructing the jury not to consider as evidence against Bobby Wayne testimony that Everett arranged for an assault against a witness. <em>Zafiro v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 534, 538, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993). Further, we find that Bobby Wayne failed to justify severance by showing a genuine need for his brother\u2019s testimony. <em>United States v. Reavis, </em>48 F.3d 763, 767 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">For these reasons, we affirm Everett Hager\u2019s and Bobby Wayne Hager\u2019s convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b175-6\"> The statement of issues asserts that the evidence was insufficient to support any of the counts on which the Hager brothers were convicted. However, because Everett does not argue in the body of the brief that the evidence was insufficient to convict him on Count One or Count Two, we find that he has abandoned these issues. <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
