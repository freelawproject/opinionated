We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-18\">We lack jurisdiction to address the Stru-bels\u2019 arguments concerning the merits of the district court\u2019s entry of judgment and permanent injunction because the Strubels failed to file a timely notice of appeal within 60 days of entry of final judgment or a timely post-judgment tolling motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), (a)(4)(A). Accordingly, this court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to the appeal of the Strubels\u2019 motion for rehearing filed 93 days after the court\u2019s judgment. We construe this motion as a motion for relief from judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b). Denial of such a motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah County v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1262 (9th Cir. 1993). Because the Strubels failed to demonstrate mistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, newly-discovered evidence, or any other basis for relief from judgment, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying their motion to reconsider. <em>See id. </em>at 1262-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b960-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
