We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>\u201cBefore a sentence may be vacated on the ground of perjured testimony, the movant must show that the testimony was perjured .and that the prosecuting officials knew at the time such testimony was used that it was perjured.\u201d <em>United States v. Reynoso-Ulloa, </em>548 F.2d 1329, 1340 (9th Cir.1977) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Although we generally review denial of \u00a7 2255 petitions de novo, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings in those proceedings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Christakis, </em>238 F.3d 1164, 1168 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Wynn claims that Kathy Smith\u2019s trial testimony was perjured because the government forced her to testify favorably by threatening to pursue warrants for her arrest and to take custody of her children. After conducting a full evidentiary hearing, the district court concluded that Smith\u2019s testimony was credible and supported by other testimony and circumstantial evidence presented during the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Because \u201c[t]his court gives special deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations,\u201d <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>137 F.3d 1094, 1110 (9th Cir.1998), we will not disturb the court\u2019s determination in this case in the absence of a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,\u201d <em>Hunt v. Cromartie, </em>532 U.S. 234, 121 S.Ct. 1452, 1458, 149 L.Ed.2d 430 (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>United States v. Maldonado, </em>215 F.3d 1046, 1050 (9th Cir.2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1172, 121 S.Ct. 1141, 148 L.Ed.2d 1004 (2001). Wynn argues that \u201ca fair inference\u201d can be drawn from Smith\u2019s testimony at the evi-dentiary hearing that Wynn in fact was not threatening her. Wynn misses the limited scope of our review under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. Under that standard, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b893-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
