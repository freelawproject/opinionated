The IJ denied the motion, and the Board affirmed. On appeal, Njie-Mokonya contends that (1) his due process rights were violated because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing; and (2) his counsel\u2019s failure to notify him of the hearing constituted ineffective assistance which established \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d to excuse his absence at the hearing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-17\">This court\u2019s review of the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen is extremely deferential, and the decision will not be reversed absent abuse of discretion. <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir. 1999). Motions to reopen are disfavored. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(c) (2000). When, as here, the Board chooses to rely on the express reasoning of the IJ in a short per curiam opinion, that reasoning is the sole basis for our review and will be reversed if inadequate. <em>Gandarillas-Zambrana v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>44 F.3d 1251, 1255 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-18\">We first find Njie-Mokonya\u2019s due process argument without merit. <em>See Garcia v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Wijeratne v. INS, </em>961 F.2d 1344, 1346 (7th Cir.1992). Second, we have reviewed the administrative record and agree with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the motion to reopen was untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) (West 1999); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(c)(3) (2000); 8 C.F .R. \u00a7 3.23(b)(4)(ii) (2000); <em>Anin v. Reno, </em>188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.1999); <em>Kamara v. INS, </em>149 F.3d 904, 906 (8th Cir.1998). To the extent that Njie-Mokonya claims that former coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>sel\u2019s ineffectiveness constitutes an exception to the time and numerical bars on motions to reopen, the Board has held that an ineffective assistance claim does not qualify as an exception to the 180-day statutory limit for the filing of a motion to reopen or rescind an <em>in absentia </em>order of deportation. <em>In re A-A- </em>Int. Dec. 3357 (BIA 1998) (en banc); <em>In re Lei, </em>Int. Dec. 3356 (BIA 1998) (en banc). In any event, the IJ properly found that Njie-Mokonya\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was defective as it failed to meet the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">We have carefully reviewed the record and find no abuse of discretion in the IJ\u2019s denial of Njie-Mokonya\u2019s motion to reopen. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of relief on this claim. We further grant Respondent\u2019s motion to withdraw, relieve, or substitute attorney. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
