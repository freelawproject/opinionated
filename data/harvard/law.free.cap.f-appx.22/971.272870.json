R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-20\">This case is before the court on Leonard Davis\u2019 request for a certificate of appeala-bility (\u201cCOA\u201d). Davis seeks a COA so that he can appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of his habeas corpus petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Davis has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses this appeal. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>Davis is currently serving a life sentence in New Mexico state prison for first degree murder. He raised the following two general claims in his habeas petition: (1) he was denied due process by the respondent\u2019s refusal to apply good-time credits to reduce the time he needed to serve in order to be eligible for parole from thirty years to fifteen years; and (2) his conviction is invalid under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) because the jury would have only convicted him of second degree murder if it had known that he would not get the benefit of good-time credits to reduce his parole eligibility date. After the case was referred to a magistrate judge for initial proceedings pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), the magistrate judge recommended that the petition be dismissed. The magistrate judge noted that Davis\u2019 claim to good-time credits was foreclosed by this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Stephens v. Thomas, </em>19 F.3d 498, 501 (10th Cir.1994) and <em>Lasiter v. Thomas, </em>89 F.3d 699, 702 (10th Cir.1996). As to <em>Apprendi, </em>the magistrate simply noted that it had no application to this case. Upon <em>de novo </em>review, the district court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge and dismissed Davis\u2019 petition with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">In his brief on appeal and request for a COA, Davis asserts that <em>Stephens </em>and <em>La-siter </em>are wrong and that the statutes in New Mexico clearly provide for the application of good-time credits to reduce the parole eligibility date on a life sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This court is bound by the decisions in <em>Stephens </em>and <em>Lasiter </em>absent a superseding decision of the Supreme Court or reconsideration by the <em>en bane </em>court. <em>See In re Smith, </em>10 F.3d 723, 724 (10th Cir.1993). Furthermore, the district court\u2019s interpretation of those cases as foreclosing Davis\u2019 claim is clearly not debatable among jurists, subject to a different resolution by this court, or deserving of further proceedings. See <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Accordingly, Davis has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d and is not entitled to a COA. <em>See id.; see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Davis\u2019 request for a COA is DENIED and this appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1013-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1013-22\">. Davis\u2019 petition is actually a hybrid in the sense that it challenged both his underlying conviction and the execution of his sentence. It does not matter, however, whether Davis\u2019 petition is denominated as arising under 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 because he would need a COA in either case. <em>See Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 867 (10th Cir. 2000) (\"[C]onsistent with the plain language of [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A), this court holds that a state prisoner must obtain a COA to appeal the denial of a habeas petition, whether such petition was filed pursuant to \u00a7 2254 or \u00a7 2241....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1014-18\">. Neither Davis' appellate brief nor his request for a COA mention the <em>Apprendi </em>claim advanced in the district court. That claim is, therefore, waived. <em>See State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Mhoon, </em>31 F.3d 979, 984 n. 7 (10th Cir.1994) (\"[A]ppellant failed to raise this issue in his opening brief and, hence, has waived the point.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
