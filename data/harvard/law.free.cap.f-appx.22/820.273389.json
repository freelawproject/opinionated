We affirm. Because the facts are familiar to the parties, we recount them only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-21\">Lizama-Sanchez has not shown that his trial counsel performed ineffectively or prejudiced his case. <em>See Babbitt v. Calderon, </em>151 F.3d 1170, 1173 (9th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). Trial counsel made a plethora of arguments, in writing and orally, objecting on the basis of various record facts to a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 four-level leader enhancement. Most, if not all, of the additional record evidence that Lizama-Sanchez argues that his trial counsel should have pointed out to the district court was either cumulative or irrelevant to the question whether Lizama-Sanchez acted as a leader or organizer under \u00a7 SBl.l(a) or as a manager or supervisor under \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). Finally, the government presented compelling evidence that Lizama-Sanchez did act as a leader or organizer, so additional argument is unlikely to have mattered.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-22\">The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b862-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
