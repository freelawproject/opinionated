We have reviewed the record, the district court\u2019s opinion, and Foreman\u2019s informal appellate brief. Because Foreman failed to challenge on appeal the basis for the district court\u2019s ruling, he has not preserved any issue for our review. 4th Cir. R. 34(b). In any event, it is clear that the district court\u2019s conclusion that Foreman\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely is correct. Further, we decline to review the claims Foreman raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appeala-bility and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-21\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
