We affirm. Because the facts are familiar to the parties, we recount them only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"A3j9\">1. <em>Waiver of Deportation, INA \u00a7 241(a)(1)(H), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(1)(H) (1994):</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-17\"><em>The credibility determination. </em>Quibol did not contest the IJ\u2019s credibility determination before the BIA and thus has not exhausted his administrative remedies as to this issue. This court therefore does not have jurisdiction to review whether the BIA abused its discretion in adopting the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Garberding v. INS, </em>30 F.3d 1187, 1188 n. 1 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cGenerally, failure to raise an issue with the BIA constitutes a failure to exhaust administrative remedies and deprives this court of jurisdiction to consider the issue.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-18\">Nor has Quibol shown a violation of his right to due process or equal protection of the laws. Substantial evidence in the record supported the credibility determination, and Quibol has presented no evidence that he received different treatment from others similarly situated. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[Bjecause the BIA does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate constitutional issues, we will consider constitutional claims not raised before the BIA____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-20\"><em>The factors considered. </em>The BIA considered the effect deportation would have on Quibol\u2019s family unity and reached a reasonable conclusion that the facts of this case did not counsel waiver, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>because Quibol\u2019s wife and two children live in the Philippines. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in considering Quibol\u2019s initial entry fraud and subsequent misrepresentations regarding his marital status at the naturalization interview and at the hearing before the U. <em>See INS v. Yang, </em>519 U.S. 26, 30, 32, 117 S.Ct. 350, 136 L.Ed.2d 288 (1996); <em>In re Tijam, </em>Int. Dec. 3372 (BIA 1998) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">2. <em>Voluntary Departure, INA \u00a7 211(e), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(e) (im):</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">This court does not have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of Quibol\u2019s motion for voluntary departure because Quibol did not appeal this issue to the BIA. <em>See Garberding, </em>30 F.3d at 1188 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The agency\u2019s decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b861-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
