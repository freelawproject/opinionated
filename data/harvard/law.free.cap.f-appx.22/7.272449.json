The court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that appellant\u2019s conviction be affirmed. The district court properly denied in part appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. At the time of appellant\u2019s arrest, the officers had probable cause to believe that appellant had committed several criminal offenses in their presence. <em>See </em>D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 50-1401.01(c); 50-1403.01(e); 50-1501.04(a)(1)(C); 50-2302.02(7), (9) &amp; (18). Therefore, the arrest was proper. <em>See </em>D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 23-581(a)(1)(B); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>754 F.2d 1001, 1002-03 (D.C.Cir.1985) (per curiam); <em>see also Atwater v. City of Lago Vista, </em>532 U.S. 318, 121 S.Ct. 1536, 1557, 149 L.Ed.2d 549 (2001). The district court properly denied suppression of statements made after the initial traffic stop and before the arrest. <em>See Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984). Appellant pled guilty before the court ruled on whether the remaining statements should be suppressed and has therefore waived his right to seek suppression of these statements. <em>See Nolan v. Armontrout, </em>973 F.2d 615, 618 (8th Cir.1992). Although appellant claims the district court erred in failing to provide him the opportunity to present additional oral argument on the motion to suppress, he fails to identify any argument he would have presented that could have affected the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
