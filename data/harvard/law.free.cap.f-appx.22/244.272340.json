Jolly\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. On Jolly\u2019s behalf, counsel contends that the district court erred by admitting hearsay evidence at the revocation hearing. Although notified of his right to do so, Jolly has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-22\">Because the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to miscellaneous proceedings such as revocation hearings, and because the hearsay testimony had some indicia of reliability, we find no error. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 1101(d)(3). <em>United States v. McCallum, </em>677 F.2d 1024, 1026 (4th cir. 1982); <em>see generally United States v. McHan, </em>101 F.3d 1027, 1038 (4th Cir. 1996). In addition, we have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Jolly requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Jolly. Finally, we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
