Butvin challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his amended complaints for failure to state a claim, specifically appealing the viability of his securities fraud, common law fraud, and two breach of contract claims. We find that the district court properly dismissed Butrin\u2019s complaints and affirm for substantially the same reasons as stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
