The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>court dismissed petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for failure to exhaust state court remedies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Erroneously believing that the district court still had jurisdiction over his \u00a7 2241 petition,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> petitioner thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment. The district court construed the summary judgment motion as one for relief from the judgment under Fed.R.CivP. 60(b) and denied it. Petitioner then filed the motion at issue here, arguing that the district court erred in treating his summary judgment motion as one seeking relief from judgment under Rule 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Before petitioner can proceed on appeal, he must obtain a certificate of appealability from this Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). To do so, petitioner must show that jurists of reason would both \u201cfind it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling\u201d and \u201cfind it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Because Blackburn did not have an action pending in the district court upon which the court could grant summary judgment, the district court correctly construed his motion for summary judgment as a Rule 60(b) motion. Based on our review of the record, we conclude that petitioner has not made the required showing under <em>Slack.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">Accordingly, petitioner\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED. Petitioner\u2019s \u201cMotion for a Writ of Mandamus,\u201d which seeks to compel respondents to file a brief in this appeal, is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1017-8\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The Court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">. Petitioner's appeal of the dismissal order was docketed in this Court as appeal No. 00-2240. By order and judgment entered November 29, 2000, this Court denied petitioner a certificate of appealability and dismissed that appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">. It appears that petitioner mistook this Court\u2019s decision dismissing an earlier interlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction (No. 00-2111) as the decision in his appeal on the merits (No. 00-2240), and therefore believed that his \u00a7 2241 action was still pending in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
