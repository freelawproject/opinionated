After a through review of the record, we find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that Helabi did not qualify for asylum because he was \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d in Saudi Arabia prior to coming to the United States. <em>See </em>\u00a7 8 C.F.R. 208.14(a)(2) (2001); <em>Mussie v. INS, </em>172 F.3d 329, 331-32 (4th Cir.1999).
