We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">We independently review the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision without deference to the district court. <em>Levin v. Maya Constr. (In re Maya Constr. Co.), </em>78 F.3d 1395, 1398 (9th Cir.1996). We review de novo the bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissal on res judicata grounds, <em>see Siegel v. Fed. Home Loan Mortgage Corp., </em>143 F.3d 525, 528 (9th Cir.1998), and may affirm on any basis fairly supported by the record, <em>see Schneider v. Vennard (In re Apple Computer Sec. Litig.), </em>886 F.2d 1109, 1112 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Because Shaw\u2019s adversary proceeding for professional malpractice involved the same issues she raised in opposition to her former counsel\u2019s application for legal fees, and the bankruptcy court actually decided those issues against her, Shaw\u2019s adversary proceeding was barred by issue preclusion. <em>See Durkin v. Shea &amp; Gould, </em>92 F.3d 1510, 1515 (9th Cir.1996) (explaining that issue preclusion bars the relitigation of issues actually litigated and necessarily determined by a court).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">We have considered Shaw\u2019s remaining contentions and conclude that they lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">Because this case does not present exceptional circumstances, we deny Shaw\u2019s request for appointment of counsel on appeal. <em>See Terrell v. Brewer, </em>935 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b941-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
