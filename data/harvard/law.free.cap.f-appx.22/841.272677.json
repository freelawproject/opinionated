ERISA\u2019s notice provision requires notice to pension plan participants if there is a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in their future benefit accruals. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(h)(1) (1999). The Third Amendment to the pension plan adopted Model 3, which froze benefit accruals for employees, effective January 1, 1989, until a new formula was adopted under Amendment No. 5. Strom commenced his employment with Shintech December 4, 1989, nearly one year after the Third Amendment froze benefit accruals. As a result, the old formula never applied to Strom, and there was never a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d to his frozen benefit accruals. Strom failed to raise a material issue of fact regarding his entitlement to notice, or the calculation of his benefits. Accordingly, the district court properly denied Strom\u2019s motion for summary judgment and properly granted Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <em>Navellier v.
