After the state court affirmed his conviction on direct appeal and denied his petition for post-conviction relief, Miller filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court. He claimed, among other things, that he was denied a fair trial when 1) the prosecutor referred to his gang association; 2) the prosecutor alluded to his co-defendants\u2019 trial and convictions for the same offenses; 3) the prosecutor, during closing argument, accused the defense of intimidating witnesses and presenting false evidence; and 4) the trial judge excluded proposed impeachment testimony regarding the victim. The district court denied Miller\u2019s petition for habeas corpus relief, but granted a certificate of appealability on these four issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The district court reviewed each of these four claims on the merits and determined that nothing in the state court\u2019s analysis constituted an unreasonable application of federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). On appeal Miller neither addresses the district court\u2019s reasoning, nor cites any clearly established federal law in conflict with the state court\u2019s resolution of his claims. Although we construe <em>pro se </em>filings liberally, <em>Whitford v. </em>Boglino, 63 F.3d 527, 535 n. 10 (7th Cir.1995), we cannot cure the substantial deficiencies in Miller\u2019s brief by creating legal arguments and researching them for him, <em>see Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545 (7th Cir. 2001). Miller\u2019s failure to argue the legal issues established in the district court\u2019s order gives him no reasonable expectation of altering the judgment of the district court. <em>Cf Williams v. Leach, </em>938 F.2d 769, 775 (7th Cir.1991). Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
