Finding insufficient evidence of discrimination, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the prospective employer. <em>See Hawkins v. Mary Hitchcock Mem. Hosp., </em>Civ. No. 93-113, slip op. at 17 (D.N.H. Jan 30, 2001) (unpublished). The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">We often have commented that when a lower court accurately takes the measure of a case, faultlessly applies the appropriate legal standards, and propounds a convincing rationale, \u201can appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\u201d <em>Lawton v. State Mut. Life </em>As<em>sur. Co., </em>101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir.1996); <em>accord Cruz-Ramos v. P.R. Sun Oil Co., </em>202 F.3d 381, 383 (1st Cir.2000); <em>Ayala v. Union de Tronquistas, Local 901, </em>74 F.3d 344, 345 (1st Cir.1996); <em>Holders Capital Corp. v. Cal. Union Ins. Co. (In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.), </em>989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir.1993). This is a paradigmatic example of such an instance. Accordingly, we uphold the judgment below for substantially the same reasons elucidated in the district court\u2019s thoughtful re-script. We add only a few comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\"><em>First: </em>The question here is not, as the plaintiff assumes, whether she might in fact have been a good prospect for employment. Rather, the question is whether the employer\u2019s reasons for rejecting her three successive applications for a housekeeping position \u2014 legitimate on their face \u2014 were pretextual (and, thus, capable of supporting an inference of discriminatory animus). <em>See Feliciano de la Cruz v. El Conquistador Resort &amp; Country Club, </em>218 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2000); <em>Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., </em>76 F.3d 413, 421 (1st Cir.1996). We have carefully canvassed the record and have found a dearth of evidence sufficient to create a genuine dispute as to duplicity on the employer\u2019s part. A plaintiff cannot carry her burden of showing pretext merely by questioning the defendant\u2019s stated reasons for acting in a particular way. <em>Hoeppner v. Crotched Mt. Rehab. Ctr., </em>31 F.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir.1994); <em>Gadson v. Concord Hosp., </em>966 F.2d 32, 34 (1st Cir.1992) (per curiam); <em>see also Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, </em>904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that \u201ca genuine issue of material fact does not spring into being simply because a litigant claims that one exists\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\"><em>Second: </em>In disparate treatment \u201cfailure to hire\u201d cases, plaintiffs typically complain of being treated unfairly. This case is no exception. But an employer can hire one employee instead of another for any reason, fair or unfair, without running afoul of the anti-discrimination laws so long as the employer\u2019s stated reason is not pretextual and its choice is not driven by race or some other protected characteristic. <em>Smith, </em>76 F.3d at 422. Here, the employer\u2019s stated reasons \u2014 poor references, an erratic work history, and the like \u2014 are legitimate on their face, and the plaintiff\u2019s attempt to explain away those data, whether or not persuasive, does not vitiate the employer\u2019s right to rely on them. <em>See Gadson, </em>966 F.2d at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\"><em>Third: </em>The plaintiff claims that the trial court should have inferred racial discrimination from the fact that the hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>had very few African American employees (none in the housekeeping department at the crucial time). We disagree. Without a statistical analysis indicating, inter alia, the racial composition of the applicant pool, the mere fact that a particular minority is not much in evidence in a given work force proves nothing. <em>LeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co., </em>6 F.3d 836, 848 (1st Cir. 1993). This is especially so where, as here, the plaintiff makes no meaningful connection between the statistics, the hospital\u2019s hiring practices, and her situation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See LeBlanc, </em>6 F.3d at 848; <em>Godson, </em>966 F.2d at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\"><em>Fourth: </em>Although the plaintiff has identified a number of factual disputes (e.g., whether or not the unflattering references that the employer received were accurate), none of those disputes were material to the dispositive issues in the case. <em>See United States v. One Parcel of Real Prop. (Great Harbor Neck, New-Shoreham, R.I.), </em>960 F.2d 200, 204 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that a factual dispute, to be material, must concern a fact that carries with it the potential to affect the outcome of the suit under applicable law). Since the only facts that genuinely have been placed in dispute lack the capacity to affect or alter the outcome of the suit, those disputed facts cannot derail the summary judgment engine. <em>See Woods-Leber v. Hyatt Hotels of P.R., Inc., </em>124 F.3d 47, 49 (1st Cir.1997); <em>Morris v. Gov\u2019t Dev. Bank, </em>27 F.3d 746, 748 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">We need go no further. We understand the plaintiffs frustration at being denied an opportunity to prove herself in the workplace \u2014 but the body of federal law that protects a job applicant against racial discrimination in employment does not inoculate her against an employer\u2019s honest exercise of its business judgment \u2014 whether or not that judgment is mistaken. <em>See Gadson, </em>966 F.2d at 34; see <em>also Morgan v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., </em>901 F.2d 186, 191 (1st Cir.1990) (explicating same principle in a termination of employment case). Because the district court recognized that this record lacked significantly probative evidence from which an inference of pretext (and, thus, an inference of discrimination) plausibly could be drawn, <em>Hawkins, </em>slip op. at 17, the court did not err in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for brevis disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\"><em>Affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. R. 27(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-7\">. Indeed, the record reveals that the plaintiff thrice completed the hospital's standard application (which was color-blind). On the first two occasions, the hospital rejected her application without an interview and, for aught that appears, without any knowledge of her race or color.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
