Because Selfs petition was time-barred by the one-year limitations period, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-23\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2), the one-year limitations period is tolled for \u201c[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review ... is pending.\u201d In <em>Nino v. Galaza, </em>183 F.3d 1003, 1006 (9th Cir.1999) <em>cert denied, </em>529 U.S. 1104, 120 S.Ct. 1846, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>146 L.Ed.2d 787 (2000), we held that the \u201cstatute of limitations remains tolled during the intervals between the state court\u2019s disposition of a state habeas petition and the filing of a petition <em>at the next state appellate level.\u201d Id. </em>at 1005 (emphasis added). Self asks us to extend the reasoning of <em>Nino </em>to this case where successive petitions were filed at the same appellate level to the state\u2019s highest court. We cannot do so. <em>See Dils v. Small, </em>260 F.3d 984, 986 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that statute of limitations is not tolled during gap between successive state habeas petitions filed to the state\u2019s highest court). Therefore, because Selfs petition would only be timely if the limitations period was tolled during the gap between his successive petitions to the California Supreme Court, his federal habeas petition is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b859-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
