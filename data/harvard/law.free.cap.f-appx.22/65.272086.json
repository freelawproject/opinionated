In October 1995, CWA conducted a training program which Farrell did not complete because she had the flu and other personal problems. On October 13, 1995, CWA terminated her. Farrell was told that she was terminated due to a low examination score and failure to complete the required training program, even though an instructor had previously told her that it was CWA\u2019s policy to retrain anyone who did not complete training and that if she failed the test, it would not be held against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Farrell, <em>pro </em>se, filed a complaint alleging that CWA discriminated against her on the basis of her national origin (West Indian/Antiguan). After the District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, Farrell filed an amended complaint alleging discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, and 1985(3), and state law. Thereafter, CWA moved to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to Rules 12(b)(6) and 12(c) for failure to state a claim and lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The District Court granted CWA\u2019s motion and dismissed Farrell\u2019s amended complaint. With respect to her discriminatory discharge claims, the District Court held that Farrell had failed to establish a <em>primei facie </em>case of wrongful termination. As for her retaliation claim, the District Court held that Farrell had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies because she had alleged only discrimination in her charge to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). Farrell filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">Reviewing the District Court\u2019s judgment <em>de novo, </em>we agree with the District Court that Farrell failed to allege a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination on the basis of her national origin. In order to state a <em>prima facie </em>case of discriminatory discharge, a plaintiff must allege that: (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she satisfactorily performed the duties of her position; (3) she was discharged; and (4) her discharge occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. <em>See, e.g., McLee v. Chrysler Corp., </em>109 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir.1997). Farrell has not established a <em>prima facie </em>case because she has failed to connect her national origin to her termination in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">As for Farrell\u2019s retaliation claim, we find, contrary to the District Court, that Farrell did exhaust her administrative remedies. While a plaintiff typically may raise in a district court complaint only those claims that either were included in or are \u201creasonably related to\u201d the allegations contained in her EEOC charge, this Court has held that a claim \u201calleging retaliation by an employer against an employee for filing\u201d the underlying claim of discrimination is such a reasonably related claim. <em>Butts v. City of N.Y. Dep\u2019t of Hous. Pres. &amp; Dev., </em>990 F.2d 1397, 1402 (2d Cir.1993). Nonetheless, we affirm the District Court\u2019s holding because Farrell has not stated a claim of retaliation as she has not alleged that the defendant has taken any specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>action against her as a result of her filing her EEOC charge and/or this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We have considered all of Farrell\u2019s claims raised, and we find them to be without merit. For the reasons set forth, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
