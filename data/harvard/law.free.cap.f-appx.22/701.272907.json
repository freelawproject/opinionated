Hughes pleaded guilty to attempted possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (1994), and the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to fifty-one months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. On appeal, Hughes argues that the Court failed to make factual findings at sentencing concerning his criminal history, and that it was required to do so given his objection to the presentence report (PSR).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-22\">After carefully reviewing the record, we cannot agree with Hughes that he objected to the PSR at sentencing. In fact, after the Court rejected a recommended victim-related enhancement, Hughes\u2019s counsel expressly informed the Court that Hughes had no other objection to the PSR. The Court therefore committed no error in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>adopting the rest of the PSR\u2019s factual findings. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b)(6)(D) (stating that District Court may accept unob-jeeted-to portions of PSR).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-8\">.
