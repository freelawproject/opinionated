Hostile Work Environment</p>\n<p id=\"b801-21\">Nina Busby\u2019s first claim is that she was subjected to a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII. Title VII prohibits discrimination in employment \u201cbecause of such individual\u2019s ... sex.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Sexual harassment constitutes sex discrimination in violation of federal law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, in this case, the district court correctly found that Nina Busby did not allege sufficient facts to suggest that she was subject to sexual harassment. As she stated in her deposition, \u201cThat\u2019s true, he did not <em>sexually </em>harass me. He <em>har-rassed </em>me.\u201d The only fact that Busby alleges which might possibly construed as sexual is that Faanes called her \u201cgirlie,\u201d \u201cgal,\u201d \u201ckiddo,\u201d and \u201cmissy\u201d instead of what she preferred to be called, either \u201cNina\u201d or \u201cSugar.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court did not err in deciding that this did not amount to sexual discrimination, as it cannot be reasonably understood to alter a \u201cterm, condition, or privilege of employment within the meaning of Title VII.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Neither does Ms. Busby offer sufficient evidence to support her allegation that she was subject to discrimination or mistreatment on account of her sex, <em>ie., </em>because she is a woman. Absent a prima facie showing of sexual harassment, Busby would have needed to provide evidence of sex-based discrimination to have survived defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In order to support a Title VII claim, the Supreme Court, in <em>Oncale v. Sundowner, </em>held that the plaintiff may choose any evidentiary route that proves \u201cthat the conduct at issue ... actually constituted discrimination because of sex.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In an attempt to prove sex discrimination, Busby claimed that a male dispatcher was not subject to the same treatment as the female dispatchers, because he was called by his first name, and not \u201cgirlie,\u201d and that Faanes didn\u2019t scream at him. However, Busby admitted that she could only think of three occasions when she had seen Faanes with the male dispatcher; so, her evidence of disparate treatment lacked sufficient foundation. It was not error for the district court to find that this did not constitute sex discrimination, where there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate a \u201cgeneral hostility to the presence of women in the workplace,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or the creation of \u201cdisadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex [were] not exposed.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There was no evidence that Faanes expressed hostility to women in the workplace, just that employees found him unpleasant and difficult to work with. Therefore, summary judgment was proper as to that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">II. Retaliation</p>\n<p id=\"b802-13\">Busby also claimed that she was subject to unlawful retaliation by Faanes. The elements of a Title VII retaliation claim include: (1) that the employee was engaged in a protected activity, (2) the employee was thereafter subjected by his employer to an adverse employment action, and (3) establishment of a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>expanded the statute to include retaliation by a co-worker if the activity is severe enough to rise to the level of an adverse employment action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Busby alleges that, after she refused Faanes\u2019s requests to disregard the requirements of the Criminal Justice Information Network, he retaliated against her. Faanes\u2019s alleged stalking of Busby is insufficient to demonstrate retaliation, because it occurred only after her resignation, when she was no longer an employee. Moreover, there is no evidence that Faanes\u2019s generally hostile activity was in retaliation for her reporting of his violations. Thus, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b801-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AFrT\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-5\">. <em>Meritor Savings Bank v.
