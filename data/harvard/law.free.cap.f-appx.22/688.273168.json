Following de novo review of the record, <em>see Whitley v. Peer Review Sys., Inc., </em>221 F.3d 1053, 1055 (8th Cir.2000), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-20\">Human Resources Manager Barry Little called Evans-who monitored Plastene\u2019s critical water supply during his shift-to his office on April 16, shortly after an incident involving the water supply. Although Evans maintained he had timely and correctly read the water gauges, Little decided to terminate Evans after the incident based on Evans\u2019s readings, which Little believed to be falsified; on the recommendation of Evans\u2019s supervisor, Gary Mercer; and on three previous warnings Evans had received concerning job performance. Although Evans asserts that genuine issues of material fact exist regarding his prior disciplinary record and the April 16 events, he did not meet his burden of producing evidence from which a jury could find that Siegel-Robert\u2019s preferred reason for his termination was pretextual. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-21\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-18\">. The Honorable Rodney W.
