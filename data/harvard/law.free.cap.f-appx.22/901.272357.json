Young appeals pro se the district court\u2019s judgment for defendants following a two-day bench trial in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 action alleging that defendants did not hire him as an independent contract taxicab driver because of his race. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-24\">We review the district court judge\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, giving due regard to the court\u2019s opportunity to judge the credibility of witnesses. <em>Brooker v. Desert Hosp. Corp., </em>947 F.2d 412, 415 (9th Cir.1991). We review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-25\">After reviewing the record, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred by believing the testimony of defendants and defendants\u2019 witnesses over the testimony of Young. <em>See Serv. Employees Int\u2019l Union v. Fair Political Practices Comm\u2019n, </em>955 F.2d 1312, 1317 n. 7 (9th Cir.1992) (stating that if the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record, the court of appeals may not reverse even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision that Young failed to establish that defendants\u2019 articulated reason for not hiring him was a pretext for race discrimination was not in error. <em>See Rodriguez v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>904 F.2d 531, 532-33 (9th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>This district court properly exercised its discretion by denying Young\u2019s motion to amend the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(b); <em>cf. Floyd v. Laws, </em>929 F.2d 1390, 1400 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Young\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b943-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
