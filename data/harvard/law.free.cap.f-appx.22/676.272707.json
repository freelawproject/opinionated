The district court sentenced appellant to 180 months imprisonment and three years supervised release. On appeal, Plummer\u2019s counsel has filed a brief \u2014 noting that the court departed upward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 \u2014 and has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Plum-mer has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Plummer expressly and voluntarily agreed in open court to the district court\u2019s upward departure and the resulting 180-month sentence, foreclosing an appellate challenge to these matters. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995). We have found no nonfrivolous issues for appeal after reviewing the record independently pursuant to <em>Tenson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-6\">.
