We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinions accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Cordero v. Wilkinson, </em>No. CA-01-237-1-17-BD (D.S.C. filed July 26, 2001, &amp; entered July 27, 2001; filed Aug. 6, 2001, &amp; entered Aug. 7, 2001). We deny Cordero\u2019s motion to recuse and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b240-29\"><em> Bivens v.
