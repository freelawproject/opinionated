The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s judgment of February 22, 2001, be affirmed. Appellant failed to raise in district court his argument that appellee Thomas\u2019 attorney made a judicial admission during opening statements, and there are no exceptional circumstances warranting the consideration of the issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See District of Columbia v. Air Florida, Inc., </em>750 F.2d 1077, 1084 (D.C.Cir.1984). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion to reopen his case. <em>See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., </em>401 U.S. 321, 331, 91 S.Ct. 795, 28 L.Ed.2d 77 (1971); <em>Wilson v. Good Humor Corp., </em>757 F.2d 1293, 1300 (D.C.Cir.1985). Appellant\u2019s remaining claims, regarding potential jury prejudice, are moot because the jury never decided appellant\u2019s case. <em>See Mitchell v. Maynard, </em>80 F.3d 1433, 1447 (10th Cir.1996) (after district court granted motion for judgment as a matter of law, claim jury prejudiced by seeing defendant in shackles moot).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
