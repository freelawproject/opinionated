We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment, <em>Balint v. Carson City, </em>180 F.3d 1047, 1050 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">We conclude that Livingston failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether prison officials were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. <em>See Jackson v. McIntosh, </em>90 F.3d 330, 332 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that difference of opinion regarding proper medical treatment does not constitute deliberate indifference).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">Moreover, Livingston failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether any delay in treatment caused him substantial harm. <em>See Wood v. Housewright, </em>900 F.2d 1332, 1334-35 (9th Cir.1990) (holding that gross negligence is insufficient to establish deliberate indifference and delay in treatment must cause substantial harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b949-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
