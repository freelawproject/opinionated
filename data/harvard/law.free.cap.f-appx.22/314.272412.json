Fersner alleged various members of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. The district court granted Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Higgins v. E.L DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment is appropriate only if there are no material facts in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). When ruling on a qualified immunity defense, we consider (1) whether the facts alleged show the violation of a constitutional right; (2) whether the right was clearly established; and (3) whether a reasonable official could have believed his conduct was unlawful. <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2155-56, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001); <em>Pritchett v. Alford, </em>973 F.2d 307, 312-13 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, joint appendix, supplemental joint appendix, and the district court\u2019s order and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Fersner v. Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, </em>No. CA-99-3099-AMD (D.Md. Apr. 11, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
