Woodson appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Hershey Chocolate of Virginia in his employment discrimination action. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>See Mitchell v. Data General Corp., </em>12 F.3d 1310, 1313 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-20\">Woodson first contends the district court erred in denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) motion to extend the time for discovery. The district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 56(f) motion is subject to review for abuse of discretion. <em>Gasner v. Board of Supervisors, </em>103 F.3d 351, 362 (4th Cir.1996). A review of the record shows ample opportunity for discovery between August 1999, when Woodson filed his complaint, and December 2000, when Hershey Chocolate moved for summary judgment. <em>See Lone Star Steakhouse &amp; Saloon, Inc. v. Alpha of Virginia, Inc., </em>43 F.3d 922, 929 (4th Cir. 1995). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Woodson\u2019s Rule 56(f) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-21\">Woodson further contends the district court erred in granting summary judgment because Woodson did not state a prima facie case of racial discrimination as a result of his discharge for fighting. <em>See Cook v. CSX Transportation Corp., </em>988 F.2d 507, 511 (4th Cir.1993). Woodson did not establish that any other employee who engaged in a physical altercation was disciplined less severely than he. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-22\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
