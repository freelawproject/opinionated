We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and find no reversible error. However, we modify the district court\u2019s order to reflect dismissal without prejudice to Dixon\u2019s ability to refile after he exhausts state remedies. <em>See Evans v. Smith, </em>220 F.3d 306, 324-25 (4th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal as so modified. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-25\">\n<em>DISMISSED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
