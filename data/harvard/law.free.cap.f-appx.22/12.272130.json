The Court has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined that they occasion no need for a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b54-16\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court is affirmed, substantially for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion of September 21, 2000. The Department of State reasonably construed the plaintiffs\u2019 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to demand production of only those documents that formed the basis for a letter, referred to in the request, written by the Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs. We have reviewed the records that the Department produced to the plaintiffs, and find that they are consistent with that construction. We also conclude that the affidavit submitted to the district court, in support of the Department\u2019s motion for summary judgment, adequately describes a search reasonably calculated to discover all documents responsive to plaintiffs\u2019 FOIA request. By failing to raise the issue below, plaintiffs waived their claim that the affidavit was inadequate because it failed to mention a search of the office of the Assistant Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-18\">The clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing. See D.C.Cir. Rule 41(a)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
