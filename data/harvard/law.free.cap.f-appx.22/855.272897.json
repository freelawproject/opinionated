We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">The district court did not err by imposing a six-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2)(C), which permits an upward adjustment for document trafficking offenses if the offense involved six or more documents. A review of the record indicates that there was sufficient evidence to support this enhancement because the prosecution proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Nguyen was involved with at least 100 documents. <em>See United States v. Maldonado, </em>215 F.3d 1046, 1051 (9th Cir.2000) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The district court properly refused to grant a three-level decrease under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(l), which applies if the defendant committed the offense \u201cother than for profit.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(l). Both witness testimony at trial and the pre-sentence report provided ample basis for the district court to conclude that Nguyen engaged in the scheme for profit. <em>See United States v. Buenrostro-Torres, </em>24 F.3d 1173, 1175 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">The district court did not err by imposing a four-level increase for Nguyen\u2019s role as a leader and organizer pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, which allows an increase if the defendant \u201cwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). A review of the record indicates that there is sufficient evidence to support a finding that Nguyen organized, led and managed at least some of the testing operations, that the operation involved at least five participants and that Nguyen exercised authority over at least one of those participants. <em>See United States v. Mares-Molina, </em>913 F.2d 770, 773-74 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">Nguyen was sentenced within the statutory maximum, so there was no violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) in this case. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Guardado, </em>228 F.3d 1017, 1027 (9th Cir. 2000) (rejecting proposition that <em>Apprendi </em>applies to a sentencing enhancement which increases the sentence, but not beyond the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b897-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
