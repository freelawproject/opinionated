Specifically, he challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-17\">When a defendant moves to withdraw his guilty plea before sentence is imposed, as Arnold here did, the court may permit the plea to be withdrawn if the defendant shows a \u201cfair and just reason .\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(e). We review the district court\u2019s denial of such a motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991). The district court\u2019s factual findings in support of its decision to deny the motion to withdraw will be overturned only if clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Suter, </em>755 F.2d 523, 525 (7th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-18\">Arnold claims error in the district court\u2019s analysis of the factors in <em>Moore, </em>931 F.2d at 248, in determining whether Arnold established a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for withdrawing his plea. Here, the district court deliberately and thoroughly considered each of the factors in <em>Moore. </em>In its adverse determination, the district court found that Arnold\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary, based upon Arnold\u2019s appropriately and thoroughly conducted Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 plea colloquy and the detailed statement of facts incorporated into the plea agreement, together with defense counsel\u2019s testimony. He further determined that Arnold\u2019s assertion of legal innocence was not credible, based upon the totality of the circumstances, including the nature of Arnold\u2019s previous profuse and threatening communications with Veronica Smith and the Waltons, which supported the reasonable conclusion that they were placed in fear of death or serious bodily harm by his actions. The district court also found that Arnold had the close assistance of competent counsel, and that withdrawal of his plea would cause some prejudice to the government. <em>Moore, </em>931 F.2d at 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-19\">While there is evidence supporting Arnold\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>cannot say on this record that in its thorough and well-reasoned consideration of all the evidence and of Arnold\u2019s claims in support of his motion, that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion to withdraw. Accordingly, we affirm Arnold\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
