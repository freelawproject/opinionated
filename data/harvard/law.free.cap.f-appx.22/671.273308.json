He also moves this court to take judicial notice of various proceedings before several courts or court entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">In his complaint Lewis alleged that defendant, a Little Rock code enforcement officer, filed a false criminal report accusing Lewis of assaulting him after he \u2022 served Lewis with a municipal ordinance citation. Upon de novo review, we agree with the district court that Lewis did not show that defendant was acting under col- or of state law when he made his report to the police. <em>See Roe v. Humke, </em>128 F.3d 1213, 1215-16 (8th Cir.1997). We deny Lewis\u2019s pending motion, noting it is unclear how granting it would help him. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R.- 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-16\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-13\">. The Honorable G.
