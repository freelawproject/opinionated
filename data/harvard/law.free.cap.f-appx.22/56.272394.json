Button argues that this constituted ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and asks this Court to remand to the district court for further factfinding with respect to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\"><em>\u201cA </em>defendant who pleads guilty unconditionally while represented by counsel may not assert independent claims relating to events occurring prior to the entry of the guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Coffin, </em>76 F.3d 494, 498 (2d Cir.1996). Because Bul-ton does not challenge his guilty plea, his argument is foreclosed. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
