Mu-riithi argues that the lack of counsel or access to a law library during the immigration proceedings denied him due process, his conviction for domestic battery \u2014 a ground for removal \u2014 was unconstitutional, and he met his burden of proving that it is more likely than not he will be subjected to torture if returned to Kenya.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-22\">We cannot consider Muriithi\u2019s first argument because he did not present it to the BIA, <em>see Valadez-Salas v. INS, </em>721 F.2d 251, 252 (8th Cir.1983) (per curiam), but we note there is no Sixth Amendment right to counsel at a deportation hearing, <em>see United States v. Torres-Sanchez, </em>68 F.3d 227, 230 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-23\">We need not consider Muriithi\u2019s claim that his domestic-battery conviction was unconstitutional, because he is also deport-able for failing to comply with the conditions of his nonimmigrant status \u2014 a finding he did not appeal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(l)(C)(i). Finally, substantial evidence supports the determination that Mu-riithi failed to show he more likely than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>not would be tortured upon his return to Kenya. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>cf. INS v. Elias-Zacharias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (BIA\u2019s denial of relief will be upheld unless alien demonstrates that evidence not only supports contrary conclusion but compels it, such that reasonable factfinder would have to conclude alien established eligibility for relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
