We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Hoyte, </em>No. CR-93-10 (W.D.Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>May 21, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b188-10\"> In his informal brief, Hoyte states he filed an amendment to his \u00a7 2255 motion prior to the district court's decision in this matter which was not considered by the district judge rendering the decision on the original \u00a7 2255 motion, but rather by a different judge who construed it as a new \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it as untimely. Because it is clear that the additional claims Hoyte sought to raise by way of amendment were, like the claims raised in the original motion, clearly barred by the one-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, \u00a7\u00a7 105, 110 Stat. 1214, 1220 (amending 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255), the fact the judge in this matter failed to consider those claims as part of this matter does not constitute error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
