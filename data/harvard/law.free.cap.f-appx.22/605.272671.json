Guerrieri, a pro se federal prisoner, appeals a district court order denying his motion for modification of sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>filed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">In 1995, a federal jury found Guerrieri guilty of: 1) maliciously damaging and destroying by means of an explosive Sadie\u2019s Casablanca Mediterranean Restaurant and devising and attempting to defraud and obtain money from Cigna Insurance Company through the mail in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; 2) arson in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 844(i) and 2; and 3) mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 2. The district court sentenced Guerrieri to 120 months of imprisonment and one month consecutive to that term of imprisonment for committing the offenses while on bond. This court affirmed Guerrieri\u2019s convictions and sentence. <em>United States v. Latouf, </em>132 F.3d 320, 332 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In 1999, Guerrieri moved the district court to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied that motion and certified that an appeal could not be taken in good faith. Guerri-eri did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In November 2000, Guerrieri sought to have his sentence reviewed and corrected under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, claiming that he was incorrectly sentenced under the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court denied Guerrieri\u2019s motion. Guerrieri appeals, reasserting the arguments set forth in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision denying a motion to modify sentence, <em>United States v. Coth-ran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1562 (11th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Townsend, </em>55 F.3d 168, 170 (5th Cir.1995), and review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Mimms, </em>43 F.3d 217, 220 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Guerrieri\u2019s motion. Guerrieri argues that he was incorrectly sentenced under the Sentencing Guidelines. Section 3582(c) provides that a court may not reduce a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed absent one of three specific circumstances: 1) the Director of the Bureau of Prisons moves for a reduction; 2) the government moves for a reduction pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 for substantial assistance; or 3) the defendant was sentenced to a guideline range that has subsequently been lowered if the Sentencing Commission designates that the change is to be applied retroactively. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). None of these circumstances applies in Guerrieri\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Accordingly, we hereby affirm district court\u2019s judgment pursuant to Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit, for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s memorandum of opinion and order of November 8, 2000.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
