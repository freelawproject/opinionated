We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-20\">We lack jurisdiction to address Payares\u2019 contentions regarding the merits of the district court\u2019s original entry of judgment because Payares both failed to file a notice of appeal within 60 days of entry of final judgment and failed to file a timely post-judgment tolling motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App.P. 4(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-24\">\u201cAn untimely motion for reconsideration is construed as a motion based on Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b).\u201d <em>Mt. Graham Red Squirrel v. Madigan, </em>954 F.2d 1441, 1463 n. 35 (9th Cir.1992). Denial of such a motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah County v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1262 (9th Cir. 1993). Because Payares failed to demonstrate mistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, newly-discovered evidence, or any other basis for relief from judgment, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying his motion to reconsider. <em>See id. </em>at 1262-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b931-35\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
