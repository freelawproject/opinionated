The district court sentenced Singleton to eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by a three year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>supervised release term. Thereafter, the district court revoked Singleton\u2019s supervised release and imposed a twenty-four month term of imprisonment based on several admitted violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Singleton\u2019s sole claim on appeal is that his twenty-four month sentence was unreasonable because it exceeded the recommended sentencing range of six to twelve months. Finding no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s revocation sentence, we affirm. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638 (4th Cir.1995). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
