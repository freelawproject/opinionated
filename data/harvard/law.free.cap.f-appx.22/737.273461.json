Fed R.App. P. 43(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b780-13\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-14\">Saied Alhori, a native and citizen of Sudan, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 decision affirming an Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of his request for asylum and withholding of deportation. We reverse the BIA and grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-15\">The BIA dismissed Alhori\u2019s petition solely on the ground that he lacked credibility. We must determine whether substantial evidence supports this finding. <em>Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1088 (9th Cir.2000). Although we can reverse the BIA only if we are \u201ccompelled to conclude to the contrary,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B), the BIA must still have a \u201clegitimate artic-ulable basis to question the petitioner\u2019s credibility, and must offer a specific, cogent reason for any stated disbelief.\u201d <em>Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir.2000) (quotations and citations omitted). Neither the record as a whole nor the BIA\u2019s opinion substantiates its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-16\">In finding that Alhori\u2019s testimony lacked credibility, the BIA relied primarily on what it characterized as \u201ca troubling amount of discrepancy in the level of detail\u201d regarding Alhori\u2019s various statements. The mere failure to spontaneously offer details of events already established in the record cannot support an adverse credibility determination when further detail is consistent with previous testimony. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>266 F.3d 1094 (9th Cir.2001). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>record amply demonstrates that Alhori testified to his arrest, his torture, and the circumstances of his dismissal from the military numerous times preceding any opportunity he had to describe these events in detail. The record further demonstrates that the IJ instructed Alhori to limit his responses to the questions asked, and circumscribed his ability to elaborate on the details. Although the IJ has the authority to conduct proceedings in an efficient manner, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(l), to curtail Alhori\u2019s testimony and then conclude that his limited responses undermine credibility demonstrates the sort of \u201cfatally flawed\u201d reasoning that cannot satisfy the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Aguilera-Cota v. INS, </em>914 F.2d 1375, 1381 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The BIA also based its adverse credibility determination on apparent \u201cimplausibilities\u201d in Alhori\u2019s testimony. These findings are not supported by substantial evidence. Nothing in the record indicates that either Alhori\u2019s training in the military or his position as a security official in the capital offered him any more knowledge of Sudanese politics or military strategy in the South than he professed to have. Mere conjecture on the part of the IJ that Alhori should have known more cannot support the BIA\u2019s finding. <em>See Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cconjecture and speculation can never replace substantial evidence\u201d). Similarly, the BIA\u2019s other findings of apparent implausibilities lack the sort of \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\u201d necessary to support an adverse credibility determination. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Hartooni v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 336, 342 (9th Cir.1994) (adverse credibility determinations require \u201ca specific, cogent reason for any stated disbelief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Because we are compelled to find Alhori\u2019s testimony credible, we also consider whether this evidence establishes his eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Chen, </em>266 F.3d at 1101 (\u201cbased on sound principles of administrative law and jurisprudence, we generally \u2018do not remand a matter to the BIA if, on the record before us, it is clear that we would be compelled to reverse its decision if it had decided the matter against the applicant\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Navas v. INS, </em>217 F.3d 646 (9th Cir.2000)). Alhori\u2019s unrebutted testimony demonstrates that he was arrested and tortured by government intelligence forces on several occasions because the government feared he was associated with opposition parties and would use his knowledge to aid them. This testimony establishes that Alhori was persecuted \u201con account of\u2019 an imputed political opinion. <em>See Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 890 (9th Cir.2001). Because the record demonstrates that country conditions have not changed, we are compelled to conclude that Alhori has established a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution making him eligible for asylum. <em>See Kataria v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1107, 1115 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Similarly, Alhori\u2019s testimony establishes a \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d should he return to Sudan, thus entitling him to withholding of removal. <em>See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 423, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987); <em>Duarte de Guinac v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1156, 1164 (9th Cir.1999). \u201cAlthough the \u2018clear probability standard for withholding of deportation is more stringent than the \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 standard for asylum, if a petitioner has suffered past persecution such that his life or freedom was threatened in his home country on account of a protected ground, he is presumed to be entitled to withholding of deportation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number><em>Duarte de Guinac, </em>179 F.3d at 1164. Nothing in the record here rebuts this presumption. We therefore grant Alhori\u2019s petition for withholding and remand to the Attorney General to exercise his discretion in granting asylum to Alhori.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; APPLICATION FOR WITHHOLDING GRANTED; APPLICATION FOR ASYLUM REMANDED (for the exercise of the Attorney General\u2019s discretion).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b780-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
