At her sentencing, Wood objected to the calculation in the presen-tence investigation report regarding the amount of drugs for which she should be held responsible and objected to the presentation of any evidence regarding drug quantity, insisting that the government was estopped from attributing to her any drugs deriving from transactions for which it had not held a codefendant, Calvin Powell, responsible in its plea agreement with him. The District Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rejected her argument, and after an evidentiary hearing, determined that she was responsible for 73.90 grams of cocaine. Wood was sentenced to five months of incarceration and five months of home detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The District Court properly rejected Defendant\u2019s argument, which we agree was meritless. Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b711-10\">. The Honorable Fernando J.
