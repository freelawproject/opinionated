Despite the fact that the magistrate judge gave Carter an opportunity to clarify his essentially incomprehensible complaint, Carter failed to do so. Accordingly, the district court dismissed Carter\u2019s action without prejudice. Because Carter could have proceeded with his action by amending and clarifying his complaint to provide the information requested by the court, his appeal of the order of dismissal is interlocutory and not subject to appellate review. <em>Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-22\">We therefore dismiss the appeal and deny Carter\u2019s motions for counsel, to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal, for \u201cSpecial Plea,\u201d and for \u201cAffidavit of Proof.\u201d We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
