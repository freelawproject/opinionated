Upon de novo review, we agree with the district court that Fox\u2019s complaint is barred by a settlement agreement in which Fox relinquished his rights to bring future actions against past or present Minnesota officers based on events occurring prior to March 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-27\">We do not address Fox\u2019s argument that the agreement was invalidated when the Minnesota Department of Corrections transferred Fox from the St. Cloud corrections facility to the Stillwater facility. Fox raised this issue for the first time on appeal. This issue remains unresolved as it was not presented to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir.
