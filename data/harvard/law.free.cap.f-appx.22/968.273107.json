R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>Mr. Anderson appeals the district court\u2019s rejection of his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation that Mr. Anderson\u2019s petition be rejected as time-barred under AEDPA. Alternatively, the district court ruled that all but one of Mr. Anderson\u2019s claims were procedurally defaulted. The district court dismissed Mr. Anderson\u2019s remaining claim of constitutional error in his in-court identification on the merits under the totality of the circumstances test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">After a thorough review of the record, we conclude that the district court correctly denied Mr. Anderson\u2019s petition. For the same reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, we dismiss Mr. Anderson\u2019s habeas petition. However, we take no position as to whether Mr. Anderson\u2019s claims are time-barred under AEDPA. Mr. Anderson\u2019s procedural default of the majority of his claims and his failure to show that the method of his in-court identification was constitutionally deficient under the totality of the circumstances test is sufficient, standing alone, to reject his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">We DENY Mr. Anderson\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS his appeal. We also DENY his motion to proceed in forma pauperis as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1010-22\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
