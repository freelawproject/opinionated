The court dismissed her suit because Xe\u2019s employment contract with Bally required her to resolve employment disputes via arbitration. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-19\">Xe is a pro se litigant, and we construe pro se filings liberally. <em>Whitford v. Bogli-no, </em>63 F.3d 527, 535 n. 10 (7th Cir.1995). But even pro se litigants are required to include legal argument and.some supporting authority in their briefs. <em>Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545 (7th Cir. 2001). Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(9)(A) requires the appellant\u2019s brief to contain the appellant\u2019s \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities\u201d and the record. Xe\u2019s brief asserts that the arbitration agreement violated her rights, but does not explain how, does not cite to legal authorities or the record, and does not propose a basis for concluding that the district court erred in dismissing her case. Because her brief fails to meet the basic requirements outlined in Rule 28(a)(9)(A), the district court\u2019s dismissal is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
