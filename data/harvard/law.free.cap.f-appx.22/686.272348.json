Lawson was convicted of four counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm and sentenced to 235 months imprisonment. We affirmed Lawson\u2019s conviction on appeal. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>173 F.3d 666, 672 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 909, 120 S.Ct. 256, 145 L.Ed.2d 215 (1999). Lawson then brought a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1994 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. IV 1998), claiming, among other things, that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied Lawson\u2019s motion without a hearing, but granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether Lawson\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to interview and subpoena certain witnesses. On appeal, Lawson contends he is entitled to a hearing on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Having reviewed the district court\u2019s decision de novo and concluded that the motion, files, and record of the case unmistakably show that Lawson is not entitled to relief, we affirm. <em>See Smith v. United States, </em>182 F.3d 1023, 1025 (8th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">We reject Lawson\u2019s request for a hearing because he cannot show that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689-90, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Lawson correctly contends that failure to interview potential witnesses is not a decision related to trial strategy, thus counsel\u2019s performance was potentially unreasonable. <em>See Whitmore v. Lockhart, </em>8 F.3d 614, 618-19 (8th Cir. 1993). Even if counsel\u2019s decision not to interview the potential witnesses was unreasonable, Lawson cannot prove prejudice. The testimony Lawson believed these witnesses could provide would not help prove his innocence of possessing a gun. Lawson contends these witnesses would bolster his claim, and refute the prosecution\u2019s claim, that he was the target, not the aggressor, of earlier gunfire. Regardless of earlier events, the firearm in question was recovered from Lawson\u2019s house immediately after he surrendered to police, thus establishing his possession. Additionally, because the challenged sentence runs concurrently with the sentences for three other counts, the challenged conviction and sentence has no harmful impact on Lawson\u2019s prison term. Lawson contests this reasoning, claiming it is an inappropriate application of the concurrent sentence doctrine. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>601 F.2d 972, 973-74 (8th Cir.1979). The concurrent sentence doctrine permits courts to dismiss without reaching the merits a claim attacking fewer than all multiple concurrent sentences if success on the claim would not change the term of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>Because the district court denied Lawson\u2019s claim on the merits, we disagree with Lawson\u2019s premise that the district court applied the concurrent sentence doctrine at all. Instead, we believe the district court properly discussed the concurrent sentencing scheme as one of the reasons why Lawson\u2019s claim fails to show prejudice. Finally, we reject Lawson\u2019s claim that his longer sentence imposed after trial shows prejudice. Lawson\u2019s sentence after trial was longer than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>his initial sentence after his guilty plea because Lawson lost the benefit of a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Both sentences were roughly in the middle of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Finding no reversible error, we thus affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-8\">. The Honorable Scott O. Wright, Senior United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
