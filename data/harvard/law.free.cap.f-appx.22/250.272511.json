On appeal, Parnell claims the district court erred by imposing pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3A1.2(b) (2000), a three-level increase in base offense level for assaulting the arresting officer in a manner giving rise to the possibility of serious bodily injury. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">We review the findings of fact of the district court for clear error and give due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts. <em>United States v. Cutler, </em>36 F.3d 406, 407 (4th Cir.1994). Under USSG \u00a7 3A1.2(b), if \u201cduring the course of the offense or immediate flight therefrom, the defendant ... knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that a person was a law enforcement or corrections officer, assaulted such officer in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury,\u201d the offense level is increased three levels. We conclude the district court did not clearly err in applying USSG \u00a7 3A1.2. <em>See United States v. Sloley, </em>19 F.3d 149, 154 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Parnell\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
