We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. The district court correctly determined that Sherrill waived his right to challenge the calculation of his sentence in this \u00a7 2255 proceeding. Further, although the court erred in concluding that the ineffective assistance claim was foreclosed by Sherrill\u2019s failure to raise it on direct appeal, <em>see United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120 (4th Cir.1991) (declining to consider ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal), such error was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>harmless because Sherrill did not establish counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness as defined in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Finally, because the discrepancy between Sherrill\u2019s affidavit and that of his counsel only involved whether Sherrill threatened to raise an ineffective assistance claim, and did not go to counsel\u2019s effectiveness, the district court did not err in declining to add a hearing to resolve the discrepancy. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
