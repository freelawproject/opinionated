He presents two questions for our review, which we have reworded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">I. Did the circuit court err in finding that the State had satisfied its burden of establishing that evidence found during the execution of a search warrant was legally obtained?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-13\">II. Did the circuit court err in finding that a warrantless intrusion of appellant\u2019s home by Delaware probation officers was a lawful \u201chome visit\u201d and that incriminating evidence observed during the home visit was admissible under the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Appellant was charged in the Circuit Court for Caroline County with three counts of second degree burglary, three counts of fourth degree theft, two counts of theft of property having a value greater than $500, and three counts of theft of property having a value less than $500. Appellant moved to suppress evidence obtained from his home and vehicle following the execution of a search warrant by the Delaware State Police. He also sought to suppress inculpatory statements made by himself, his wife, and two associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">At the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion, Sergeant Carsten Wendlandt of the Wicomico County Sheriffs Office testified that, on October 9, 2002, he received a report that the Winter-place Animal Hospital in Salisbury, Maryland had been burglarized. Sergeant Wendlandt spoke with the owner or operator of the business, Ms. Clark, who informed him that she witnessed a suspicious man peering into the windows of the office the evening before. Clark had written down the tag number of the man\u2019s vehicle. The vehicle was registered in Delaware to appellant and his wife, Emma Volkomer. Sometime during the week ending October 19, 2002, Sergeant Wendlandt showed Clark a photographic array that included appellant\u2019s picture. Although she \u201cgot a good look,\u201d Clark was unable to identify appellant as the man she saw on October 8, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Detective William Porter, a Delaware State Police Officer, informed Sergeant Wendlandt that the address listed on the vehicle registration was outdated and that the Volkomers\u2019 current address was \u201c7489 Canterberry Road\u201d in Felton, Delaware. On October 14, 2002, Sergeant Wendlandt, accompanied by another officer, went to the Felton address to verify that it was a residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">On October 18, 2002, Sergeant Wendlandt was contacted by Detective Porter, who was preparing a warrant to search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>appellant\u2019s home and vehicles for veterinary medicine. Sergeant Wendlandt did not remember whether he had shown Clark the photo array before the conversation with Detective Porter, but he testified that if he had done so, he would have informed Detective Porter that Clark was unable to identify appellant as the man she saw the night before the break-in. After speaking with Detective Porter, Sergeant Wendlandt went to appellant\u2019s home. He \u201cassist[ed]\u201d the Delaware State Police in executing the search warrant, but did not personally seize any items.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Detective Porter testified that Sergeant Wendlandt contacted him after the October 9, 2002 burglary of the Winterplace Animal Hospital. Sergeant Wendlandt relayed the tag number recorded by Clark. An investigation revealed that the vehicle was registered to appellant and Emma Volkomer.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">According to Detective Porter, the Delaware State Police had an agreement with Delaware Probation and Parole officers, whereby Delaware state troopers would report \u201ctips\u201d that a probationer or parolee was suspected of violating the terms of his or her probation or parole or otherwise suspected of involvement in criminal activity. The state police officers would then accompany the probation and parole officers on \u201csearches\u201d of the probationer\u2019s home. The Delaware State Police did this \u201con numerous occasions\u201d because \u201c[ijt\u2019s just easier using them than ... typing up a search warrant and that takes a couple of hours to do something like that when you can just get on the phone and call the probation officer and if the person\u2019s on probation they\u2019re allowed to go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">When Detective Porter checked to determine whether appellant was on probation or parole, he discovered that both appellant and Emma Volkomer were on probation. On October 18, 2002, Detective Porter contacted Thomas Webster, a Delaware State Probation and Parole Officer. He informed Officer Webster that appellant was a suspect in the Winter-place Animal Hospital burglary, and asked to accompany Officer Webster on a \u201csearch\u201d of appellant\u2019s home. Officer Webster agreed and met Detective Porter at appellant\u2019s home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>between 1:15 p.m. and 1:30 p.m. In total, four law enforcement officers were present; two Delaware State Police detectives, Porter and Durham, and two Delaware State probation and parole officers, Webster and Thompson. All of the officers entered appellant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Officers Webster and Thompson looked through the household, while Detective Porter \u201cfollowed them and ... observed what they opened and looked in.\u201d When questioned about the scope of the \u201csearch,\u201d Detective Porter testified, \u201cI think they [, the probation officers,] looked in ah, closets ah, I believe and I believe they opened up ah, cupboards and drawers. I think so, I don\u2019t....\u201d Detective Porter recalled that appellant remained seated in the living room. He could not remember whether Emma Volkomer escorted the officers around the house. The probation and parole officers \u201csearched\u201d for approximately twenty-five to thirty minutes, but nothing inside was seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">After all of the officers had exited appellant\u2019s home and were preparing to depart, Detective Porter observed a see-through \u201cWalmart bag\u201d containing \u201cnumerous [identical] boxes,\u201d \u201cunderneath the foundation of the house.\u201d Because it appeared \u201cstrange,\u201d he \u201cpointed this bag out to one of the probation officers.\u201d Detective Porter testified, \u201cI think it was [Officer] Webster and ah, [I] gave him the bag and he looked in the bag.\u201d Inside the bag, the officers found \u201cketamine drugs,\u201d a \u201cveterinary animal medication.\u201d Appellant and Emma Volkomer were immediately arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Following appellant\u2019s arrest, Detective Porter applied for a warrant to search appellant\u2019s home and vehicles. In support of the warrant application, Detective Porter described the initial intrusion into appellant\u2019s home as an \u201cadministrative search.\u201d After securing a warrant, Detective Porter returned to appellant\u2019s home between three and four hours after he was arrested. During the subsequent search, seven items were seized. Relevant to this case, the items included a box recovered from appellant\u2019s vehicle that contained \u201ccostume jewelry ... and some little trinkets,\u201d which still had price tags <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>attached. The attached price tags \u201cstood out\u201d to Detective Porter because he thought that a merchant would have removed them after selling the items.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Detective Porter also discovered a business card in the bottom of the box. When he called the phone number on the card, he learned that \u201ca little antique strip mall in Caroline County ... had been burglarized.\u201d Detective Porter related his discovery to the Caroline County Sheriffs Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Officer Webster was the next witness to testify. In October 2002, he was a probation and parole supervisor for Emma Volkomer. On the morning of October 18, 2002, he received a phone call from Detective Porter, informing him \u201cthat the Volkomers were suspects in a burglary.\u201d Appellant\u2019s probation supervisor was not present, but Officer Webster also reviewed appellant\u2019s file. Officer Webster did not complete the \u201cadministrative search\u201d form required to search a probationer\u2019s home because \u201cthere was no [administrative] search, it was a home visit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Officer Webster arrived at appellant\u2019s home at approximately 1:80 p.m. on October 18, 2002. He intended \u201c[t]o walk through during a home visit and to verify if anything [Detective Porter] said was corr[ect].\u201d He requested that Detective Porter accompany him \u201cas security.\u201d Officer Webster did not inform the Volkomers that he was coming because a home visit, unlike an administrative search, did not require prior notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Officer Webster knocked on appellant\u2019s door and was greeted by Emma Volkomer. He informed her who he was and that he was there to conduct a home visit. Emma Volkomer gave Officer Webster a tour of the home; Detective Porter followed. The officers walked through appellant\u2019s home for approximately fifteen to twenty minutes. Officer Webster did not recall opening any doors, closets, or cupboards.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Upon exiting appellant\u2019s home and walking to his vehicle, Officer Webster, along with Detective Porter, observed a \u201cWalmart bag or a clear plastic bag like you would get in a store. With boxes in it.\u201d As he walked closer to the bag, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Officer Webster could see boxes through the bag that were labeled \u201cketamine,\u201d one of the drugs that had been taken during the burglary of the Winterplace Animal Hospital. Officer Webster believed that he picked up the bag before Detective Porter did. He could clearly read the labels on the boxes inside before moving, or looking inside of, the bag. Upon discovery of the ketamine, Officer Webster arrested appellant for \u201cviolation of probation\u201d and Emma Volkomer for \u201cbreach of release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">During cross-examination, Officer Webster explained that he performs approximately thirty home visits per week. In a typical home visit, he requests the probationer to \u201cshow [Officer Webster] around his house, show ... his refrigerator, that ... kind of stuff.\u201d He is permitted to \u201ctouch stuff\u2019 and may request probationers to open doors, drawers, and closets. To perform a more intrusive \u201cadministrative search,\u201d he must obtain prior approval from his superiors. Generally, and at a minimum, reasonable suspicion that the probationer is violating the terms of probation is required to conduct an administrative search.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Officer Webster reiterated his intention on October 18, 2002, to perform a home visit, not an administrative search. In addition, prior to discovering the bag of ketamine, he was prepared to \u201csay good-bye\u201d to the Volkomers, but possibly urine test them for drugs at their next regularly scheduled meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Appellant also testified. In October 2002, he was on probation for one count of carrying a concealed weapon and one count of aggravated menacing. He had signed two \u201cConditions of Supervision\u201d agreements, consenting to be \u201csubject to arrest and to a search of [his] living quarters, person or vehicle without a warrant at any time by a probation/parole officer.\u201d He did so because he had \u201ca choice of being in jail away from everything or being on the street, ... as far as [he][was] concerned it wasn\u2019t a choice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">On October 18, 2002, he woke up to four officers knocking on his door. He sat in the living room, where he \u201cth[ought]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>he \u201cheard [Officer Webster] say we\u2019re here to do an administrative search.\u201d According to appellant, the officers requested Emma Volkomer to escort them around the home and \u201cordered] her to open up cabinets and ... a little cupboard underneath the stairs ... they didn\u2019t like lift the couch up and look under stuff like that, but they were searching through stuff....\u201d When the officers went outside, he became worried they would find the \u201cbag of drugs\u201d he secreted \u201cbeneath the foundation the night before.\u201d When the bag was discovered, he admitted the drugs were his.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The State called Detective Phil Dixon, a member of the Caroline County Sheriffs Department, as its sole rebuttal witness. Detective Dixon testified that, on September 20, 2002, the Denton Station Antiques Mall was burglarized, resulting in the theft of more than $5,000 worth of silver, glass items, and costume jewelry. The night prior to the break-in, the manager observed \u201c[two] white males and two young white females\u201d approach the business \u201cright at closing time.\u201d The two males walked around the back of the building, before returning to their \u201cgreenish, turquoise colored\u201d vehicle with Delaware registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">On November 13, 2002, Sergeant Ronald Dixon of the Caroline County Sheriffs Department,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was contacted by Detective Porter, who inquired about the Caroline County Sheriffs Department\u2019s investigation of an antique store burglary. During the October 18, 2002 search of appellant\u2019s home and vehicles, Detective Porter had discovered a business card for \u201cRosie\u2019s Past and Present\u201d in the box of antique items.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Sergeant Dixon contacted the owner, Rose Mulligan, who confirmed that her business \u201chad items inside the Denton [Station] Antique[s] Mall that were stolen.\u201d Mulligan\u2019s description of the items, including the \u201clittle [numbered] tags,\u201d matched items recovered from appellant\u2019s vehicle on October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>18, 2002. Several days later, Detective Porter gave the recovered box and its contents to Detective Phil Dixon. When Detective Dixon showed Mulligan the items, she confirmed that some of the items were hers.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">On January 2, 2003, Detective Dixon visited appellant, who was incarcerated in Delaware. After advising appellant of his Miranda rights and obtaining appellant\u2019s written waiver of those rights, Detective Dixon questioned appellant concerning the burglary of the Denton Station Antiques Mall. At first, appellant denied any knowledge of the burglary. He then stated, \u201cjust because Detective Porter got that stuff from my house, it\u2019s not enough to convict me.... [H]e might get me with being in possession of stolen goods, but that\u2019s better than burglary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">At the conclusion of the interview, appellant instructed Detective Dixon to tell his co-worker \u201cthat he was about six or eight feet from a good collar.\u201d Detective Dixon interpreted appellant\u2019s comment as an admission that he was present when a member of the Caroline County Sheriffs Department responded to the alarm at the Denton Station Antique Mall on September 19, 2002. Appellant then stated that he would tell Detective Dixon everything he knew about the robbery if Detective Dixon would arrange for appellant to have a phone conversation with Emma Volkomer. When Detective Dixon informed appellant that he could not arrange such a phone call, the interview ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Detective Dixon interviewed Emma Volkomer at the Wicomico County Detention Center on April 15, 2003. She made a statement implicating appellant and two other individuals, Eric Myers and Sheena Eastridge, in the Denton Station Antiques Mall burglary. She said that the participants used false names to purchase \u201cwalkie talkies\u201d from a store. Detective Dixon \u201ctracked down the sales receipts for those items.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">He then spoke with Myers, who admitted that he and appellant \u201cwere the primary persons that entered the [Denton Station Antiques Mall] and stole silver and other items that were missing.\u201d Detective Dixon also questioned Eastridge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>who initially denied any knowledge or participation in the burglary. Eastridge later confessed her complicity in the burglary to Detective Porter.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">During cross-examination, Detective Dixon agreed that he \u201cwould never have had [appellant] as a suspect in the [Denton Station Antiques Mall burglary] case,\u201d but for the call from Detective Porter.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Following the close of evidence, appellant argued that the initial visit was, in fact, an \u201cadministrative search,\u201d conducted in violation of his Fourth Amendment Rights. Because the officers were not legally present at his home, their discovery of the bag of ketamine did not fall within the plain view exception to the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, the evidence upon which the search warrant was secured was illegally obtained, and all of the evidence obtained as a consequence of that search, including the box of stolen items, the receipts for the \u201cwalkie talkies,\u201d and the inculpatory statements from appellant, Emma Volkomer, Myers, and Eastridge should be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The State countered that the bag of ketamine was discovered, in plain view, during a lawful \u201chome visit.\u201d Therefore, the search warrant was issued based upon legally obtained evidence and all of the evidence was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">On September 10, 2004, the circuit court issued an order denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. In its memorandum opinion, the court credited Officer Webster\u2019s testimony that the intrusion into appellant\u2019s home on October 18, 2002, was a \u201chome visit,\u201d and not an \u201cadministrative search.\u201d The court stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">The Delaware Department of Corrections has promulgated rules governing administrative searches of probationers^] homes. An administrative search of a probationer\u2019s home can be a full search for named items conducted by Parole &amp; Probation Officers rather than police officers. The [Superior] [C]ourt [of Delaware] in <em>State v. Harris, </em>734 A.2d 629 (1998), suggested that if Parole &amp; Probation officers do not comply with the Delaware Department of Corrections\u2019 rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>governing such administrative searches, evidence seized in violation thereof might be suppressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\">The only suggestion that this was not a home visit but an administrative search comes from [appellant\u2019s] characterization of it. The testimony of [Officer] Webster, who conducted it, was that it was not an administrative search. He said if it had been, he would have followed the procedures requiring him to seek his supervisor\u2019s approval and he did not do so. In addition, the evidence is that the intrusion was short in time and limited in scope. [Officer] Webster told [appellant] and his wife that he wanted them to \u201cshow him their home,\u201d not that he was there searching for anything in particular or in general. The fact that a police officer (Detective Porter) accompanied [Officer] Webster does not make it any more of an administrative search than it does a home visit. Police assistance is a matter of policy and procedure in either instance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">A provision of the probation forms signed by both [appellant] and his wife allows home visits, unannounced. Delaware Parole &amp; Probation policy is that officers should be accompanied by an officer from the jurisdiction in which the home visit is being conducted. As Detective Porter was from the agency having jurisdiction, and was available, he accompanied [Officer] Webster and [Officer] Thompson on his home visit. [Officer] Webster testified that they arrived at the home, knocked at the door, and identified themselves. [Appellant\u2019s] wife was asked to show them around their house, which she did. [Officer] Webster testified that they did not open any doors, closets, cupboards or containers but they may have asked [appellant\u2019s] wife to do so for them. [Appellant] says they went through and into everything, but he remained downstairs and could only see them for a portion of their visit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">The home visit lasted approximately twenty (20) minutes. As the three officers were leaving, they noticed a transparent shopping or supermarket bag (hereinafter \u201cWal-Mart bag\u201d) in plain view beside the steps and partially under the foundation. [Officer Webster] said that without moving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>bag or taking out the contents, he could see it had numerous identical boxes in it, labeled as a type of veterinary medicine .... [Officer] Webster did not need to move or open the bag to identify the contents. [Appellant] and his wife admitted they had no prescription for the medication, so they were arrested, either for possession of prescription drugs without a prescription, or violation of probation, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Affording full faith and credit to the search warrant issued by the Delaware court, the circuit court determined that the second search of appellant\u2019s home and vehicles was constitutional in both justification and scope. The court concluded that the evidence resulting from the second search was not subject to suppression as fruit of the poisonous tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Following the court\u2019s suppression decision, appellant pleaded \u201cnot guilty\u201d to one count of Fourth Degree Burglary based on an agreed statement of facts. Given the interest in the agreed statement of facts at oral argument, we find it useful to describe the statement of facts as presented to the court in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The State explained that on September 20, 2002, Sergeant Nepert of the Caroline County Sheriffs Department was dispatched to the Denton Station Antiques Mall to investigate a reported breaking and entering. The Denton Station Antiques Mall is essentially a consignment shop with more than sixty vendors displaying items for sale. When he arrived, he noticed that three display units had been broken into. Two of the display cases belonged to Rose Mulligan. Through his investigation, Sergeant Nepert determined that the perpetrators had gained entry to the property by cutting a hole in a chain link fence in the back of the building and had entered the building through a window air conditioning unit. Inside, the perpetrators tampered with an alarm. The night before, Deputy Chuck Briggs had responded to an alarm at the location, but upon a cursory investigation, did not see anything unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Barbara Coleman, the manager of the facility, informed Sergeant Nepert that, immediately before closing on the night before the burglary, she observed two white males and two white females, appearing to be in their early twenties. The two males walked around the back of the building. Coleman thought they had merely used the portable rest-room located there.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">The investigation was turned over to Detective Philip Dixon. Mulligan and the other victims provided Detective Dixon with a description of the items taken during the break-in. He was unable to identify any likely suspects and the investigation soon went cold.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">On November 13, 2002, Sergeant Ronald Dixon was contacted by Detective Porter, who \u201chad been involved in an execution of a search and seizure warrant\u201d at the Volkomers\u2019. In executing the warrant, the officers discovered a box containing numerous items with white price tags and a business card for Rosie\u2019s Past and Present Antiques and Collectibles, Rose Mulligan\u2019s business. The recovered items matched the description of items taken during the burglary of the antique mall.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">On January 2 or 3, 2003, Detective Dixon visited appellant while he was imprisoned in Smyrna, Delaware. After being advised of his Miranda Rights, appellant reportedly stated that \u201cjust because Detective Porter got that stuff from my house, is not enough to convict me. He might get me with being in possession of stolen goods, but that\u2019s better than burglary.\u201d Appellant also reportedly asked Detective Dixon why he should feel guilty for what he had done, after all \u201cthe land we live on was stolen from Indians.\u201d Moreover, appellant asked Detective Dixon whether the officer who had reported to the alarm at the Denton Station Antiques Mall wore eyeglasses, and knowing that Deputy Briggs did wear glasses, Detective Dixon responded affirmatively. Appellant smiled and stated, \u201c[Tjell your buddy that he was about eight feet away from a good collar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>In April 2003, Detective Dixon interviewed Emma Volkomer, while she was imprisoned in Wicomico County. Emma Volkomer reported that she, appellant, Myers, and Eastridge had committed the burglary at the Denton Station Antiques Mall on September 19, 2002. The group had visited the store the night before. Later, they went to a RadioShack store in Milford, Delaware, where Myers, using the name Jason Smith, purchased two-way radios. On the night of the burglary, Emma Volkomer and Eastridge were positioned across the street from the Denton Station Antiques Mall, acting as lookouts. The women notified appellant and Myers when Deputy Briggs was coming. Deputy Briggs circled the property and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The group obtained bags \u201cfull of silver items and jewelry.\u201d Later, the silver was melted down. They attempted, unsuccessfully, to pawn it in Delaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Following Detective Dixon\u2019s conversation with Emma Volkomer, an arrest warrant was secured for Myers, who was extradited from Delaware to Maryland. After being advised of his Miranda Rights, Myers confessed to involvement in the Denton Station Antiques Mall burglary, reporting a similar version of events as Emma Volkomer. Myers discussed purchasing the radio headsets from RadioShack. He also explained that he and appellant had entered the Denton Station Antiques Mall \u201cby pushing an air-conditioning unit through the wall and um, going in.\u201d When the alarm went off and Deputy Briggs arrived, appellant and Myers were hiding in the tall grass in the back, \u201conly a few feet from him as he shined his light over the grassy area.\u201d When Deputy Briggs left, appellant and Myers fled, picking up Eastridge and Emma Volkomer along the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Detective Dixon went to the RadioShack in Milford, where he found records evidencing the sale of radio headsets under the names Jason Smith and Chris Roberts.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">On the agreed statement of the facts, the circuit court found appellant guilty of fourth degree burglary and sentenced him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>to a three-year term \u201cconsecutive to any and all outstanding and unserved sentences.\u201d This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">STANDARD OR REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\"> When reviewing a denial of a motion to suppress under Maryland Rule 4-252, we are required to make an independent review of the legal questions presented at the suppression hearing by applying the law to the facts. <em>Nathan v.

In determining whether the action in question was proper, we \u201cmake our own independent constitutional appraisal by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Collins, </em>367 Md. at 707, 790 A.2d 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">Relying primarily upon <em>Jones v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 212, 775 A.2d 421 (2001), appellant contends that the circuit court erred in finding that the State had satisfied its burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the officers\u2019 initial entry into appellant\u2019s home \u201cwas a valid home visit [per Officer Webster\u2019s testimony] and not an unauthorized administrative search [per Detective Porter\u2019s testimony].\u201d According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>to appellant, the evidence \u201cstood in equip\u00f3se\u201d and was, therefore, insufficient to satisfy the State\u2019s burden. In addition, the court erred in determining that the State had satisfied its burden of establishing that the officers\u2019 discovery of the bag of ketamine fell within the plain view exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement because the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing was \u201cevenly balanced\u201d on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Appellant asserts that the burden was on the State to prove by a preponderance of evidence that the evidence the State sought to introduce was obtained legally. We disagree. When the State seeks to introduce evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant, \u201cthere is a presumption that the warrant is valid[,]\u201d and \u201c[t]he burden of proof is allocated to the defendant to rebut that presumption by proving otherwise.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald v. State, </em>153 Md.App. 601, 625, 837 A.2d 989 (2003). <em>See also Yeagy v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 1, 7-8, 491 A.2d 1199 (1985) (noting that, where a defendant challenges a search warrant that was issued based upon a false statement by an affiant, the defendant must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the false statement was made \u201cintentionally or with reckless disregard to its accuracy\u201d). The presumption that a search warrant is valid provides an incentive to police officers to seek judicial approval before effectuating a search. <em>Herbert v. State, </em>136 Md.App. 458, 492, 766 A.2d 190 (2001) (\u201cWhen the State has procured evidence of guilt by the favored and preferred modality of a warranted search, it is rewarded by a presumption of validity in favor of its warrant application.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The evidence that the State sought to introduce included the box and its contents obtained during the execution of a search warrant by the Delaware State Police. Accordingly, the burden rested with appellant to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the warrant was invalid. In attempting to do so, appellant claims that the initial intrusion by Parole and Probation Officers Webster and Thompson, accompanied by the Delaware State Police Officers, was illegal because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>probation officers did not abide by the administrative procedures established by the Delaware State Department of Corrections, Probation and Parole Division, for conducting an administrative search. Alternatively, he argues that the officers violated the scope of a home visit by moving or opening the bag under the foundation of his home and that the officers lacked probable cause to believe that the bag contained evidence of a crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Because the burden rested with appellant to establish that the warrant was invalid, if the evidence was \u201cin equip\u00f3se,\u201d as appellant contends, we would hold that the warrant was procured upon legally obtained evidence. As we explained in <em>Jone s,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">The burden of proof on the merits at a suppression hearing is by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">Therefore, when the court at a suppression hearing finds it more likely than not that evidence was obtained illegally, it should suppress the evidence. If, on the other hand, the court finds it more likely that the evidence was legally seized, it should deny the motion and allow the evidence to be introduced at trial. It is only when the court finds the evidence on each side of the issue to be equally persuasive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>that it must consider by which party the burden of proof is borne. <em>See </em>[Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions 1:7a (3d ed. 1993 <em>&amp; </em>2000 Supp.) ]. (\u201cIf you believe that the evidence is evenly balanced on an issue, then your finding on that issue must be against the party who has the burden of proving it.\u201d). Unless the court finds the evidence to be in this state of equip\u00f3se, the burden of proof has no effect on its disposition of its motion to suppress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">139 Md.App. at 227, 775 A.2d 421. <em>See also Fitzgerald, </em>153 Md.App. at 625, 837 A.2d 989 (\u201cOnce a warrant is shown to exist, the State wins the nothing-to-nothing tie (or a tie at any other level). The allocation of the burden of proof is the law\u2019s tiebreaker.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Nevertheless, we are not persuaded, as we explain in Part II, that the evidence relating to whether the initial intrusion was a home visit or an administrative search and whether Officer Webster saw that the bag contained ketamine before it was moved was \u201cevenly balanced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Appellant contends that the circuit court\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous. Specifically, appellant contends that the court erroneously \u201cdisregarded Detective Porter\u2019s testimony in its entirety, without offering any reason for doing so.\u201d Moreover, appellant argues that the circuit court erred in crediting the testimony of Officer Webster because it \u201clacked the hallmarks of believability because it was so internally inconsistent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences derived therefrom in favor of the State as the prevailing party, we do not believe that the circuit court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous regarding the \u201chome visit\u201d and Officer Webster\u2019s ability to see the \u201cketamine\u201d label through the bag. To be sure, Detective Porter\u2019s and Officer Webster\u2019s testimony with regard to whether the initial intrusion was a \u201chome search\u201d or an \u201cadministrative search\u201d was contradictory. Detective Porter, who had accompanied probation and parole officers on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\u201cfour or five\u201d occasions, repeatedly characterized the visit to appellant\u2019s home on October 18, 2002, as an \u201cadministrative search\u201d or a \u201csearch.\u201d He also testified, \u201cI think they [, the probation officers,] looked in ah, closets ah, I believe and I believe they opened up ah, cupboards and drawers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">On the other hand, Officer Webster, who conducts approximately thirty home visits per week, testified that \u201cthere was no search, it was a home visit.\u201d He did not remember opening doors, closets, or cupboards. Not only had Officer Webster conducted far more home visits with probationers, but as a probation and parole officer, he is presumably more familiar with the Division of Correction regulations concerning \u201chome visits\u201d and \u201cadministrative searches,\u201d than Detective Porter, who is a Delaware State Police Officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Officer Webster\u2019s testimony that the intrusion was a valid \u201chome visit\u201d was somewhat supported by appellant\u2019s own testimony. Although appellant repeatedly characterized the intrusion as a \u201csearch,\u201d he testified that Officers Webster and Thompson requested Emma Volkomer to escort them around the home and \u201corder[ed] her to open up cabinets and ... a little cupboard underneath the stairs ... they didn\u2019t like lift the couch up and look under stuff like that....\u201d Appellant\u2019s testimony was consistent with Officer Webster\u2019s description of the scope of a home visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the circuit court erred in crediting the testimony of Officer Webster over that of Detective Porter on the issue of whether the initial intrusion began as, and was conducted within the scope of, a valid home visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Even if the initial intrusion into appellant\u2019s home was, in fact, an \u201cadministrative search\u201d conducted in violation of procedures established by the Delaware Division of Correction, the analysis, but not necessarily the result, changes. In <em>Griffin v. Wisconsin, </em>483 U.S. 868, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987), the Supreme Court held that a warrantless search of a probationer\u2019s home, which was conducted pursuant to an administrative regulation substantially similar to the Delaware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Division of Correction regulation governing \u201cadministrative searches,\u201d did not violate the probationer\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. The <em>Griffin </em>Court declined to adopt a bright line rule that a warrantless search of a probationer\u2019s home was valid so long as the law enforcement officers had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d for the search. <em>Id. </em>at 872, 107 S.Ct. 3164. Rather, the Court determined that the search was valid because the administrative regulation supporting the search satisfied \u201cthe Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonableness requirement under well-established principles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 873, 107 S.Ct. 3164.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Subsequent to <em>Griffin, </em>however, the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Knights, </em>534 U.S. 112, 122 S.Ct. 587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001), held that law enforcement officers need only possess a reasonable suspicion that a probationer is engaged in illegal activity in order to conduct a warrantless search of a probationer\u2019s home. Therefore, even if the initial intrusion into appellant\u2019s home exceeded the permissible scope of a home visit, so long as the officers conducting the intrusion possessed a reasonable suspicion that appellant or Emma Volkomer were engaged in illegal activity, the intrusion would not have violated their Fourth Amendment Rights. In that instance, although the intrusion may have violated the Delaware Division of Correction\u2019s regulation, which appellant concedes was created in accordance with <em>Griffin, </em>the evidence would not be subject to suppression pursuant to the exclusionary rule. The exclusionary rule is a judicially created mechanism to deter Fourth Amendment violations by those charged with ferreting out crime, not violations of law enforcement protocol. <em>See Michigan v. Tucker, </em>417 U.S. 433, 439, 94 S.Ct. 2357, 41 L.Ed.2d 182 (1974) (holding that a suspect\u2019s rights were not violated and that inculpatory statements made by him to police were admissible even though the police \u201cviolated ... the prophylactic rules developed to protect [the suspect\u2019s rights]\u201d); <em>Ferguson v. State, </em>301 Md. 542, 547-48 n. 2, 483 A.2d 1255 (1984) (\u201c[T]he exclusionary rule ... [is] a judicially imposed sanction for <em>violations of the [FJourth [AJmendment </em>against unreasonable searches and seizures in state prosecutions\u201d). In light of our conclusion that the circuit court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>not err in crediting Officer Webster\u2019s testimony that he abided by the reasonable procedures established by the Delaware Division of Corrections in executing a home visit, we need not decide whether the officers possessed a reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify a more intrusive search of appellant\u2019s home under <em>Knights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Detective Porter\u2019s and Officer Webster\u2019s testimony with regard to the discovery of the bag of ketamine was also somewhat different, but not irreconcilable. Detective Porter testified that \u201cI think it was [Officer] Webster and ah, [I] gave him the bag and he looked in the bag.\u201d Detective Porter also stated that he could not read the labels of the ketamine until the bag was opened. On the other hand, Officer Webster testified that he believed that he was the first to pick up the bag, but in any event, before the bag was \u201cmoved\u201d he could see through the bag and read that the boxes inside were labeled \u201cketamine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Regardless of which officer first touched the bag, if Officer Webster could read the labels inside before the bag was moved, as the trial court believed he could, he would have obtained probable cause to believe that the bag contained evidence of a crime, namely the burglary of the Winterplace Animal Hospital. Therefore, the officers could seize the bag under the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. <em>See Wengert v. State, </em>364 Md. 76, 88-89, 771 A.2d 389 (2001) (explaining that, where an officer\u2019s initial intrusion is lawful and the officer observes an object that he or she has lawful access to, which is apparently incriminating, the officer\u2019s warrantless seizure of the object is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment). That Detective Porter could not also see through the bag is of no consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CAROLINE COUNTY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-8\">. Sergeant Ronald Dixon did not testify at the suppression hearing. After he spoke with Detective Porter, he made a brief investigation. The primary investigator of the Denton Station Antiques Mall burglary was Detective Porter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\">. Appellant does not contend that the guidelines established by the Delaware State Department of Corrections, permitting probation officers to conduct \u201chome visits\u201d and \u201cadministrative searches\u201d of a probationer\u2019s home, is unconstitutional. To the contrary, citing <em>Delaware v. Harris, </em>734 A.2d 629 (Del.Super.Ct.1998), appellant acknowledges that Department of Correction Procedure Number 7.19 was established \u201c[fjollowing the guidelines set forth in <em>Griffin v. Wisconsin, </em>483 U.S. 868, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987),\u201d in which the Supreme Court approved administrative searches and entries of a probationer\u2019s home, so long as the intrusion was conducted pursuant to a regulation that, in itself, satisfied the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness requirement. In his reply brief, appellant stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">For the warrantless inspection of a probationer\u2019s home to be valid under Delaware law, it must be either a home visit or an authorized administrative search. The nature of both of these intrusions is clearly defined. A home visit amounts to a less intrusive and routine inspection of the probationer's residence.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
