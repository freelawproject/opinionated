In 2002, at the request of the Employees\u2019 Retirement System of Baltimore County, Maryland (\u201cERS\u201d), Siedlecki underwent two medical examinations. The evaluating physicians determined that he was fit to return to full-time police work. Siedlecki then challenged ERS\u2019s authority under section 23-58(a) to have him examined. The Baltimore County Board of Appeals (\u201cboard\u201d), and thereafter, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County rejected the challenge. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court and so uphold the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The facts of this case are uncontested. Siedlecki was born on January 17, 1954. He began serving as a Baltimore County police officer in 1975. In 1983, he injured his back in a car accident while on duty. He sought treatment for low back pain over the next seven years, until the county granted him accidental disability retirement, beginning on March 16, 1990. He was thirty-six years old when he retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In the Spring of 2002, a neighbor of Siedlecki informed ERS that Siedlecki regularly engaged in strenuous physical activity. The county conducted surreptitious surveillance of Siedlecki from this neighbor\u2019s property. It then passed on the surveillance tapes to Drs. Hung K. Cheung, the medical director for Baltimore County, and Stephen R. Matz, an orthopedic surgeon, who conducted examinations for ERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Pursuant to section 23-58(a), ERS directed Siedlecki to undergo a medical examination. Dr. Matz examined Siedlecki on August 7, 2002, and issued a report on that date in which he concluded that \u201cfrom the standpoint of his low back Mr. Siedlecki is capable of returning to work as a police officer on a full-time basis unrestricted.\u201d Dr. Cheung examined Siedlecki on November 5, 2002, and reached a similar conclusion. The ERS\u2019s Medical Board also concluded on November 21, 2002, that Siedlecki could return to police work.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>On December 10, 2002, ERS rescinded Siedlecki\u2019s accidental disability retirement benefits. He appealed the decision to the board, which held hearings on June 26, 2003, September 11, 2003, November 20, 2003, January 22, 2004, and April 8, 2004. It concluded, by a vote of two to one, that Siedlecki was able to serve as a police officer<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and upheld ERS\u2019s decision to rescind his disability retirement benefits. The board issued a written opinion and order on August 24, 2004. Siedlecki then sought judicial review in the circuit court, which affirmed the board in a written opinion and order filed on April 11, 2005. Siedlecki noted a timely appeal to this Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">We rephrase the question for our review as whether section 23-58(a) allows periodic medical examinations of a Baltimore County police officer, who retired on an accidental disability before reaching age fifty-five and before completing twenty years of creditable service, until that officer attains the age of fifty-five. We construe the Baltimore County Code to allow for such examinations and, accordingly, to allow ERS to rescind disability retirement benefits based on those examinations and on other evidence in the record indicating that appellant was no longer disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\"> On appeal, we review the board\u2019s decision, not the circuit court\u2019s decision. <em>See Comptroller v. Phillips, </em>384 Md. 583, 590, 865 A.2d 590 (2005). Because this appeal raises a purely legal question, we may reverse the board\u2019s decision if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>was premised on an erroneous conclusion of law. <em>See Marzullo v. Kohl, </em>366 Md. 158, 171, 783 A.2d 169 (2001) (citation omitted). However, \u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172, 783 A.2d 169; <em>see also </em>Phillips, 384 Md. at 590, 865 A.2d 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Section 23-58(a) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">Once each year during the first five (5) years following the retirement of a member on a disability retirement allowance, and once in every three-year period thereafter, the board of trustees [of ERS] may and upon his application shall require <em>any disability beneficiary who has not yet attained the normal service retirement age to undergo a medical examination, </em>such examination to be made at the place of residence of such beneficiary or other place mutually agreed upon, by a physician or physicians designated by the board of trustees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">(Emphasis added). The Baltimore County Code currently does not define the phrase \u201cnormal service retirement age.\u201d We must apply the cannons of statutory construction to divine the legislature\u2019s intended definition. <em>See Phillips, </em>384 Md. at 591, 865 A.2d 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">First, we read the plain language of that section with the perspective of \u201cthe overall purpose of the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Zografos v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>165 Md.App. 80, 101, 884 A.2d 770 (2005) (stating that statutory language should be read in context, not in isolation) (citation omitted). \u201cThe statute must be construed as a whole so that no word, clause, sentence, or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>384 Md. at 591, 865 A.2d 590. If the plain language is clear and consistent with the statutory scheme, our review ends and we give full effect to the statutory language. <em>See id. </em>If the language is unclear, we may turn to \u201clegislative history, prior case law, and [the] statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d is not presently defined for police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>officers, the parties agree that its meaning is unclear. They ask us to ascertain the legislature\u2019s intent from other, related provisions of the law and from legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Siedlecki argues that, under section 23-58(a), the County Council intended a police officer to reach \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d twenty years after the officer began police service. He refers us to section 23-51 (d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">Sec. 23-51. ALLOWANCE FOR SERVICE RETIREMENT-POLICE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">(d) A member who retires on or after July 1, 1995 shall be entitled to receive a service retirement allowance <em>irrespective of age </em>... <em>provided such member shall have a minimum of twenty (20) years of creditable service.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af\">(Emphasis added). Siedlecki recognizes in his brief that section 23-51, by its title, refers to service retirement, not disability retirement. Yet, he argues that the twenty-year standard articulated in section 23-51 applies in either circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Siedlecki\u2019s position is that he would have become eligible for retirement in 1995, twenty years after he began serving as a police officer, but for the accidental injury in 1983. He argues that, after 1995, ERS could not subject him to periodic medical examinations, and consequently, the medical examinations required by ERS in 2002 were without lawful authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">ERS, on the other hand, contends that \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d is a specific age, even if that age is not currently articulated for police officers in the Baltimore County Code. Relying on legislative history, ERS argues that the \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d for a police officer is fifty-five, unless the officer has completed at least twenty years of creditable service at the time of retirement, in which case the officer may retire regardless of age. ERS maintains that it was authorized to ask Siedlecki to undergo medical examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>tions in 2002, because he was forty-eight years old and had completed only fifteen years of creditable service when he retired in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Having reviewed the legislative history outlined by ERS, we conclude that \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d has the meaning ascribed to it by ERS. The phrase was first used for police officers in the Baltimore County Code in 1959, when the county divided its employees into four groups, the last of which, Group 4, included police officers and firefighters. <em>See </em>County Council of Baltimore County, Md., 1959 Leg. Sess., Bill No. 138 \u00a7 41\u20144. In 1959, the law stated that \u201c[t]he normal service retirement age shall be ... the age of sixty for Group 4 members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 41-13. The law further provided that a police officer could retire \u201cbefore attaining the normal service retirement age provided he has completed thirty or more years of e[re]ditable service.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The 1959 law set the \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d for employees in Groups 1 through 3 at age sixty-five. <em>See id. </em>Because the retirement age for Group 4 members differed from that for members of Groups 1 through 3, the County Council referred to \u201cnormal service retirement age,\u201d rather than a specific numerical age, when discussing retirement in other sections of the Baltimore County Code. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41-13-19, \u00a7 41-49. Notably, at this time, the County Council replaced the phrase \u201cage sixty-five\u201d with \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d in section 41-19, which allowed for medical examinations of employees retired on disability and was the predecessor to section 23-58(a). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 41-19. This section applied to members of Groups 1 through 4, some of whom were expected to retire at sixty-five, and others of whom were expected to retire at sixty. <em>See id. </em>Thus the 1959 law specifically tied the phrase \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d to a chronological age, depending on the group to which the employee belonged.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The definition of \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d for Group 4 members was lowered in 1967 to fifty-five. <em>See </em>County Council of Baltimore County, Md., 1967 Leg. Sess., Bill No. 49 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u00a7 41-13. Also, the law was changed to allow an officer to retire before age fifty-five if the officer had completed at least twenty-seven and one-half years of creditable service. <em>See id. </em>In 1978, the law changed again to allow an officer to retire \u201cbefore attaining his normal service retirement age\u201d if the officer \u201ccompleted twenty (20) or more years of creditable service ... regardless of age.\u201d Baltimore County Code \u00a7 20-18 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The next notable legislative amendment to the Baltimore County Code occurred in 1994, when broad changes were made to the retirement benefits, primarily for those members of Group 4 who were employed by the fire department. <em>See </em>County Council of Baltimore County, Md., 1994 Leg. Sess., Bill No. 84-94. A new section was added to provide a service retirement allowance for fire department personnel, depending upon the attainment of certain ages and/or years of creditable service. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2. In so doing, the County Council found it necessary to remove the definition of \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d for fire department personnel from section 23-48(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1. However, the County Council removed that definition from section 23-48(a) for <em>all </em>Group 4 members, which included police officers, and it did not add language anywhere else in the code defining \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d for police officers. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1-2. Yet the phrase \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d still appeared in provisions of the Baltimore County Code providing for police service retirement allowance (sections 23-49(b)-(c),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 23-51(b)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>), and re-examination of disability retirees (section 23-58).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">ERS convincingly argues that nothing in the preamble or language of Bill 84-94 indicates that the County Council <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>intended to eliminate the definition of \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d for police officers. The failure of the County Council to transfer the definition of \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d to provisions applicable to police officers was, as ERS contends, a \u201cdrafting oversight [that] should not be permitted to eliminate the long established age of [fifty-five] as normal service retirement age for Group 4 police members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The conclusion that the County Council intended fifty-five to be the \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d for police officers is buttressed by the language of section 28-60,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which pertains to persons who receive payments from the retirement system after ceasing to be employees for reasons <em>other than </em>death or retirement. This section is commonly known as the \u201cvesting\u201d provision. It allows Group 4 members to opt for \u201ca deferred retirement allowance\u201d at age fifty-five, while members of Groups 1 through 3 must wait until age sixty. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Siedlecki correctly points out that section 23-60, by its terms, does not apply to him, as he ceased to be an employee because of retirement. However, viewed in the context of the legislative history outlined above, section 23-60 supports the conclusion that the County Council intended \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d to mean the same thing throughout the Baltimore County Code. We do not discern any reason why the County Council in 1994 would have maintained the specific retirement age of fifty-five in the vesting provision, but purposefully removed it from the provision authorizing medical examinations and other provisions for police service retirement allowances. W must \u201canalyze the statutory scheme as a whole and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect.\u201d <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 563, 577, 870 A.2d 186 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d for police does not mean age fifty-five, the only other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>definition in the Baltimore County Code for that phrase would be after \u201ctwenty (20) years of creditable service.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 23-51(c). However, at the time of his disability retirement in 1990, Siedlecki had accrued only fifteen years of creditable sendee and could not accrue any more creditable service after beginning such retirement. The Baltimore County Code distinguishes between \u201cservice,\u201d which \u201cmeans service as employee paid for by employer,\u201d and \u201cretirement,\u201d which \u201cmeans withdrawal from active service.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 23\u201436(t), (x).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Before 1990, Siedlecki was an <em>employee </em>who received <em>compensation, </em>but after 1990, Siedlecki was a <em>retiree </em>who collected an <em>allowance. </em>Moreover, \u201ccreditable service\u201d means \u201cmembership sendee,\u201d military service, and, with certain restrictions, prior sendee. <em>See </em>\u00a7 23-47(a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cMembership service\u201d is defined as \u201chonorable and faithful service as <em>an employee </em>rendered while a member of the retirement system.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 23-36(o) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus Siedlecki\u2019s time spent on disability retirement is not \u201ccreditable service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Siedlecki seeks to sidestep the requirement of twenty years of creditable service by claiming that the \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d should be twenty years after his entry into service with the Baltimore County Police Department. In other words, Siedlecki argues that, under section 23-51(c), he would have been eligible to retire in 1995, after twenty years of creditable service, <em>but for </em>his accidental injury that resulted in his disability retirement. This argument is without merit for the simple reason that nowhere in the Baltimore County Code is a normal retirement associated with anything other than age and/or creditable service. To read into the statute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>meaning for \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d that is unsupported by the purpose and language of the statute would violate the cannons of statutory construction. <em>See Phillips, </em>384 Md. at 591, 865 A.2d 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u201c \u2018Adherence to the meaning of words does not require or permit isolation of words from their context ... (since) the meaning of the plainest words in a statute may be controlled by the context.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson v. State, </em>21 Md.App. 557, 568, 321 A.2d 549 (1974) (quoting <em>Maguire v. State, </em>192 Md. 615, 623, 65 A.2d 299 (1949)). From 1967 until 1994, the phrase \u201cnormal service retirement age\u201d meant the specific age of fifty-five for police officers. We do not believe that the County Council intended that meaning to change when it re-structured the law in 1994. As such, the age of fifty-five continues to be the ordinary benchmark for police officers\u2019 retirement. This benchmark applies to the vesting provisions, the retirement allowance provisions, and the provision authorizing medical examinations alike. Because in 2002 Siedlecki had not attained the age of fifty-five or completed twenty years of creditable service, ERS was authorized to request medical examinations and terminate his disability retirement as a result of those examinations and other evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-11\">.
