Fullbright,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of one count of second-degree assault, one count of possession of a deadly weapon with intent to injure, one count of first-degree burglary, one count of third-degree burglary, and one count of fourth-degree burglary. The jury acquitted appellant of first-degree assault. On January 18, 2005, the court sentenced appellant to seven years imprisonment for the second-degree assault conviction and a consecutive three-year sentence for the possession of a deadly weapon with intent to injure conviction. The court merged the third-degree and fourth-degree burglary convictions into the first-degree burglary conviction, and sentenced appellant to a concurrent five-year term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>On appeal, appellant presents a single question for our review, which we have re-phrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\">Whether the trial court erred or abused its discretion by admitting the opinion of the investigating police officer, who was not qualified as an expert witness, to explain why a bloody knife used in the assault was not tested for fingerprints.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Finding no error, we affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">This case arises out of the assault of Helen Ringer and burglary of her home during the early morning hours of Monday, February 16, 2004. At trial, in its case-in-chief, the State called two witnesses, Helen Ringer and Officer Bradley Bechtel of the Baltimore City Police Department. Ringer\u2019s testimony was as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Ringer first met appellant through a mutual friend in September 2002, and she and appellant became bowling partners. Beginning in June 2003, Ringer and appellant became romantically involved and dated \u201coff-and-on\u201d until December 2003. Ringer testified that, during the course of their relationship, appellant had laid hands on her; she described those occasions as \u201c[wjrestling,\u201d which \u201cgot out of hand a couple of times,\u201d but \u201c[njothing violent.\u201d Ringer also stated that appellant stalked her, and would \u201cpop up [at] various locations [she was] at\u201d after she had told appellant that she did not want to see him. On one occasion, Ringer reported the stalking to the Baltimore County Police. According to Ringer, she told appellant that he should \u201cgo his separate way,\u201d but that \u201ceverywhere [she] went, he would all suddenly pop up, [and] continuously lie to things.\u201d She further recalled that once or twice a week she would find her vehicle tires flat, and that graffiti was written on the side of her home. Ringer suspected appellant, but did not file charges against appellant because she felt that she did not have enough evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">On the evening of February 15, 2004, Ringer, appellant, and members of their bowling league gathered at the Pinland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Bowling Alley on Dundalk Avenue in Baltimore County. Appellant, who was normally outgoing, was quiet that evening. He was also unusually dressed, wearing dark pants, an off-white solid long sleeve shirt, and a necktie.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Appellant left the bowling alley at around 10:00 p.m., approximately twenty minutes before Ringer. As Ringer drove home, she spotted appellant\u2019s white and pink leisure van in the lot of a McDonald\u2019s restaurant; the van was turned to face Dundalk Avenue. Frightened that appellant might be stalking her, Ringer met her friend, Bob Hittle, at Rigerio\u2019s Restaurant on Eastern Avenue, so that she could \u201ccalm down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Ringer arrived home at about 11:55 p.m. When she reached her street, she noticed appellant\u2019s van parked on a dead end side street, approximately a block and a half from her house. Ringer drove past her house to see if appellant was there before driving around the block to double check that the van was appellant\u2019s. Although Ringer did not get out of her car and approach the van when she circled back around to look at it, she \u201ckn[e]w it was [appellant\u2019s] van.\u201d When Ringer did not see anyone in the van, she proceeded home.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Ringer entered her house through the front door. At that time she was talking to Hittle on her cell phone. She went to her bedroom, turned on the night-stand light, and then walked towards the kitchen to get a can of Coca-Cola. As Ringer entered the kitchen, appellant, who was crouched down hiding in front of the refrigerator, attacked her. Ringer testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa6\">[Appellant] jumped out at me and I noticed a knife in his hand. I grabbed the blade of that knife with my left hand and held on. I had put my hands up to defend myself, and that\u2019s when I got cut on my right hand. And I grabbed the knife blade with my left hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Ringer recognized the knife as her own; it was approximately ten inches long, with a wooden handle. Once she grabbed the knife, Ringer explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">I didn\u2019t let go. I held on to the knife and then I was forced to the\u2014my floor because I wouldn\u2019t let go of the knife. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>kept saying, \u201cLet go of the knife.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, because you\u2019re going to kill me,\u201d and he said yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\">So I was not going to let go of that knife. And he actually got me to my kitchen floor. And then he started choking me. And I still wouldn\u2019t let go of the knife. And I begged with him to, please, let go of the knife, leave my home, that if he would leave that I would tell them someone broke in, I don\u2019t know who. And then I would not tell the police it was him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">After some time, Ringer was finally able to convince appellant to let go of the knife. Ringer testified that before appellant left her home, she heard him say: \u201cYes, you\u2019re going to tell the police it was me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The attack lasted approximately ten to fifteen minutes, during which time Ringer could see appellant, and recalled that he was wearing the same clothes that he wore earlier that evening at the bowling alley.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Following the attack, Ringer called the police and an ambulance. As a result of the attack, Ringer sustained injuries to both of her hands, which required stitches and several weeks of physical therapy. Ringer positively identified appellant in court as the man who attacked her.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Ringer did not know how appellant got into her home. She had given him a key on a prior occasion to do work on the interior of the house, but appellant had returned that key. Ringer also noted that after the attack, she stopped getting flat tires.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Officer Bechtel testified that he responded to Ringer\u2019s home at 12:22 a.m. on February 16, 2004. When he encountered Ringer, she was suffering from several lacerations and her hands were bleeding. According to Officer Bechtel, Ringer was \u201ccalm,\u201d although \u201cupset,\u201d and \u201cshe was trying to be composed.\u201d Ringer told Officer Bechtel that her ex-boyfriend attacked her with a knife. Officer Bechtel observed blood on the floors in the dining room, living room, and kitchen, as well as a bloody knife in the kitchen. He saw no evidence of forced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>entry to Ringer\u2019s home. Officer Bechtel arranged for Ringer to be transported to Union Memorial Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Thereafter, Officer Bechtel called for the Crime Lab and a supervisor. The Crime Lab responded and took pictures of Ringer\u2019s home. Officer Bechtel directed the Crime Lab to recover the knife, which was covered with blood. That same night, the knife was marked as \u201cProperty Number 04008805,\u201d sealed in a box by the Crime Lab technician, and placed in Evidence Control.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Based on information provided by Ringer, Officer Bechtel arrested appellant at his home at around 2:00 a.m. on February 16, 2004. According to Officer Bechtel, the travel time between Ringer\u2019s home and appellant\u2019s home was approximately twenty minutes. At the time of his arrest, appellant was wearing gray dress pants and a striped shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">At trial, appellant called only one witness, an alibi witness, Bobby Hunter. Hunter testified that appellant worked for him on February 15, 2004, from 10:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. Hunter also testified that he was with appellant at a restaurant around the time of the attack. According to Hunter, he met appellant at around 10:10 p.m., at a Burger King. Appellant was wearing dress clothes. Appellant explained that he needed to have his van towed to his daughter\u2019s house, so Hunter followed as the van was towed. Thereafter, Hunter and appellant went to another restaurant where they remained until midnight. Hunter then drove appellant to his home, approximately fifteen to twenty minutes away from the restaurant. Appellant elected not to testify in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">On rebuttal, the State called Ringer\u2019s son-in-law, Andrew Horant. Horant testified that appellant contacted him during the afternoon of February 15, 2004, to tell him that his van was working again, and Horant could pick up the car that he had loaned appellant. When Horant arrived at appellant\u2019s house at around 2:00 p.m.\u20142:30 p.m., appellant was wearing dress pants. Appellant said that he had attended church services that morning. Horant also testified that he frequent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ed the same Burger King where Hunter said that he met appellant on the night of February 15, 2004, and that he (Horant) believed that the restaurant closed at 10:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Regarding the single issued raised in this appeal, during opening argument, defense counsel stated, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">The problem in all of this is[,] is [appellant] the one that did it? Helen Ringer is going to tell you he did. But you\u2019re going to hear that the knife that was used was left behind, never printed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">The house was never printed. His hands were never tested to see whether there was any blood on them. The clothing he was wearing was never taken into evidence. His house was never searched to see whether there was any blood, any clothing, the key to her house, none of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">His keys weren\u2019t taken into evidence to see whether he had a key to her house. Because you\u2019re going to hear there\u2019s no sign of forced entry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">His van was never searched. There\u2019s absolutely no evidence you\u2019re going to hear corroborate that he is the one that cut her hands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">During his testimony, Officer Bechtel identified the box and the knife. He described the knife as having a four and one-half inch handle and a seven and one-half inch blade. He noted that the box was marked with a property tag, a biohazard sticker (due to blood on the knife at the time it was recovered), as well as the complaint number. Thereafter, without objection, the knife was admitted into evidence as State\u2019s Exhibit Number 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">With regard to the knife, on direct examination, Officer Bechtel testified, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: Now, Officer Bechtel, to your knowledge, were any prints conducted on that knife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-13\">[BECHTEL]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: And why weren\u2019t prints conducted on that knife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>[BECHTEL]: At the time of the incident, there was blood that was still on there. It was in a wet condition. You know, stating that, from my past\u2014from my experience\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApC\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: You may continue^]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">[BECHTEL]: From my experience and training in the Police Academy in regards to recovering latent prints\u2014 [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">[BECHTEL]: Off the knife or off of wet objects, it\u2019s pretty much\u2014it\u2019s hard to get good prints off of blood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Later, on cross-examination, Officer Bechtel testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Now, you said that you recovered the knife and you did not try to get any\u2014you did not submit it for fingerprints?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-11\">[BECHTEL]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:' And that was based on training you received in the Academy four years ago?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-13\">[BECHTEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: You\u2019ve never worked in a crime lab; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-15\">[BECHTEL]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you even try to submit it just to see whether your training in the Academy could be wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-17\">[BECHTEL]: Based on my training in the Academy, I\u2014I submitted it as evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-18\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But you didn\u2019t submit it to the Crime Lab to see whether they could try to find prints on the knife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-19\">[BECHTEL]: No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-20\">Defense counsel then elicited from Officer Bechtel the following admissions regarding the police investigation. Officer Bechtel did not ask the Crime Lab to check appellant\u2019s hands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>for blood or the door knob in Ringer\u2019s home for fingerprints. He did not obtain a search warrant for appellant\u2019s house or van. Officer Bechtel did not recover any clothing that appellant was wearing at he time of the attack, nor did he check appellant\u2019s house or van for clothing, shoes with blood on the bottom, or \u201cany type of evidence at all.\u201d When appellant was arrested, Officer Bechtel did not take appellant\u2019s keys and did not check to see if there was a key to Ringer\u2019s home on appellant\u2019s key ring. Officer Bechtel also did not try to find a key to Ringer\u2019s home in appellant\u2019s house or van. He did not know whether there was any blood in the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Defense counsel concluded the above line of inquiry as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Basically ... Ringer said that [appellant] did it. Did you do any further investigation after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">[BECHTEL]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Relying on the recent Court of Appeals case, <em>Ragland v. State, </em>385 Md. 706, 870 A.2d 609 (2005), appellant argues that the trial court erred in admitting testimony from Officer Bechtel that, based on his training and experience, it is \u201chard\u201d to recover \u201cgood\u201d latent fingerprints from wet objects. According to appellant, by admitting Officer Bechtel\u2019s testimony explaining the reason why he did not obtain fingerprints from the bloody knife found in Ringer\u2019s home following the attack, the court improperly allowed Officer Bechtel to give an unqualified expert opinion that \u201cplugged a hole in the State\u2019s case.\u201d Consequently, appellant argues that his conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">In response, the State contends that appellant\u2019s argument regarding the admission of Officer Bechtel\u2019s opinion was waived, because defense counsel elicited the same opinion from Officer Bechtel on cross-examination. Nevertheless, the State asserts that Officer Bechtel\u2019s testimony was not the sort of testimony that the Court of Appeals found objectionable in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>Ragland, </em>because Officer Bechtel\u2019s opinion was not used to prove an element of the crime alleged, but merely to explain why the knife was not tested for fingerprints. In addition, the State contends that because defense counsel raised the lack of fingerprint evidence from the knife in her opening statement, Officer Bechtel\u2019s testimony amounted to anticipatory rehabilitation evidence, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting such testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">As a threshold matter, we reject the State\u2019s preservation argument. Simpiy stated, appellant did not waive his objection to Officer Bechtel\u2019s testimony regarding his explanation for not submitting the bloody knife for fingerprint analysis, by re-raising that issue with Officer Bechtel on cross-examination. <em>See Peisner v. State, </em>236 Md. 137, 144, 202 A.2d 585 (1964) (\u201cThe general rule in Maryland is that one does not lose the benefit of objection to [alleged] inadmissible testimony by cross-examining on the subject.\u201d). Appellant did not lose the benefit of the objection to Officer Bechtel\u2019s testimony by the cross-examination of Officer Bechtel on the same issue in an attempt to weaken the impact of what appellant considered to be erroneously admitted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\n<em>Ragland v. State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Regarding the merits of the issue on appeal, appellant places great emphasis on <em>Ragland, </em>385 Md. 706, 870 A.2d 609, in support of his position that the trial court committed reversible error when it allowed Officer Bechtel, who was not qualified as an expert witness, to testify, in response to the question of why he did not submit the bloody knife for fingerprint analysis, that based on his training and experience, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>\u201cit\u2019s hard to get good prints off of blood.\u201d Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Ragland </em>is misplaced. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">In <em>Ragland, </em>appellant was convicted of distribution of a controlled dangerous substance. <em>See id. </em>at 709, 870 A.2d 609. On March 18, 2003, members of the Montgomery County Police Special Assignment Team observed Paul Herring, a person known to them from a prior arrest, make two short telephone calls from two different gas stations, and then drive to Northwest Drive. <em>See id. </em>At Northwest Drive, a hand-to-hand transaction occurred between Herring and a man wearing a hat, who was sitting in the passenger seat of a parked, yellow Cadillac. <em>See id. </em>at 709-10, 870 A.2d 609. No officer was able to see the face of the Cadillac\u2019s passenger or the items exchanged with Herring. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">After the parties left the scene of the exchange on Northwest Drive, Herring\u2019s van was stopped and a piece of suspected crack cocaine was found on Herring\u2019s person. <em>See id. </em>at 710, 870 A.2d 609. The Cadillac was also stopped and its three occupants were arrested. <em>See id. </em>Appellant was sitting in the front passenger seat; he was wearing a multi-colored beret. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">At trial, two police officers offered \u201clay opinion\u201d testimony, based on their training and experience, that the series of events involving appellant and Herring constituted a drug transaction. <em>See id. </em>at 709, 870 A.2d 609. Before the Court of Appeals, appellant argued that such evidence \u201cshould only have been admitted as expert testimony, subject to the accompanying qualification and discovery procedures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals agreed, and held that \u201cM[arylan]d Rules 5-701 [governing lay opinion testimony] and 5-702 [governing expert opinion testimony] prohibit the admission as \u2018lay opinion\u2019 of testimony based upon specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training or education.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725, 870 A.2d 609. Accordingly, the Court vacated appellant\u2019s conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. <em>See id. </em>at 709, 870 A.2d 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">In reaching its holding, the Court explained the difference between expert opinion testimony and lay opinion testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Expert opinion testimony is testimony that is based on specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education. Expert opinions need not be confined to matters actually perceived by the witness. Lay opinion testimony is testimony that is rationally based on the perception of the witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 717, 870 A.2d 609. Quoting the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the Court further distinguished lay opinion testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">\u201cThe prototypical example of the type of evidence contemplated by the adoption of Rule 701 relates to the appearance of persons or things, identity, the manner of conduct, competency of a person, degrees of light or darkness, sound, size, weight, distance, and an endless number of items that cannot be described factually in words apart from inferences____ Other examples of this type of quintessential Rule 701 testimony include identification of an individual, the speed of a vehicle, the mental state or responsibility of another, whether another was healthy, the value of one\u2019s property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 718, 870 A.2d 609 (quoting <em>Asplundh Mfg. Div. v. Benton Harbor Eng\u2019g, </em>57 F.3d 1190, 1196-98 (3rd Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Applying that rationale to the facts of <em>Ragland, </em>the Court determined that the State \u201csought and received opinions\u201d from the police officers \u201cthat were based on those witnesses\u2019 specialized knowledge, experience, and training.\u201d <em>Ragland, </em>385 Md. at 725, 870 A.2d 609. The Court explained that such testimony could not be described as lay opinion because: (1) the witnesses \u201chad devoted considerable time to the study of the drug trade;\u201d (2) \u201cthey offered their opinions that, among the numerous possible explanations for the events on Northwest Drive, the correct one was that a drug transaction had taken place;\u201d and (3) \u201c[t]he connection between the officers\u2019 training and experience on one hand, and their opinions on the other, was made explicit by the prosecutor\u2019s questioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 726, 870 A.2d 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Finally, the Court rejected the State\u2019s contention that any error in the admission of the officers\u2019 opinions was harmless. <em>See id. </em>The Court explained that Herring, the State\u2019s primary witness, was an impeached witness, who was also a participant in the alleged crime. <em>See id. </em>The remaining evidence was circumstantial, depending upon an inference that the piece of crack cocaine found on Herring when he was stopped had been obtained from appellant in the transaction observed by the police officers minutes before. <em>See id. </em>at 727, 870 A.2d 609. To prove that inference, \u201cthe State relied in large part on the police officers\u2019 opinion testimony that the events on Northwest Drive had constituted a drug transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court could not say beyond a reasonable doubt that the admission of the police officers\u2019 opinions was harmless. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The case <em>sub judice </em>is clearly distinguishable from <em>Ragland. </em>First, Officer Bechtel\u2019s testimony that, based on his training and experience, it is hard to get good prints off wet objects, was not opinion evidence, expert or lay, because the State did not offer his testimony for its truth. Rather, Officer Bechtel was asked by the State to explain his conduct as the investigating police officer, <em>i.e., </em>why he did not submit the bloody knife for fingerprint analysis. He responded by referring to his knowledge of \u201crecovering latent prints\u201d gained from his \u201cexperience and training in the Police Academy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Opinion evidence, by definition, is \u201ctestimony of a witness, given or offered in the trial of an action, that the witness is of the opinion that some fact pertinent to the case exists or does not exist, offered as proof of the existence or nonexistence of that fact.\u201d Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary 893 (3d ed.1969); <em>see also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 598 (8th ed.2004) (defining \u201copinion evidence\u201d as \u201c[a] witness\u2019s belief, thought, inference or conclusion concerning a fact or facts\u201d). In <em>Ragland, </em>the State introduced the officers\u2019 opinions that the events they observed constituted a drug transaction in order to prove that those events were <em>in fact </em>a drug transaction. By contrast, in the instant case, the State did not elicit Officer Bechtel\u2019s opinion to prove that it was <em>in fact </em>hard to get good fingerprints off of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>wet objects. Rather, the State sought his opinion for the sole purpose of explaining to the jury why Officer Bechtel, as the investigating officer, did not submit the bloody knife for fingerprint analysis. In short, the jury was not called upon to determine the truth or falsity of Officer Bechtel\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Second, Officer Bechtel\u2019s opinion regarding the quality of latent fingerprints from wet objects was not introduced to prove an essential element of the offenses for which appellant was charged. Officer Bechtel\u2019s opinion did not directly relate to any element of the crimes of assault, possession of a deadly weapon, or burglary, but rather was directed to the issue of the adequacy of the police investigation. The State had unimpeached, eyewitness testimony from Ringer, the victim and appellant\u2019s ex-girlfriend, that appellant was the person who broke into her home and assaulted her with a knife during the early morning hours of February 16, 2004. Officer Bechtel\u2019s explanation for his actions or omissions, as the investigating officer, was introduced simply to counter any defense argument to the jury of reasonable doubt arising out of an alleged inadequate police investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">In <em>Ragland, </em>on the other hand, the police officers observed a hand-to-hand transaction between appellant and Herring, but could not see any of the items that appellant had exchanged with Herring. Herring was stopped by police and a piece of crack cocaine was found on his person. To obtain a conviction, the State had to prove that Herring obtained the crack cocaine from appellant. That proof came from an inference based on the police officers\u2019 opinion testimony that the hand-to-hand transaction between appellant and Herring was a drug transaction. Thus, the opinion testimony of the police officers was necessary to prove an essential element of the charge against appellant in <em>Ragland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\n<em>Anticipatory Rehabilitation Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">We find further support for the trial court\u2019s decision to admit Officer Bechtel\u2019s opinion in the doctrine of anticipatory rehabilitation evidence. At trial, defense counsel sought to generate reasonable doubt by attacking the sufficiency of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>police investigation. Defense counsel challenged Officer Bechtel\u2019s performance of his duties as the investigating officer, which performance was based on his training, experience, and specialized knowledge as a police officer. In her opening statement to the jury, defense counsel claimed that the knife used in the assault was never fingerprinted; that appellant\u2019s house was never printed; that appellant\u2019s hands were never tested for blood; that the clothing worn by appellant was never taken into evidence; that appellant\u2019s house was never searched; that keys to Ringer\u2019s home were never taken from appellant; and that appellant\u2019s van was never searched. Defense counsel concluded that \u201c[tjhere\u2019s absolutely no evidence you\u2019re going to hear corroborate that he is the one that [sic] cut her hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Faced with this broad challenge to the police investigation, the State predictably sought to minimize its impact by asking Officer Bechtel, on direct examination, why he did not submit the knife for fingerprint analysis. In his answer, Officer Bechtel explained that it was hard to get good prints off of wet objects, based on his \u201cexperience and training in the Police Academy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Defense counsel continued her attack on the police investigation in her cross-examination of Officer Bechtel. She got Officer Bechtel to admit to everything that she told the jury in opening statement was not done in the investigation of the assault on Ringer. Officer Bechtel also admitted that, in essence, there was no investigation after Ringer identified appellant as her attacker. Finally, in her closing argument, defense counsel told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">This is a criminal case. They\u2019ve charged [appellant] with burglary, with assault. They\u2019ve charged [appellant] with breaking into a woman\u2019s house and cutting her hand, and <em>they do no investigation at all</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUf\">As citizens of Baltimore City, <em>you ought to be outraged that it wasn\u2019t dam.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Ordinarily, a party \u201c \u2018may not sustain the credibility of his own witness absent an attack upon credibility by the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>side.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Werner, 302 </em>Md. 550, 561, 489 A.2d 1119 (1985) (quoting <em>City of Baltimore v. Zell, </em>279 Md. 23, 27, 367 A.2d 14 (1977)). However, a witness whose credibility has been attacked may be rehabilitated by permitting the witness to deny or explain the impeaching facts. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-616(c)(1). \u201c[Rehabilitation must consist of repairs made at the point of the attack rather than fortification of areas that have not been disturbed.\u201d Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., Maryland Evidence Handbook \u00a7 1305 (3d ed.1999). \u201c \u2018Why?\u2019 \u2018How?\u2019 and \u2018please explain ...\u2019 are usually excellent redirect examination questions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Rehabilitation evidence, however, need not be confined to redirect examination. Anticipatory rehabilitation evidence may be introduced during the direct examination of a witness for the State \u201cif the opening statement of [the defendant\u2019s] trial counsel predicts that jurors will receive evidence that would\u2014when presented\u2014\u2018open the door\u2019 to the [rehabilitation evidence].\u201d <em>Hopkins v. State, </em>137 Md.App. 200, 208, 768 A.2d 89 (2001); <em>see also Clark v. State, </em>332 Md. 77, 84-85, 629 A.2d 1239 (1993) (explaining that \u201c \u2018opening the door\u2019 is simply a way of saying: \u2018My opponent has injected an issue into the case, and I ought to be able to introduce evidence on that issue\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In <em>Hopkins, </em>137 Md.App. 200, 768 A.2d 89, the defendant was convicted of second-degree assault on the twelve-year-old daughter of his former girlfriend. In the opening statement, defense counsel stated that a social worker would testify that the defendant\u2019s former girlfriend admitted to making up the charges against the defendant and lying to the police. <em>See id. </em>at 207-08, 768 A.2d 89. During the direct examination of the former girlfriend, the State introduced into evidence a prior consistent written statement that she had given to an investigating officer. <em>See id. </em>at 207, 768 A.2d 89. We concluded that because the opening statement of defense counsel predicted that the jurors would hear the social worker\u2019s testimony, which, when presented, would \u201copen the door\u201d to the introduction of the former girlfriend\u2019s prior consistent statement, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>trial judge had the discretion to admit that statement during the former girlfriend\u2019s direct examination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 208, 768 A.2d 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Similarly, in the instant case, the opening statement of defense counsel set forth in detail the alleged deficiencies in the police investigation of the charges against appellant, and predicted a lack of corroborating evidence due to that inadequate investigation. Consequently, the trial court had the discretion to permit the State to obtain, on direct examination, an explanation from Officer Bechtel for his conduct as the investigating police officer. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-611 (authorizing the trial judge to exercise discretion over the order in which and the methods by which evidence is presented). Without such explanation, appellant would have \u201can unwarranted advantage in impeaching a witness with an assurance that his credibility would remain impaired.\u201d <em>State v. Farmer, </em>97 Ariz. 348, 400 P.2d 580, 583 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">We hasten to note that our holding in this case does not permit the admission into evidence of a police officer\u2019s expert opinion <em>for its truth </em>any time a police investigation is challenged by a defendant, unless the proper qualification and notice requirements have been met. We do not intend to allow entering in the back door what <em>Ragland </em>forbids coming in the front door. A defendant can always request a limiting instruction so that the jury is advised that the officer\u2019s opinion is not offered for its truth, but only as an explanation for the officer\u2019s conduct of the police investigation. <em>See </em>Murphy, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1305(E) (explaining that \u201c[cjautionary, curative and limiting instructions are given during trial when there is a danger that jurors will be exposed to information they should not consider, and/or that the jurors might make improper use of the information they have been exposed to\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion by admitting the opinion of the investigat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ing police officer, who had not been qualified as an expert witness, to explain why the bloody knife used in the assault was not tested for fingerprints.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-12\">.

The State also argues that, even if Officer Bechtel's testimony was improperly admitted by the trial court, such error was harmless, because Ringer\u2019s identification of appellant as her assailant was sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction, and Officer Bechtel\u2019s testimony did not bolster the State\u2019s case or prejudice appellant. In light of our holding that there was no error or abuse of discretion in admitting Officer Bechtel's opinion, we need not address this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\">.
