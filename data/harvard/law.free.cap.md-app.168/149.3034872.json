After the dog alerted, the police searched the vehicle and recovered almost twelve pounds of cocaine. Claiming the canine scan was unlawful, Oscar E. Cruz, appellant, moved to suppress the drugs. The Circuit Court for Cecil County (Jackson, J.) denied his motion. Cruz subsequently tendered a plea of not guilty pursuant to an agreed statement of facts, and was convicted of importing a controlled dangerous substance into Maryland. The court (Lidums, J.) sentenced appellant to four years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">On appeal, Cruz presents one question, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">Did the [motion] court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence and statements seized, which motion was based upon appellant\u2019s claim that the evidence was the product of an unconstitutional search, where the dog <em>scanning </em>the appellant\u2019s vehicle did <em>not </em>have a right to invade any part of the <em>inte,\u00f1or </em>of appellant\u2019s vehicle prior to alerting his police-officer master to the presence of contraband?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">On the afternoon of February 15, 2005, Maryland State Police Sergeant Mike Lewis \u201cobserved a silver-colored 2005 Chevy Trailblazer traveling southbound on Interstate 95 directly behind a pickup truck in front of it.\u201d Lewis testified that his \u201cinitial thought was that it was likely being towed because it was so close\u201d to the vehicle in front of it. He also \u201cnoticed a Chevy Monte Carlo directly behind the Trailblazer also following it entirely too closely.\u201d Although Lewis \u201cattempt[ed] to stop both vehicles,\u201d he was only able to effect a stop of the Trailblazer, which occurred at about 12:47 p.m. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Appellant, the sole occupant of the vehicle, \u201cwas identified by a Massachusetts driver\u2019s license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The traffic stop was recorded by a video camera located in Officer Lewis\u2019s vehicle. The videotape was admitted into evidence, without objection, and was played in open court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Describing his initial encounter with appellant, Lewis stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">As he surrendered his driver\u2019s license to me, I noticed his hands were trembling very badly. I noticed he avoided all eye contact with me. I also asked for a registration card. He informed me that the vehicle was a rental. As he looked for a rental agreement for the vehicle, I noticed his chest was palpitating. I noticed the carotid pulse was pounding on the right side of his neck and I was standing at the passenger side open window of the SUV.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Upon review of the registration documents produced by appellant, Lewis noticed \u201cthat the vehicle had been rented at 6 a.m. that morning from Logan International Airport\u201d and that it \u201chad to be back to Logan ... the following morning.\u201d But, Lewis saw no luggage when he \u201cpeered\u201d through the glass. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">Observing no luggage in the vehicle coupled with the indicators I saw present in Mr. Cruz, that being the trembling hands, the evasive eye contact, the chest palpitating, the carotid pulse pounding in his neck, as I walked back to my car I peered through the side tinted glass in the vehicle. From the outside I saw one cardboard box on the rear cargo floor indicating a Dremel rotary power tool would be inside. I noticed the box to be taped at one end.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">Based on his observations, Sergeant Lewis returned to his vehicle and requested \u201ca certified drug detection K-9 han<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>dler.\u201d He also requested \u201ca driver\u2019s license check and wanted check\u201d on appellant. Trooper Joseph Catalano, a drug dog handler, promptly responded to the scene, along with Bruno, a yellow Labrador Retriever \u201ccertified in the detection of controlled dangerous substances.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lewis directed Trooper Catalano and Bruno to conduct \u201ca K-9 scan of the vehicle.\u201d Trooper First Class Mike Conner, who had also arrived at the scene, \u201chad Mr. Cruz step away from the vehicle so the K-9 scan could be safely conducted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Sergeant Lewis testified that he \u201cobserved Trooper Catalano scan the vehicle\u201d and also \u201cobserved the dog sit down, which indicates a passive alert for the presence of narcotics being inside the vehicle.\u201d Sergeant Lewis then saw \u201cTrooper Catalano open the right rear door of the Chevy Trailblazer and put Bruno inside the vehicle.\u201d According to Lewis, \u201cTrooper Catalano would only do this if the dog had alerted for the presence of narcotics outside of the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Sergeant Lewis described what happened next:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">I stepped from my car. I then approached the SUV. I opened the rear tailgate to remove the cardboard box, the only item I saw in the entire vehicle, and as I went to open the rear tailgate, the cardboard box actually fell out of the vehicle onto my feet on the roadside and hit my toes. I picked the box up. I quickly removed the tape from the one end. Inside the box was 5,370 grams of cocaine or 5.3 kilograms of cocaine inside the box.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Sergeant Lewis added that the U.S. customary weight of the cocaine was equal to 11.9 pounds. Appellant \u201cwas arrested on the spot,\u201d and was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">During Trooper Catalano\u2019s testimony, the videotape was played for the court a second time, as Catalano explained \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the court what [was] being depicted on the videotape.\u201d Notably, the videotape does not show whether Bruno put his head through the window of appellant\u2019s car. The following testimony is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">[THE COURT]: Did you just say that as you came up to the vehicle you gave the command to seek?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">[TROOPER CATALANO]: As I come up I was giving [Bruno] the command to seek. As <em>you can see he immediately goes to this one comer here and he stops, and that I would consider a behavior change because he stopped his forward motion. </em>He already knows what he needs to know when we walked up to the. car. What he does, he stops and corners in on the one corner of the tailgate or the hatch where it meets the bumper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">I believe here, [Y]our Honor, this\u2014you can see his tail wagging. That indicates\u2014he\u2019s still on all four legs in an upright position, and <em>he on his own jumps up into the window, open window, jumps up; puts his paws up on like the window sill. </em>Now, your Honor, you see his tail is now sweeping the ground area, which indicates to me that he\u2014I know he did sit, but because according to this he\u2019s not able to <em>see\u2014you can see his tail sweeping the ground which indicates that he\u2019s sitting.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">[THE COURT]: What was the significance of the sit? [TROOPER CATALANO]: A sit\u2014they are trained to give a final response of alerting to\u2014on a particular odor of drugs that he is trained on, and <em>a sit is his final response. That tells me that he has alerted to that vehicle.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: So as of\u2014according to the videotape, Trooper Catalano, that would be at 1256 approximately, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">[TROOPER CATALANO]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">Thereafter, Catalano \u201cput [Bruno] inside the vehicle to scan the general area.\u201d The videotape shows that Bruno entered through the right rear door of the vehicle at 12:56:48. At 12:56:53, another officer approached the vehicle and opened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the rear hatch. The box with the cocaine fell out of the hatch at 12:56:55, and Catalano removed Bruno from the vehicle at 12:56:56.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Now let me ask you something while we still have the tape in front of us. <em>Trooper Catalano, would you ever put Bruno into a vehicle without him having alerted to the outside of the vehicle?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">[TROOPER CATALANO]: <em>No, I would not </em>He would have to alert to the outside before I would ever put him on the inside of a vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Is it your testimony that on this particular stop he had alerted prior to your going to the door and opening it and letting him into the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">[TROOPER CATALANO]: That\u2019s correct. <em>I first observed the behavior change in the rear comer by his forward 'moving stop. </em>I then\u2014that\u2019s why I do pull him around, get him\u2014give him a second chance at it, which <em>he then </em>comes around, then shoots down to the side, goes into the\u2014 <em>automatically goes to the open window. </em>As a trained handler I observe. He is directed to go to the source. Stronger <em>odor\u2014he\u2019s catching a stronger odor in the open window </em>than he is in the rear axle door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Then thereafter he sat\u2014actually made\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM\">[TROOPER CATALANO]: After jumping up to the window he then went into the\u2014actually does a swipe, another indicator of behavior changes. Took his paw and goes to the source. That\u2019s his dominant possession of that vehicle, pawing it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">On cross-examination, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: So after jumping up through the window he gives you the indication that you believe is an alert?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-14\">[TROOPER CATALANO]: I know he did alert by sitting. That\u2019s his final response. <em>You have behavior\u2014several be</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>havior changes, and then he still might want to search, trying to get to the\u2014directly to that odor, </em>closest to the odor; then final response, him saying yes that is a hot car, he sits down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: My thinking at your earlier testimony\u2014correct me if I am wrong\u2014he did that after jumping to the\u2014through the window?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">[TROOPER CATALANO]: Which is\u2014always indicates a behavior change. <em>There is something in that window he wanted to get to. </em>Swerves around, then he falls\u2014goes into a sit. <em>Excuse me. Let me correct it. He didn\u2019t jump through the window. He just jumped up to get a better sniff.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: <em>He stuck his head in the window?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">[TROOPER CATALANO]: <em>Yes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: His paws were up on where, the open window?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-10\">[TROOPER CATALANO]: Yes, I believe so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">Cruz testified that he stepped out of the car when asked, that the door was closed behind him after he got out, and that no one sought his consent to search the vehicle. Appellant also said: \u201cThe policeman took the dog to the passenger side front. The dog turned around and came out.\u201d However, Cruz did not testify that he saw Bruno put his head through the window of his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">Appellant\u2019s counsel conceded that there was no dispute \u201cthat the dog sat down to alert.\u201d Nevertheless, urging the court to suppress the cocaine, appellant\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-14\">Your Honor, I believe that videotape and Officer Catalano\u2019s testimony indicates that this dog crossed the line of what was permissible, was more than a scan of the outside of the vehicle. The dog, his determination\u2014it is in the record\u2014jumped through the thing. He qualified that. Excuse me. He qualified that to indicate that he didn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>actually\u2014the dog didn\u2019t actually go in through there but actually the <em>dog\u2014his head was inside and paws were up on the open window. So I believe that\u2019s crossing the point of where the dog is invading the space of the defendant,, and the defendant has a reasonable right to privacy. </em>At this point he\u2019s exceeded it. <em>It wasn\u2019t simply an outside scan in which the dog alerted,. </em>The record is clear on what that is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">Respectfully, I think\u2014I believe that the evidence and the law require that the evidence be suppressed in light of having crossed that boundary, and I respectfully ask the evidence in the form of drugs seized be suppressed from evidence in this case, and any statements that subsequently came as a result of having been arrested from what I believe to be\u2014was an unconstitutional search be suppressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">In response, the prosecutor argued that \u201cthere was probable cause for the stop. The alert was done by the dog in response to a situation that the dog was well-trained for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A3X\">Denying the motion to suppress, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">Well starting at the beginning, I find that the probable cause for the stop\u2014I wrote down the times, although maybe I don\u2019t need to spend much time on that. Nobody is arguing the time. The defendant was stopped at 1247, the radio call for the dog handler went out at 1251; at 1251 the call was into the barracks for\u2014there was incidentally another traffic stop taking place at the same time. At 1254 there was still no response back from the barracks. 1254\u201456, that is, 56 seconds past\u20141254 Trooper Catalano and Bruno were there. At 1255.29\u2014well actually before Trooper Catalano got there\u2014at 1255.29 the defendant was out of the car. It is on 1256.18 the dog is to the car. On videotape he\u2019s out of sight momentarily, and at 1256.50 the door has been opened, the dog having alerted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">The time lapse is perfectly reasonable. It is without artificially prolonging the traffic stop. The dog went around the outside of the vehicle. <em>He started acting like he </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>was smelling something at the rear comer of the </em>door\u2014 excuse me. <em>The window apparently was down. The police didn\u2019t put the window down. The window was down. If a police officer is walking around a vehicle and a window is down I don\u2019t think it is unconstitutional for the police officer to smell whatever is coming through the window. That\u2019s exactly what the dog did. He didn\u2019t invade any private protected area. He\u2019s making an outside scan of the car, smelled something coming out the window. He got up on hind feet, put front feet on the end of the window momentarily, then he alerted.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">Looks like a classic K-9 scan to me. I think it provided probable cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Appellant contends that, because the drug dog\u2019s head poked through the open window of appellant\u2019s vehicle <em>before </em>alerting to the presence of drugs, the canine scan was \u201cconstitutionally \u00ab\u00ab.permissible\u201d under the Fourth Amendment. Cruz asserts: \u201cWhile previous case law makes it clear that it was lawful for the dog to be present on the scene to do a sniff of the <em>exterior </em>of the appellant\u2019s vehicle, the dog was not lawfully present when its head invaded the inside [of] the appellant\u2019s vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">The State offers several alternative bases to uphold the circuit court. First, the State argues that Bruno\u2019s \u201csniff\u2019 was \u201ca permissible non-search under Supreme Court and Maryland precedent\u201d because \u201cthe suppression court found that the dog\u2019s nose did not enter the interior of the vehicle.\u201d It asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">The testimony at the suppression hearing did not clearly address whether the dog\u2019s head actually entered the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-12\">It is noteworthy that at the suppression hearing Cruz\u2019s counsel did not ask, and Trooper Catalano did not explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>say, whether the dog\u2019s head was actually \u201cinside\u201d the vehicle or whether his head went \u201cthrough\u201d the .window.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Second, the State argues that, \u201c[e]ven if the dog\u2019s nose briefly entered the interior of the vehicle,\u201d it did so \u201cwithout prompting from the officer,\u201d and so the entry \u201cshould be treated as the functional equivalent of an exterior canine scan of the vehicle\u2014i.e., as a non-search.\u201d Third, the State contends: \u201cEven if the canine scan constituted a search, there was probable cause for the search because of the dog\u2019s behavior changes before his nose might have entered the open window\u2014stopping at the rear corner of the vehicle and jumping up on the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to a suppression motion, we look solely to the record of the suppression hearing. <em>Myers v. State, </em>165 Md.App. 502, 518, 885 A.2d 920 (2005); <em>see Dashiell v. State, </em>374 Md. 85, 93, 821 A.2d 372 (2003); <em>State v. Collins, </em>367 Md. 700, 706-07, 790 A.2d 660 (2002); <em>Cartnail v. State, </em>359 Md. 272, 282, 753 A.2d 519 (2000). Moreover, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Stokes v. State, </em>362 Md. 407, 414, 765 A.2d 612 (2001); <em>Myers, </em>165 Md.App. at 518, 885 A.2d 920; <em>Charity v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 598, 605-06, 753 A.2d 556, <em>cert. denied, </em>360 Md. 487, 759 A.2d 231 (2000). In this endeavor, \u201c[w]e accept the suppression court\u2019s first-level factual findings unless clearly erroneous, and give due regard to the court\u2019s opportunity to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Faulkner v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 615, 640, 847 A.2d 1216, <em>cert. denied, </em>382 Md. 685, 856 A.2d 721 (2004); <em>State v. Fernon, </em>133 Md.App. 41, 44, 754 A.2d 463 (2000). However, \u201c[w]hen the question is whether a constitutional right ... has been violated, the reviewing court makes its own independent constitutional appraisal, by reviewing the law and applying it to the peculiar facts of the particular case.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>343 Md. 448, 457, 682 A.2d 248 (1996); <em>see also Dashiell, </em>374 Md. at 93-94, 821 A.2d 372; <em>Stokes, </em>362 Md. at 414, 765 A.2d 612; <em>Myers, </em>165 Md.App. at 518, 885 A.2d 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Here, according to Officer Catalano, Bruno\u2019s behavior changed at the corner of the vehicle. Then, of Bruno\u2019s own accord, and without any command from Catalano, the dog jumped up on the car \u201cto get a better sniff,\u201d and \u201cstuck his head in the window.\u201d The motion court found that Bruno\u2019s behavior changed at the rear corner of the vehicle, before he jumped up, but the court did not find that the dog\u2019s conduct at the corner of the vehicle amounted to an alert. Instead, the court found that Bruno alerted only after he \u201csmelled something coming out the window.\u201d Although the motion court did not expressly resolve whether Bruno\u2019s nose or head actually entered the interior of the vehicle before he alerted, the court was satisfied that Bruno \u201cdidn\u2019t invade any private protected area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Therefore, in analyzing this case, we shall assume that Bruno jumped upon the vehicle before he alerted, put his head through the open window, and then alerted. In turn, we must decide whether the dog\u2019s conduct exceeded the scope of a lawful canine scan. We hold that the canine scan was lawful, and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The Supreme Court has addressed the issue of canine scans in <em>United States v. Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 707, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983); <em>United States v. Jacobsen, </em>466 U.S. 109, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 80 L.Ed.2d 85 (1984); <em>City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, </em>531 U.S. 32, 121 S.Ct. 447, 148 L.Ed.2d 333 (2000); and <em>Illinois v. Caballes, </em>543 U.S. 405, 125 S.Ct. 834, 160 L.Ed.2d 842 (2005). We pause to review these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">In <em>Place, </em>462 U.S. at 707, 103 S.Ct. 2637, the Court concluded that the canine sniff of luggage at an airport was not a search because it \u201cdiscloses only the presence or absence of narcotics, a contraband item,\u201d without requiring the opening of the suitcase. The Court characterized the canine sniff as \u201climited both in the manner in which the information is obtained and in the content of the information revealed by the procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, it pointed out that, \u201cdespite the fact that the sniff tells the authorities something about the contents of the luggage, the ... limited disclosure ... ensures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>that the owner of the property is not subjected to the embarrassment and inconvenience entailed in less discriminate and more intrusive investigative methods.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In <em>Jacobsen, </em>the Court concluded, 466 U.S. at 122-24, 104 S.Ct. 1652, that a field test of white powder seized by government agents was not a search. Relying on <em>Place, </em>the Court analogized the field test to a dog sniff, which reveals only the presence or absence of contraband. In its view, the field test likewise did not infringe upon a legitimate expectation of privacy. <em>Id. </em>at 122, 104 S.Ct. 1652.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In <em>City of Indianapolis, </em>531 U.S. at 40, 121 S.Ct. 447, the Court found unconstitutional a highway checkpoint program designed to discover and interdict illegal narcotics, but noted that the program\u2019s use of dogs to sniff the outside of automobiles was constitutional. Relying on <em>Place, </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGi\">Just as in <em>Place, </em>an exterior sniff of an automobile does not require entry into the car and is not designed to disclose any information other than the presence or absence of narcotics. Like the dog sniff in <em>Place, </em>a sniff by a dog that simply walks around a car is \u201cmuch less intrusive than a typical search.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 40,121 S.Ct. 447 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">More recently, in <em>Caballes, </em>543 U.S. at 409, 125 S.Ct. 834, the Supreme Court determined that a drug dog\u2019s sniff of the exterior of an automobile that had been lawfully stopped for speeding did not \u201cimplicate legitimate privacy interests.\u201d Because the sniff revealed only the \u201clocation of a substance that no individual has a right to possess,\u201d the Court concluded that the scan did not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 410, 125 S.Ct. 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Numerous Maryland cases have recognized that a positive alert by a drug dog during an exterior scan of a vehicle gives rise to probable cause to search that vehicle. In <em>Wilkes v. State, </em>364 Md. 554, 774 A.2d 420 (2001), for example, the Court said: \u201cWe have noted that once a drug dog has alerted a trooper \u2018to the presence of illegal drugs in a vehicle, sufficient probable cause exist[s] to support a warrantless search of [a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>vehicle].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 586, 774 A.2d 420 (quoting <em>Gadson v.

State, </em>384 Md. 484, 864 A.2d 1006 (2004), is instructive. There, the Court of Appeals determined that a dog sniff conducted in the common area of an apartment hallway, and at the exterior of an apartment door, did not amount to a \u201csearch\u201d under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 494-95, 864 A.2d 1006. Based on its review of Supreme Court decisions, the Court observed: \u201cThe only relevant locational determination is whether the dog was permitted outside the object sniffed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 864 A.2d 1006. The <em>Fitzgerald </em>Court added that \u201cthe location or circumstance of the sniff was relevant only to determine whether the dog and officer\u2019s presence there was constitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court explained, <em>id. </em>at 493-94, 864 A.2d 1006: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>Place </em>and <em>Jacobsen </em>together establish that government tests, such as <em>a canine sniff, </em>that can reveal only the presence or absence of narcotics and are <em>conducted from a location where the government officials are authorized to be, ie. a public place, are not searches.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">A review of <em>Place </em>and <em>Jacobsen </em>indicates that a crucial component of the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings is the focus on the scope and nature of the sniff or test, rather than on the object sniffed, in determining whether a legitimate privacy interest exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">While recognizing that \u201cthe dog and police must lawfully be present at the site of the sniff,\u201d the Court concluded that \u201cbinding and persuasive authority compel our holding that a dog sniff of the exterior of the residence is not a search under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 503, 864 A.2d 1006. Notably, in reaching its decision, the Court pointed out that the canine and his police handler \u201clawfully were present, as the apartment building\u2019s common area and hallways were <em>accessible to the public through an entrance of unlocked glass doors.\u201d Id. </em>at 504, 864 A.2d 1006 (emphasis added; citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Nevertheless, appellant seizes on <em>dicta </em>in <em>Fitzgerald </em>to support his contention that Bruno\u2019s scan was illegal. He notes that in <em>Fitzgerald </em>the Court underscored that the dog \u201coccupied the same position as the government agent; he observed from the public space outside the residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498, 864 A.2d 1006. But, as Cruz points out, the Court went on to say that, <em>\u201c[w]ere [the dog] to have entered the residence himself without a warrant, he would have conducted an unconstitutional search.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">We are not persuaded by appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>dicta </em>in <em>Fitzgerald. </em>The cases cited above lead us to conclude that, under the circumstances attendant here, Bruno\u2019s brief and instinctive intrusion into the open window of the vehicle did not transform the scan into an illegal interior search. As in <em>Fitzgerald, </em>Bruno and Trooper Catalano \u201clawfully were present at the site of the sniff,\u201d 384 Md. at 503, 864 A.2d 1006; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>officer and the dog had a right to stand outside the vehicle, which had been lawfully stopped for a traffic offense. And, of significance here, it is undisputed that the window of the vehicle was already open when Bruno jumped onto the sill, and Catalano never instructed Bruno to jump. Rather, as Catalano testified, Bruno \u201con his own ... put his paws up on ... the window sill.\u201d Moreover, the videotape demonstrates that Bruno briefly \u201cstood\u201d on his back legs, with his paws upon the door, and then immediately went into a full-alert \u201csit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In essence, while in a public place, Bruno responded to the smell he detected, which was emanating from the open car window. Accordingly, the motion court was not clearly erroneous in finding that Bruno simply \u201csmelled something coming out of the window\u201d after his scan of the car\u2019s exterior, \u201cgot up on [his] hind feet, put front feet on the end of the window momentarily,\u201d and then alerted.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Courts in other jurisdictions have considered whether the Fourth Amendment is violated by a dog\u2019s entry into the interior of a vehicle during a canine scan. In general, these cases support our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">In <em>United States v. Stone, </em>866 F.2d 359 (10th Cir.1989), the dog was commanded to sniff the car and \u201cbecame interested underneath the car at the passenger side where the door was open.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362. The defendant challenged the legality of the canine search because the dog jumped into the open hatchback and \u201ckeyed\u201d on illegal \u201csubstances he was trained to detect....\u201d The dog \u201capparently did not positively \u2018key' on the methaqualone until he was inside the car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363. So, \u201cwhen the dog jumped into the hatchback of Stone\u2019s car the police had only reasonable suspicion to believe it contained narcotics. Only after the dog was in the trunk, where it \u2018keyed\u2019 on the methaqualone, did the police have probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The Tenth Circuit acknowledged that, \u201c[e]ven though the police could use a trained dog to sniff the exterior of Stone\u2019s automobile, the dog created a troubling issue under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Fourth Amendment when it entered the hatchback.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363. Nevertheless, the Court upheld the denial of the suppression motion, agreeing with the trial judge \u201cthat the dog\u2019s instinctive actions did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this regard, the appellate court pointed out that \u201c[t]here is no evidence, nor does [defendant] contend, that the police asked [defendant] to open the hatchback so the dog could jump in. Nor is there any evidence the police handler encouraged the dog to jump in the car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the court concluded that \u201cthe police remained within the range of activities they may permissibly engage in when they have reasonable suspicion to believe the automobile contains narcotics.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\"><em>United States v. Watson, </em>783 F.Supp. 258 (E.D.Va.1992), is also illuminating. In that case, the federal court addressed the question of \u201cwhether by jumping in the open passenger door, the dog caused what is supposed to be a very limited encounter to escalate into a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265. Relying on <em>Stone, </em>the court stated, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai\">[T]he court finds that the dog\u2019s actions were within the bounds of a proper canine sniff. In <em>Stone, </em>the dog jumped through a car\u2019s open hatchback and proceeded to do a canine sniff of the car. The court held that the dog\u2019s \u201cinstinctive actions\u201d did not violate the Fourth Amendment because the police did not ask the Defendant to open the hatchback so the dog could jump in, nor did the police handler encourage the dog to jump in. <em>Id. </em>at 364. As in <em>Stone, </em>this court was presented with no evidence that the dog was encouraged to jump in the car by its handler. Consequently, the court follows <em>Stone </em>and declares that the canine sniff of the passenger compartment was proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae\"><em>State v. Logan, </em>914 S.W.2d 806 (Mo.App.1995), is also relevant. There, a trained drug dog, while scanning a vehicle, \u201csuddenly jumped into the car through an open rear window\u201d and then \u201c \u2018alerted\u2019 on the trunk of the car as trained to indicate the presence of drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 807. The appellant complained that, \u201cunlike the search under scrutiny in <em>Place, </em>the search ... did not take place in a public area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 810. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>The court acknowledged that the dog \u201centered the interior\u201d of appellant\u2019s car, the window of which \u201chad apparently been left open by the defendant and his wife.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But, it noted that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that the dog had been \u201cprompted by his handlers to enter the car.\u201d Relying on <em>Stone, </em>the court found that the entrance of the dog into the car was not \u201cequivalent for fourth amendment purposes to an entrance into the car by a police officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 810. Therefore, it concluded that \u201cthe trial court did not err in admitting the evidence obtained as a result of [the dog\u2019s] investigative sniffing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">In <em>United States v. Morales-Zamora, </em>914 F.2d 200 (10th Cir.1990), the Tenth Circuit reversed a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to suppress. In that case, the appellate court considered \u201cwhether the police must have a reasonable suspicion of drug-related activity before employing a narcotics-detection dog to sniff a vehicle already detained by the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203. The court held \u201cthat the dog sniff, under these circumstances, is not a \u2018search\u2019 within the meaning of the fourth amendment and therefore an individualized suspicion of drug-related criminal activity is not required when the dog sniff is employed during a lawful seizure of the vehicle.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Of import here, the Tenth Circuit rejected the argument that the defendants had \u201ca legitimate expectation of privacy in the odor of narcotics detected by the dog because this odor emanated from inside their vehicles, a private area protected by the fourth amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205. The court stated that, \u201cwhen the odor of narcotics escapes from the interior of a vehicle, society does not recognize a reasonable privacy interest in the public airspace containing the incriminating odor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\"><em>United States v. Perez, </em>37 F.3d 510 (9th Cir.1994), is also pertinent. There, the Ninth Circuit considered \u201c[w]hether a search went beyond the scope of a suspect\u2019s consent\u201d when the dog, while outside of the vehicle, \u201calerted to the spot on its undercarriage where the drugs were found.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515-16. The defendant claimed that \u201c \u2018[n]o reasonable person ... could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>have foreseen that his consent [to search] opened the door to a trained K-9 unit\u2019s examination of their entire automobile.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515. Rejecting that claim, the court determined \u201cthat the search was not more intrusive than Perez had envisioned when giving his consent, but rather simply more effective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515-16. According to the appeals court, \u201cThe undercarriage of a van, where the drugs were found, is not a uniquely private space.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516 (citations omitted). Further, it stated: \u201cUsing a narcotics dog to carry out a consensual search of an automobile is perhaps the least intrusive means of searching because it involves no unnecessary opening or forcing of closed containers or sealed areas of the car unless the dog alerts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The State also refers us to <em>Commonwealth v. Rogers, </em>741 A.2d 813, 820 (Pa.Super.Ct.1999) <em>aff'd, </em>578 Pa. 127, 849 A.2d 1185 (2004), in which the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, relying on <em>Stone, </em>noted that \u201cthe window was open, the dog was not prompted to enter the vehicle and once he did the search was immediately terminated.\u201d The court stated that it did \u201cnot believe such a limited intrusion into the vehicle under these particular facts was violative\u201d of either Pennsylvania law or the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">We recognize that other courts have held that a dog\u2019s entry into the interior of a vehicle during a canine scan constituted an unreasonable search. But, those courts have based their decisions on evidence that the handler facilitated or encouraged the dog\u2019s entries into the vehicles. <em>See State v. Warsaw, </em>125 N.M. 8, 956 P.2d 139, 143 (Ct.App.1997) (distinguishing <em>Stone </em>and <em>Watson, </em>noting that \u201cOfficer Williams reached into the trunk to remove the glass-laden carpet because he expected the dog to jump in there. [The dog], under the preparation, guidance, and stimulation of Officer Williams, jumped into the open trunk\u201d); <em>United States v. Winningham, </em>140 F.3d 1328, 1331 (10th Cir.1998) (\u201cA desire to <em>facilitate </em>a dog sniff of the van\u2019s interior, absent in <em>Stone, </em>seems readily apparent here\u201d); <em>State v. Freel, </em>29 Kan.App.2d 852, 32 P.3d 1219, 1225 (2001) (finding that the officer \u201cencouraged the dog to enter into the car when it had not alerted on the exterior\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>In this case, there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that the police encouraged Bruno to jump up on the car and stick his nose through the window of Cruz\u2019s vehicle. To the contrary, the record reflects that the dog acted instinctively, because he detected from the open window the odor he was trained to identify. Indeed, Catalano testified that the dog \u201con his own jump[ed] into the window----\u201d Moreover, Mr. Cruz had no \u201creasonable privacy interest\u201d in the odor of cocaine emanating from the car, which Bruno detected from \u201cthe public airspace.\u201d <em>Morales-Zamora, </em>914 F.2d at 205.
