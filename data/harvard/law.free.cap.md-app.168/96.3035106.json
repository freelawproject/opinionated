The amendments removed language terminating the interest of Virginia Denton Eller (\u201cWife\u201d) in a portion of Husband\u2019s pension benefits upon her death. In addition, the amended QDRO designated Wife as \u201cthe alternate payee through Wilbur S. Bolton, III, Personal Representative of the Estate of [Wife].\u201d Husband presents one question for our review, which we have divided and recast as the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">I. Did the circuit court have the authority to amend a QDRO in order to secure Wife\u2019s marital property award in accordance with a Consent Order that was incorporated, but not merged, into the judgment of divorce?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">II. Is the QDRO, as amended, invalid under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(D)(3)(K) because it provides for payment to an individual not included within the definition of an \u201calternate payee?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">We answer the first question in the affirmative, but because the domestic relations order, as amended, may not be qualifiable, we shall vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Husband and Wife were married on December 11, 1961. They separated on May 11, 1997, and on July 20, 1998, Husband filed a complaint for absolute divorce in the Circuit Court for Harford County. In her counter-complaint for absolute divorce, Wife sought, among other things, alimony, child support, and a monetary award pursuant to Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-205-208 of the Family Law Article (\u201cF.L.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">On June 27, 2000, the circuit court approved a consent order executed by Husband and Wife (the \u201cConsent Order\u201d). In consideration of Wife\u2019s waiver of any right to a monetary award, alimony, and attorneys\u2019 fees, Husband assigned to Wife, among other things, one-half of his interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Robert Preston Excavating Co., Inc., Profit Sharing Plan and Trust (the \u201cPlan\u201d). The Plan is identified as a defined contribution plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Husband and Wife covenanted, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">L. The Plan Administrator for [Husband\u2019s] interest in the [Plan], shall distribute directly to [Wife], <em>by way of a rollover to her designated plan, </em>50% of the total value in the Plan, not to exceed 1/2 of $50,000 as indicated on Statement of Account for Plan dated 12/31/99, copy attached as Ex. 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">M. [Husband] assigns to [Wife] one-third (1/3) of the preretirement death benefits, not to exceed 1/3 of $126,000.00 as indicated on Ex. 1, but a lesser amount if value of said pre-retirement death benefit has decreased at the time of [Husband\u2019s] death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">N. [Husband] assigns to [Wife] one-third (1/3) of the proceeds from life insurance benefits incident to the Plan, not to exceed 1/3 of $76,000.00 as indicated on Ex. 1, but a lesser amount if value of said insurance death benefit has decreased at the time of plaintiffs death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">O. [Husband] shall not do nor suffer to be done any act, except as herein set forth, to decrease the value of his said pre-retirement death benefit or the value of the life insurance proceeds either by way of requesting disbursement thereof, by assignment, or by loan against such benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>P. [Wife\u2019s] attorney shall draft the Qualified Domestic Relations Orders necessary to distribute the pension plan benefits <em>as herein </em>indicated^.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">On March 9, 2001, the circuit court granted Husband an absolute divorce. The court incorporated, but did not merge, the Consent Order in its judgment of divorce. Furthermore, in granting the divorce, the court ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">[T]his Court shall retain jurisdiction over the matter of the pension for purposes of securing a Qualified Domestic Relations Order to protect said [Wife\u2019s] monetary award, and to retain jurisdiction to amend[ ] this Judgment and/or the aforesaid Qualified Domestic Relations Order for the purpose of maintaining its qualifications as a qualified domestic relations order under the Retirement Equity Act of 1984, or any other subsequent legislation; and both parties and the manager of [Husband\u2019s] retirement plan shall take whatever actions may be necessary to establish or maintain these qualifications, provided that no such amendment shall require the retirement plan to provide any type or form of benefits, or any option not otherwise provided under the [P]lan, and further provided that no such amendment or the right of the Court to so amend will invalidate the order as \u201cQualified\u201d under the Retirement Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">On March 13, 2001, the circuit court signed a domestic relations order (\u201cDRO\u201d), which was \u201cconsent[ed][to] as to form\u201d by counsel for both Husband and Wife. The DRO included the name and address of Husband, the plan participant, and the name and address of Wife, the alternate payee. Additionally, the DRO provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">(3) The Plan Administrator for [Husband\u2019s] interest in the [Plan], shall distribute, directly to [Wife], by way of a rollover to her designated plan, Fifty Percent (50%) of the total value in the Plan, not to exceed one-half <em>Qk) </em>of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) as indicated on Statement of Account for Plan dated December 31, 1999, copy attached as Exhibit No. 1, when, if, and as paid to [Husband.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>* * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">(6) The [Plan], from which benefits are assigned herein-above, including both Company Accounts and Voluntary Accounts of the Participant under the Profit Sharing Plan &amp; Trust, will pay benefits to [Wife] in accordance with the provisions of Annotated Code of Maryland, Family Law Article Section 8-205 (Cumm. Supp. 1990) and based on the following formula. [Wife] is hereby assigned Fifty Percent (50%) of the total value of [Husband\u2019s] profit sharing plan &amp; trust account (not to exceed <em>\u00bd </em>of $50,000.00), which he has earned through his employment with Robert Preston Excavating Co., Inc., said Fifty Percent (50%) interest to be calculated as of December 31, 1999. [Husband] assigns to [Wife], 50% of assets of account as of December 31, 1999 (not to exceed $50,000.00, in value), plus all accretions and losses attributable to [Wife\u2019s] 50%, rolled over into a separate account for [Wife]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">(7) [Wife] shall commence her portion of the benefit plan when eligible in accordance with the Plan. Payments will continue until [Wife\u2019s] death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">(8) [Husband], [Wife], and the [c]ourt, intend this Order to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\">(9) This Order is issued pursuant to the Family Law Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland which relates to the provisions of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights as defined therein between spouses and former spouses in actions for divorce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-11\">(18) The parties agree that their mutual intent is to provide the Alternate Payee [Wife] with a retirement payment that fairly represents a marital share of the retirement before as defined herein. If this Order submitted to the Administrator of the Plan is held not to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order within the meaning of IRC Section 414(p), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>the parties permit this Court to retain jurisdiction over this matter and they further agree to request this [cjourt to modify the Order so as to make it a Qualified Domestic Relations Order that reflects the parties\u2019 intent, said modification order to be entered <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>if appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Although the Plan administrator initially accepted, and presumably \u201cqualified,\u201d the proposed DRO (the \u201coriginal QDRO\u201d), several problems soon became apparent. The original QDRO was unclear whether Wife\u2019s benefits were to be distributed through a single lump sum payment. The Plan administrator also determined that the pre-retirement death benefit figure of $126,000 in the Consent Order was inaccurate. According to the Plan administrator, Husband\u2019s interest should have been stated as $76,000. Finally, the Plan noted that, as the original QDRO was drafted, the Plan could not pay Wife the death benefit because the provision of the Consent Order granting Wife such an interest was not included.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">It appears that, in response, Husband and Wife agreed to amend the original QDRO to address the Plan administrator\u2019s concerns, and that a revised DRO was drafted (the \u201cRevised DRO\u201d), but was never approved by the circuit court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is unclear from the record whether it was actually submitted to the circuit court, but, according to the Plan\u2019s complaint in the subsequent interpleader action, the Revised DRO was submitted to the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">On September 18, 2001, before Husband became eligible for benefits under the Plan and before Wife had returned required distribution request forms to the Plan, Wife died. When Husband subsequently became eligible for benefits, Husband and Wife\u2019s estate (\u201cthe Estate\u201d) filed competing claims. Uncertain as to which party or parties it should pay and whether it should honor the original QDRO or the Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>vised DRO, the Plan filed an interpleader action in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Civil Action number WMN-02-0077, naming Husband and the Estate as defendants. After the District Court realigned the parties, Husband, as plaintiff, filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that Wife was not entitled to benefits under the original QDRO, the only order approved by the circuit court, because payments to Wife were to cease upon Wife\u2019s death. The Estate moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the defects in the original QDRO rendered it a \u201cnullity.\u201d In the alternative, the Estate requested that the District Court amend the terms of the original QDRO to reflect the terms of the Consent Order, which \u201cmanifested] the \u2018clear intent of the parties.\u2019 \u201d In the event the court declined to do so, the Estate requested that the District Court stay or dismiss the action so that \u201cthe parties [could] \u2018fight it out in state court.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Finding that it had \u201c \u2018jurisdiction over an action for inter-pleader to determine the proper beneficiary of benefits payable from an ERISA employee welfare plan,\u2019 \u201d the District Court denied the Estate\u2019s motion to dismiss and declined to grant a stay, (quoting <em>Central States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. Howell, </em>227 F.3d 672, 674 n. 2 (6th Cir.2000)). Considering the merits of the Estate\u2019s motion, the District Court concluded that it could neither \u201csimply ignore\u201d the stated language of the original QDRO, which was \u201cthe only QDRO that ha[d] been brought to th[e] Court\u2019s attention,\u201d nor amend it to reflect the Consent Order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the Court found that the original QDRO stated \u201cunequivocally\u201d that benefits under the Plan \u201cshall only be distributed to [Wife] Vhen, if, and as paid\u2019 to [Husband], and that the rights to payment terminate upon [Wife\u2019s] death,\u201d the court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the Estate was not entitled to benefits under the Plan. Accordingly, the Court granted Husband\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Following the District Court proceeding, the Estate, on August 4, 2003, filed a motion to amend the original QDRO in the Circuit Court for Harford County.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Husband opposed the Estate\u2019s motion on multiple fronts, arguing: that the Estate did not have standing; that the court lacked jurisdiction; that the parties were improperly substituted; and that the motion was barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>On February 10, 2004, in a memorandum opinion, the circuit court granted the Estate\u2019s motion to amend the QDRO. In so doing, the court agreed to approve \u201can amended [D]RO with terms consistent with the original Judgment of Divorce and the Agreement of the parties regarding the division of [Husband\u2019s] retirement plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The court approved the amended DRO on March 15, 2004 (the \u201cAmended DRO\u201d). The Amended DRO named Wife \u201cthe alternate payee through Wilbur W. Bolton, III, Personal Representative of the Estate of [Wife].\u201d The provisions in the original QDRO that distributions to Wife were to occur \u201cwhen, if, and as paid to [Husband]\u201d and that payments were to \u201ccontinue until [Wife\u2019s] death\u201d were removed. Moreover, the Amended DRO ordered the Plan to pay the Estate one-half of the value of Husband\u2019s interest in the Plan, not to exceed $50,000, with payment to take place \u201cas soon as administratively feasible on or after the acceptance of th[e] order by the Plan, and completion of any required forms by the Alternate Payee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">On March 26, 2004, Husband filed a motion to alter or amend, claiming that the circuit court made several erroneous findings of fact and conclusions of law. According to Husband, the circuit court erred in finding that the Estate\u2019s motion was not barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>allowing an improper substitution of parties, and in finding that the court had jurisdiction to amend the QDRO. On May 18, 2004, the court denied Husband\u2019s motion. This timely appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In an action tried without a jury, we review the case on \u201cboth the law and w.e evidence.\u201d Maryland Rule 8-181(c). We will not disturb the judgment of the circuit court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, giving deference to the court\u2019s opportunity to assess the credibility of the witnesses. Rule 8\u2014131(c). <em>See McCleary v. McCleary, </em>150 Md.App. 448, 457-58, 822 A.2d 460 (2002); <em>Noffsinger v. Noffsinger, </em>95 Md.App. 265, 283, 620 A.2d 415 (1993) (citing <em>Eckstein v. Eckstein, </em>38 Md.App. 506, 516, 379 A.2d 757 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Husband asserts that the circuit court erred or abused its discretion in amending the original QDRO to provide Wife, through the Estate, a survivorship interest in the Plan. According to Husband, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to do so because the original QDRO had been qualified by the Plan. He also contends that the Estate\u2019s claim to benefits is barred by the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">In considering Husband\u2019s assignments of error, a brief overview of the relevant federal statutes is helpful. Congress enacted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (P.L. 93\u2014406, 88 Stat. 829) (\u201cERISA\u201d) \u201cto provide better protection for beneficiaries of employee pension and welfare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>benefit plans abounding in the private workplace.\u201d <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 30, 566 A.2d 767 (1989) (discussing the history and intent of ERISA). Included in ERISA is a \u201cspendthrift\u201d provision, restricting a plan participant\u2019s ability to assign his or her benefits under a pension plan covered by the act. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1). ERISA expressly preempts state law and made the regulation of pension plans a matter of exclusive federal interest. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a); <em>Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 31, 566 A.2d 767 (citing <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, </em>481 U.S. 41, 46, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Subsequent to the enactment of ERISA, Congress and various courts questioned the validity and efficacy of state law domestic relations orders that awarded a non-participant spouse an interest in a participant spouse\u2019s pension benefits under an ERISA covered plan. In response, Congress passed the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-397, 98 Stat. 1433) (\u201cREA\u201d), which exempted from the spendthrift and preemption provisions \u201cqualified domestic relations orders\u201d or \u201cQDROs.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(A). With respect to qualified domestic relations orders, the REA provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">(B) for purposes of this paragraph-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">(i) the term \u201cqualified domestic relations order\u201d means a domestic relations order\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">(I) which creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee\u2019s right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">(II) with respect to which the requirements of subparagraphs (C) and (D) are met, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">(ii) the term \u2018domestic relations order\u2019 means any judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement) which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">(I) relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>(II) is made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">(C) A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order clearly specifies\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">(i) the name and last known mailing address (if any) of the participant and the name and mailing address of each alternate payee covered by the order,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">(ii) the amount and percentage of the participant\u2019s benefits to be paid by the plan to each such alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or percentage is to be determined,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">(iii) the number of payments or period to which such order applies, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">(iv) each plan to which such order applies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">(D) A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-11\">(i) does not require a plan to provide any type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the plan,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-12\">(ii) does not require the plan to provide increased benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial value), and does not require the payment of benefits to an alternate payee which are required to be paid to another alternate payee under another order previously determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-13\">(E) (i) A domestic relations order shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) of subparagraph (D) solely because such order requires that payment of benefits be made to an alternate payee\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-14\">(I) in the case of any payment before a participant has separated from service, on or after the date on which the participant attains (or would have attained) the earliest retirement age,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-15\">(II) as if the participant had retired on the date on which such payment is to begin under such order (but taking into account only the present value of benefits actual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>ly accrued and not taking into account the present value of any employer subsidy for early retirement), and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">(III) in any form in which such benefits may be paid under the plan to the participant (other than in the form of a joint and survivor annuity with respect to the alternate payee and his or her subsequent spouse).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)-(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Under the REA, an alternate payee is \u201cany spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant who is recognized by a domestic relations order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under the plan with respect to such participant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(E). An alternate payee, under a qualified domestic relations order, is treated as a plan beneficiary. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(J).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">As noted above, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(D) prohibits the qualification of domestic relations orders that grant \u201cany type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the plan,\u201d or orders that result in a plan having to pay increased benefits. Therefore, QDROs can be drafted to provide for differing payment types depending upon the type of plan involved. One type of payment available is a \u201cshared payment,\u201d whereby the QDRO \u201cseeks to divide only actual payments made with respect to the participant under the plan.\u201d Pamela D.

In its memorandum opinion, the circuit court reasoned that it had jurisdiction to amend the original QDRO because the Consent Order and original QDRO were incorporated, but not merged, into the judgment of divorce. Additionally, the circuit court noted that, in the order of divorce, \u201cfor the purpose of maintaining its qualifications as a qualified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>domestic relations order under the Retirement Equity Act of 1984, or any other or subsequent legislation,\u201d it had retained jurisdiction \u201cover the matter of the pension for purposes of securing a Qualified Domestic Relations Order to protect said Virginia Denton Eller\u2019s monetary award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Husband claims that the circuit court only retained jurisdiction to amend the original QDRO if the order was submitted to the Plan and the administrator \u201cheld [it] not to be qualified.\u201d Relying upon <em>Leadroot v. Leadroot, </em>147 Md.App. 672, 810 A.2d 526 (2002), Husband asserts, once the Plan administrator qualified the original QDRO and thirty days elapsed from the entry of that order, the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction to revise the order terminated, in the absence of fraud, mistake, irregularity, or clerical mistake. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 2-535.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In <em>Leadroot, </em>the circuit court granted a judgment of absolute divorce in 1993, which incorporated a DRO granting the wife a marital property award of one-half of the marital portion of the husband\u2019s pension benefits. The marital portion of the husband\u2019s plan was calculated as \u201ca fraction of the [husband\u2019s] full monthly benefit, the numerator of which shall be the number of months of [husband\u2019s] participation in the Plan from the date of the parties\u2019 marriage ... and the denominator of which shall be the total number of months of [husband\u2019s] participation in the Plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 674-75, 810 A.2d 526. The wife filed the order with the husband\u2019s plan in 1995, and the plan qualified it.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Four years later, without the wife\u2019s knowledge, the husband transferred his interest to a separate plan that had previously been acquired, in part, during the marriage. As a result, the husband\u2019s pension benefits were significantly increased. He retired and began collecting benefits soon thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">When the wife learned of the transfer, she filed the QDRO with the administrator of husband\u2019s second plan. She was informed that the QDRO would not be accepted unless it was separated from the parties\u2019 judgment of absolute divorce. Pursuant to the wife\u2019s motion, the circuit court issued a separate order in 2001, effectively incorporating the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the parties\u2019 first QDRO. The husband did not challenge the language of the 2001 QDRO or claim that it should be altered to reflect his repurchase of the four years of benefits that had been cashed in during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Six months later, the husband filed a motion to alter or amend the 2001 QDRO on the grounds that \u201c \u2018the original divorce decree and QDRO had an error as to the marital portion of the retirement benefits which are owing and due\u2019 [wife].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 677, 810 A.2d 526. Because he had cashed in four years of retirement during his marriage and had repurchased those benefits with non-marital funds subsequent to the divorce, the husband claimed the repurchased benefits could not be considered marital property. The circuit court agreed and again amended the QDRO on the grounds of mutual mistake so that the four years of redeemed benefits were not considered part of the marital fraction of husband\u2019s total benefits. Claiming that the court was without authority to amend a QDRO eight years after its issuance, the wife filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, which was denied. <em>Id. </em>at 678-79, 810 A.2d 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">On appeal, this Court initially determined that the circuit court\u2019s modifications to the QDRO were clearly revisions as opposed to clarifications. The <em>Leadroot </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">Regardless of what [the husband] chooses to call it, the circuit court did in fact revise the fraction used to compute the marital portion of [the husband\u2019s] pension benefits. It did so to correct what it believed to be a \u201cmutual mistake by the parties.\u201d A clarification does not modify; it illuminates. And the circuit court, here, was engaged in more than simply illuminating the fraction at issue; it significantly altered that fraction so that it conformed with what the circuit court believed to be the parties\u2019 expectations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">* * Jjs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">No distinction was made between redeemed and unredeemed months in computing the marital portion of [the husband\u2019s] pension benefits in 1993, when the QDRO was first issued, or in 2001, when it was re-issued as a separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>order, after [the husband] repurchased his four years of service. Nor can we do so now without revising the parties\u2019 QDRO. To now qualify a term, which was left unqualified both in 1998 and in 2001, plainly constitutes a \u201crevision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AO\"><em>Id. </em>at 680, 810 A.2d 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Considering whether the circuit court retained jurisdiction to revise the QDRO, the <em>Leadroot </em>Court noted that, under Maryland Rule 2-535, after thirty days elapse from the entry of a judgment, the circuit court lacks authority to revise the judgment absent fraud, mistake, or irregularity. <em>Id. </em>at 682, 810 A.2d 526. Finding no fraud, procedural irregularity, or mistake (jurisdictional error), the <em>Leadroot </em>Court held that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to revise the QDRO eight years after it had originally been entered. <em>Id. </em>at 682-84, 810 A.2d 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">We find <em>Leadroot </em>distinguishable from the instant case. Here, the court expressly retained jurisdiction \u201cover the matter of the pension for purposes of securing a Qualified Domestic Relations Order to protect [Wife\u2019s] monetary award[.]\u201d Although the Plan administrator accepted the original QDRO as it was drafted by the parties and entered by the court, the Plan administrator later noted several problems with the original QDRO, including the fact that, as drafted, the method and manner in which benefits were to be distributed were unclear. When they were informed of the errors, the parties agreed to submit an amended order to the circuit court, but, before they could do so, Wife died.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In the interpleader proceeding, the District Court, without expressly deciding whether it had been properly qualified,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>held that the original QDRO, as drafted, \u201cunequivocally\u201d intended benefits to be paid to Wife on a \u201cwhen, if, and as paid to [Husband]\u201d basis and that Wife\u2019s benefits terminated upon her death. The District Court\u2019s interpretation of the original QDRO is subject to the doctrine <em>of res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">As explained in <em>Warner v. German, </em>100 Md.App. 512, 642 A.2d 239 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">\u201c[A] judgment between the same parties and their privies is a final bar to any other suit upon the same cause of action, and is conclusive, not only as to all matters that have been decided in the original suit, but as to all matters which with propriety would have been litigated in the first suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 517-18, 642 A.2d 239 (quoting <em>Rowland v. Harrison, </em>320 Md. 223, 229, 577 A.2d 51 (1990)). See <em>also Anne Arundel County Bd. of Educ. v. Norville, </em>390 Md. 93, 887 A.2d 1029 (2005) (holding that a claim of age discrimination filed in state court was barred by the principles of <em>res judicata, </em>where the claim had previously been adjudicated on the merits in federal court). Moreover, the parties are collaterally estopped from arguing that the original QDRO provides for a type or manner of payment other than that interpreted by the District Court. <em>See Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Commn. Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>361 Md. 371, 391-92, 761 A.2d 899 (2000) (explaining that collateral estoppel is concerned with the factual implications of earlier judgments and applies when there has been a final judgment deciding an issue between the same parties, each of whom had a fair opportunity to be heard on the issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">A decision by the District Court that the original QDRO had been properly qualified would also be subject to <em>res judicata. </em>If such a determination had been made, and had the circuit court merely retained jurisdiction until the Plan administrator qualified the original QDRO, the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction to amend the original QDRO would be subject to the limitations of Maryland Rule 2-535. In that instance, under <em>Leadroot, </em>the circuit court could not revise the original QDRO absent fraud, mistake, irregularity, or clerical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>In incorporating the Consent Order with the order of divorce, however, the circuit court expressly reserved jurisdiction \u201cto protect [Wife\u2019s] monetary award[,]\u201d as agreed to, and expressed in, the Consent Order.

The Consent Order states that \u201c[Wife\u2019s] attorney shall draft the Qualified Domestic Relations Orders necessary to distribute the pension plan benefits as <em>herein indicated.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The Consent Order further provides that Wife\u2019s interest in Husband\u2019s plan \u201cshall [be] distributed] directly to [Wife], by way of a roll-over to her designated plan.\u201d The language, \u201cby way of a roll-over,\u201d is consistent with a separate interest or separate payment approach where, as here, the participant\u2019s interest in the plan is valued as of a specified date and divided. <em>See </em>Perdue, <em>Pension and Welfare, </em>62 ALI-ABA at 748 (discussing separate interest QDROs).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>In contrast to the Consent Order, the original DRO provided that Wife\u2019s interest was to be transferred \u201cby way of a rollover to her designated plan,\u201d that Wife was to receive her interest \u201cwhen, if, and as paid to [Husband],\u201d and that payments to Wife would continue until her death. The provision in the original QDRO providing for benefits to be paid to Wife \u201cwhen, if, and as paid to [Husband],\u201d is consistent with a shared interest or shared payment approach, whereby \u201cpayments start when the [participant chooses, are paid in the form that he chooses, and will terminate completely on his death unless a [qualified joint survivor annuity] has been selected.\u201d Carrad, <em>The Complete QDRO Handbook </em>at 70. In fact, the shared interest or shared payment approach \u201cis sometimes known as the \u2018if, as, and when received\u2019 approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nothing in the Consent Order expressly or impliedly suggests that Wife\u2019s interest would terminate at her death or that Wife\u2019s interest was to be distributed \u201cwhen, if, and as paid to [Husband].\u201d To the extent that the original QDRO conflicts with the Consent Order, we are persuaded that the language of the Consent Order controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Although this Court and the circuit court must afford <em>res judicata </em>effect to the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the original QDRO, the circuit court retained jurisdiction in its judgment of divorce to amend the QDRO, such that it reflected \u201cthe parties\u2019 intent, said modification to be entered <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>if appropriate.\u201d The circuit court\u2019s amendments to the original QDRO were, in effect, a clarification of the original QDRO to reflect the intent of the parties as evidenced in the Consent Order, <em>i.e., </em>to provide Wife a \u201cseparate interest\u201d distribution in fifty-percent of Husband\u2019s pension plan earned during the parties\u2019 marriage, not to exceed $25,000, with payment to take place \u201cdirectly by way of a rollover to her designated plan.\u201d That intent was obscured by the language providing that payments would occur \u201cwhen, if, and as paid to [Husband]\u201d and that \u201c[p]ayments will continue until [Wife\u2019s] death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">A separate interest award is permitted by F.L. \u00a7 8-205 whether the participant spouse\u2019s interest in the plan is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>vested or unvested at time of the divorce.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See e.g., Prince George\u2019s County Police Pension Plan v. Burke, </em>321 Md. 699, 584 A.2d 702 (1991) (interpreting F.L. \u00a7 8-205 and transferring a participant\u2019s interest in a government pension plan to his former spouse). Wife\u2019s portion of the Plan, rolled-over to a plan of her choice, would, in the absence of a named alternate payee, ordinarily be the property of the Estate upon her death. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1974, 2001 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 1-101(r) &amp; 7-102 of the Estates and Trusts Article. A copy of the Plan is not included in the record, but neither Husband in this case, nor the Plan administrator in the interpleader proceeding, argued that a \u201croll-over\u201d to a plan or account of Wife\u2019s choosing could not have been accomplished. Therefore, we presume that a separate interest QDRO would have been accepted by the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">We are persuaded that the circuit court did not err or abuse its discretion in amending the original QDRO to reflect the parties\u2019 intent, as expressed in the Consent Order, and which they intended to provide for in the QDRO. Enforcement of the original QDRO would frustrate the parties\u2019 intent and provide Husband with a windfall payment of that portion of his pension plan that he had agreed to transfer to Wife upon dissolution of their marriage seven months before her death. That transfer was not conditioned on Wife surviving Husband or dependent upon \u201cwhen, if, and [how]\u201d Husband elected to receive his interest. In the event of her death, there was no contracted for reversion of Wife\u2019s marital property award to Husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Without further citation, Husband asserts that the Amended DRO, which assigns benefits to \u201cthe alternate payee, [Wife], through Wilbur W. Bolton, III, Personal Representative of Ther] Estate\u201d (\u201cBolton\u201d), is invalid because Bolton is not an \u201calternate payee\u201d within the definition of 29 U.S.C. 1056(d)(3)(K). Whether a domestic relations order that provides for payment of the alternate payee\u2019s interest in a defined contribution plan \u201cthrough\u201d the personal representative of the estate of the alternate payee can be a qualifiable domestic relations order is a matter of first impression in Maryland. In the end, it may simply be a matter of semantics. Although the Amended DRO, as currently drafted, may not be qualifiable under ERISA and the REA, we are persuaded that the circuit court may further amend the order to secure Wife\u2019s marital property award, while at the same time adhering to the strictures of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">We have not been directed to case law specifically discussing the issue presented. Courts considering similar issues have found guidance in the purpose and statutory language of ERISA and the REA. Discussion of some key cases is, therefore, appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In <em>Ablamis v. Roper, </em>937 F.2d 1450 (9th Cir.1991), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit considered whether a deceased spouse could devise her one-half interest in her husband\u2019s pension benefits, arising under California community property law, to a third party named in her will. The deceased spouse was married to the plan participant at the time of her death. By will, she devised \u201call property subject to [her] testamentary power including [her] one-half <em>(\u00bd</em>) community property interest in all community assets and any separate property assets [she] may have[,]\u201d to a trust for the benefit of her children from a previous marriage. <em>Id. </em>at 1452 (alterations in original). The deceased wife\u2019s estate brought an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, claiming a property interest in the participant spouse\u2019s retirement benefits. That court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>California community property law was preempted by ERISA and that a non-participant spouse could not \u201cbequeath her interest in a participant spouses\u2019s retirement plan.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">On appeal, the executrix of the wife\u2019s estate argued that the California Probate Court\u2019s order enforcing the wife\u2019s will was a QDRO that avoided ERISA\u2019s preemption. Concluding that ERISA preempted California\u2019s community property law, the <em>Ablamis </em>Court rejected the executrix\u2019s contention that the order of the Probate Court was a valid QDRO. The court explained that the provisions of the REA applied to \u201c \u2018domestic relations\u2019 orders\u201d and not \u201c \u2018probate\u2019 orders,\u201d and that \u201cCongress did not intend to classify court orders effecting testamentary transfers as QDROs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1455. The court also opined that the probate order could not constitute a QDRO because the deceased spouse\u2019s estate could not qualify as an \u201calternate payee\u201d as defined by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(K). According to the <em>Ablamis </em>Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">An estate, even of a deceased spouse, certainly does not fall within even the most liberal construction of the phrase \u201cspouse, former spouse, child or other dependent of the participant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">Similarly, Ms. Ablamis\u2019s death divests her of the title of \u201cspouse or other dependent.\u201d The executrix argues that the term \u201cformer spouse\u201d encompasses a deceased nonparticipant spouse. In legal parlance, however, the term \u201cformer spouse\u201d does not include a deceased spouse. At law, we use the term \u201cformer spouse\u201d to refer to a divorced spouse; once a spouse has died we refer to her, for legal purposes, as a \u201cdeceased spouse.\u201d Nothing in the language of the legislative history of the REA suggests an intention to afford the term \u201cformer spouse\u201d a meaning different from its customary usage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1456 (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(K)).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Furthermore, the Court determined that permitting such testamentary transfers to third parties would violate the statutory purpose of ERISA \u201cto safeguard the security of the employee\u2019s immediate family members in the case of divorce or separation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1456-57. The Court concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>As a matter of policy, ERISA\u2019s <em>limited </em>exception to the prohibition against assignment and alienation has considerable merit. Pensions are designed for the benefit of the living. Congress wanted to ensure that workers would have the security of a fair pension for their lifetimes. Congress also wanted surviving spouses to have what it considered to be a reasonable degree of security. In this connection, Congress wisely deemed it necessary to protect the divorced spouse for the remainder of her lifetime. From a practical standpoint, in order to do so, it was necessary to give her, upon divorce, the share of pension benefits she would have been entitled to if she had remained married and her husband predeceased her. Since that interest is ordinarily converted into cash or other property at the time of the divorce, it followed necessarily that the divorced spouse would receive full right, title and interest in the settlement proceeds, and that she would therefore be free to bequeath any funds remaining at the time of death to the beneficiary of her choice. However, Congress\u2019 fundamental purpose was evident throughout\u2014to ensure that both spouses would receive sufficient funds to afford them security during their lifetimes, not to arrange an opportunity for a predeceasing non-employee spouse to leave a part of her surviving husband\u2019s pension rights to others. We must keep in mind that pension benefits are designed to protect individuals in their later years-both the employee and the spouse. That the employee\u2019s ultimate pension will be reduced following divorce is unavoidable-because divorce necessitates the maintenance of two households rather than one. However, from the standpoint of pension protection-the fundamental purpose and goal of ERISA-there is no reason to allow a predeceasing non-employee spouse to leave part of her surviving employee spouse\u2019s pension to a friend, lover, or relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1457 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Subsequent to <em>Ablamis, </em>the United States Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari </em>in <em>Boggs v. Boggs, </em>520 U.S. 883, 117 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>1754, 138 L.Ed.2d 45 (1997), to resolve a conflict in the federal circuit courts concerning ERISA\u2019s preemption of state community property laws. In <em>Boggs, </em>the facts were substantially the same as <em>Ablamis, </em>except that the participant husband and the non-participant former spouse were both deceased, and the participant had remarried prior to his death. The children of the deceased non-participant former spouse filed an action in a Louisiana court, seeking an interest in the deceased plan participant\u2019s individual retirement account, shares of stock, and monthly survivorship annuity payments. The plan participant\u2019s widow petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Louisiana to issue a judgment declaring that ERISA preempted Louisiana law. The District Court concluded that the deceased former spouse\u2019s interest arose under Louisiana community property law and the alienation and assignment proscriptions of ERISA were not implicated. A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The Supreme Court reversed, holding that Louisiana\u2019s community property law conflicted with ERISA, which, by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of Article Six of the Constitution of the United States and the preemption provision of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a), preempted otherwise applicable state law. The Court explained that the principal purpose of ERISA was \u201cto protect plan participants and beneficiaries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 845, 117 S.Ct. 1754. That purpose would be frustrated by testamentary transfers of pension benefits to third parties having no relation to the participant. In addition to a potential diversion of a retiree\u2019s stream of income, the <em>Boggs </em>Court envisioned \u201ctroubling anomolies,\u201d including the potential of pension plans being \u201crun for the benefit of only a subset of those who have a stake in the plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 850,117 S.Ct. 1754.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The Court was persuaded that the REA\u2019s QDRO provisions, \u201cwhich acknowledge and protect specific pension plan community property interests, give rise to the strong implication that other community property claims are not consistent with the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 834, 117 S.Ct. 1754. The respondents in <em>Boggs </em>did not contend that there was a valid QDRO, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>but they asserted that it was \u201canomalous and unfair that a divorced spouse, as a result of a QDRO, will have more control over a portion of his or her spouse\u2019s pension benefits than a predeceasing spouse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 854, 117 S.Ct. 1754. Rejecting that argument, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">Congress thought otherwise. The QDRO provisions, as well as the surviving spouse annuity provisions, reinforce the conclusion that ERISA is concerned with providing for the living. The QDRO provisions protect those persons who, often as a result of divorce, might not receive the benefits they otherwise would have available during their retirement as a means of income. In the case of a predeceased spouse, this concern is not implicated. The fairness of the distinction might be debated, but Congress has decided to favor the living over the dead and we must respect its policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUg\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">At least two courts, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the Court of Appeal of California, have relied upon <em>Ablamis </em>and <em>Boggs </em>in holding that a domestic relations order providing for payment to a deceased nonparticipant former spouse was not qualifiable under the REA. In <em>Branco v. UFCW-Northern California Employers Joint Pension Plan, </em>279 F.3d 1154 (9th Cir.2002), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals considered whether a domestic relations order, awarding a non-participant former spouse community property pension benefits, could be enforced as a QDRO, where the non-participant former spouse died before the participant became eligible for benefits. During a divorce proceeding, the participant spouse stipulated to a court order awarding his former wife a community property interest in 47% of his pension benefits. Benefits were to be paid to the former wife \u201cso long as they were payable to or on behalf of [the participant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The court order was apparently filed with the participant\u2019s plan before the former wife died. When the participant became eligible for benefits, the plan deducted the former wife\u2019s community property share from the participant\u2019s bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>fits, presumably retaining her portion. The participant filed a complaint in state court, alleging breach of contract and claiming that his former wife\u2019s benefits should have reverted to him upon her death. The plan removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and claimed that the participant\u2019s claims were preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The District Court concluded that ERISA was not implicated because the participant was not deprived of benefits to which he was entitled. Therefore, between the plan and the former wife\u2019s estate, her estate was entitled to her benefits under the plan. According to the District Court, such a distribution of benefits would protect the former wife\u2019s community property award and require the plan to satisfy its obligation of paying the full earned benefit amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The Ninth Circuit initially determined that, unless the state court order awarding the deceased former wife an interest in the plan was a QDRO, her benefits were subject to the anti-alienation provisions of ERISA and could not be devised. Relying upon <em>Ablamis, </em>the <em>Branco </em>Court determined that, when the former wife died, \u201cshe was divested of her qualified status under ERISA\u201d because she was no longer a \u201cspouse\u201d or \u201cformer spouse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1158. Therefore, \u201c[pjayments to [the former wife] as a deceased spouse are not authorized under ERISA\u2019s definition of a qualifying recipient, because at that point, the QDRO does not relate to marital property rights of a spouse or former spouse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Branco </em>Court also concluded that payments to the former wife\u2019s estate or to her heirs were similarly precluded under ERISA because they did not come within the definition of an \u201calternate payee\u201d and were not mentioned in the state domestic relations order. Finally, citing <em>Ablamis </em>and <em>Boggs, </em>the Court reasoned that permitting a deceased former spouse to devise an interest in a living participant\u2019s pension benefits would violate the statutory purpose of providing a stream of income to the participant and his or her beneficiaries in their retirement years.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The Court of Appeal of California, Fourth District relied upon similar reasoning in <em>In re the Marriage ofShelstead, </em>66 Cal.App.4th 893, 78 Cal.Rptr.2d 365 (1998). In that case, the California appellate court held that an order granting an alternate payee and \u201cher designated successor in interest\u201d the right to monthly payments under a pension plan until the participant\u2019s death could not be qualified under the REA and ERISA, because it would require the plan to \u201cpay benefits to an individual ([the alternate payee\u2019s] successor) who is not an \u2018alternate payee\u2019 within the meaning of ERISA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 372. In that case, the non-participating spouse\u2019s interest in the participant\u2019s retirement plan was awarded in a divorce action pursuant to California\u2019s community property laws. After the parties\u2019 divorce, the trial court entered a proposed QDRO, naming the non-participating former spouse an alternate payee.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Upon the participant\u2019s eligibility under the plan, each month the plan was directed to make payments to the alternate payee, \u201cor her designated successor in interest should [she] predecease [the participant], until terminated by [the participant\u2019s] death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367. In a later proceeding, the trial court determined the order to be a QDRO. The plan appealed to the California Court of Appeal claiming, among other things, that the order could not be qualified because the wife\u2019s successor was not an \u201calternate payee\u201d within the contemplation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Considering whether the order in <em>Shelstead </em>violated the statutory scheme, the California Court of Appeal explained that, under a strict literal reading of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(i)(I), a domestic relations order designating a successor in interest could be a valid QDRO because the statute does not expressly preclude such a designation. It only provides that an order is qualified if it creates or assigns rights to receive pension benefits to an \u201calternate payee.\u201d So long as the statutory requirements are satisfied, there is a qualified order and \u201cthe fact that the order further permits the alternate payee to exercise her rights under state community property law does not change this conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The <em>Shelstead </em>Court reasoned, however, that such an assignment still violates the \u201ccentral purpose of the ERISA and REA ... which seek to provide for the economic security of the participant or the participant\u2019s dependents-those defined as alternate payees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Shelstead </em>Court further explained that \u201c \u2018Congress\u2019 primary purpose in enacting the limited exception to ERISA\u2019s prohibition on assignment and alienation was to safeguard the security of the employee\u2019s <em>immediate family members </em>in the case of divorce or separation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ablamis, </em>937 F.2d at 1456-57) (emphasis in <em>Shelstead). </em>Thus, it concluded, if testamentary transfers were permitted by the order at issue, \u201ca third party \u2018successor\u2019 would have the right to obtain benefits at the expense of the living employee; this outcome[,] is \u2018incompatible with [ERISA\u2019s] spendthrift provision.\u2019 \u201d 78 Cal.Rptr.2d at 371 (quoting <em>Boggs, </em>520 U.S. at 852, 117 S.Ct. 1754).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Additionally, the <em>Shelstead </em>Court reiterated the Supreme Court\u2019s concern in <em>Boggs </em>that the fiduciary obligations of the plan, which, under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(e), apply only to the \u201cparticipants\u201d and \u201cbeneficiaries,\u201d would be implicated because an undesignated successor in interest is not a beneficiary under ERISA. 78 Cal.Rptr.2d at 371-72. <em>See also, </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(J) (noting that an alternate payee, including a former spouse, is considered a beneficiary under ERISA). The court concluded that, \u201c[r]ead together, ERISA\u2019s statutory definitions and fiduciary provisions prohibit a court from issuing a domestic relations order requiring an ERISA plan administrator to pay benefits to a person who does not fall within the definition of an alternate payee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372. Nevertheless, the <em>Shelstead </em>Court was careful to limit its holding to the facts of that case. <em>Id. </em>at 372. The court remarked that its decision might have been different had the QDRO specifically identified as a successor in interest an individual, such as a child, who was included within the definition of \u201calternate payee.\u201d The court noted that the plan at issue did not provide for payments through a \u201cseparate interest approach,\u201d whereby \u201ca court may have additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>options permitting it to provide the divorced nonemployee spouse -with a form of testamentary rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">More recently, in <em>Divich v. Divich, </em>665 N.W.2d 109 (S.D. 2003), the Supreme Court of South Dakota considered, among other things, the validity of a QDRO permitting the nonparticipant spouse to devise to her estate her portion of pension plan benefits were she to predecease the plan participant. The parties\u2019 divorce decree incorporated the terms of a settlement agreement, which granted the non-participant former spouse a vested one-half interest in her former husband\u2019s retirement account. <em>Id. </em>at 111. Payment of benefits to the wife would occur on a monthly basis. <em>Id. </em>She attempted to preserve her interest through a proposed QDRO that provided, \u201cif [she] predeceased [the husband (participant),] her share of the retirement benefits would be payable to her estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, the trial court adopted a QDRO providing that, in the event the wife predeceased the husband, the wife\u2019s portion of the benefits would revert back to the husband. The wife appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Initially, the <em>Divich </em>Court stated that, under South Dakota\u2019s marital property laws, a retirement plan was a divisible marital asset because it represented consideration to the spouse in lieu of a higher salary. <em>Id. </em>at 112. Next, the court considered <em>Ablamis </em>and the Ninth Circuit\u2019s discussion of ERISA\u2019s surviv- or annuity provisions, and concluded that, not only did the parties stipulate that the plan at issue is exempt from federal legislation, but ERISA\u2019s spendthrift provisions were not applicable to QDROs. The court went on to hold that, because the grant of a share of retirement benefits is a property right, it could be paid under the terms of a QDRO to a non-participant spouse\u2019s estate should she predecease the plan participant. The court found persuasive the wife\u2019s argument that, had the plan participant bought her out of her share of the retirement plan, she would be free to devise that money to her estate. The court concluded that the result should not change merely because the wife was paid on a month-to-month basis instead of through a lump sum award. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Without expressly considering the issue, other courts have upheld QDRO\u2019s that grant the alternate payee\u2019s estate an interest in the alternate payee\u2019s benefits upon the alternate payee\u2019s death. <em>See, e.g., Seal v. Raw, </em>954 S.W.2d 681 (Mo.Ct.App.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The cases cited above are not controlling, and we do not find <em>Boggs </em>and <em>Ablamis </em>particularly instructive on the issue presented. Neither <em>Boggs </em>nor <em>Ablamis </em>concerned the entry of a QDRO. In fact, in <em>Ablamis, </em>the Ninth Circuit reasoned that, where a QDRO is entered,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">[s]ince [the divorced former spouse\u2019s] interest is ordinarily converted to cash or other property at the time of divorce, it follow[s] necessarily that the [former] spouse would receive full right, title and interest in the settlement proceeds, and that she would therefore be free to bequeath any funds remaining at the time of death to the beneficiary of her choice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">937 F.2d at 1457. <em>See also Shelstead, </em>78 Cal.Rptr.2d at 372 (\u201c[U]nder the separate interest approach, a court may have additional options permitting it to provide the divorced nonemployee spouse with a form of testamentary rights consistent with ... ERISA.\u201d). Therefore, we are not persuaded by the <em>Branco </em>and <em>Shelstead </em>opinions. That being said, we find guidance in the reasoning of the <em>Divich </em>Court. Similar to South Dakota law, in Maryland a retirement or pension plan is a marital asset, which can be divided pursuant to a marital property award. F.L. \u00a7 8-205.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">As explained in Part I, through the Consent Order, Husband agreed to transfer to Wife one-half of the marital portion of the Plan, not to exceed $25,000. The distribution was to take place by way of a \u201croll-over to her designated plan.\u201d Had a QDRO been drafted that clearly reflected the parties\u2019 intent for a \u201cseparate interest\u201d lump sum distribution, Wife\u2019s marital property award could have been protected and Husband would not be able to assert an interest in the marital property that he assigned to her. Husband does not contend otherwise. Instead, he argues that the original QDRO effec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>tively superseded the Consent Order. Presumably, had the lump sum distribution occurred prior to Wife\u2019s death, unless otherwise provided for by the terms of her designated plan, Wife\u2019s portion of the award would become part of the Estate. In either event, we are not persuaded that a failure to submit a proper QDRO prior to Wife\u2019s death should alter that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The QDRO, as amended by the circuit court, however, provides for payment through the personal representative of Wife\u2019s estate, a party not included within the REA\u2019s definition of an \u201calternate payee.\u201d Courts have interpreted the provisions of the REA and the 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(K) definition of \u201calternate payee\u201d strictly. <em>See Branco, </em>279 F.3d at 1158 (concluding that a domestic relations order providing for payment to a deceased former spouse was not qualifiable because a \u201cdeceased spouse\u201d was not included within the term \u201cformer spouse\u201d). <em>But see Shelstead, </em>78 Cal.Rptr.2d at 365 (opining that, under a strict literal reading of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(i)(I), a domestic relations order providing for payment to a successor in interest could be a valid QDRO because the statute did not expressly prohibit such orders). To the extent that it can be argued that payment of an alternate payee\u2019s interest in a plan \u201cthrough\u201d the alternate payee\u2019s personal representative designates the personal representative as the \u201calternate payee\u201d and renders the Amended QDRO unqualifiable, we believe that the QDRO can be amended again, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>to simply name Wife as the \u201calternate payee,\u201d and avoid the issue. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">In the judgment of divorce, the circuit court reserved jurisdiction to secure a QDRO protecting Wife\u2019s monetary award. In the original QDRO, the court retained jurisdiction to modify the QDRO \u201cso as to make it a Qualified Domestic Relations Order that reflects the parties\u2019 intent, said modification to be entered <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>if appropriate.\u201d This Court has previously explained that an order entered <em>nunc pro tunc </em>is \u2018\u201can entry now of something actually previously done to have effect of former date; office being not to supply omitted action, but to supply omission in record of action really had but omitted through inadvertence or mistake.\u2019\u201d <em>Short v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>Short, </em>136 Md.App. 570, 578, 766 A.2d 651 (2001) (quoting <em>In re Peter\u2019s Estate, </em>175 Okla. 90, 51 P.2d 272, 274 (1935)).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In a slightly different context, courts have entered domestic relations orders, granting a former spouse an interest in a deceased participant\u2019s plan benefits, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>to secure the former spouse\u2019s monetary award. For example, in <em>Patton v. Denver Post Corp., </em>326 F.3d 1148 (10th Cir.2003), the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that a domestic relations order, which granted a former spouse an interest in her deceased spouse\u2019s plan benefits and was entered <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>was a qualified domestic relations order. In <em>Patton, </em>the parties made financial disclosures during their divorce proceedings. When the husband inquired into his pension benefits with his employer, the employer disclosed the husband\u2019s participation in one pension plan, but inadvertently failed to disclose the existence of a second plan. A domestic relations order granting the wife one-half of the husband\u2019s interest in the disclosed plan, valued as of the date of the parties\u2019 divorce, was entered by a Colorado state court. The husband later died before he had reached the age of retirement or became eli \u201cble for benefits. As a result, under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055(a)(2), benefits were only payable under the plan to a surviving spouse. Because the husband had not remarried at the time of this death, his former spouse qualified as a surviving spouse pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(a)(3)(F)(i). The wife filed the court order granting her one-half of the disclosed plan with the plan administrator. The order was qualified and the plan provided the former spouse a lump sum survivorship payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The former spouse believed that the payment was very low in light of the years of service her former spouse had provided to the employer. A subsequent investigation revealed the existence of the second plan, which had not been disclosed at the time of the divorce proceedings. When the former spouse presented the QDRO to the second plan administrator, the plan refused payment, claiming that the order was not qualifiable because it increased the plan\u2019s liability and provided a type of payment not otherwise available under the plan, <em>i.e., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>survivorship payments to a former spouse not designated prior to the plan participant\u2019s death. The former spouse returned to state court and requested a second order dividing the second plan in the same manner as the first plan. The state court entered an order <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>effective on the date of the parties\u2019 divorce. The <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order granted the former spouse a one-half interest in the participant\u2019s interest. When the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order was filed with the second plan, the plan administrator rejected the order. The wife then filed an action to determine her right to payment in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, which found in the wife\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit concluded that, although the domestic relations order was entered and filed with the plan posthumously, the order did not provide for an increase in benefits paid because it was entered <em>nunc pro tunc </em>and therefore \u201cmust be considered to have been entered before the death of the participant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1152. According to the <em>Patton </em>Court, the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order was \u201cakin to the correction of a clerical error, which is an accepted use for <em>nunc pro tunc </em>orders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1153. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">All that occurred in this case is that the state court and the parties previously lacked full information as to the assets to be distributed in the divorce settlement. When those assets were finally discovered, the court simply allotted them as it had intended under the original plan, i.e., as it would have done had it been aware of their existence at the time. The historical facts were not changed-two pension plans existed on the date of the divorce as well as the date of death. That is, once discovered, the second plan simply was added to the list of assets and apportioned so as to achieve the same equitable division of marital assets originally intended by the domestic relations court. No other person\u2019s vested interest was upset by this action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The <em>Patton </em>Court went on to reject the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Samaroo v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number><em>Samaroo, </em>193 F.3d 185 (3d. Cir.1999), in which that court held that a beneficiary\u2019s interest had to be secured prior to the date of the participant\u2019s death and that an order entered <em>nunc pro tunc </em>was not qualifiable because it provided for increased benefits. According to the Tenth Circuit, the Third Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Samaroo </em>\u201cwas not compelled by statute or case law,\u201d and \u201c *work[ed] an unwarranted interference with the states\u2019 ability to administer their domestic relations law and to effectuate equitable divisions of marital assets.\u2019 \u201d <em>Patton, </em>326 F.3d at 1153 (quoting <em>Samaroo, </em>193 F.3d at 192 (Mansmann, J., dissenting)). In conclusion, the Tenth Circuit explained the importance of <em>nunc pro tunc </em>orders in the context of QDROs, remarking: <em>\u201cNunc pro tunc </em>QDROs are desperately needed in the domestic relations arena. There must be a way to secure a former spouse\u2019s property rights to a pension that could suddenly disappear as a result of a technicality or a family law attorney\u2019s inexperience in drafting QDRO\u2019s.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1154 (quoting Gary Shulman, <em>QDROs\u2014The Ticking Time Bomb, </em>23 Family Advocate, 26, 29 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in <em>Hogan v.
