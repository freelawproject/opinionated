The Circuit Court for Baltimore County ordered visitation with the appellees, John Haining (John) and Maureen Haining (Maureen) (sometimes collectively referred to as \u201cGrandparents\u201d), over the opposition to any visitation by the appellants, Glen Koshko (Glen) and Andrea Koshko (Andrea) (sometimes collectively referred to as \u201cParents\u201d). Andrea is the oldest of the four children of the Hainings. Andrea is the mother of three children: Kaelyn (DOB 9/26/94), Haley (DOB 8/21/99), and Aiden (DOB 12/19/02) (the Children). Appellants contend that Maryland\u2019s Grandparent Visitation Statute (GVS), Maryland Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-102 of the Family Law Article (FL), is facially unconstitutional, or was unconstitutionally applied in this case to fit parents in an intact family.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">We set forth the facts in the light most favorable to the Grandparents as the prevailing parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Andrea was raised in Middleton, New Jersey. At age eighteen she left home, \u201cto get away,\u201d together with her then boyfriend, James Atkats. They lived in Florida where Andrea became pregnant with their child, Kaelyn. James Atkats abandoned Andrea, who then returned to the Haining family home in Middleton. James Atkats has never played any role in Kaelyn\u2019s life.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After Kaelyn was born, Andrea and Kaelyn continued to reside in the Haining family home until 1997, when Kaelyn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>was three years old. During this period, Andrea worked as a waitress in the evening, and the Hainings actively participated in the care and raising of Kaelyn. Maureen described her participation as co-parenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Also during this period, Andrea and Glen began dating. In September 1997, Andrea moved out of the family home, and she, Glen, and Kaelyn lived in Point Pleasant, New Jersey. Their home was about a half-hour drive from the Grandparents, and Maureen saw Kaelyn \u201cquite often.\u201d \u201c[A] lot of times\u201d Maureen would take Kaelyn out for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Andrea and Glen became engaged to be married. The Hainings were prepared to pay for a formal wedding, with reception, but the couple, sometime in 1998, eloped. Andrea testified that the couple were anxious to bring Kaelyn under the health insurance coverage available through Glen\u2019s employment. The couple, over time, reimbursed the Hainings for the $2,000 deposit with a catering facility that was lost when the formal wedding was cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">In about June 1999, the Parents, with Kaelyn, moved to Baltimore County, Maryland in connection with Glen\u2019s employment. At that time Kaelyn was three months shy of age five. They have resided in Baltimore County ever since. Haley and Aiden were born in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Despite the approximately 150 miles separating the two households, the Children had a close relationship with the Grandparents until October of 2003. Sometimes the Grandparents visited at the Parents\u2019 home; other times the Parents drove the Children to the Grandparents\u2019 home. The parties agree that the Children saw their maternal grandparents approximately once a month. Further, between visits, the Children and the Grandparents maintained a relationship by telephone and through cards and letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">To evidence that the relationship continued after the Koshkos moved to Maryland, the Grandparents produced photo albums, videos, and E-Z Pass billings. The circuit court also received into evidence a log, prepared by the Grandparents, demonstrating that they visited with the Children thirty-one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>times in the thirty month period between May 2001 and October 2003. These visits included two overnight stays by the Grandparents at the Parents\u2019 home and fourteen overnights at the Grandparents\u2019 home. On seven of these fourteen overnights the Children stayed without their Parents. Indeed, the Children kept toothbrushes at the Grandparents\u2019 home. The last of these Children-only visits was from October 9 to October 13, 2003, while Parents were at Glen\u2019s college homecoming in South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In October 2003, Glen\u2019s mother was hospitalized in New Jersey with terminal cancer. She died in early December of that year. Maureen\u2019s own mother had died from cancer, and Maureen was emotional about the condition of Glen\u2019s mother. Glen did not visit his mother when one, the other, or both Parents delivered and picked up the Children in connection with the five day stay during homecoming. On the following Thursday, Maureen spoke to Andrea about this. Maureen offered to watch the Children if Parents came to New Jersey to see Glen\u2019s mother. Andrea said, \u201c \u2018No, Glen is not coming up. Glen is having a birthday party.\u2019 \u201d Maureen pointed out that Glen\u2019s mother would not live much longer and that the Parents had gone away for four days the preceding weekend. At that point Glen came on the telephone and, Maureen testified, the following conversation ensued.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">GLEN: \u201c \u2018You got something to say to me?\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab-\">MAUREEN: \u201c \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m just concerned. [Your] mother is dying, and you\u2019re acting like an asshole.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">GLEN: \u201c\u2018It\u2019s none of your goddamn business____You are not going to see your fucking grandchildren again.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ax\">Glen slammed the phone down.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">When Maureen told John of the conversation with Glen, John first spoke to Andrea, who confirmed to him what Glen had said. John then unsuccessfully attempted to reach Glen on the latter\u2019s cell phone, but left a message telling Glen that he, John, was going to come down to Maryland \u201cto knock some sense into him[,] to crack him [in the head] that evening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>At the time of this October 2003 incident, Andrea\u2019s sister, Tracey, was engaged to be married in August 2004. Tracey planned for the Children to be part of the wedding party. On November 17, 2003, Tracey wrote to Andrea urging that Andrea at least permit the Children to participate. Tracey offered to transport them and arrange for their wedding outfits. She received no reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">On December 12, John e-mailed Glen and Andrea, apologized for \u201cgoing off the handle and wanting to \u2018crack\u2019 \u201d Glen, and urged that Parents and Grandparents \u201csit down and talk.\u201d He said, \u201cWe Love you guys and, as you said in your Mom\u2019s eulogy Glen\u2014life is too precious and short.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Through telephone calls and e-mails, and utilizing friends as intermediaries, Grandparents sought to restore the relationship with the Koshko family. On Valentine\u2019s Day, after being in Washington, D.C., they stopped by Parents\u2019 home, unannounced, and left gifts on the door step. They employed an attorney who wrote to the Parents on February 27, 2004, suggesting mediation. In April 2004, Parents offered to permit Grandparents to visit once with the Children, but would not commit themselves as to whether any subsequent visits could take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Kaelyn was nine years old, Haley age four, and Aiden about age two when the relationship between the parties ruptured in October 2003. The subject action was filed April 19, 2004, and tried on July 19 and 20, 2005. There was no expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">On cross-examination, Andrea acknowledged that, prior to the rupture, Kaelyn and Maureen had carried on a correspondence. The following colloquy then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">\u201cQ So, tell the Court what did you tell your daughter when you just cut her grandparents out of their life, what did you tell her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-11\">\u201cA I didn\u2019t say anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-12\">\u201cQ Just didn\u2019t talk about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-13\">\u201cA Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>\u201cQ She never asked you one question about your parents, that\u2019s what you told me at the deposition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">\u201cA She has not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">\u201cQ You\u2019re under oath. Not a single question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">\u201cA No, we have not talked about it. We have not talked about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">\u201cQ How do you answer that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">\u201cA She has not asked me anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\">\u201cQ Nothing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-11\">\u201cA Nothing, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-12\">\u201cQ You think that\u2019s a healthy thing for her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-13\">\u201cA I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s healthy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">Focusing on the status of the Maureen-Kaelyn correspondence following the rupture, counsel for Grandparents asked Andrea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-15\">\u201cQ Have your parents written her since the problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-16\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-17\">\u201cQ What happens with those letters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-18\">\u201cA They were not letters, they would just send cards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-19\">\u201cQ What would happen to them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-20\">\u201cA Because of the escalation and fighting, I thought it might be best if she not see them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-21\">\u201cQ So, you hid them from her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-22\">\u201cA I didn\u2019t hide them from her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-23\">\u201cQ What did you do with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-24\">\u201cA I didn\u2019t give them to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-25\">\u201cQ What do you [do] with them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-26\">\u201cA I put them aside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-27\">\u201cQ Just to obliterate them from her life?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-28\">\u201cA What I\u2019m trying to do is make more peace with everything, because she might start asking questions. So, I\u2019m keeping her out of it. I am keeping her out of it at this point. Because of the position we are in, I thought it would be best. That was my opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>\u201cQ You don\u2019t think an 8, 9 or 10-year-old child is able to understand when two people completely disappear out of her life? She has not asked you one question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">\u201cA She really hasn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The circuit court delivered an oral opinion at the conclusion of the evidence. It found this testimony to be \u201ccredible\u201d but \u201ctroubling.\u201d After explaining its legal reasoning, the court interwove a program of counseling with its visitation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Before describing the circuit court\u2019s rationale, it will be helpful to review <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000), the background against which this case was argued in the circuit court and here.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">\n<em>Troxel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\"><em>Troxel </em>involved a statute of the State of Washington which, in terms, permitted any person, at any time, to obtain court-ordered visitation if the court concluded that visitation was in the best interest of the child. The custodial parent, the mother, did not oppose entirely visitation by the grandparents, so long as it was limited to one short visit per month. <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 61, 120 S.Ct. at 2057. The Washington Supreme Court had held that the statute violated the United States Constitution by infringing on the fundamental right of parents to rear their children. <em>Id. </em>at 63, 120 S.Ct. at 2058. In the United States Supreme Court, four justices joined in the opinion announcing judgment, there were two separate concurrences, and three justices dissented. The Court affirmed, but for reasons different from those given by the Supreme Court of Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">The plurality, describing the operation of the Washington statute, said that \u201c[ojnce the visitation petition has been filed in court and the matter is placed before a judge, a parent\u2019s decision that visitation would not be in the child\u2019s best interest is accorded no deference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67, 120 S.Ct. at 2061. By placing the best interest determination solely in the hands of the judge, the Court said that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>\u201cin practical effect, in the State of Washington a court can disregard and overturn <em>any </em>decision by a fit custodial parent concerning visitation ... based solely on the judge\u2019s determination of the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-5\"><em>Id. </em>This decisional framework that had been employed by the Washington State trial court \u201cdirectly contravened the traditional presumption that a fit parent will act in the best interest of his or her child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69, 120 S.Ct. at 2062. Setting forth the appropriate decisional framework, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">\u201c[T]he decision whether such an intergenerational relationship would be beneficial in any specific case is for the parent to make in the first instance. And, if a fit parent\u2019s decision of the kind at issue here becomes subject to judicial review, the court must accord at least some special weight to the parent\u2019s own determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 70, 120 S.Ct. at 2062. Accordingly, the Court held that the Washington statute had been unconstitutionally applied to the parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">The Court expressly declined to pass on whether \u201cthe Due Process Clause require[d] all nonparental visitation statutes to include a showing of harm or potential ham to the child as a condition precedent to granting visitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73, 120 S.Ct. at 2064. Nor would the Court define \u201cthe precise scope of the parental due process right in the visitation context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After recognizing that non-parental visitation cases are adjudicated on a case-by-case basis, the Court said that it \u201cwould be hesitant to hold that specific nonparental visitation statutes violate the Due Process Clause as a <em>per se </em>matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). The Court then cited, for the sake of an example, <em>Fairbanks v. McCarter, </em>330 Md. 39, 49-50, 622 A.2d 121, 126-27 (1993), where illustrations of the factors to be considered under the Maryland statute were set forth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>The plurality in <em>Troxel </em>also expressed agreement with one aspect of the dissenting opinion of Justice Kennedy, namely that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">\u201cthe constitutionality of any standard for awarding visitation turns on the specific manner in which that standard is applied and that the constitutional protections in this area are best \u2018elaborated with care.\u2019 [530 U.S. at 101, 120 S.Ct. at 2079.] Because much state-court adjudication in this context occurs on a case-by-case basis, we would be hesitant to hold that specific nonparental visitation statutes violate the Due Process Clause as a <em>per se </em>matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 73, 120 S.Ct. at 2064. The Court then set forth in a footnote references to the statutes of all fifty states providing for grandparent visitation in some form.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The Circuit Court\u2019s Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The circuit court stated that grandparent visitation cases are very fact specific, so that the trial court is required to look at the totality of the circumstances. It noted the discretionary phraseology of the Maryland GVS, its requirement for finding that visitation is in the best interest of the child, and the nonexclusive factors set forth in <em>Fairbanks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Directing its attention to <em>Troxel, </em>the court said: \u201cIn looking at the presumptions and what <em>Troxel </em>did, it clearly did change the law in this area in terms of laying out what the trial court, such as myself, has to look at.\u201d The circuit court considered that <em>Troxel</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">\u201cclearly says ... that parents do have certain rights to control what happens to their children, but it is not an unfettered right. There\u2019s a presumption ... that does exist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>as parents basically being deemed to know what is in their children\u2019s best interest, but as I said, that\u2019s not an absolute mandate that this Court then has to say just because the parents say it\u2019s so, they are presumed to be a hundred percent correct, and that could not be challenged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The trial judge further opined that in order for the Grandparents to get visitation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">\u201ctwo things have to happen. First off, the evidence has to be sufficient by a preponderance of the evidence to rebut the presumption that the parents have the best interest of the children at heart and are doing this out of the best interest as opposed to any other issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">If the presumption were rebutted, then the second step would be for the court to consider the factors bearing on a best interest analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The court concluded that the Grandparents had produced sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption. In particular, the court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">\u201cit was very clear to this Court over the years these Children were part of the Hainings\u2019 life on a fairly regular basis[,] more so frankly than the Court has seen in some grandparent cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">\u201cSo, this was not a case of grandparent showing up five years after the child was born saying I want to see the children every month. There was a relationship, <em>the relationship stopped abruptly, not became of anything relating to the children, </em>but clearly because of a deterioration in the relationship between the Hainings and the Koshkos unfortunately over this incident in October.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">The court characterized the Grandparents\u2019 communications seeking reconciliation, to which no response was received, as utilizing \u201ceverything short of the Pony Express.\u201d Further distinguishing the instant matter from <em>Troxel, </em>the court noted that the position of Parents was that there would be \u201cabsolutely no visitation\u201d by the Grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The circuit court concluded that it was in the best interests of the Children for there to be some limited visitation with Grandparents, but that, because of the October 2003 rupture, counseling was required. The court ordered the parties to attend four counseling sessions, within thirty days of each other, beginning within fourteen days from the decree. Grandparents were awarded one visitation in every forty-five day period, for four hours on Sunday afternoon. After the four counseling sessions, one overnight visitation per calendar quarter was substituted for one of the four hour visits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Parents timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">In this Court, Parents raise the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">\u201cI. Whether [FL \u00a7 9-102] is constitutional under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">\u201cII. Whether the lower court unconstitutionally applied [FL \u00a7 9-102] in granting visitation of the minor children to [the] Grandparents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-10\">\u201cIII. Whether the lower court erred in giving greater weight to [the Grandparents\u2019] evidence than [the Parents\u2019].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">Maryland\u2019s first grandparent visitation statute was enacted by Chapter 276 of the Acts of 1981. As amended through Chapter 247 of the Acts of 1991, the statute, then codified as Maryland Code (1984, 1991 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-102 of the Family. Law Article, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-13\">\u201cAt any time after the termination of a marriage by divorce, annulment, or death, an equity court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>\u201c(1) consider a petition for reasonable visitation by a grandparent of a natural or adopted child of the parties whose marriage has been terminated; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">\u201c(2) if the court finds it to be in the best interests of the child, 'grant visitation rights to the grandparent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">By Chapter 252 of the Acts of 1993, FL \u00a7 9-102 was amended to its present form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">\u201cAn equity court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">\u201c(1) consider a petition for reasonable visitation of a grandchild by a grandparent; and \u201c(2) if the court finds it to be in the best interests of the child, grant visitation rights to the grandparent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">In allowing court-ordered visitation where the marriage of the parents is intact, FL \u00a7 9-102 is like the GVSs of other states.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">The Parents argue that FL \u00a7 9-102, on its face, is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Citing <em>Troxel, </em>they contend that the statute is overly broad because it fails to \u201ccontain language that a fit parent is presumed to make decisions in the best interest of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>their [sic ] child and that a court must give special weight to that presumption.\u201d Parents submit that Maryland\u2019s GVS \u201cincorrectly promulgates the \u2018best interest of the child\u2019 standard as the sole standard for determining third-party rights of visitation.\u201d Brief of Appellants at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">It is axiomatic that statutes carry a strong presumption of constitutionality. <em>Edgewood Nursing Home v. Maxwell, </em>282 Md. 422, 427, 384 A.2d 748, 751 (1978); <em>City of Baltimore v. Charles Center Parking, Inc., </em>259 Md. 595, 598, 271 A.2d 144, 145 (1970); <em>Atkinson v. Sapperstein, </em>191 Md. 301, 315, 60 A.2d 737, 742 (1948). Further, statutes \u201cwill be construed so as to avoid a conflict with the Constitution whenever that course is reasonably possible.\u201d <em>In re James D., </em>295 Md. 314, 327, 455 A.2d 966, 972 (1983) (citing <em>Deems v. Western Maryland Ry., </em>247 Md. 95, 113, 231 A.2d 514, 524 (1967)); <em>Williams &amp; Fulwood v. Director, </em>276 Md. 272, 295, 347 A.2d 179, 191 (1975). Moreover, to succeed on a facial challenge, a party \u201cmust establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\u201d <em>United States v. Salerno, </em>481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 2100, 95 L.Ed.2d 697, 707 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Maryland courts have interpreted statutes, broad on their face, to include limitations consistent with the United States Constitution, in an effort to uphold legislative intent to the extent reasonably possible, where the statute is challenged as facially unconstitutional. <em>See Becker v. State, </em>363 Md. 77, 90-92, 767 A.2d 816, 823-24 (2001) (construing a drug nuisance abatement statute which granted authority to order \u201cequitable relief\u201d as not allowing the destruction of a building without providing compensation to the owner, so as to avoid \u201cserious questions\u201d about the statute\u2019s constitutionality); <em>Schochet v.

In doing so, we do not \u201cinferentially manufacture additional components of the statute that do not exist.\u201d <em>Fairbanks, </em>330 Md. at 47, 622 A.2d at 125. In a sense, unsupervised visitation is custody for a very limited time. In <em>Ross v. Pick, </em>199 Md. 341, 351, 86 A.2d 463, 468 (1952), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">\u201cWhere parents claim the custody of a child, there is a <em>prima facie </em>presumption that the child\u2019s welfare will be best subserved in the care and custody of its parents rather than in the custody of others, and the burden is then cast upon the parties opposing them to show the contrary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The rationale for the presumption is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4H\">\u201c \u2018the affection of a parent for a child is as strong and potent as any that springs from human relations and leads to desire and efforts to care properly for and raise the child, which are greater than another would be likely to display.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEA\"><em>Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 178 n. 4, 372 A.2d 582, 587 n. 4 (1977) (quoting <em>Melton v. Connolly, </em>219 Md. 184, 188, 148 A.2d 387, 389 (1959)).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">The seminal case in the Court of Appeals on the construction of Maryland\u2019s GVS is <em>Fairbanks, supra, </em>where the dispute was over the extent of the visitation that the Grandparents should have. The Court held that \u201cGrandparents are not obliged to support their claim by alleging and proving the existence of exceptional circumstances justifying [their] visitation.\u201d 330 Md. at 49, 622 A.2d at 126. Rather, \u201c[t]he outcome ... lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, guided solely by the best interests of the grandchild.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is nothing inconsistent in <em>Fairbanks </em>with application of a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>sumption that the parents\u2019 decision concerning visitation is in the best interest of their child.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Before <em>Troxel </em>was decided, this Court recognized that the United States Constitution, as interpreted in a long line of decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States upholding the fundamental right of parents to rear their children, required that the presumption be applied in visitation cases. <em>See Wolinski v. Browneller, </em>115 Md.App. 285, 693 A.2d 30 (1997). That ease involved a mother\u2019s objection to court-ordered overnight visitation with grandparents where the mother considered daytime visitation to be appropriate. Judge Davis, writing for this Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">\u201cBut proper regard for a parent\u2019s constitutional rights requires that the burden to produce testimony or other evidence discrediting a parent\u2019s proposed visitation schedule be placed upon the grandparents who petition for vested visitation rights. Simply to ignore a parent\u2019s wishes regarding the time his or her child should spend outside the family home, and outside of his or her immediate care and custody, is to trample improperly on the parent\u2019s liberty interest in directing the upbringing of his or her child. Nevertheless, in light of the State\u2019s compelling interest in protecting the child\u2019s welfare and the minimal severity of the intrusion upon parental rights, the presumption in favor of appellant\u2019s schedule may be rebutted by affirmative evidence that the schedule would be detrimental to the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 319, 693 A.2d at 46. The absence of any reference in Maryland\u2019s GVS to a presumption did not impede recognition of the presumption as a constitutional requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">About one month after <em>Troxel </em>was decided, this Court decided <em>Brice v. Brice, </em>133 Md.App. 302, 754 A.2d 1132 (2000). <em>Brice </em>was an appeal by a mother who was aggrieved that the circuit court had ordered grandparent visitation in excess of the schedule that the mother considered to be in the child\u2019s best interest. Finding no distinction between <em>Brice </em>and <em>Troxel, </em>this Court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>A widower, who objected to the extent of court-ordered visitation between his children and their maternal grandmother, appealed in <em>Herrick v. Wain, </em>154 Md.App. 222, 838 A.2d 1263 (2003). The father contended that Maryland\u2019s GVS was unconstitutionally broad and that the trial court had erred by failing to apply the presumption in favor of the father\u2019s decision to limit visitation. This Court affirmed. After reviewing the evidence, we found it sufficient to rebut the presumption that the father\u2019s decision was in the child\u2019s best interest, <em>id. </em>at 240, 838 A.2d at 1273, and that the <em>Fairbanks </em>criteria, see n. 2, <em>supra, </em>\u201censure[d] a proper analysis of a grandparent visitation case beyond that which impermissibly occurred in <em>Troxel.\u201d Id. </em>at 236, 838 A.2d 1263, 838 A.2d at 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The post<em>-Troxel </em>case of <em>In re Tamara R., </em>136 Md.App. 236, 764 A.2d 844 (2000), addressed a parent\u2019s objection, on constitutional grounds, to any court-ordered visitation by his daughter with her siblings. The issue arose in a CI\u00d1A case where a juvenile master recommended sibling visitation. When the father argued on exceptions that he opposed any visitation, and that ordering visitation over his objection would violate his constitutional right to raise his children as he saw fit, the circuit court agreed. This Court reversed and remanded. Alter reviewing <em>Fairbanks, T'roxel, </em>and <em>Wolinski, </em>this Court concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">\u201c[W]e are faced with the issue of whether Mr. R.\u2019s opposition to visitation is entitled to a presumption that denial of visitation is in the best interests of the children over whom he has custody. We think <em>Troxel </em>compels the court to apply a rebuttable presumption in favor of parents who oppose a non-parent\u2019s petition for visitation with their custodial children. <em>See Troxel, </em>120 S.Ct. at 2063-64. By deciding that Mr. R.\u2019s constitutional rights were violated without considering the evidence other than Mr. R.\u2019s opposition to visitation, the trial court effectively created an irrebuttable presumption that visitation was not in the best interests of the children. In doing so, it erred. If there was sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that visitation was in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>children\u2019s best interests, then we must reverse and remand for the court to consider that evidence in making its determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 253-54, 764 A.2d 844, 764 A.2d at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In the Court of Appeals, the <em>pre-Troxel </em>case of <em>Maner v. Stephenson, </em>342 Md. 461, 677 A.2d 560 (1996), involved a petition for grandparent visitation against the wishes of both parents in an intact nuclear family. The trial court, under a best interest analysis, concluded that there should be no visitation. The grandparents contended on appeal that the circuit court had \u201cimproperly deferred\u201d to the parents\u2019 wishes, \u201cthereby imposing a higher burden of proof on the [grandparents].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466, 677 A.2d at 562. The grandparents also contended for a rebuttable presumption that visitation with them was in the grandchildren\u2019s best interests. The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the notion that there was a presumption in favor of grandparental visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">A visitation issue was presented more recently to the Court of Appeals in <em>Fruse v. Barnhart, </em>379 Md. 100, 840 A.2d 114 (2003). The appellant in that case was the mother of three children who had been placed with foster caregivers by the appellant\u2019s mother while appellant was incarcerated. The appellees took two of the children, Brett and Justin. On the appellant\u2019s release, the appellees returned Brett to the appellant, but not Justin. Within days thereafter, the appellees sought court-ordered custody of Brett. The trial court found the appellant to be a fit mother and awarded custody of Brett to her, but, in addition, established certain conditions which the Court of Appeals found to be illegal. Among these was that visitation between Brett and Justin take place at the appellees\u2019 home, without the third child being present. The appellant wanted visitation at her home, with the third child present. In resolution of that, and other more complex issues in the <em>Frase </em>case, the Court of Appeals reviewed <em>Troxel. </em>It considered that the plurality opinion in <em>Troxel </em>applied \u201cthe presumption that fit parents act in the best interest of their children,\u201d so that \u201c \u2018there will normally be no reason for the State to interject itself into the private realm of the family to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent\u2019s children.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123, 840 A.2d 114, 840 A.2d at 127-28 (quoting <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 69, 120 S.Ct. at 2061). The error by the trial court in its visitation order was that \u201c[n]o deference was given to [appellant\u2019s] view.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125, 840 A.2d at 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Following <em>Troxel, </em>some state courts have upheld statutes similar to Maryland\u2019s by judicially grafting the presumption required by <em>Troxel </em>to the statute. See <em>Kansas Dep\u2019t of Soc., Rehabilitation Serus. v. Paillet, </em>270 Kan. 646, 16 P.3d 962, 967-69 (2001) (finding statute unconstitutional as applied because trial court failed to apply a presumption that the fit mother\u2019s decision to withhold visitation was in the best interest of the child); <em>Morgan v. Grzesik, </em>287 A.D.2d 150, 732 N.Y.S.2d 773, 776 (2001) (holding statute facially constitutional because circumstances to be examined under best interest test included the parents\u2019 objection and the extent of the grandparent-grandchild relationship); <em>Harrold v. Collier, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 44, 836 N.E.2d 1165, 1172 (2005) (holding \u201ctrial court misinterpreted <em>Troxel </em>as requiring courts to find \u2018overwhelmingly clear circumstances\u2019 to support forcing visitation for the benefit of the child over the opposition of the parent\u201d); <em>Currey v. Currey, </em>650 N.W.2d 273, 277 (S.D.2002) (placing burden of proof on grandparents so as to avoid unconstitutionality); <em>In re the Paternity of Roger D.H., </em>250 Wis.2d 747, 641 N.W.2d 440, 444-45 (2002) <em>(\u201cTroxel </em>strongly suggests that we may read such a requirement into the statute to save it from facial invalidation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Some states require clear and convincing evidence that visitation is in the child\u2019s best interest to rebut the presumption. <em>See Evans v. McTaggart, </em>88 P.3d 1078, 1090 (Alaska 2004) (remanding to \u201cdetermine by clear and convincing evidence whether it is in the best interests of [the grandchild] that visitation with the [grandparents] be provided\u201d); <em>Vibbert v. Vibbert, </em>144 S.W.3d 292, 295 (Ky.Ct.App.2004) (\u201c[G]randparent[s] seeking visitation must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the requested visitation is in the best interest of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>the child.\u201d). Here, Parents do not contend that there must be an enhanced burden of persuasion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In <em>In re the Interest of T.A., </em>30 Kan.App.2d 30, 38 P.3d 140, 143-44 (2001), the court concluded that, \u201c[a]bsent findings of <em>unreasonableness, </em>a trial court should adopt the grandparent visitation plan proposed by a fit parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">An illustration of statutory language precluding a court from construing a GVS as according special weight to parental opposition to visitation is found in <em>DeRose v. DeRose, </em>469 Mich. 320, 666 N.W.2d 636, 643 (2003). The court reasoned that the text of the statute provided \u201cno indication that the statute requires deference of any sort be paid by a trial court to the decisions fit parents make for their children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">\u201cindicates that the court is only required to make a record of the reasons for its decision in a grandparenting visitation case if visitation is <em>denied. </em>Apparently, if visitation is granted, the trial court need not justify its decision with any factual findings or analysis. Thus, rather than giving any \u2018special weight\u2019 to the determination of a fit parent, the thrust of this provision appears to favor grandparent visitation in the face of a contrary preference by a fit parent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 643 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">In sum, this Court has concluded that the fundamental right of parents to raise their children, as applied to grandparent visitation in <em>Troxel, </em>is honored by a presumption that the parents\u2019 decision is in the best interests of the children. No decision of the Court of Appeals has held that, even after applying that presumption, the GVS infringes in all cases on the constitutional right. Accordingly, we hold that FL \u00a7 9-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>102 is not facially unconstitutional for failure expressly to articulate the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Alternatively, Parents contend that the trial court unconstitutionally applied the GVS because it utilized only a best interest analysis, without first finding that there were exceptional circumstances militating in favor of grandparental visitation. The argument rests almost entirely on <em>McDermott v. Dougherty, </em>385 Md. 320, 869 A.2d 751 (2005). We disagree. Our explanation requires a background review.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\"><em>Fairbanks </em>expressly held that, under FL \u00a7 9-102, \u201c[grandparents are not obliged to support their claim by alleging and proving the existence of exceptional circumstances justifying such visitation.\u201d 330 Md. at 49, 622 A.2d at 126. In so holding, the Court of Appeals disapproved dicta to the contrary in <em>Skeens v. Paterno, </em>60 Md.App. 48, 61, 480 A.2d 820, 826 (1984). <em>Fairbanks, </em>330 Md. at 48, 622 A.2d at 126. This Court, despite having recognized, <em>gre-Troxel, </em>the constitutional foundation of the presumption that parents\u2019 decisions are in children\u2019s best interests, concluded that visitation rights could be awarded to grandparents over the parents\u2019 objections \u201ceven in the absence of exceptional circumstances,\u201d because the intrusion on parental autonomy is minimal. <em>Wolinski, </em>115 Md.App. at 312, 693 A.2d at 43. <em>Herrick, </em>154 Md.App. 222, 838 A.2d 1263, sustained an award of grandparent visitation on a best interest analysis, after applying the presumption in favor of the parental decision, but without requiring the trial court first to have found extraordinary circumstances to rebut the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Parents\u2019 position in the instant case is that <em>McDermott, </em>read in conjunction with <em>Troxel, </em>has overruled <em>Fairbanks, Wolinski, </em>and <em>Herrick </em>by necessary implication. Phrased another way, Parents submit that the GVS is unconstitutionally applied if visitation is awarded contrary to the Parents\u2019 decision, unless the court first finds extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>In <em>McDermott, </em>custody was transferred by the trial court from the child\u2019s father to his maternal grandparents, over the objection of the father. Under the rule of <em>Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 372 A.2d 582 (1977), exceptional circumstances are required to award custody to a third party over the objection of a custodial parent or parents. In <em>Shurupoff, </em>372 Md. 639, 814 A.2d 543, the Court, with one judge concurring only in the result, affirmed the award of custody to grandparents over the objection of the child\u2019s father. The Court in <em>Shurupoff </em>undertook to clarify a sentence in <em>Hoffman </em>where the Court had said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">\u201c \u2018Therefore, in parent-third party disputes over custody, it is only upon a determination by the equity court that the parent is unfit or that there are exceptional circumstances which make custody in the parent detrimental to the best interest of the child, that the court need inquire into the best interest of the child in order to make a proper custodial disposition.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\"><em>Shurupoff </em>372 Md. at 661, 814 A.2d at 557 (quoting <em>Hoffman, </em>280 Md. at 179, 372 A.2d at 587). The <em>Shurupoff </em>Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u201c[t]he last sentence that we quoted from <em>[Hoffman </em>] was simply intended to make clear that, because of the presumption, a parent and a third party do not stand on an equal footing, and that, before the third party may be granted custody, he or she must rebut the presumption in one of the manners indicated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 662, 814 A.2d at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">The Court revisited that aspect of <em>Shurupoff in McDermott. </em>There, in a 112 page opinion, the Court reviewed cases from throughout the country with the view of determining whether a finding of exceptional circumstances was a threshold requirement before applying a best interest analysis, in determining whether custody could be transferred from a fit parent to a third party in a private custody dispute. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>concluded that was the majority view and applied it to the facts in <em>McDermott.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Specifically, the Court in <em>McDermott </em>held the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">\u201cIn respect to third-party custody disputes, we shall adopt for Maryland, if we have not already done so, the majority position. In the balancing of court-created or statutorily-created \u2018standards,\u2019 such as \u2018the best interest of the child\u2019 test, with fundamental constitutional rights, in private custody actions involving private third-parties where the parents are fit, absent extraordinary (ie., exceptional) circumstances, the constitutional right is the ultimate determinative factor; and only if the parents are unfit or extraordinary circumstances exist is the \u2018best interest of the child\u2019 test to be considered, any contrary comment in <em>Shurupoff, </em>or other of our cases, notwithstanding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">385 Md. at 418-19, 869 A.2d at 808-09. The Court concluded that the periodic absences from the state by the father, due to his occupation as a merchant seaman, did not constitute extraordinary circumstances, where the father had arranged suitable and safe alternative care for the child during those absences.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The <em>McDermott </em>Court did not limit its review, however, exclusively to cases dealing with custody disputes between fit parents and third parties. <em>Troxel </em>was reviewed, 385 Md. at 349, 869 A.2d at 767-68, as part of a restatement of Supreme Court decisions dealing with the constitutional right of parents to raise their children. Also interspersed among state court decisions discussed in <em>McDermott </em>are five visitation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\"><em>McDermott, </em>385 Md. at 383-84, 869 A.2d at 788, cited <em>Rideout v. Riendeau, </em>761 A.2d 291 (Me.2000), a post <em>-Troxel </em>case in which the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine sustained the constitutionality, as applied, of that state\u2019s GVS. <em>McDermott </em>emphasized the <em>Rideout </em>court\u2019s statement that \u201cthe best interests of the child standard, standing alone, is an insufficient standard for determining when the state may intervene in the decision making of competent parents.\u201d <em>McDermott, </em>385 Md. at 383, 869 A.2d at 788 (quoting <em>Rideout, </em>761 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>297) (italics omitted). The <em>Rideout court </em>approved visitation in that case largely because the petitioning grandparents had acted as parents for the children for a number of years and because the statute required that the trial court give consideration to the parents\u2019 objection to visitation, \u201cthus preventing the court from intervening in a fit parent\u2019s decision[-]making simply on a best interests basis.\u201d 761 A.2d at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\"><em>Hoff v. Berg, </em>595 N.W.2d 285 (N.D.1999), a <em>pre-Troxel </em>case, is cited in <em>McDermott, </em>385 Md. at 395-96, 869 A.2d at 795. There, the Supreme Court of North Dakota held that state\u2019s GVS to be facially unconstitutional because it expressly required that visitation rights be awarded to grandparents of an unmarried minor unless the trial court found that visitation would not be in the best interest of the minor. This shifting of the burden of proof violated the parents\u2019 fundamental liberty interest. 595 N.W.2d at 291-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\"><em>McDermott, </em>385 Md. at 412-13, 869 A.2d at 805, cites <em>Griffin v.

Williams, </em>256 Va. 19, 501 S.E.2d 417 (1998), a decision in which the Virginia Supreme Court held that \u201c'a court must find an actual harm to the child\u2019s health or welfare without such visitation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418 (citing <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>24 Va.App. 778, 485 S.E.2d 651, 654 (1997)). <em>Williams </em>was cited by the plurality in <em>Troxel </em>as an obvious counterbalance to Maryland\u2019s <em>Fairbanks, </em>in that portion of the opinion where the United States Supreme Court found it unnecessary to decide whether a finding of harm constitutionally was required \u201cas a condition precedent to granting visitation.\u201d <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 73, 120 S.Ct. at 2064.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">A pre-Troxel grandparents\u2019 visitation decision, <em>Beagle v.

Parkerson, </em>265 Ga. 189, 454 S.E.2d 769 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 942,116 S.Ct. 377, 133 L.Ed.2d 301 (1995). The Georgia GVS in part provided that \u201c \u2018the court may grant any grandparent of the child reasonable visitation rights upon proof of special circumstances which make such visitation rights necessary to the best interests of the child.\u2019 \u201d 454 S.E.2d at 771. The court invalidated this statute under both the Fourteenth Amendment and the due process clause of the Georgia Constitution. There was \u201cinsufficient evidence that supports the proposition that grandparents\u2019 visitation with their grandchildren always promotes the children\u2019s health or welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 773. Further, the \u201cstate may only impose that visitation over the parents\u2019 objections on a showing that failing to do so would be harmful to the child.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Other grandparent visitation cases requiring a showing of harm to the child in order to rebut the presumption that the parents\u2019 decision is in the child\u2019s best interest are <em>In the Matter of R. A. &amp; T.A, </em>121 P.3d 295, 299 (Colo.App.2005), <em>cert. granted </em>by Colorado Supreme Court; <em>Roth v. Weston, </em>259 Conn. 202, 789 A.2d 431, 450 (2002); <em>Crockett v. Pastore, </em>259 Conn. 240, 789 A.2d 453, 457 (2002) (requiring, in addition to real and significant harm to child, a parent-like relationship between grandparent and grandchild); <em>Moriarty v. Bradt, </em>177 N.J. 84, 827 A.2d 203, 222 (2003); and <em>Camburn v. Smith, </em>355 S.C. 574, 586 S.E.2d 565, 568 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In <em>Moriarty, </em>the court explained what it meant by \u201charm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>\u201cThus, in every case in which visitation is denied, the grandparents bear the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that visitation is necessary to avoid harm to the child. The grandparents\u2019 evidence can be expert or factual. For example, they may rely on the death of a parent or the breakup of the child\u2019s home through divorce or separation.... In addition, the termination of a longstanding relationship between the grandparents and the child, with expert testimony assessing the effect of those circumstances, could form the basis for a finding of harm. <em>See, e.g., Roth, </em>789 A.2d at 445 (noting that proof of substantial, emotional ties between child and nonparent could result in harm to child if contact with that person is denied or curtailed); <em>Blixt </em>[v. <em>Blixt], </em>[437 Mass. 649], 774 N.E.2d [1052] 1060 [(2002)] (observing that \u2018[t]he requirement of significant harm presupposes proof of a showing of a significant preexisting relationship between the grandparent and the child\u2019). &gt;The possibilities are as varied as the factual scenarios presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">\u201cIf the court agrees that the potential for harm has been shown, the presumption in favor of parental decision making will be deemed overcome. At that point, the parent must offer a visitation schedule. If the grandparents are satisfied, that will be the end of the inquiry. If not, a second step will be undertaken\u2014an assessment of the schedule. The presumption in favor of parental decision making having been overcome, the court should approve a schedule that it finds is in the child\u2019s best interest^]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">827 A.2d at 223-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\"><em>Post-Troxel, </em>grandparent visitation cases which do not require a showing of harm to the child include <em>Vibbert, 144 </em>S.W.3d 292 (overruling prior decision requiring harm and holding constitutionally sufficient presumption that fit parents\u2019 decision is in child\u2019s best interest, coupled with clear and convincing evidence standard); <em>Zeman v. Stanford, </em>789 So.2d 798, 804 (Miss.2001) (holding that multiple factors in best interest analysis, including \u201c \u2018willingness of the grandparents to accept that the rearing of the child is the responsibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the parent,\u2019 \u201d ensured that parental fundamental right would not be infringed); <em>Morgan, </em>287 A.D.2d 150, 732 N.Y.S.2d 773, 778 (holding that giving parents\u2019 \u201cdecision some presumptive or \u2018special\u2019 weight, ... is all that <em>Troxel </em>requires\u201d); <em>Harold, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 44, 836 N.E.2d 1165, 1172 (holding statutorily enumerated, <em>Fairbanks-like </em>factors placed on grandparents \u201cthe burden of proving that visitation would be in the best interest of [the child], thereby honoring the traditional presumption that a fit parent acts in the best interest of his or her child\u201d); <em>In re Paternity of Roger D.H., </em>250 Wis.2d 747, 641 N.W.2d 440 (best interest test with presumption, held constitutional); <em>Brandon L. v.

Indeed, in a footnote responding to the concurring opinion, the majority in <em>McDermott </em>stated: \u201cThe Court has gone to great lengths to affirm that the present opinion is limited to the context of attempts by pure third parties to gain custody over the children of others.\u201d 385 Md. at 435-36 n. 49, 869 A.2d at 819 n. 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">\u2014A holding concerning custody (McDermott) is not a directly controlling precedent concerning visitation (Fairbanks) because the intrusions on parental rights are not comparable. \u201c[T]he respective proceedings for termination of parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>rights/adoption, custody, and visitation vary greatly in their degree of intrusiveness upon the liberty interests of the parents involved.\u201d <em>Wolinski, </em>115 Md.App. at 305, 693 A.2d at 39. \u201c[I]n light of the much lesser intrusion on parental rights of a modifiable custody order than a permanent TPR order, the private interest of the parent becomes far less \u2018commanding\u2019 than that which exists in TPR eases.\u201d <em>Shurupoff, </em>372 Md. at 658, 814 A.2d at 555. Moving down the scale of values, \u201c[visitation is a considerably less weighty matter than outright custody of a child[.]\u201d <em>Fairbanks, </em>330 Md. at 48, 622 A.2d at 126. When fully implemented after counseling, the visitation order in the case before us places the Children with the Grandparents approximately one percent of the time in a calendar quarter.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\u2014We cannot purport to justify declaring, based on <em>Troxel, </em>that <em>Fairbanks </em>is no longer the law of Maryland when <em>Troxel </em>expressly declined to decide whether harm is a prerequisite to awarding visitation to grandparents over parental objection, and the Supreme Court cited <em>Fairbanks </em>as illustrative of one of the modes of analysis for determining visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">\u2014Absent justification based on directly controlling Supreme Court authority, it is not, jurisprudentially, the function of a state intermediate appellate court to anticipate rulings by the United States Supreme Court in order to declare a decision of the state supreme court overruled by higher authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">\u2014It is not, jurisprudentially, the function of a state intermediate appellate court to declare a precedent of the state supreme court (Fairbanks) impliedly overruled by a later decision of the state supreme court (McDermott) that is not a direct precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Parents\u2019 remaining contention is that the circuit court misapplied the presumption. They submit that, \u201c[b]y using the best interest of the child standard to' rebut the presumption, the lower court placed itself on equal footing with [the Parents].\u201d Brief of Appellants at 19. Much the same argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>ment is advanced when Parents assert that the circuit court gave \u201cgreater weight to the ... evidence of the [Grandparents] than that of the [Parents].\u201d Brief of Appellants at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The question presented is directed to the weight of the presumption. \u201c \u2018[A] parent\u2019s right to direct his or her child\u2019s upbringing is not absolute. Rather, Due Process analysis requires the delicate balancing of all of the competing interests involved in the litigation.\u2019 \u201c <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 569, 819 A.2d 1030, 1041 (2003) (quoting <em>Wolinski, </em>115 Md.App. at 300, 693 A.2d at 37). A parent\u2019s fundamental interest in raising a child \u201cis not absolute and does not exclude other important considerations.\u201d <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 705, 782 A.2d 332, 343 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The presumption with which we are concerned here is an evidentiary presumption. In the instant matter, the Parents\u2019 fitness is not disputed. That fact gives rise to the presumption that the Parents\u2019 decision that there be no contact whatsoever between Grandparents and Children was \u201cin the best interests of their children.\u201d <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 68, 120 S.Ct. at 2061. Because, in the context of child rearing, the presumption operates to protect a fundamental constitutional right, the court reviewing a fit parent\u2019s decision concerning visitation \u201cmust accord at least some special weight to the parent\u2019s own determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 120 S.Ct. at 2062.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Here, Grandparents produced sufficient evidence from which the court found that the Children \u201cwere part of the Hainings\u2019 life on a fairly regular basis[.]\u201d The Children \u201cdid definitely benefit from that relationship.\u201d The court further found the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">\u201cI understand that there\u2019s a lot of baggage that goes along with this family dating back to when Mrs. Koshko was a teenager or even earlier than that. However, the evidence has proven to this Court that in terms of the relationship with the grandchildren, I think efforts were made by both sides to their credit to keep some of that baggage in the background and foster a relationship with the grandchil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>dren, and I think that was done to the credit of both parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The Grandparents further proved, and the court found, that that relationship stopped, \u201cclearly because of a deterioration in the relationship between the Hainings and the Koshkos unfortunately over this incident in October.\u201d The Hainings also proved, and the court found, that the relationship between them and the Children \u201cstopped abruptly,\u201d but the Parents did not stop it \u201cbecause of anything relating to the Children[.]\u201d Thus, there was sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Parents could have decided, tactically, at the end of the Grandparents\u2019 case, to rest entirely on the presumption, but they chose to put on a case. The principal witness for the Parents was Andrea, whose testimony extends over approximately 145 pages of transcript. At the conclusion of Andrea\u2019s examinations by counsel, the court asked her some questions, one of which was why it was her position that \u201cit was in the best interest of their children not to ever see their grandparents again.\u201d In its oral opinion, the circuit court referred to Andrea\u2019s response, commenting that it \u201cheard nothing\u201d as to how the complete termination of visitation was in the best interests of the Children. The court also said that Andrea\u2019s response \u201cwas not persuasive.\u201d Parents point to these statements in the orai opinion as evidencing that the circuit court improperly shifted the burden to Parents to prove that termination of visitation was in the best interests of the Children. We think not. As the circuit court clearly stated, the Grandparents had already produced sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption, and the court\u2019s questioning was an obvious effort to give Parents a final opportunity to bolster the rebutted presumption for purposes of the weighing process on best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The circuit court permissibly reached a best interest analysis and did not abuse its discretion in performing that analysis or in the extent of visitation ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>For all the foregoing reasons, we shall affirm.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.
