A majority of the Judges in regular active service have not voted in favor of the suggestion. On consideration of the foregoing, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b172-16\">ORDERED by the Court <em>en banc </em>that Appellee\u2019s suggestion is denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b172-17\">Circuit Judges WILKEY, GINSBURG, BORK, SCALIA and STARR would grant the suggestion for rehearing <em>en banc. </em>A statement by Circuit Judge SCALIA, joined by Circuit Judges WILKEY, BORK and STARR, is attached.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b172-18\">Circuit Judge EDWARDS abstains.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b172-19\">Statement on the denial of rehearing <em>en banc, </em>filed by Circuit Judge SCALIA, in which Circuit Judges WILKEY, BORK and STARR concur.</judges>\n<author id=\"b172-20\">SCALIA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b172-21\">For the reasons stated in my dissent from the panel opinion, I believe that opinion to be in error, both with regard to the scope of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s jurisdiction, and with regard to the issue whether the decision that the court took upon itself was \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law\u201d within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2) (1982). Both issues seem to me of sufficient significance and of sufficiently general application to warrant the attention of the full court. Especially the latter, however, which bears upon the enforcement authority of all federal agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-22\">The panel\u2019s determination that there exists a \u201cgeneral presumption of reviewability\u201d of enforcement decisions distorts the law and usurps the authority of the Executive Branch. It is particularly worth the attention of the full court because it rests upon a novel interpretation of Supreme Court precedent that has now appeared in several of our panel opinions. The Supreme Court has said that action is to be deemed \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law\u201d when the governing statute is \u201cdrawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 410, 91 S.Ct. 814, 820, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971), <em>quoting from </em>S.Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. 26 (1945). The panel opinion renders this guidance quite literally meaningless by asserting that \u201cwhether there is law to apply turns on such pragmatic considerations as whether judicial supervision is necessary to safeguard plaintiffs\u2019 interests, whether judicial review will unnecessarily impede the agency in effectively carrying out its congressionally assigned role, and whether the issues are appropriate for judicial review.\u201d 718 F.2d 1174 at 1185, <em>citing Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. SEC, </em>606 F.2d 1031, 1043-44 (D.C.Cir.1979). The same test has been applied by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Circuit to sustain review in <em>Falkowski v. EEOC, </em>719 F.2d 470, 480 n. 16 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>Local 1219, American Federation of Government Employees v. Donovan, </em>683 F.2d 511, 515 (D.C.Cir.1982); and <em>WWHT, Inc. v. FCC, </em>656 F.2d 807, 816 (D.C.Cir.1981); and has been purportedly followed by other Circuits (though in denying review) in <em>Tuepker v. FHA, </em>708 F.2d 1329, 1332 (8th Cir.1983); and <em>Sinai Hospital v. Horvitz, </em>621 F.2d 1267, 1270 (4th Cir.1980). This seems to me not an application of the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance, but the substitution of an entirely different test \u2014 which can be summarized by saying that we intervene when we think it a good idea. The recited \u201cpragmatic considerations\u201d bear no rational relationship to \u201cwhether there is law to apply.\u201d One could with equivalent logic recite them as the definition of \u201cinjury in fact\u201d \u2014 or of almost any other concept that needs evisceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Because of the importance of this issue in particular, I note my dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
