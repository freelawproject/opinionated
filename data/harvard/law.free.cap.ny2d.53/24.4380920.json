As matters of fact and law, the documents signed by the Walkers did not shift to them the monetary consequences of Morgan\u2019s and Union Camp\u2019s errors. <em>(Gross v Sweet, </em>49 NY2d 102; <em>Hertzog v Harrison Is.

III. The \u201ccircularity\u201d theory urged by Morgan and rejected by the court below does not create any liability on Walker. <em>(Boll v Sharp &amp; Dohme, </em>281 App Div 568, 307 NY 646; <em>Saladino v Stuyvesant Ins.

Also presented for our consideration is the question whether an indemnitor is obligated to reimburse an indemnitee for losses occasioned by the indemnitee\u2019s own failure to act within a reasonable time in order to mitigate damages. We conclude that both questions should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In 1970, Ms. Helen Walker acquired 1,140 shares in Union Camp Corporation. Although she transferred the certificates representing these shares approximately one month after she acquired them, the transfer, for some reason, was never recorded by the corporation or its transfer agent, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company (Morgan). As a consequence, Ms. Walker continued to receive dividends from Union Camp. Her son, Alexander Walker, Jr., who knew she was receiving these dividends but was apparently unaware of the transfer, attempted to locate the corresponding stock certificates among his mother\u2019s personal effects. When he was unable to do so, he suggested to his mother that she ask the corporation to issue duplicate certificates evidencing her ownership of the shares. The record does not make clear whether Ms. Walker remembered at this point that she had earlier transferred the shares, but, in any event, she acquiesced in her son\u2019s suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>The corporation\u2019s transfer agent agreed to the issuance of duplicate stock certificates, but insisted that Ms. Walker execute an instrument attesting to the fact that she had not sold or transferred the original certificates and, further, that she had conducted a diligent search for the originals before applying for duplicates. The instrument also provided that Ms. Walker would indemnify Union Camp Corporation and Morgan against \u201cany and all liabilities, loss, damage or expense in connection with, or arising out of their compliance with [her request for duplicate certificates]\u201d. Finally, the instrument stated that Ms. Walker\u2019s obligation to indemnify Union Camp and Morgan would be secured by a \u201cblanket bond\u201d issued by Federal Insurance Company (Federal), under which Federal was to \u201cdefend, indemnify and save harmless Assured [Morgan Guaranty and Union Camp] from and against any and all * * * liabilities, damages, costs * * * and other expenses of every nature * * * by reason of the Original Instrument and/or the issuance of * * * duplicates * * * whether or not caused by, based upon, or arising out of inadvertence, accident, oversight or neglect on the part of Assured\u201d. In exchange for its agreement to assume this obligation, Federal demanded that both Ms. Walker and her son execute another agreement indemnifying it \u201cagainst any and all loss, damage [and] expense * * * which it shall at any time incur by reason of its [undertaking] \u201d. The net result of these interlocking indemnity agreements was that Union Camp and Morgan were indemnified against loss by Federal and Ms. Walker, and Federal, in turn, was indemnified against loss by Ms. Walker and her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Following the execution of the various indemnity agreements, Morgan issued duplicate stock certificates to Ms. Walker. Shortly thereafter, she sold the shares represented by the duplicate certificates for the sum of $52,800. Approximately two years later, in September of 1975, an audit was conducted and it was discovered that Ms. Walker\u2019s original stock certificates had been transferred by her in 1970. This revelation led Union Camp and Morgan to become concerned about an \u201coverissuance\u201d of Union Camp stock resulting from the issuance of the duplicate certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>cates. Morgan promptly notified Federal of the problem, and Federal then made a demand upon its indemnitors, the Walkers, to replace the overissued shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Ms. Walker\u2019s son, who was at this point administering his deceased mother\u2019s estate, asked Federal to refrain from taking any action while his attorney evaluated the situation. Settlement negotiations ensued, but by February of 1976 it became apparent that Walker was not prepared to make an offer that would be acceptable to the other parties. It was not until August of 1976, however, that Union Camp and Morgan moved to remedy the \u201coverissuance\u201d problem by purchasing replacement shares on the open market. By this time, the common stock of Union Camp had \u201csplit\u201d three for two, and, as a consequence, the cost of replacement had risen to $108,515.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Pursuant to its blanket indemnity bond, Federal paid Union Camp\u2019s and Morgan\u2019s claim for the cost of replacement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It then commenced an action against Alexander Walker, Jr., and Ms. Walker\u2019s estate for reimbursement. Walker, acting on his own behalf and on behalf of the estate, impleaded Union Camp and Morgan on the theory that their negligence in failing to record the original 1970 transfer was, at least in part, the proximate cause of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Prior to trial, Federal moved for summary judgment against Walker and the estate. Third-party defendants Union Camp and Morgan then moved for summary judgment dismissing the third-party negligence complaint on the ground that the various indemnity agreements insulated them from liability to the Walkers. Special Term agreed with the contentions of the third-party defendants and dismissed the third-party complaint as requested. The court, however, declined to grant summary judgment to plaintiff Federal for the full amount demanded in its complaint. Instead, the court awarded Federal $52,800, the amount realized by Ms. Walker when she sold the duplicate shares in 1973, and held that the remainder of Federal\u2019s claim should be resolved in a plenary trial. The Appellate Division, however, modified the order of Special Term. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Appellate Division first concluded that the indemnity agreements did not present a bar to a third-party negligence action against Union Camp and Morgan. Additionally, the court held that Federal was entitled to summary judgment in the full amount demanded in its complaint. Following the entry of the order by the Appellate Division, defendant Walker appealed as of right from the modification by which he and the estate of his deceased mother were aggrieved (CPLR 5601, subd [a], par [iii]). Third-party defendant Union Camp and Morgan also appealed pursuant to leave granted by the Appellate Division, and that court also certified the following question of law: \u201cWas the order of this Court, insofar as it denied the third-party defendants-respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment dismissing the third-party complaint, properly made?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Turning first to the contentions of the third-party defendants, we conclude that there was no error in the Appellate Division\u2019s decision to reinstate the third-party negligence complaint. The third-party defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss this complaint was based upon the existence of the interlocking indemnity agreements, which, it was claimed, rendered the third-party defendants immune from liability in negligence to Walker and the decedent whose estate Walker represents. A careful analysis of the relationships created by the various indemnity agreements, however, belies this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The decedent, Ms. Walker, agreed \u201cto indemnify and protect [the third-party defendants] from any and all liabilities, loss, damage or expense in connection with, or arising out of [their issuance of duplicate stock certificates] \u201d. These words of indemnification merely established the decedent\u2019s obligation to hold harmless the third-party defendants in the event that they were held liable to some stranger to the transaction as a result of their decision to issue duplicate stock certificates. As such, the agreement simply represented an allocation of the risk of liability among <em>the several </em>contracting parties (see <em>Hogeland v Sibley, Lindsay &amp; Curr Co., </em>42 NY2d 153,158). Nothing in the language of the agreement, however, indicates an intention on the part of the decedent to waive her own rights against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>the third-party defendants or to exonerate them from direct liability to her for pecuniary injuries resulting from their negligence (compare <em>Gross v Sweet, </em>49 NY2d 102, with <em>Hogeland v Sibley, Lindsay &amp; Curr Co., supra, </em>and <em>Levine v Shell Oil Co., </em>28 NY2d 205). Thus, the indemnity agreement executed by Ms. Walker cannot legitimately be invoked by the third-party defendants as a defense to the negligence claim brought on behalf of her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Similarly, the third-party defendants cannot rely upon any of the various indemnity agreements as a defense to the negligence claim asserted by defendant Alexander Walker, Jr., in his individual capacity. Walker was not a party to the indemnity agreement between the decedent and the third-party defendants. Instead, he agreed only to indemnify plaintiff Federal, the surety, from loss in the event that Federal was obliged to reimburse the third-party defendants for claims made against them. Inasmuch as Walker\u2019s obligations under the lone indemnity agreement he signed ran solely to Federal, the agreement cannot be used by the third-party defendants to defeat Walker\u2019s individual claim against them. Thus, the Appellate Division acted correctly in refusing to dismiss the third-party complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">We cannot approve, however, that portion of the Appellate Division decision which granted summary judgment to plaintiff surety, Federal, in the full amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>demanded in its complaint ($114,842.25). The parties discovered in September of 1975 that the original stock certificates, which were previously thought to have been lost, had actually been transferred in 1970 by the decedent. Yet, no efforts were made to correct the apparent over-issuance of shares until August of 1976, when Union Camp and Morgan purchased an equivalent number of shares on the open market and then obtained reimbursement from the surety. By that time, the price of the shares had risen dramatically above the price that the corporation would have had to pay had it entered the market promptly in September of 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Defendant Walker does not dispute that both he and the decedent\u2019s estate are obligated to reimburse Federal by virtue of the separate indemnity agreements that were executed in the surety\u2019s favor. He does, however, contend that he should not be held liable for the entire amount which was ultimately paid for the shares ($108,515.25), since the third-party defendants waited nearly a year after the over-issuance was discovered before entering the market in an effort to \u201ccover\u201d. Asserting that this delay was unreasonable under the circumstances, defendant Walker argues that the increase in price which was attributable to the delay should be absorbed either by the third-party defendants or by the surety, which failed to challenge the amount of reimbursement demanded by Union Camp and Morgan.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">We agree with defendant Walker\u2019s contention that, under the circumstances of this case, neither he nor the decedent\u2019s estate should be required to reimburse Federal for those expenses that are attributable to any \u201cunreasonable\u201d delay by the parties in correcting the overissuance problem. The surety agreed to reimburse the third-party defendants for any loss they might reasonably sustain by virtue of the issuance of the duplicate stock certificates. The surety was not, however, obliged to remunerate the third-party defendants for losses occasioned strictly by their own failure to take remedial measures within a reasonable period of time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similarly, although defendant Walker and decedent had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>agreed to indemnify Federal in the event it was obliged to pay the third-party defendants, neither Walker nor the decedent\u2019s estate should be required to reimburse the surety for any portion of its payment which represented the loss arising from the third-party defendants\u2019 lack of diligence. Indeed, a contrary result would be particularly inequitable in this case, since Federal was fully aware of and, in fact, acquiesced in the third-party defendants\u2019 decision to postpone corrective action. Under such circumstances, Federal should not be permitted to pass on any unnecessary loss resulting from delay to defendant Walker.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Whether any portion of the third-party defendants\u2019 11-month delay in \u201ccovering\u201d was unreasonable, however, remains an open question. As the Appellate Division noted, the third-party defendants\u2019 failure to act promptly may have been attributable, at least in part, to the settlement negotiations which had been initiated by defendant Walker. On the other hand, there may be some question as to whether it was reasonable for the third-party defendants to postpone the purchase of substitute shares on the strength of these negotiations. Moreover, the third-party defendants have not offered any explanation as to why they failed to act between February of 1976, when the settlement negotiations apparently broke down, and August of that year, when they finally entered the market to purchase substitute shares. Under these circumstances, the question of the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the delay is one that can only be resolved by the trier of fact after a plenary trial on the issue. Inasmuch as defendant Walker does not dispute that he is liable to plaintiff surety for at least $52,800, the amount for which the duplicate certificates were sold in 1973, the case should be remitted for a trial on the question of the remaining dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>ages, if any, due to Federal on its first and second causes of action as well as on the question of the third-party defendants\u2019 liability to Walker on the negligence causes of action asserted in the third-party complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Accordingly, on the appeal by the third-party defendants, the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be affirmed, with costs, and the question certified answered in the affirmative. On the appeal by defendant third-party plaintiff Walker, the oder of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be modified, with costs, and the case remitted for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein and, as modified, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-8\">. Federal also paid $6,327 to Morgan as reimbursement for overpaid dividends resulting from the issuance of the duplicate stock certificates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b73-7\">. We recognize that our decision permitting the third-party complaint to stand will create a theoretical \u201cdaisy chain\u201d of sorts, since if defendant Walker is permitted to recover in negligence from the third-party defendants, the latter would presumably have a second claim for indemnification against plaintiff surety, Federal. And, if such a claim were asserted, Federal, in turn, could theoretically assert a claim for indemnification against defendant Walker on the basis of his agreement to hold it harmless against loss. That the potential for this type of circular litigation exists, however, does not provide a basis for dismissing the third-party complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The only issue before this court on the third-party defendants\u2019 appeal is whether any of the various indemnity agreements signed by the parties constitute a complete defense to the third-party negligence claim. Thus, the possibility that the parties may assert rights in the future which would have the effect of depriving defendant Walker of the fruits of his victory (assuming he is ultimately successful) need not concern us. While the parties may find some unwanted irony in their present situation, it must be recognized that it was they and not the courts who created the danger of \u201cround-robin\u201d recoveries through their interlocking indemnity agreements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\">. The dissenter\u2019s suggestion to the contrary would lead to an implausible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>and unacceptable result. Under the dissenter\u2019s view, the indemnitee would be in a position to unilaterally increase the indemnitor\u2019s liability by simply sitting back and refusing to take reasonable steps to cover its loss. As time passed, the cost of \u201ccovering\u201d could escalate and, as a consequence, the indemnitor\u2019s obligation would spiral. Indeed, unless some durational limit is placed upon the indemnitee\u2019s freedom to act, there is nothing to prevent the indemnitee from willfully multiplying the indemnitor\u2019s loss, since there would be no incentive for the indemnitee to act in an economically reasonable manner. The economic waste which would result in situations such as this is alone sufficient reason to reject the approach urged by the dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b76-6\">Jasen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay\">(dissenting in part). I agree with the majority that the third-party defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss defendant Walker\u2019s third-party negligence complaint was properly denied. The provisions of the decedent\u2019s agreement do not evince an unmistakable intent to allow indemnification for the third-party defendants\u2019 own negligence which can be \u201cclearly implied from the language and purposes of the entire agreement, and the surrounding facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>(Margolin v New York Life Ins. Co., </em>32 NY2d <em>149,153; </em>see <em>Levine v Shell Oil Co., </em>28 NY2d 205.) I cannot join, however, in the majority\u2019s disposition of defendant Walker\u2019s appeal. In my view, based on the clear and unambiguous language of the agreements involved herein, the plaintiff surety properly was awarded summary judgment against defendant Walker and the decedent\u2019s estate for the full amount demanded in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">In order to induce the plaintiff surety to assume liability for the replacement shares under its blanket bond, both defendant Walker and the decedent executed indemnification agreements for the benefit of the surety. The decedent\u2019s agreement provided that she would \u201cindemnify and protect [the plaintiff surety] * * * from any and all liabilities, loss, damage or expense in connection with, or arising out of\u201d the surety\u2019s assumption of liability for the replacement shares under its blanket bond with the third-party defendants. Similarly, defendant Walker executed a personal agreement which provided that he would \u201cindemnify and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>save harmless [the plaintiff surety] from and against any and all loss, damage, expense and attorneys\u2019 fees which it shall at any time incur by reason of * * * assuming liability for the issuance of [the replacement shares] under the said Blanket Lost Original Instrument Bond, or its payment of any claim or liability thereunder.\u201d In short, the Walkers clearly agreed to indemnify the plaintiff surety for <em>any </em>loss it might sustain as a result of assuming liability under its blanket bond for the replacement shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The blanket bond specifically obligated the plaintiff surety to: \u201cdefend, indemnify and save harmless [the third-party defendants] from and against any all liabilities, losses, damages, costs, charges, counsel fees and other expenses of every nature and character by reason of the Original Instrument and/or the issuance of a duplicate or duplicates in lieu thereof * * * whether or not caused by, based upon, or arising out of inadvertence, accident, oversight or neglect on the part of [the third-party defendants] or any of them, or their respective officers, agents, clerks, or employees\u201d. The blanket bond further provided that the plaintiff surety\u2019s obligation to the third-party defendants would accrue \u201con demand\u201d and that this liability was \u201cabsolute and unconditional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Notwithstanding the clear and all-embrasive language of these agreements, the majority concludes that the plaintiff surety is not entitled to recover from the Walkers the full amount it has paid to the third-party defendants as a result of the loss occasioned by the issuance of the replacement shares. In the face of a provision which imposes liability on the plaintiff surety for \u201cany and all\u201d losses, the majority concludes that the surety only was obligated to reimburse the third-party defendants for losses they might \u201creasonably sustain\u201d due to the issuance of the duplicate stock. Moreover, according to the majority, the plaintiff surety was not \u201cobliged to remunerate the third-party defendants for losses occasioned strictly by their own failure to take remedial measures within a reasonable period of time.\u201d Yet, the blanket bond expressly required the surety to indemnify the third-party defendants even for losses occasioned by their own \u201cinadvertence, accident, oversight or neglect\u201d in issuing the duplicate certificates. I simply cannot join in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>such creative judicial interpretation which engrafts language onto the clear provisions of the agreements and imposes conditions where the contracting parties have seen fit not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The indemnification agreements executed by the Walkers require that they reimburse the plaintiff surety for any and all loss which it might suffer in connection with assuming liability for the replacement shares under its bond of indemnity issued.in favor of the third-party defendants. This assumption of liability by the plaintiff surety under its blanket bond, which was specifically requested by the Walkers, obligated the surety to reimburse the third-party defendants \u201con demand\u201d. Furthermore, this obligation on the surety\u2019s part was without qualification and, contrary to the majority\u2019s view, without regard to any \u201clack of diligence\u201d by the third-party defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">By virtue of its undertaking, the plaintiff surety was required and did make payment to the third-party defendants for the loss arising out of the issuance of the duplicate stock certificates. In paying this claim, the surety performed its contractual obligation in accordance with the express terms of its bond. That being the case, the plaintiff surety is entitled to reimbursement from defendant Walker and the decedent\u2019s estate for the full amount demanded in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">For these reasons, I would affirm the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jones, Wachtler and Fuchsberg concur with Judge Gabrielli; Judge Jasen dissents in part and votes to affirm in all respects in a separate opinion; Judge Meyer taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">On appeal by third-party defendants: Order, insofar as appealed from, affirmed, with costs. Question certified answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">On appeal by defendant and third-party plaintiff Walker : Order, insofar as appealed from, modified, with costs, and case remitted to Supreme Court, New York County, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
