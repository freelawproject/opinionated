Defendant\u2019s conviction of the crime of assault in the first degree must be reversed because defendant\u2019s rubber boots did not increase the danger to the victim. <em>(People v Cwikla, </em>60 AD2d 40, 46 NY2d 434; <em>People v Davis, </em>65 AD2d 515; <em>People v Rumaner, </em>45 AD2d 290; <em>People v France, </em>57 AD2d 432; <em>Matter of Taylor, </em>62 Misc 2d 529; <em>People v Klosis, </em>48 AD2d 705.) II. Defendant\u2019s conviction of the crime of assault in the first degree must be reversed because there is no evidence that the rubber boots of defendant produced the victim\u2019s injury. III. The court\u2019s charge failed to adequately instruct the jury to make an independent finding that the rubber overshoes worn by defendant were dangerous instruments.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-10\"><em>Sol Greenberg, District Attorney (F.

II. The evidence was sufficient as a matter of law for the jury to find that the victim\u2019s injuries were caused by defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>kicking and stomping on her face and head with his boots. III. The trial court\u2019s charge to the jury was proper. <em>(People v Robinson, </em>36 NY2d 224; <em>People v Cerrato, </em>24 NY2d 1; <em>People v Adams, </em>21 NY2d 397.) IV. The issues raised in defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief do not warrant reversal in that the conviction of assault in the first degree was established beyond a reasonable doubt and defendant was afforded the effective assistance of counsel. <em>(People v Cossentino, </em>38 NY2d 760; <em>People v Smith, </em>31 AD2d 847; <em>People v Brown, </em>7 NY2d 359; <em>People v Brabson, </em>9 NY2d 173; <em>People v Lampkins, </em>21 NY2d 138; <em>People v Camacho, </em>16 NY2d 1064; <em>People v Brady, </em>16 NY2d 186; <em>People v Pobliner, </em>32 NY2d 356; <em>People v Anthony, </em>24 NY2d 696; <em>People v Marks, </em>6 NY2d 67.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b155-4\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b155-5\">Jasen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The issue on this appeal is whether a rubber boot used to stomp upon the head of a helpless victim is a dangerous instrument within the meaning of the Penal Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">On the afternoon of February 26, 1978, defendant was driving through the City of Albany with his girlfriend, Frances Coleman, when the two began to quarrel. Defendant pulled his car to the curb in the vicinity of 10 Lark Drive. Coleman exited the car and began to walk away. As she was leaving, defendant viciously assaulted her. He began by striking her several times with his fists. She fell to the ground. While she lay helpless on the pavement, defendant kicked and \u201cstomped\u201d her several times in the head and face. Coleman lapsed into a coma. At the time of trial several months later, the victim remained in a comatose state and the People\u2019s medical expert testified that in his opinion her condition would never improve.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Defendant was charged in a two-count indictment with attempted murder and assault in the first degree. The assault charge was predicated upon subdivision 1 of section 120.10 of the Penal Law, which defines assault in the first degree as intentional causation of serious physical injury \u201cby means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>After a jury trial, defendant was acquitted on the attempted murder charge and convicted of first degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">On appeal, defendant contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that the pair of rubber boots which he was wearing at the time of the assault could not be considered a \u201cdangerous instrument\u201d within the meaning of the Penal Law. The Appellate Division unanimously rejected this argument and affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction. There should be an affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The term \u201cdangerous instrument\u201d is defined in subdivision 13 of section 10 of the Penal Law as \u201cany instrument, article or substance * * * which, under the circumstances in which it is used * * * * is readily capable of causing death or other serious physical injury.\u201d The statute makes no attempt to give an absolute definition of the term or to provide a list of items which can be considered dangerous instruments. Instead the statute states plainly that any \u201cinstrument, article or substance\u201d, no matter how innocuous it may appear to be when used for its legitimate purpose, <em>becomes </em>a dangerous instrument when it is <em>used </em>in a manner which renders it readily capable of causing serious physical injury. (See Hechtman, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 39, Penal Law, \u00a7 10.00, p 21.) The object itself need not be inherently dangerous. It is the temporary use rather than the inherent vice of the object which brings it within the purview of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The courts of this State have consistently adopted this use-oriented approach. In <em>People v Cwikla </em>(60 AD2d 40, revd on other grounds 46 NY2d 434), for example, we noted our agreement with the Appellate Division that a common handkerchief with which a victim was gagged and which led to his asphyxiation was a \u201cdangerous instrument\u201d within the meaning of the Penal Law. In a like manner, leather boots used to kick a victim in the face <em>(People v Rumaner, </em>45 AD2d 290) and a spatula used to inflict a cut <em>(People v Bouldin, </em>40 AD2d 1045) have been found to satisfy the statutory standard.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Thus, although the rubber boots in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>issue are not inherently dangerous, we must determine whether the evidence in this case is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that they were readily capable of causing serious physical injury in the way in which they were used.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Here, there is evidence that the defendant used the rubber boots to stomp upon the head and face of his victim, causing her head to contact the pavement below with tremendous force. The jury apparently concluded that the pair of boots, when used in this fashion, was readily capable of causing serious physical injury and, thus, was a \u201cdangerous instrument\u201d within the meaning of subdivision 13 of section 10 of the Penal Law. On this record, we cannot say that such a conclusion was erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Gabrielli, Jones, Watchler, Fuchsberg and Meyer concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b156-7\"> Many other jurisdictions have also taken the view that the status of an object as a dangerous instrument is to be determined by its use. (See, e.g., <em>State v Bradley, </em>254 Iowa 211, app dsmd and cert den 374 US 490 [shoe as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>\u201cdangerous weapon\u201d] ; <em>People </em>v <em>Buford, </em>69 Mich App 27 [boot as \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d]; <em>Orrill v State, </em>509 P2d 930, 932 [Okla] [boot as \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d] ; <em>Medlin </em>v <em>United States, </em>207 F2d 33 [shoe as \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d] ; see, also, <em>Commonwealth v Appleby, </em>\u2014 Mass \u2014, \u2014, 402 NE2d 1051, 1057 [riding crop as \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d]; <em>State </em>v <em>Mercier, </em>\u2014 RI \u2014, \u2014, 415 A2d 465, 467 [car as \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d]; <em>People </em>v <em>Goolsby, </em>284 Mich 375, 378 [car as \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d]; see, generally, Kicking As Aggravated Assault or Assault with Dangerous or Deadly Weapon, Ann., 333 ALR3d 922.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
