This court need not apply the United States Supreme Court decision of <em>Rush v Savchuk </em>retroactively where a party reasonably relied on prior law and would suffer manifest injustice and hardship. <em>(Linkletter v Walker, </em>381 US 618; <em>Great Northern Ry. v Sunburst Co., </em>287 US 358; <em>Desist v United States, </em>394 US 244; <em>Stovall v Denno, </em>388 US 293; <em>Lyons v Westinghouse Elec.

II. <em>Rush v Savchuk </em>should not be applied retroactively to this action since plaintiff justifiably relied on the <em>Seider </em>doctrine and would be denied her day in court by a holding of retro-activity. <em>(Harris v Jex, </em>55 NY 421; <em>People ex rel.

IV. Should this court decide that <em>Rush </em>must be applied retroactively, it should, in the interests of justice, condition dismissal upon the waiver of the defense of the Statute of Limitations in New Jersey. <em>(Barry v American Home Assur.

The United States Supreme Court in <em>Shaffer v Heitner </em>and <em>Rush v Savchuk </em>applied the due process test for the benefit of defendant. <em>(Simpson v Loehmann, </em>21 NY2d 305, 990; <em>Minichiello v Rosenberg, </em>410 F2d 106, 398 US 844; <em>Kirchman v Mikula, </em>443 F2d 816; <em>Robinson v Shearer &amp; Sons, </em>429 F2d 83; <em>Kulko v California Superior Ct., </em>436 US 84; <em>Hanson v Denckla, </em>357 US 235; <em>Arnold v Mayal Realty Co., </em>299 NY 57; <em>Gregoire v Putnam\u2019s Sons, </em>298 NY 119; <em>Ratka v St. Francis Hosp., </em>44 NY2d 604.) III. Appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>Seider v Roth </em>was patently misplaced. <em>(Reynolds v Snow, </em>10 AD2d 101, 8 NY2d 899; <em>Shaffer v Heitner, </em>433 US 186; <em>O\u2019Connor v Lee-Hy Paving Corp., </em>579 F2d 194, 439 US 1034.) IV. The decision in <em>Gager v White </em>represents the prevailing appellate judgment on the issue of retroactive application of <em>Rush v Savchuk. (International Shoe Co. v Washington, </em>326 US 310; <em>Morehouse v Volkswagen AG., </em>74 AD2d 164; <em>Tomaszewski v Cleveland, </em>103 Misc 2d 355.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>V. The conditional granting of dismissal as suggested by appellants has no jurisdictional basis and patently violates the United States Constitution. <em>(Epstein v Sirivejkul, </em>64 AD2d 216, 48 NY2d 738.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-4\"><em>James A.

II. Even if the court finds that there was no waiver by defendant and <em>Rush </em>should be applied retroactively, it should not be so applied to this case. <em>(Desist v United States, </em>394 US 244; <em>Johnson v New Jersey, </em>384 US 719; <em>People v Morales, </em>37 NY2d 262; <em>People v Lynch, </em>23 NY2d 262; <em>People v Heller, </em>33 NY2d 314; <em>People v Dargan, </em>27 NY2d 100; <em>Matter of D.

II. The New York State Court of Appeals has already determined that <em>Rush v Savchuk </em>should be applied retroactively. <em>(Erneta v Princeton Hosp., </em>49 NY2d 829; <em>Donawitz v Danek, </em>42 NY2d 138; <em>Morehouse v Volkswagen AG., </em>74 AD2d 164.)

Appellant justifiably relied upon the attachment procedure to secure quasi in rem jurisdiction and will be put to unfair hardship if the subsequent declaration that this procedure is unconstitutional, is applied and her complaint dismissed. <em>(Seider v Roth, </em>17 NY2d 111; <em>Linkletter v Walker, </em>381 US 618; <em>Mapp v Ohio, </em>367 US 643; <em>Tehan v Shott, </em>382 US 406; <em>Stovall v Denno, </em>388 US 293; <em>Chevron Oil Co. v Huson, </em>404 US 97; <em>Harris v Jex, </em>55 NY 421; <em>People v Kaiser, </em>21 NY2d 86; <em>Rosenstiel v Rosenstiel, </em>16 NY2d 64; <em>People v McQueen, </em>18 NY2d 337.) II. This is the first occasion this court has had to rule on the retroactive application of <em>Rush </em>to residents of New York at the time of the accident. <em>(Erneta v Princeton Hosp., </em>49 NY2d 829.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number><em>Louis G.

In essence, <em>Seider </em>held that a liability insurance contract issued by a carrier authorized to do business in this State, contingent as its obligations may be, partakes of the character of a \u201cdebt\u201d which by its attachment may be made to serve as the foundation for jurisdiction over its nonresident insured defendants. After this holding had survived 14 years of doctrinal dispute, <em>Rush </em>was to declare it violative of due process. The issue now is whether this ruling is to be applied prospectively alone or retrospectively as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The cases on which we are to act present typical <em>Seider </em>fact patterns. In each, a New York domiciliary seeks damages for injuries or death sustained in an automobile accident outside the State as a result of the alleged negligence of a nonresident operator or owner of a motor vehicle. Save for the plaintiff\u2019s residence, in all, for all practical purposes, the sole connection with this State was the policy\u2019s availability for attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Because in every instance the cases before us were <em>pendente lite </em>when the Supreme Court administered its <em>coup de grace, </em>they all became the subject of motions to dismiss. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>These initially were all denied, \"nisi prius declining to apply <em>Rush </em>to ongoing cases whose plaintiffs, in choosing this forum and foregoing others, had, as these courts saw it, placed justifiable reliance on New York\u2019s previously consistent, if vigorously contested, course of decisional support for <em>Seider\u2019s </em>jurisdictional analysis (see <em>Baden v Staples, </em>45 NY2d 889; <em>Donawitz v Danek, </em>42 NY2d 138; <em>Neuman v Dunham, </em>39 NY2d 999; <em>Simpson v Loehmann, </em>21 NY2d 305, mot for rearg den 21 NY2d 990; see, also, <em>O\u2019Connor v Lee-Hy Paving Corp., </em>579 F2d 194, cert den 439 US 1034 ; <em>Minichiello v Rosenberg, </em>410 F2d 106, affd en banc 410 F2d 117, cert den 396 US 844, reh den 396 US 949).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The story in the intermediate appellate courts, however, was different. In Cachat v Guertin Co., there was an affirmance, but only because no jurisdictional defense had been interposed. On the other hand, because some type of jurisdictional objection had been raised in the other four, each brought a reversal and dismissal. For the reasons that follow, we now hold that <em>Rush </em>must be applied only when a specific objection to the assertion of jurisdiction founded on the attachment of the out-of-State defendant\u2019s liability insurance policy was preserved by appropriate motion or affirmative defense (CPLR 3211, subd [e]).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Especially since almost every party touches on the matter, our discussion may well start with the reminder that, consonant with the common law\u2019s policy-laden assumptions, a change in decisional law usually will be applied retrospectively to all cases still in the normal litigating process <em>(People v Pepper, </em>53 NY2d 213, citing <em>People v Morales, </em>37 NY2d 262, 267-268; <em>Kelly v Long Is. Light. Co., </em>31 NY2d 25, 29, n 3). By way of departure from this generality, however, where there has been such a sharp break in the continuity of law that its impact will \u201cwreak more havoc in society than society\u2019s interest in stability will tolerate\u201d (Fairchild, Limitation of New Judge-Made Law to Prospective Effect Only: \u201cProspective Overruling\u201d or \u201cSun-bursting\u201d, 51 Marq L Rev 254), it is now recognized that, when adherence to the traditional course is strongly contraindicated by powerful factors, including strong elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>of reliance on law superseded by the new pronouncement, a court may direct that it operate prospectively alone <em>(Chevron Oil Co. v Huson, </em>404 US 97; <em>Great Northern Ry. v Sunburst Co., </em>287 US 358).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">All the plaintiffs, stressing that the Statute of Limitations now may have foreclosed an action in a forum where jurisdiction would be constitutionally unassailable, argue that theirs are precisely the kind of cases in which retroactive application should be eschewed. But this is by no means a one-sided argument. As the defendants contend, that <em>Seider </em>might turn out to have not been the only possible \u201ctrue rule\u201d was not without forewarning (see, e.g., Siegel, New York Practice [1978], \u00a7 105, p 127; Stein, Jurisdiction by Attachment of Liability Insurance, 43 NYU L Rev 1075; Reese, Expanding Scope of Jurisdiction Over Non-Residents \u2014 New York Goes Wild, 35 Ins Counsel J 118). Moreover, even if the balance on the issue of prejudice had to be struck in favor of those who preferred to rely on the authoritative pronouncements of the New York courts rather than those of its now clairvoyant critics, the fundamental nature of the jurisdictional determinations in <em>Rush </em>renders conventional criteria for fixing an appropriate line of demarcation for overruling academic. For, a constitutional due process limitation on the power of a State\u2019s exercise of its jurisdiction under our Federal system of government, as distinguished, for instance, from one founded in due process considerations bearing on less fundamental substantive and procedural concerns, is an absolute abnegation of the offending State\u2019s ability to continue to act beyond the boundaries the determination defines.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">This observation almost inevitably flows from a review of the conceptual building blocks on which <em>Rush </em>stands. They reflect deviation from what for long had come to be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>accepted standards for identifying the bounds of State court basis jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Epitomized by <em>Pennoyer v Neff </em>(95 US 714), these were readily divisible into in personam, in which the fulcrum was the person; in rem, which, applicable to designated property, was designed to affect the interests of all persons; or quasi in rem which bore on the interests of particular persons in designated property. The last was of two types. One, like actions to partition land or foreclose a mortgage, was invocable to establish or extinguish claims to or in particular property. The second, the kind involved in the present cases, provided a basis for obtaining a judgment to the satisfaction of which the property on which the jurisdiction was based could be applied though it was not related to the controversy between the parties. (See Restatement, Judgments, \u00a7\u00a75-9; Silberman, <em>Shaffer v Heitner: </em>The End of an Era, 53 NYU L Rev 33, 39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Background too was the requirement for \u201cminimum contacts\u201d, integral to \u201cfair play and substantial justice\u201d (see <em>International Shoe Co. v Washington, </em>326 US 310, 316), which, at the time <em>Seider </em>came on the legal horizon, had been established as essential to in personam jurisdiction, yet was not requisite for quasi in rem jurisdiction, for which the presence of property alone sufficed <em>(Harris v Balk, </em>198 US 215; <em>Pennoyer v Neff, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">But <em>Shaffer v Heitner </em>(433 US 186) was to eliminate this dichotomy. Noting that \u201cthe law of state-court jurisdiction no longer stands securely on the foundation established in <em>Pennoyer\u201d </em>and that \u201c \u2018 \u201cjudicial jurisdiction over a thing,\u201d is a customary elliptical way of referring to jurisdiction over the interests of persons in a thing\u2019 Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 56, Introductory Note (1971)\u201d, it held that \u201calthough the presence of the defendant\u2019s property in a State might suggest the existence of other ties among the defendant, the State, and the litigation, the presence of the property alone would not support the State\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d <em>(Shaffer v Heitner, supra, </em>pp 206-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>207, 209). This, of course, still left open the question as to whether the presence in the forum of the defendant\u2019s policy and the fact that its carrier was doing business there were enough in the <em>Seider-type </em>case to meet these concerns (see Lowenfeld, In Search of the Intangible: A Comment on <em>Shaffer v Heitner, </em>53 NYU L Rev 102).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In <em>Rush, </em>however, the Supreme Court was to dissipate any differences on this subject. It specifically held that cognizable legal fictions, first that, as a form of property, a debt partakes of 'the situs of the debtor, and, second, that a corporation is to be found wherever it does business, both of which <em>Seider </em>entertained, fell short when no more was present in the forum than the liability insurer and its obligation to defend and indemnify. Furthermore, in defining a forum relationship that would meet The required standards, the court made clear that it is not the relation of the plaintiff who seeks the advantage of its forum of choice that carries weight, but rather that of the defendant against whom.the litigation is targeted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> From there it proceeded to arrive at the evaluation that, in a <em>Seider </em>factual framework, \u201cthe defendant has <em>no </em>contacts with the forum\u201d (emphasis in original). It was on these foundations, which whatever otherwise has been or can be said on the subject,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we have no choice but to accept for the nonce that the Supreme Court concluded that the forum State could impose no binding judgment against a <em>Seider </em>defendant <em>(Rush v Savchuk, </em>444 US 320, 328-333, supra).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The searching nature of <em>Rush\u2019s </em>reach for the roots of State judicial jurisdictional power is but a reiteration of the basic principle that \u201c[a] court must have jurisdiction in rem or in personam in order to enter a valid judgment of any kind\u201d (4 Carmody-Wait 2d, NY Prac, \u00a7 25:3, p 4; accord <em>Hanson v Denckla, </em>357 US 235, 250). So, with significant contemporaneousness, in <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v Woodson </em>(444 US 286, 291), a companion case to <em>Rush </em>itself, the court took the occasion to remind us, once again, that \u201c[a] judgment rendered in violation of due process is <em>void </em>in the rendering State and is not entitled to full faith and credit elsewhere\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, as Dean McLaughlin has noted, \u201cif it violates due process to <em>commence </em>an action with jurisdiction resting on the attachment of the defendant\u2019s insurance policy, it is difficult to comprehend why it does not also violate due process to <em>continue </em>such an action\u201d (1980 Supplementary Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, C314:4, 1980-1981 Supp, pp 137, 138-139; emphasis in text) <footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">And, since as we have seen, basis jurisdiction now focuses on a defendant\u2019s rights <em>(World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v Woodson, supra; Kulko v California Superior Ct., </em>436 US 84, 91), any reliance by plaintiffs is irrelevant. Indeed, inasmuch as lack of such jurisdiction can be asserted even after a defense on the merits has been presented (see Fourth Prelim Rep of Adv Comm on Practice &amp; Procedure, p 187 [1960] ; <em>Harkness v Hyde, </em>98 US 476), it surely must be given effect here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>That, however, is not the end of the matter. Unlike subject matter jurisdiction, which limits the power of a particular court rather than the judicial jurisdiction of the State <em>en gros, </em>a defect in basis jurisdiction is waivable (CPLR 3211, subd [e]). Under the CPLR, the objection may be raised either by a preanswer motion or by pleading it as an affirmative defense, whichever comes first (see Siegel, New York Practice, \u00a7 111, p 137; 4 Weinstein-KornMiller, NY Civ Prac, pars 3211.03-3211.05).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Absent the pursuit of either course, a defendant\u2019s voluntary participation in litigation in which the point can be raised, in and of itself, constitutes a submission to the jurisdiction of the courts of our State and, as such, acts as a predicate for basis jurisdiction (see Restatement, Conflict of Laws 2d, \u00a7 33; Siegel, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 111, p 139; cf. <em>York v Texas, </em>137 US 15; <em>Henderson v Henderson, </em>247 NY 428).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Examining the cases before us to determine whether quasi in rem jurisdiction has been appropriately controverted, we note that specific objections on that score were made in the answers filed in Gager v White and Hill v Elliott. In these cases, the Appellate Division\u2019s dismissal of the complaints being mandatory, there should be an affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>In contrast, no jurisdictional protest having been lodged in Cachat v Guertin Co., the Appellate Division also was correct when it there found that dismissal was not in order (CPLR 3211, subd [e]).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Lastly, in Mei Yuet Chin v Cray and Carbone v Ericson, the answers raised objection to in personam jurisdiction only.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Since, as explained earlier, a defect in the categorically distinct concept of quasi in rem jurisdiction requires a sufficiently particularized pleading to apprise the plaintiff of its nature with sufficient clarity to avoid prejudice by inducing quiescence (compare CPLR 3211, subd [a], par 8, with par 9; see 4 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac, par 3211.15, p 32-66), it follows that the in rem issue must be deemed waived and the Appellate Division orders, which held to the contrary, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In sum, the orders in Gager v White, Cachat v Guertin Co., and Hill v Elliott should be affirmed, while those in Chin v Cray, and Carbone v Ericson should be reversed and the orders at Special Term in these cases should be reinstated.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-6\">. Although this exceptional technique is usually employed in the criminal law area (see, e.g., <em>People v Pepper, </em>53 NY2d 213, <em>supra; People v Morales, </em>37 NY2d 262, <em>supra), </em>as the cited cases illustrate, it finds application in the civil sphere as well (see, also, Overruling Decision \u2014 Application, Ann., 10 ALR3d 1371).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">It is settled that judgments where the normal appellate process has been exhausted may not be collaterally attacked <em>(Chicot County Dist. v Baxter State Bank, </em>308 US 371, 376; cf. <em>Vander v Casperson, </em>12 NY2d 56).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b525-8\">. Basis jurisdiction, sometimes known as \u201cjudicial jurisdiction\u201d (Restatement, Conflict of Laws 2d, \u00a7\u00a7 24, 68), is to be distinguished from subject matter jurisdiction, which embraces the competence of a court to entertain a particular kind of litigation (Green, Civil Procedure [2d ed], p 13).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\">. Our court <em>(Baden v Staples, </em>45 NY2d 889, <em>supra) </em>and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <em>(O\u2019Connor v Lee-Hy Paving Corp., </em>579 F2d 194, <em>supra) </em>were of the view that it did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b526-7\">. Although some <em>post-Seider </em>decisions theorized that the <em>Seider </em>formulation was tantamount to a direct action statute under which a tort plaintiff in essence was proceeding directly against the coverage so that the carrier\u2019s and not the tort-feasor\u2019s was the interest at stake (see <em>Donnwitz v Danek, </em>42 NY2d 138, 142, <em>supra; Miniehiello v Rosenberg, </em>410 F2d 106, 109, <em>supra), </em>in <em>Rush, </em>the court found the analogy inappropriate <em>(Rush v Savchuk, </em>444 US 320, 330-331, <em>supra).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\">.

Though a State may interpret its own statute or State constitutional provision more strictly than the Supreme Court interprets the corresponding provision of the Federal Constitution, it may not do so more broadly <em>(Erlanger Mills v Cohoes Fibre Mills, </em>239 F2d 502 [SOBELOFF, J.] [North Carolina statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>authorizing jurisdiction on a basis broader than the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d of <em>International Shoe Co. v Washington, supra, </em>held invalid]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\">. We have found no case in which a holding that the assertion of basis jurisdiction would violate due process was limited to prospective effect. Whatever signpost there is, it goes the other way. So the Supreme Court, though only in dictum in a case concerned with subject matter jurisdiction, recently observed that a jurisdictional ruling by definition can never be so limited <em>(Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v Risjord, </em>449 US 368). While there is a Third Circuit opinion limiting a holding concerning subject matter jurisdiction <em>(Mc-Sparran v Weist, </em>402 F2d 867, 876-877 [en banc], cert den 395 US 903), the vitality of that decision would appear to have been sapped by the language in <em>Firestone.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\">. For these reasons, we are constrained to reject the provisional contentions of some of the plaintiffs, that, if we hold that their actions do not survive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>jurisdictionally, their dismissal be conditioned on the defendants\u2019 willingness to stipulate that they will not plead the Statute of Limitations if the suit is pursued in an appropriate forum. Unlike resort to that device in cases of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>which presumes the fact of jurisdiction, where basis jurisdiction is lacking there just is no power to condition the dismissal <em>(Kalman v Neuman, </em>80 AD2d 116, 126, n 2 [Lazer, J.]; <em>Foley v Roche, </em>68 AD2d 558, 565-566 [Fein, J.]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\">. Of course, if a defendant has not appeared at all, there is nothing to preclude essaying a collateral attack on jurisdiction (Restatement, Judgments, \u00a711; see, generally, Chief Judge Desmond\u2019s opn in <em>Vander v Casperson, </em>12 NY2d 56, 59, <em>supra).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\">. Historically, where the initial jurisdiction was in rem or quasi in rem, an appearance, followed by a defense upon the merits, automatically transformed the jurisdictional basis to one that was in personam (see Homburger &amp; Laufer, Appearance and Jurisdictional Motions in New York, 14 Buf L Rev 374, 386-388, 406-408; Frummer, Jurisdiction and Limited Appearance in New York: Dilemma of the Nonresident Defendant, 18 Ford L Rev 73; cf. Restatement, Judgments, \u00a7\u00a7 38-40). Later, this practice was replaced by CPLR 320 (subd <em>[c]), </em>which provides that when jurisdiction is quasi in rem, the appearance remains a limited one. Under these circumstances, the defendant is now permitted to defend without submitting to in personam jurisdiction (Siegel, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 113, p 140).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\">.

Finally, the concurrers\u2019 comments- are quickly met:</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\"><em>First, Erneta v Princeton Hosp. </em>(49 NY2d 829), a memoless entry, which, following <em>Rush </em>by days and here on briefs which had no time to treat with <em>Rush </em>or its retroactivity, as Judge Jasen\u2019s <em>Erneta </em>concurrence so correctly implied, did not scratch the surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\"><em>Secondly, Erneta </em>was a case involving an infant whose time to bring suit in another jurisdiction was still alive because of the toll of the Statute of Limitations for such plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\"><em>Thirdly, </em>it therefore comes as no surprise that the most current post <em>-Rush </em>comment, emphasizing the need for explication of the issues with which today\u2019s opinion treats and specifically referring to the attention both sides of <em>Rush\u2019s </em>retroactivity issue merit, concludes on the following note: \u201cThe magnitude of the impact that [-RmsTi\u2019s] retroactivity will have on tort victims, who walked the red carpet of <em>Seider, </em>thus remains unspoken. And that red carpet was laid down not by legislators, but by judges.

We concur in result in each of these cases, but cannot accept what appears to us to be the overbreadth of the majority opinion, addressing matters which are not necessary for the resolution of these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In <em>Erneta v Princeton Hosp. </em>(49 NY2d 829) our court acknowledged the mandate of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Rush v Savchuk </em>(444 US 320). In there according retroactivity to the new rule of <em>Rush, </em>the court eschewed the opportunity to indulge in an \u201cinstitutional reassessment of <em>Seider </em>v <em>Roth\u201d </em>(49 NY2d, p 830). It suffices for present purposes to cite <em>Erneta, </em>and to emphasize that in as much as the decision in <em>Rush </em>is predicated on the nonexistence of jurisdiction, that inhibition extends to judicial action of any sort thereby precluding any of the ameliorative remedies which are pressed on us by plaintiffs who may now be foreclosed from all judicial relief. As the Supreme Court, through Justice Marshall, wrote with respect to an absence of subject matter jurisdiction: \u201cA court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction, and thus, by definition, a jurisdictional ruling may never be made prospective only\u201d <em>(Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v Risjord, </em>449 US 368, 379).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The only new issue presented in these cases relates to questions of waiver of the right to challenge jurisdiction predicated on a <em>Seider </em>attachment under the <em>Rush </em>decision. We understand the majority to be holding that <em>Rush </em>is to be applied retroactively unless in the individual case, there has been such a waiver by the defendant (in whatever form or by whatever means effectually manifested). We agree with that principle and concur in its application to the five cases now before us. We are in accord as well that in preserving the <em>Rush </em>claim, the defendant must be explicit, by a \u201csufficiently particularized pleading\u201d or otherwise, to leave no doubt that it is the jurisdictional challenge under what is now the <em>Rush </em>doctrine which is being raised. It will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>do to raise challenges to personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Accordingly, as the majority correctly concludes, the defendants in Gager and Hill did not waive their challenges to <em>Seider </em>jurisdiction; the defendants in Mei Yuet Chin, Cachat and Carbone must be held, in consequence of failure to raise the <em>Rush </em>defense, now to have waived it.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen and Meyer concur with Judge Fuchsberg; Judges Gabrielli, Jones and Wachtler concur in result in a concurring opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In <em>Gager v </em>White: Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In <em>Mei Yuet Chin v </em>Cray: Order reversed, with costs, and the order of Supreme Court, Bronx County, reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">In <em>Cachat v Guertin Co.: </em>Order affirmed, with costs.
