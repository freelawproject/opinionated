The district court denied his motion because the drug quantity attributed to him at the original sentencing hearing meant that Amendment 782 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines did not affect his sentencing range. Hatten was originally sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846, as well as possession with the intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. His sentence was later reduced to 360-months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-22\">On appeal, Hatten argues that the district court erroneously based its determination on the sentencing court\u2019s conversion of the quantity of powder cocaine he possessed into crack cocaine, and then into a marijuana equivalency. Hatten further ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>gues that <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), which held that any fact that increases a defendant\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence must be submitted to the jury, <em>id. </em>at 2155, highlights the impropriety of the sentencing court\u2019s drug quantity determination. Beyond that, Hatten asserts that the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) favor granting him a sentence reduction. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce an incarcerated defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment \u201cwhen that defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). A district court must engage in a two-step analysis when considering a motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>First, the court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s sentence using the new sentencing range and holding all other Guidelines findings made at the original sentence hearing constant. <em>Id. </em>If a defendant\u2019s sentencing range would not be lowered by an amendment, the court may not reduce the sentence. <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d 328, 337 (11th Cir.2013). Second, the court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">However, a court need not examine the \u00a7 3553(a) factors if it correctly recognizes it has no authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). \u201c[A] sentencing adjustment undertaken pursuant to Section 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing.\u201d, <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. Accordingly, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not \u201cgrant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous sentencing issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines revised the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). USSG App. C, Amend. 782. In pertinent part, the amendment increased the quantity of marijuana necessary to qualify for a base offense level of 38 from at least 30,000 kilograms to at least 90,000 kilograms of marijuana. <em>Compare </em>USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (2013), <em>with </em>USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (2014). Amendment 782 became effective on November 1, 2014 and was made retroactive by Amendment 788 the same day. USSG App. C, Amends. 782 <em>&amp; </em>788; USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-16\">The district court did not err in holding that it lacked authority to reduce Hatten\u2019s sentence under Amendment 782 since that amendment did not actually lower Hatten\u2019s sentencing range. At the original sentence hearing, the sentencing judge made a clear finding of the drug quantity attributable to Hatten \u2014 over 1,600,000 kilograms of marijuana. To arrive at that quantity, the district court converted 100 kilograms of cocaine to 1,600,000 kilograms of marijuana equivalent. In addition, Hat-ten was held responsible for 1.106 grams of marijuana. Under the 1992 Sentencing Guidelines, Hatten\u2019s original base offense level was 42. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), (c)(1) (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-17\">After Hatten\u2019s previous motion to reduce his sentence was granted, Hatten\u2019s base offense level was reduced to 38. While Amendment 782 raised the quantity of marijuana required for a base offense level of 38 from 30,000 kilograms to 90,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>kilograms, Hatten was sentenced based on over 1,600,000 kilograms of marijuana equivalent. He would therefore still receive a base offense level of 38 even with Amendment 782 taken into account. Because Hatten\u2019s sentencing range would remain unchanged, the district court did not err in concluding that it lacked authority to grant Hatten\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Because the district court correctly concluded that it lacked authority to reduce Hatten\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c), the court was not required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em>Webb, 565 F.3d at 793. Moreover, any arguments about the implications of <em>Alleyne </em>are irrelevant because Mr. Hatten\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence was unchanged. In addition, any argument based on <em>Alleyne </em>is extraneous to the district court\u2019s determination as to whether it could reduce Hatten\u2019s sentence. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 782. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
