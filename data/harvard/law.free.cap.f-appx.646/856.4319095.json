On appeal, he argues that he was entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 782, because his sentence was based, at least in part, on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, and he challenges his career offender designation based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), which held that the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act was unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the Sentencing Guidelines and the scope of its authority' under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the prison sentence of a \u201cdefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission[.]\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). Section 3582(c)(2) does not grant the district court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues, including collateral attacks' on a sentence. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000). Instead, collateral attacks must be brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-15\">For a defendant to be eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the Sentencing Commission must have amended the guidehne at issue, the. amendment must have lowered the defendant\u2019s sentencing range, and the amendment must also be listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) &amp; comment. (n.l(A)). Amendment 782 provided for a two-level reduction in base offense levels for most drug quantities listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), and may serve, when applicable, as the basis for a sentence reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 782; <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-17\">However, \u201c[wjhere a retroactively applicable guidehne amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Thus, where a defendant\u2019s sentence was based on the guidehne range for a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, an amendment to the base offense levels apphcable to the defendant under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 does not affect the guidehne range, because the defendant\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 \u201cplayed no role\u201d in the calculation of the guidehne range. <em>Id. </em>at 1327, 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-18\">The district court did not err when it denied Pierre\u2019s motion for a reduction of his sentence because he was sentenced based on the career offender guidehne under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than the drug quantity tables under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Therefore, he is ineligible for relief based on Amendment 782, because the amendment did not alter his guidehne range. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327, 1330. Although Pierre now attempts to challenge his ca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>reer offender designation, he cannot challenge that determination in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
