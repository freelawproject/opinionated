Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(5), (a)(8). Although we liberally construe pro se briefs, arguments not raised on appeal\u2014 even by pro se litigants \u2014 are \u201cdeemed abandoned.\u201d <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-19\">In this case, the district court dismissed Kaiser\u2019s action as time-barred, which Kaiser fails to address in his brief. Indeed, on appeal, Kaiser does not mention the statute of limitations, and we will not act as his <em>\u201cde facto </em>counsel\u201d in order to preserve the issue. <em>See Campbell v. Air Jamaica Ltd., </em>760 F.3d 1165, 1168-69 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 759, 190 L.Ed.2d 628 (2014). Therefore, Kaiser has abandoned any argument that his claim is not time-barred. <em>See Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874. Accordingly, upon review of the record and consideration of Kaiser\u2019s brief, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
