California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Johnson has filed a response, arguing that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because he received the ineffective assistance of counsel. The record is sufficiently developed to allow us to make a fair evaluation of Johnson\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 314 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-20\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Johnson\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be \u25a0 published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
