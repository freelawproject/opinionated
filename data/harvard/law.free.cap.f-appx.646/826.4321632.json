Jenkins asserts the district court clearly erred in determining the Government had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Jenkins was responsible for more than 50 victims. Jenkins further contends his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately explain its reasoning for the sentence imposed. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AZx\">\n<em>A. Number of Victims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">The 2014 Sentencing Guidelines provide for a four-level enhancement for fraud or theft offenses involving 50 or more, but fewer than 250, victims. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B) (2014). A victim means any person who sustained any part of the actual loss calculated under the guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 1. \u201cIn cases involving means of identification, such as a Social Security number, \u2018victim\u2019 also includes \u2018any individual whose means of identification was used unlawfully or without authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Philidor, </em>717 F.3d 883, 885 (11th Cir.2013). Mere transfer of personal identifying information, without more action, does not constitute use under \u00a7 2B1.1. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>704 F.3d 1317, 1323 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-16\">In a case involving jointly undertaken criminal activity, the defendant may be held responsible for all reasonably foreseeable acts of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). A jointly undertaken criminal activity is \u201ca criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. n. 2. In order to determine the accountability of the defendant in a jointly undertaken criminal activity, the sentencing court must first make individualized findings regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>ing the scope of criminal activity undertaken by the defendant. <em>United States v. Hunter, </em>323 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir. 2003). Then, the court makes a determination as to foreseeability. <em>Id. </em>In determining the scope of criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly undertake, the court may consider any explicit or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">The district court did not clearly err in determining that there were more than 50 victims attributable to Jenkins. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>732 F.3d 1299, 1305 (11th Cir.2013) (reviewing the district court\u2019s calculation of the number of victims for clear error). The district court determined that Jenkins and his co-defendant Llanos were involved in a jointly undertaken criminal conspiracy to file false tax returns using over 3,000 instances of personal identification information (PIIs). The 86 actual victims resulting from this conspiracy were reasonably foreseeable given the number of PIIs involved. <em>See Hunter, </em>323 F.3d at 1319. These findings were supported by evidence that Jenkins lived with Llanos when the tax returns were filed, went to ATMs to cash refunds from the falsely-filed returns, filed some tax returns himself, left fingerprints on a sample of the documents containing PIIs, and shared in the profits of the conspiracy. Thus, the district court did not clearly err in finding that the government had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Jenkins was responsible for more than 50 victims. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>714 F.3d 1358, 1361 (11th Cir.2013) (explaining that when a defendant challenges one of the factual bases of his sentence, the government has the burden of introducing sufficient and reliable evidence to prove the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">\n<em>B. Procedural Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">When imposing a sentence, the district court must consider the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and adequately explain the basis for the sentence imposed. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The failure to do so can constitute significant procedural error. <em>Id. </em>However, a district court is not required to \u201crecite a laundry list\u201d of factors in order to demonstrate the reasonableness of its sentence. <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1278 (11th Cir.2008). Rather, it is sufficient for the court to give \u201cexplicit acknowledgment that it has considered a defendant\u2019s argum\u00e9nts and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the context and record can be sufficient to indicate the reasoning behind the district court\u2019s conclusion. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 359, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Jenkins\u2019 sentence is procedural^ reasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court adequately explained the sentence'it imposed and addressed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court expressly stated it had considered the statutory factors, the PSI, and the parties\u2019 arguments. It also gave an expla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>nation that, while brief, tracked several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, such as a need to protect the public and promote respect for the law. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Based on this analysis, the district court concluded that a sentence at the top of the guidelines was appropriate and rejected Jenkins\u2019 request for a downward variance. Thus, the district court gave a sufficient explanation of the sentence imposed, taking into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 359, 127 S.Ct. 2456; <em>Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"A4A\">We affirm Jenkins\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-11\">, Because we write for the parties, we set out only those facts necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b854-5\"><em>. </em>The parties dispute the standard of review. Where a defendant fails to object to procedural reasonableness at sentencing, we apply plain error review. <em>See United States v. Vandergrift, </em>754 F.3d 1303, 1307 (11th Cir.2014). However, we have reviewed <em>de novo </em>whether a district court adequately explained the sentence it imposed, even when the defendant did not object on this ground below. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1181, n. 3 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>438 F.3d 1272, 1274 (11th Cir.2006). The district court\u2019s imposition of Jenkins' sentence was procedurally reasonable under either standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
