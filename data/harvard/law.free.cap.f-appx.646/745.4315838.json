Tobkin filed a pro <em>se </em>complaint in the bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>court asserting that the proofs of claim were \u201cfalse, falsified, forged, unlawful, exaggerated, invalid, void, and/or unenforceable\u201d because Scott filed an arrearage affidavit in which she impersonated a Deputy-Clerk of Florida\u2019s Ninth Judicial Circuit, and the other defendants knew or should have known that when they relied on that affidavit. The district court concluded that Tobkin\u2019s complaint alleged claims arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, withdrew the reference to the bankruptcy court, and ordered Tobkin to refile his complaint in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Tobkin filed an amended complaint reiterating his claims. After the defendants moved to dismiss and Tobkin responded to that motion, John Ostrow entered an appearance as Tobkin\u2019s attorney. The parties then filed a joint scheduling report, which stated that there was no need to amend the pleadings \u201cat this time.\u201d Soon after, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, finding that Tob-kin\u2019s complaint was \u201cbereft of any facts necessary to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face, [and] full of concluso-ry, unfounded, and borderline unintelligible allegations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim, viewing the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain' sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quotation marks omitted). Facial plausibility means \u201cfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo prevail on a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must demonstrate both (1) that the defendant deprived [him] of a right secured under the Constitution or federal law and (2) that such a deprivation occurred under color of state law.\u201d <em>Arrington v. Cobb Cty., </em>139 F.3d 865, 872 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Tobkin\u2019s amended complaint was entirely devoid of factual allegations that give rise to a cognizable claim under \u00a7 1983. His only factual allegations were that Scott impersonated a state court\u2019s deputy clerk and that the other defendants knew it. He failed to specify any \u201cright secured under the Constitution or federal law\u201d that their actions violated. <em>Arrington, </em>139 F.3d at 872. To the extent that Tobkin now argues that the district court erred by failing to grant him leave to amend his complaint, that argument is a nonstarter. \u201cA district court is not required to grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint sua sponte when the plaintiff, who is represented by counsel, never filed a motion to amend nor requested leave to amend before the district court.\u201d <em>Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., </em>314 F.3d 541, 542 (11th Cir.2002) (en banc). Not only did Tobkin\u2019s attorney fail to request leave to amend, he indicated in the joint scheduling report that he did not need to amend the pleadings. The district court did not err in dismissing Tobkin\u2019s amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
