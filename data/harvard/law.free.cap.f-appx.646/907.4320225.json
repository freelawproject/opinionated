Bryant seeks a reduction under Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court held that Bryant is ineligible for relief under Amendment 782 because he was originally sentenced as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. On appeal, Bryant argues that he was sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1\u2014 not \u00a7 4B1.1 \u2014 and therefore the district court erred. Alternatively, he asserts that he is eligible for a reduction based on Amendment 782 because he was erroneously sentenced as a career offender. Both arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">First, the original sentencing court clearly sentenced Bryant pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. During his sentencing hearing, Bryant admitted \u2014 and the court acknowledged \u2014 that \u00a7 4B1.1 governed his sentence. Moreover, the court adopted the guidelines calculations from Bryant\u2019s Pre-sentence Investigation Report, and those calculations were explicitly based on \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">Second, under the present procedural posture, Bryant cannot challenge the sentencing court\u2019s decision to sentence him as a career offender. Section 3582(c)(2) only \u201cpermits a sentence reduction within the narrow bounds established by\u201d the Sentencing Commission. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2694, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). \u201cIn making [a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ] determination, the court shall substitute only the amendments ... for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and <em>shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) (emphasis added). Amendment 782 does not have any bearing on the guidelines\u2019 career offender provisions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 782. Thus, the sentencing court\u2019s career offender decision is \u201coutside the scope of the proceeding authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>See Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 831, 130 S.Ct. at 2694.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
