The Commissioner therefore denied Ms. Fernandez the benefits and income she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Ms. Fernandez brought this action to obtain review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The District Court, on motion for summary judgment, affirmed it. Ms. Fernandez appeals the court\u2019s judgment raising one issue: whether the ALJ, in denying her application, erred by discounting the opinion of her treating psychiatrist, Fernando Mendez-Villamil, M.D., that she is disabled and unable to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">Since the Appeals Council denied review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, we review the ALJ\u2019s decision as the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). The precise question before us is whether the ALJ properly applied the standards found in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(2) in evaluating .the medical opinion \u2014 in particular, Dr. Mendez-Villam-il\u2019s opinion. We review her evaluation for substantial evidence,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and her application of legal principles <em>de novo. Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-16\">Eligibility for SSI or DIB requires that the claimant is under a disability. 42 U.S.O. \u00a7\u00a7 423(a)(1), 1382(a)(l)-(2). In relevant part, a claimant is under a disability if she is unable to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of a medically determinable impairment that can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423(d)(1)(A), 1382c(a)(3)(A). The claimant bears the burden of proving her disability, and she is responsible for producing evidence in support of her claim. <em>Ellison v. Barnhart, </em>355 F.3d 1272, 1276 (llthpir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-17\">The Commissioner uses a five-step, sequential evaluation process to determine whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4). Under the first step, the claimant must show that she is not currently engaged in substantial gainful activity. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)\u00ae, 416.920(a)(4)\u00ae. At the second step, the claimant must show that she has a severe impairment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii), 416.920(a)(4)(h). The regulations define a severe impairment as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>an \u201cimpairment or combination of impairments which significantly limit[ ] [the claimant\u2019s] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(c), 416.920(a)(4)(c). Third, the claimant has the opportunity to show that the impairment meets or equals the criteria contained in one of the Listings of Impairments. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii), 416.920(a)(4)(iii). At the fourth step, if the claimant cannot meet or equal the criteria in one of the Listings, the ALJ considers the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) and the claimant\u2019s past relevant work to determine if she has an impairment that prevents her from performing her past relevant work. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv), (e), 416.920(a)(4)(iv), (e). Finally, once a claimant establishes that she cannot perform her past relevant work due to some severe impairment, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to show that a significant number of jobs exist in the national economy that the claimant can perform. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(v), 416.920(a)(4)(v); <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The Social Security Regulations define a \u201ctreating source\u201d as a medical source, including a physician, who has provided the claimant with medical treatment and has, or previously had, an ongoing treatment relationship with the claimant. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1502. A treating source is generally afforded more weight \u2022 because \u201cthese sources are more likely to be the medical professionals most able to provide a detailed, longitudinal picture of [the claimant\u2019s] medical impairment(s) and may bring a unique perspective to the medical evidence that .cannot be obtained from the objective medical findings alone or from reports of individual examinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(c)(2), 416.927(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Dr. Mendez-Villamil is Ms. Fernandez\u2019s treating source because he is her treating physician. As such, the ALJ was required to give his opinion \u201csubstantial or considerable weight\u201d unless there was good cause not to do so. <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(c)(2), 416.927(c)(2) (providing that a treating source\u2019s opinion is not given controlling weight if it is inconsistent with the other substantial evidence). Good cause exists \u201cwhen the: (1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was eonclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179. The opinion of a non-examining physician, standing alone, does not constitute good cause if it contradicts the opinion of a treating physician. <em>Lamb v. Bowen, </em>847 F.2d 698, 703 (11th Cir.1988). The ALJ must clearly articulate his reasons for giving less weight to the treating physician\u2019s opinion, and the failure to do so is reversible error. <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440. However, where the ALJ articulates specific reasons for failing to give the opinion of a treating physician controlling weight, there is no reversible error. <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1212. When a treating physician\u2019s opinion does not warrant controlling weight, the ALJ must nevertheless weigh the opinion based on: (1) the length of the treatment relationship and the frequency of examination; (2) the nature and extent of the treatment relationship; (3) the medical evidence supporting the opinion; (4) consistency with the record as a whole; (5) specialization in the relevant medical issues; and (6) other factors which tend to support or contradict the opinion. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(2). .</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">The question here is whether the ALJ articulated good cause for giving limited weight to Dr. Mendez-Villamil\u2019s opinion of Ms. Fernandez\u2019s mental impairments and her ability to work. <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>1440. In assessing the opinion evidence, the ALJ recounted the history of Ms. Fernandez\u2019s medical impairments, considered the treatment notes provided by Dr. Mendez-Villamil, and reviewed the opinion evidence provided by the psychologists, Dr. James Brown, Dr. Pauline Hightower, and Dr. Maribel Del Rio-Roberts. After conducting this review of the record, the ALJ concluded that Dr. Mendez-Villamil\u2019s opinion was conclusory and inconsistent with his own treatment notes. Accordingly, the ALJ clearly articulated her reasons for assigning limited weight to his opinion. <em>See Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Furthermore, the ALJ\u2019s articulated reasons are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1212. Dr. Mendez-Villamil\u2019s positive findings concerning Ms. Fernandez\u2019s mental status were inconsistent with his abrupt and unexplained conclusion that her capacity for social interaction was extremely impaired. Additionally, Dr. Mendez-Villam-il\u2019s own treatment notes reveal that he treated her through a course of minor, routine adjustments to her medications. As the ALJ noted, this conservative course of treatment was inconsistent with Dr. Menndez-VillamiFs dire prognosis of complete inability to work and extreme impairment. Accordingly, the ALJ had good cause not to give the doctor\u2019s opinion substantial weight, as his opinion was conclu-sory and inconsistent with his own medical records. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Finally, the ALJ did not err by affording more weight to the opinions of Drs. Brown, Hightower, and Del Rio-Roberts. As noted above, the ALJ\u2019s decision to partially discount Dr. Mendez-Villamil\u2019s opinion was based upon his treatment notes and the record as a whole, not solely upon the opinions of the three psychologists. Thus, the ALJ did not err by assigning limited weight to his opinion as it pertained to Ms. Fernandez\u2019s mental impairments and ability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-11\">. In doing so, we do not reweigh the evidence, or substitute our own judgment for that of the ALJ. <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011). Thus, so long as her decision is supported by substantial evidence, we must affirm that decision, even if the evidence may preponderate against it. <em>Crawford v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158-59 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
