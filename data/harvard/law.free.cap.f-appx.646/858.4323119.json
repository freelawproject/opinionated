Plaintiff moved to proceed <em>in forma pau-peris, </em>and the district court granted the motion. The district court dismissed Plaintiffs claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), which permits a district court to dismiss an <em>in forma pauperis </em>complaint <em>sua sponte </em>if the complaint fails to state a claim. Plaintiff appeals. We reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-16\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b885-17\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b885-18\">Plaintiff is a former informant who is imprisoned in Florida\u2019s \u201cprotective management\u201d system. We assume to be true the following allegations made in Plaintiffs operative complaint. The following facts are described in Plaintiffs most recent complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 6, 2011, Plaintiff requested that prison officials transfer him out of Florida. Plaintiff requested the transfer because he feared that inmates from the general population would infiltrate the protective management system and harm him. Indeed, Plaintiff received at least one threat from a general population inmate, and Plaintiff witnessed prison officials inadvertently placing several general population inmates into protective management.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-19\">After Plaintiff submitted his request, an officer informed Plaintiff that the \u201cinstitutional classification team\u201d \u2014 an intermediate review team \u2014 had reviewed Plaintiffs request and recommended his transfer. On April 13, 2011, still awaiting a final response to his transfer request, Plaintiff requested a status update from Defendant Correctional Services Administrator Cedric Sneed. The next day, Sneed responded that the Florida Department of Corrections was \u201cinvestigating if all options had been exhausted before making a final decision of an out of state transfer.\u201d On April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>24, 201\u00cd, Plaintiff responded to Sneed to encourage the approval of his transfer. On May 9, 2011, Sneed notified Plaintiff that the \u201ctransfer request was disapproved due to the department not exhausting all of its options to resolve [Plaintiffs] protection needs within the state prior to submission of the transfer request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Soon after receiving the denial, Plaintiff began a long series of attempts to reverse his denial. Between the May 9, 2011 denial and November 2, 2011, Plaintiff repeatedly requested \u2014 in one form or another \u2014 that Sneed approve the transfer request or that the institutional classification team re-recommend Plaintiffs transfer. Specifically, Plaintiff describes at least seven formal or informal requests that he filed with prison officials between May 9, 2011, and November 2, 2011. Further, on October 7, 2011, Plaintiffs family and friends began e-mailing various defendants to express concern over Plaintiffs safety and over the transfer denial. Many of the requests from Plaintiff, his family, and his friends went unanswered, but Plaintiff \u201cand his family continued vigorously in their position!,] addressing their concerns for the plaintiffs safety via inmate requests, informal and formal grievances!,] and emails to\u201d various defendants \u201cas well as to other officials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">On June 12, 2012, Defendant Security Sergeant Jamal Ingram wrote a disciplinary report that accused Plaintiff of \u201cattempting] to conspire.\u201d The report quoted Plaintiff as admitting that his \u201callegations and safety concerns were all lies.\u201d Plaintiff was confined for 30 days as a consequence of the disciplinary report, but the confinement did not stop Plaintiffs requests for help. Indeed, \u201c[w]hile in confinement ..., plaintiff filed grievances appealing the disciplinary team[\u2019]s findings.\u201d When Plaintiff emerged from confinement, he again filed a \u201cgrievance (appeal),\u201d which Defendant Warden William Churchwell returned without disposition. On August 6, 2012, Plaintiffs family sent Defendant Douglas Craven, a member of the Classification Team, an e-mail expressing concern for Plaintiffs safety and requesting that Plaintiff \u201cbe re-recommended for [an interstate] transfer for his safety.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the same day, at a \u201cmonth review,\u201d Plaintiff gave Craven and Defendant Major J. Schweinsberg \u201can inmate request in reference to the [interstate] transfer.\u201d Plaintiff \u201casked that the [Florida Department of Corrections] rules be adhered to and that a written response to the inmate request ... be provided.\u201d Craven responded, \u201cWe have a place for you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">The next day, Craven and Schweinsberg recommended that Plaintiff be returned to confinement. Defendant Senior State Classification Officer Michael Workman approved the recommendation, and Plaintiff was returned to disciplinary \u201cconfinement and classified for placement on close management under the ruse that it was for the [June 12, 2012] disciplinary report ... and allegedly because the plaintiffs desperate behavior demonstrated a clear threat to the safety and security of\u2019 others. Plaintiffs second confinement occurred nearly a month after Plaintiff was released from the first confinement and more than two months after Ingram drafted the June 12 disciplinary report for the first confinement. In Plaintiffs experience, \u201cit is unprecedented for an inmate to serve his confinement time for a [disciplinary report] and be released from confine<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>ment to the general population and approximately a month later to be re-locked up in confinement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">On October 22, 2012, Plaintiff was transferred to a new Florida correctional facility for \u201cclose management status housing.\u201d The next day, Plaintiff began requesting \u201call his legal work stored\u201d at his previous facility. Plaintiff received various conflicting responses but did not receive his legal work until February 21, 2013. Plaintiff alleges that this delay caused him to miss a November 26, 2012 criminal appeal deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">B. District Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Plaintiff submitted three complaints to the district court. Following the filing of both the first and second complaints, the district court twice <em>sua sponte </em>directed Plaintiff to amend. Plaintiff ultimately filed a third complaint, the facts of which are presented above. The complaint names eleven defendants: Michael D. Crews, Cedric Sneed, William Churchwell, Charles Sexton, Norma Kelly, Douglas Craven, J. Schweinsberg, Michael Workman, FNU Beasly, Jamal Ingram, and Jeffery Beasley. Further, the complaint contains four counts, each alleged against an unspecified subset of Defendants. Count I alleges that \u201c[t]he defendant(s)\u201d violated the Eighth Amendment by failing to reasonably protect Plaintiff from danger and by failing to transfer Plaintiff to another state. Count II alleges that \u201c[t]he defendants)\u201d violated Plaintiffs Fourteenth Amendment equal protection right by treating similarly situated inmates favorably. Count III alleges that \u201cDefendants)\u201d violated the First Amendment by retaliating against Plaintiff for \u201cwriting inmate requests, grievances, [and] letters,\u201d and for \u201c[Plaintiffs family sending emails.\u201d Count IV alleges that \u201cDefendants)\u201d violated the Fifth Amendment by withholding Plaintiffs legal documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">The district court <em>sum sponte </em>dismissed Plaintiffs third complaint. The district court relied on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), which permits a district court to dismiss an <em>in forma pauperis </em>complaint <em>sua sponte </em>if the complaint fails to state a claim. The district court also denied three motions to appoint counsel. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">\n<em>SCOPE OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">Plaintiff purports to appeal six orders\u2014 the two orders directing him to amend, the three orders denying motions to appoint counsel, and the order dismissing his third complaint. Plaintiffs appellate brief, however, discusses only the order dismissing his third complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we review only the third complaint and the corresponding dismissal. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cWhile we- read briefs filed by pro <em>se </em>litigants liberally, issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">\u201cThis Court reviews a dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) <em>de novo.\u201d Troville v. Venz, </em>303 F.3d 1256, 1259 (11th Cir.2002). And \u201cwe ... apply Rule 12(b)(6) standards in reviewing dismissals under section 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-16\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b887-17\">A. Count I: Eighth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b887-18\">Plaintiffs Eighth Amendment claim alleges that his conditions of confinement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>subject him to an unacceptable risk of injury from general population inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">The Eighth Amendment prohibits \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment. And \u201c[t]he \u2018cruel and unusual punishments\u2019 standard applies to the conditions of a prisoner\u2019s confinement.\u201d <em>Chandler v. Crosby, </em>379 F.3d 1278, 1288 (11th Cir.2004). Indeed, \u201c[i]t has long been recognized that ... \u2018prison officials have a duty to protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brooks v. Warden, </em>800 F.3d 1295, 1301 (11th Cir.2015). \u201cA prison official violates the Eighth Amendment when a substantial risk of serious harm, of which the official is subjectively aware, exists and the official does not respond reasonably to the risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, to succeed on an Eighth Amendment claim, a plaintiff must show \u201c(1) a substantial risk of serious harm; (2) the defendants\u2019 deliberate indifference to that risk; and (3) a causal connection between the defendants\u2019 conduct and the Eighth Amendment violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs complaint fails to satisfy the first two elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">A plaintiffs allegations of substantial risk are evaluated using an objective standard. <em>Id. </em>Under the objective standard, the plaintiff must \u201callege a prison condition that is so extreme that it poses an unreasonable risk of serious damage to the prisoner\u2019s health or safety.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Johnson, </em>598 F.3d 734, 737 (11th Cir.2010). In other words, a plaintiff must allege facts showing a \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d of a substantial injury, not just \u201ca mere possibility\u201d of a substantial injury. <em>Brooks, </em>800 F.3d at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">A plaintiffs allegations of deliberate indifference are evaluated using a subjective standard. Under the subjective standard, a plaintiff must allege that a prison official (1) had subjective knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm and (2) disregarded that risk \u201cby conduct that is more than mere negligence.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>598 F.3d at 737; <em>accord Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 835, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (\u201c[Djeliberate indifference describes a state of mind more blameworthy than negligence.\u201d); <em>Kelley v. Hicks, </em>400 F.3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cMere negligence, however, is insufficient to establish deliberate indifference.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Plaintiff argues that he is at risk of an attack from other inmates who view him as a \u201csnitch.\u201d Plaintiff recognizes that he is already subject to Florida\u2019s \u201cprotective management\u201d - system, but he argues that the system is nonetheless not safe enough. Plaintiff alleges that general population inmates want to harm him because he is a \u201csnitch\u201d and that one general population inmate threatened to stab him to death. Further, Plaintiff notes that prison officials have inadvertently placed several general population inmates in protective management. Plaintiff alleges that eventually the prison officials\u2019 carelessness will lead to a general population inmate attacking Plaintiff from within protective management.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s allegations satisfy neither the objective nor the subjective component of an Eighth Amendment claim. As to the objective component, Plaintiff identifies only one general population inmate who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>has threatened him. More importantly, Plaintiffs allegations span three years, yet the complaint identifies only a handful of incidents of inmate misclassification. Further, Plaintiff alleges that only two of those misclassified inmates were dangerous, and Plaintiff does not allege that those two inmates wanted to harm Plaintiff specifically. Finally, Plaintiff does not allege that either dangerous inmate was housed in Plaintiffs cell or that either dangerous. inmate threatened Plaintiff. Although Plaintiffs allegations show a \u201cpossibility\u201d of injury, Plaintiffs allegations fail to show \u201cextreme\u201d conditions that create a \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">As to the subjective component, Plaintiffs limited allegations establish, at most, that prison officials acted negligently. Plaintiffs allegations span more than three years, yet Plaintiff identifies only a few incidents of general population inmates (only two of which are described as dangerous) in protective management. <em>See Zatler v. Wainwright, </em>802 F.2d 397, 403 (11th Cir.1986) (holding that no deliberate indifference existed even though \u201c \u2018on at least one occasion,\u2019 while in protective custody, [the plaintiff-prisoner] was housed with another inmate who physically attacked him\u201d). Accordingly, Plaintiff fails to allege facts demonstrating deliberate indifference, and we affirm dismissal of Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">B. Count II: Fourteenth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Count II alleges that prison officials violated the Fourteenth Amendment by denying Plaintiff equal protection. Liberally construed, the complaint alleges (1) that several defendants violated Plaintiffs equal protection right by failing to \u201cre-recommend[ ]\u201d Plaintiff for interstate transfer and (2) that Sneed violated Plaintiffs equal protection right by failing to approve Plaintiff for interstate transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">In a \u201cnormal equal protection case,\u201d a plaintiff alleges discrimination on the basis of the plaintiffs \u201cbelonging] to a protected class such as race or gender.\u201d <em>Griffin Indus., Inc. v. Irvin, </em>496 F.3d 1189, 1200 (11th Cir.2007). However, the complaint in this action alleges only a \u201cclass of one\u201d claim. \u201c[A] \u2018class of one\u2019 claim involves a plaintiff who \u2018alleges that she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.\u2019\u201d Id<em>. </em>at 1202. \u201cTo be \u2018similarly situated,\u2019 the comparators [similarly situated persons] must be <em>\u2018\u2018prima facie identical in all relevant respects.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Grider v. City of Auburn, Ala., </em>618 F.3d 1240, 1264 (11th Cir.2010). And a plaintiff must allege more than \u201cbroad generalities in identifying a comparator.\u201d <em>Griffin Indus., </em>496 F.3d at 1204. Thus, a \u201c\u2018class of one\u2019 plaintiff might fail to state a claim by omitting key factual details in alleging that it is \u2018similarly situated\u2019 to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">Neither of Plaintiff\u2019s equal protection claims identifies a comparator. Instead, for the first claim (that is, the claim that a prison official failed to \u201cre-recommend\u201d Plaintiff for transfer), Plaintiff states only that \u201cother similarly situated inmates ... were re-recommended\u201d for transfer. The complaint\u2019s \u201c\u2018labels and conclusions\u2019 ... will not do.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Instead, Plaintiff must plead facts, not labels, demonstrating that the other inmates are similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">For Plaintiff\u2019s second claim (that is, the claim that Sneed failed to approve Plaintiffs transfer request), the complaint\u2019s most detailed allegation identifies as a comparator only \u201cother\u201d protective management \u201cinmate(s)\u201d who were \u201clabeled informants (snitches)\u201d and who \u201cwere ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>not having any issues while they were on [protective management] status.\u201d Plaintiffs allegation is more detailed but nonetheless deficient. Plaintiffs broad generalities not only fail to identify a specific comparator but also fail to describe the comparator\u2019s characteristics \u201cthat would be relevant to an objectively reasonable governmental decisionmaker.\u201d <em>Griffin Indus., </em>496 F.3d at 1207. Most importantly, Plaintiffs complaint fails to identify threats facing the comparators.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">\u201cDifferent treatment of dissimilarly situated persons does not violate the equal protection clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, a complaint must identify sufficient facts about a comparator to determine whether the comparator is similarly situated. Plaintiffs complaint fails to satisfy that burden, and we affirm dismissal of Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">C. Count III: First Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Count III alleges that \u201cDefendant(s)\u201d violated the First Amendment by re-confining Plaintiff in retaliation for Plaintiffs complaints about his prison setting.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">To state a First Amendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must allege facts establishing that \u201c(1) his speech was constitutionally protected; (2) [he] suffered adverse action such that the official\u2019s allegedly retaliatory conduct would likely deter a person of ordinary firmness from engaging in such speech; and (3) there is a causal relationship between the retaliatory action [the disciplinary punishment] and the protected speech [the grievance].\u201d <em>O\u2019Bryant v. Finch, </em>637 F.3d 1207, 1212 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">As discussed above, Plaintiff alleged that prison officials re-confined Plaintiff in retaliation for his complaints. Plaintiffs claim satisfies the first element of a First Amendment retaliation claim because \u201can inmate is considered to be exercising his First Amendment right of freedom of speech when he complains to the prison\u2019s administrators about the conditions of his confinement.\u201d <em>Id.; accord Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1112 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cFirst Amendment rights to free speech and to petition the government for a redress of grievances are .violated when a prisoner is punished for filing a grievance concerning the conditions of his imprisonment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">Plaintiffs claim satisfies the second element because he alleged that he was subjected to disciplinary confinement for his complaints. <em>See Smith v. Mosley, </em>532 F.3d 1270, 1277 (11th Cir.2008) (concluding that 45 days\u2019 disciplinary segregation \u201c \u2018would likely deter a prisoner of ordinary firmness\u2019 from complaining about the conditions of his confinement\u201d); <em>Thaddeus-X v. Blatter, </em>175 F.3d 378, 396 (6th Cir.1999) (\u201cIn the prison context, an action comparable to transfer to administrative segregation would certainly be adverse.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">Plaintiff satisfies the third element, causal connection, with at least two allegations. First, Plaintiff alleges that on August 6, 2012 \u2014 after a long series of persistent complaints from Plaintiff, his family, and his friends \u2014 Plaintiff submitted \u201can inmate request in reference to the [interstate] transfer.\u201d With that request for transfer, Plaintiff \u201casked that the [Florida Department of Corrections] rules be adhered to and that a written response to the inmate request ... be provided.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>very next day, prison officials re-confined Plaintiff. That temporal proximity can imply causation, particularly at the motion-to-dismiss stage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, when Plaintiff submitted the August 6 request \u2014 one day before his second confinement began\u2014 Craven seemingly ignored Plaintiffs request and instead responded, \u201c[W]e have a place for you.\u201d But that place turned out to be disciplinary confinement, not a transfer. Together, for purposes of dismissal, the temporal proximity and Craven\u2019s statement satisfy the causation element.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Yet, although Plaintiff stated a claim for First Amendment retaliation in Count III, as a general matter, he fails to support this claim as to each of the eleven-named defendants. The sole allegations sufficient to suggest causation apply only to Craven and Schweinsberg. That is, Plaintiff delivered his August 6 complaint to Craven and Schweinsberg; Craven responded, \u201c[W]e have a place for you\u201d; and one day later, Craven and Schweinsberg recommended Plaintiffs re-confinement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation that Count III be dismissed, and the district court\u2019s subsequent adoption of that recommendation, result from a misunderstanding of the particular confinement that Plaintiff asserts to have been retaliatory. The magistrate judge construed the complaint to be alleging that the first confinement on June 12, 2012 was retaliatory. And so interpreting the complaint, the magistrate judge concluded that even had Plaintiff sufficiently alleged facts sufficient to infer causation \u2014 which was not at all <em>certain </em>\u2014 O\u2019Bryant <em>v. Finch, </em>637 F.3d 1207 (11th Cir.2011), precluded Plaintiffs claim. Specifically, Plaintiffs first confinement followed on the heels of a finding that he had committed a disciplinary infraction. <em>O\u2019Bryant </em>held that \u201c[i]f a prisoner is found guilty of an actual disciplinary infraction after being afforded due process <em>and </em>there was evidence to support the disciplinary panel\u2019s fact finding, the prisoner cannot later state a retaliation claim against the prison employee who reported the infraction in a disciplinary report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Although there is some support within the complaint for the magistrate judge\u2019s construction of the claim as focusing on only the first confinement,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>also states that the second confinement on August 7 constituted \u201cblatant retaliation.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Further, in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, Plaintiff pointed out the magistrate judge\u2019s misunderstanding of what Plaintiff had alleged. Plaintiff admitted that the complaint alleges that the June 12 (first) confinement constituted retaliation, but he also stated that he \u201cis <em>\u2018not\u2019 </em>arguing as an issue (claim) in th[e] complaint [that] the erroneous disciplinary report [constituted retaliation] because though it was an erroneous disciplinary report he was found guilty by the disciplinary team.\u201d In other words, although Plaintiff believed that the June 12 confinement constituted retaliation, he had not alleged that this confinement supported his First Amendment retaliation claim. Instead, as Plaintiffs objection further explains, the complaint identifies his August 7 (second) confinement as the retaliation that underlies his claim. Plaintiffs objection supports his argument by identifying several allegations demonstrating that the August 7 confinement constitutes retaliation. For example, Plaintiff identifies several of the allegations discussed above as supporting an inference of causation: (1) the temporal proximity between Plaintiffs August 6 complaint and his August 7 confinement and (2) Craven\u2019s August 6 statement \u201c[W]e have a place for you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Because the magistrate judge and district judge failed to focus on the particular confinement underlying the claim of retaliation and because Plaintiff stated a claim based on this particular confinement, we reverse as to the district court\u2019s dismissal of this claim of retaliation in violation of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">D. Count IV: Fifth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">Count IV alleges that \u201cDefendant(s)\u201d violated Plaintiffs Fifth Amendment right to access the courts by refusing to forward Plaintiffs legal work after his transfer.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiff alleges that the refusal caused him to miss a deadline to appeal in another action.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">\u201c[I]n order to assert a claim arising from the denial of meaningful access to the courts, [a plaintiff] must first establish an actual injury.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Barbour v. Haley, </em>471 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>F.3d 1222, 1225 (11th Cir.2006). To allege an actual injury, the complaint \u201cmust identify a \u2018nonfrivolous,\u2019 \u2018arguable\u2019 underlying claim.\u201d <em>Christopher v. Harbury, </em>536 U.S. 403, 415, 122 S.Ct. 2179, 153 L.Ed.2d 413 (2002). More specifically, the complaint must describe the underlying claim \u201cwell enough to apply the \u2018nonfrivolous\u2019 test and to show that the \u2018arguable\u2019 nature of the underlying claim is more than hope.\u201d <em>Cunningham v.
