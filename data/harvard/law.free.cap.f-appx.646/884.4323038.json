The district court ruled that Cortes-Castro voluntarily forfeited the property and waived any challenge to the forfeiture by pleading guilty to a crime connected to the property. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-21\">The district court did not err by denying Cortes-Castro\u2019s motion because he no longer had a possessory interest in the property. After his arrest, Cortes-Castro agreed in writing to \u201cabandon all claim to ... and waive any further rights [to] proceedings relative to\u201d several cellular telephones and laptop computers and a camera. Later, Cortes-Castro pleaded guilty based on a written agreement in which he consented \u201cto forfeit to the United States voluntarily and immediately all of his right, title and interest in the cash, cellular telephones, and computers that were\u201d used or purchased with the proceeds of his sex trafficking offense. Cortes-Castro argues that he was not given adequate notice of the forfeiture, in violation of his right to due process under the Fifth Amendment, but Cortes-Castro waived any challenge that he could have made to the seizure of the property when he entered his plea of guilty. <em>See United States v. Patti, </em>337 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2003). And Cortes-Castro declined to challenge his order of forfeiture, though he could have done so on direct appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 32.2(b)(4)(A); <em>United States v. Petrie, </em>302 F.3d 1280, 1284 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>We AFFIRM the denial of Cortes-Castro\u2019s motion to reclaim property.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
