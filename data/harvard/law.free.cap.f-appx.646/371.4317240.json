This court must examine the basis of its own jurisdiction, sua sponte, if necessary. <em>See Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A timely notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement in a civil case. <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-20\">Bowden\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely. It was not filed within 30 days of the district court\u2019s order denying injunctive relief or the judgment dismissing the case. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a); Fed. R.\u00c1p?. P. 4(a)(1). Even if Bowden\u2019s post-judgment motion for time to file objections were considered a motion under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4)(A) that served to suspend the start of the period for filing a notice of appeal, the district court\u2019s order denying the motion was entered more than 30 days before the date of Bowden\u2019s notice of appeal. In light of the untimeliness of Bowden\u2019s notice of appeal, we lack jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-21\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should hot be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
