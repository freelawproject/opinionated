Halkitis, Assistant State Attorney Ryan McGee, retired Major Crimes Detective Mark Moe, and Deputy Clerk of Court Brenda McBel. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court concluded that Armstrong\u2019s allegations about the violation of his constitutional rights during a state criminal proceeding failed to state a claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-18\">Judges and prosecutors ordinarily enjoy absolute immunity from suits about actions taken in their official capacities. Judges enjoy absolute immunity for all actions taken in their judicial capacity except when taken in a \u201cclear absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Bolin v. Story, </em>225 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Absolute judicial immunity \u201capplies even when [a] judge\u2019s acts are in error, malicious, or were in excess of his or her jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Prosecutors also enjoy absolute immunity for actions undertaken in the course of initiating a prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1242. But a prosecutor is not immune from suit if he knowingly makes false statements of fact in an affidavit. <em>Jones v. Cannon, </em>174 F.3d 1271, 1282 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-19\">The district court correctly dismissed Armstrong\u2019s complaint. Armstrong alleged that Judge Andrews credited testimony that he knew was false during a pretrial hearing, but the judge is entitled to absolute immunity for actions performed in the exercise of his official duties. <em>See Bolin, </em>225 F.3d at 1239; <em>Sibley v. Lando, </em>437 F.3d 1067, 1070 (11th Cir. 2005). Prosecutor Halkitis is not liable for allegedly using false affidavits to secure a warrant for Armstrong\u2019s , arrest because that act waS\u2018 undertaken in her role as an advocate for the State. <em>See Bolin, </em>225 F.3d at 1242. Armstrong did not allege that Halkitis knew the affidavits were false. And Halkitis is not liable for false statements that Armstrong alleged were made by Detective Moe. <em>See Jones, </em>174 F.3d at 1282. Armstrong has waived any challenge that he could have made to the dismissal of his complaints against the remaining members of the prosecution team. <em>See Henry v. Warden, </em>750 F.3d 1226, 1232 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>(11th Cir.2014). Armstrong does not dispute that he failed to state a claim against Detective Moe or that Assistant State Attorney McGee and Deputy Clerk McBel are immune from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Armstrong\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
