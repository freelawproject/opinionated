After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b768-15\">In 2003, a jury convicted Defendant of one count of conspiracy to import at least five kilograms of cocaine,, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a), 960(b)(1)(B), 963 (\u201cCount One\u201d); one count of attempting to import at least five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 952(a), 960(b)(1)(B), 963 (\u201cCount Two\u201d); one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(ii), 846 (\u201cCount Three\u201d); \u25a0 one count of possession with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(ii) (\u201cCount Four\u201d); and one count of attempted reentry into the United States after deportation subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) (\u201cCount Five\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-16\">In anticipation of sentencing, the probation officer prepared a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). Applying the 2002 Sentencing Guidelines, the PSR assigned Defendant a base offense level of 36, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2), because he was responsible for at least 50 but less than 150 kilograms of cocaine (60.12 kilograms).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>receive any other enhancements or adjustments, Defendant\u2019s total offense level was 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Defendant received three criminal history points, based on his 1998 conviction at the age of 19 for manslaughter with a firearm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also received an additional two criminal history points because he committed the present offenses while serving a term of probation, which resulted in a total of five criminal history points and a criminal history category of III. Based on a total offense level of 86 and a criminal history category of III, Defendant\u2019s advisory guideline range was 235 to 293 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">At sentencing, the Government asserted that a sentence at the high end of the guideline range was appropriate. In particular, Defendant had a lengthy criminal reeord, including seven felony convictions that had not been fully taken into account by his criminal history category because he began committing crimes at the age of 11. The district court explained that Defendant\u2019s history indicated that he might not be able to rehabilitate himself, as he began committing crimes at a young age and had committed progressively more serious crimes leading up to his manslaughter conviction. And although he had not been arrested in the past six years, he was either incarcerated or out of the country during that time. Moreover, Defendant committed the present drug offenses within three years of being deported, and the drug offenses were serious, as they involved 60 kilograms of cocaine. Stating that a sentence at the high end of the guideline range was necessary to deter individuals like Defendant, the district court sentenced him to 288 months\u2019 imprisonment as to each of Counts One through Four, and 240 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count Five, to be served concurrently. We affirmed Defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>124 Fed.Appx. 640 (11th Cir. 2004) (Table).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">In 2015, Defendant filed a pro <em>se </em>motion for a reduction in sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 782. He argued that Amendment 782 lowered his total offense level from 36 to 34, which reduced his guideline range to 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment, He requested that the district court reduce his sentence to 188 months, in light of his post-sentencing conduct, which demonstrated rehabilitation in both his behavior and thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">The district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that, although Amendment 782 reduced Defendant\u2019s guideline range, a reduction was not warranted in light of Defendant\u2019s history and characteristics. Specifically, Defendant committed the present drug offenses while attempting to illegally re-enter the United States, and he had previously been deported after his felony convictions for burglary of a conveyance, aggravated assault with a 'deadly weapon, and manslaughter with a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">Defendant now appeals from that decision, arguing that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. He asserts that the district court erred by failing to calculate his amended guideline range under Amendment 782, and by failing to consider his post-sentencing rehabilitative conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a sentence reduction under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Janes, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a term of imprisonment when the original sentencing range has been subsequently lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). To be eligible for a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a. defendant must identify an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines that is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). Amendment 782 reduced the base offense level for most drug offenses by two levels. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(d); U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 782 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">A district court must follow a two-step process in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the district court must \u201cdetermin[e] a new 'base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At this step, all other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain the same. <em>Id. </em>Second, the district court must decide whether, in its discretion and in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to retain the original sentence or to resen-tence the defendant under the amended guideline range.. <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Defendant\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction. First, the district court correctly conducted the first step of the analysis by substituting the amended guideline range for the original sentencing guideline range. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780. Contrary to Defendant\u2019s assertion on appeal that the district court did not calculate his amended guideline range under Amendment 782, the district court explicitly stated that Amendment 782 reduced Defendant\u2019s guideline range.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">Although Defendant was eligible for a sentence reduction, the district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that a reduction was not warranted based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. As correctly noted by the district court, Defendant committed the present drug offenses while attempting to illegally re-enter the United States, and Defendant had previously, been deported after his convictions for burglary of a conveyance, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and manslaughter with a firearm. The circumstances surrounding the present drug offenses involved Defendant throwing two bags containing 60.12 kilograms of cocaine from a boat headed toward the United States, while the operator of the boat attempted to flee law enforcement. What\u2019s more is that Defendant was wearing a body armor vest during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>commission of the drug offenses. Defendant also had a lengthy criminal record, including several violent crimes, which extended back to when he was 11 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">We also reject Defendant\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion by failing to consider his rehabilitative conduct. While the district court was permitted to consider post-sentencing conduct, it was not required to do so. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201c[T]he district court ... may consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, in evaluating whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence is warranted and the extent of any such reduction.\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. l(B)(iii)). And although the district court did not explicitly discuss each \u00a7 3558(a) factor, the record shows that the district court considered the relevant factors, given its reference to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and its statements regarding Defendant\u2019s criminal history and the nature and circumstances of the present drug offenses. <em>See Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256 (stating that the district court need not discuss each factor, so long as the record demonstrates that the relevant factors were considered). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision to deny Defendant\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-10\">. The PSR grouped Counts One through Four, pursuant to U.S.S.G, \u00a7 3D1.2(d), because the offense level was based largely on the amount of cocaine involved. Given that the total offense level for Counts One through Four was nine levels higher than the offense level for Count Five, Count Five did not increase the offense level under U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>\u00a7 3D1.4(c). Thus, the guidelines were calculated pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b769-14\">. After completing his sentence for manslaughter, Defendant was removed to the Bahamas,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b770-6\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed education or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b770-11\">. Indeed, Defendant\u2019s original guideline range was 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, Amendment 782 reduced his offense level from 36 to 34, which, when combined with his criminal history category of III, his amended guideline range was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 782 (2014); <em>see also Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
