(JPMorgan) and CPCC Delaware Business Trust (CPCC)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking damages under the Fair Debt Collections Practice Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692. After the district court converted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Pinson\u2019s second amended complaint to a motion for summary judgment, it granted the defendants summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pinson appeals, We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Chaparro v. Carnival Corp., </em>693 F.3d 1333, 1335 (11th Cir.2012). We accept the complaint\u2019s allegations as true and construes them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>The factual allegations in the complaint must be sufficient to \u201craise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)1 Further, the complaint must contain sufficient factual matter \u201cto state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 570, 127 S.Ct. at 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">To state a plausible FDCPA claim, \u201ca plaintiff must allege, among other things, (1) that the defendant is a debt collector and (2) that the challenged conduct is related to debt collection.\u201d <em>Reese v. Ellis, Painter, Ratterree &amp; Adams LLP, </em>678 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2012). Obligations to pay a residential mortgage qualify as \u201cdebt\u201d for purposes of the FDCPA. <em>Id. </em>at 1216-17. When determining whether a communication is \u201cin connection with the collection of any debt,\u201d courts look to the language of the letters in question\u2014 specifically to statements that demand payment and discuss additional fees if payment is.not tendered. <em>Caceres v. McCalla Raymer, LLC, </em>755 F.3d 1299, 1302 (11th Cir.2014); <em>see also Reese, </em>678 F.3d at 1217. A communication can have more than one purpose \u2014 for example, providing information to a debtor as well as collecting a debt. <em>Reese, </em>678 F.3d at 1217. A demand for payment need not be expressed. A letter may imply a demand for payment if it states the amount of the debt, describes how the debt may be paid, provides the phone number to call and address to send the payment to, and expressly states that the letter is for the purpose of collecting a debt. <em>Caceres, </em>755 F.3d at 1303 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">We conclude that Pinson\u2019s second amended complaint failed to allege that JPMorgan or CPCC attempted to collect a debt, and thus, did not sufficiently plead facts to state a FDCPA claim. <em>Reese, </em>678 F.3d at 1216. The second amended complaint made the general statement that CPCC and JPMorgan were debt collectors for purposes of the FDCPA, and that JPMorgan directly or indirectly engaged in the collection of an alleged debt for a third party, but it did not allege any specific actions taken by either CPCC or JPMorgan. Thus, Pinson failed to allege that any \u201cchallenged conduct [was] related to debt collection\u201d because his complaint lacked any facts about CPCC or JPMor-gan\u2019s conduct as it related to him or his debt. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Rioux v. City of Atlanta, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number><em>Ga., </em>520 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cSummary judgment is rendered \u2018if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In making this assessment, we must view all evidence and all factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and must resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the nonmovant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a dispute over a material fact. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The burden then shifts to the non-moving party, who may not rest upon mere allegations, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); <em>Eberhardt v. Waters, </em>901 F.2d 1578, 1580 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The FDCPA imposes civil liability on \u201cdebt collectors\u201d for certain prohibited debt-collection practices. <em>Harris v. Liberty Cmty. Mgmt., Inc., </em>702 F.3d 1298, 1299 (11th Cir.2012). The FDCPA defines a \u201cdebt collector,\u201d in relevant part, as one who engages \u201cin any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or. who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6); <em>Harris, </em>702 F.3d at 1302, The term \u201cdebt collector\u201d as used in the FDCPA does not include \u201cany person collecting or attempting to collect any debt owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another to the extent such activity ... concerns a debt which was originated by such person.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">Rule 902(4) of the Federal Rules of Evidence states that \u201ca copy of an official record \u2014 or a copy of a document that was recorded or filed in a public office as authorized by law \u2014 if the copy is certified as correct by the custodian or another person authorized to make the certification\u201d is self-authenticating. Fed.R.Evid. 902(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment on Pinson\u2019s FDCPA claim against Chase. First, Chase presented a certified copy of the mortgage, filed in Palm Beach County, Florida, showing that Pinson borrowed funds from it in December 2005, While Pinson argues that the mortgage was not authenticated, as a certified copy of a public record it is self-authenticating. Fed.R.Evid. 902(4). . In short, Chase was the lender on Pinson\u2019s mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">Second, because Chase was the lender, Pinson\u2019s argument that Chase was a debt collector for purposes of the FDCPA fails. Section 1692a(6)(F) exempts original creditors, such as Chase, from its definition of debt collector. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6)(F). Third, the district court did not improperly disregard an affidavit supplied by Pinson in opposition to summary judgment. At the summary judgment hearing, the court thoroughly considered the affidavit and questioned Pinson as to its contents, giving him the opportunity to explain the affidavit and what triable issues it created. Pin-son\u2019s unsupported statement that he did not believe Chase was the originator of his loan was insufficient to create a triable issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s summary judgment is AF<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>FIRMED.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-15\">. Four of the letters were communications from Pinson and are irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\">. Pinson also sued a law firm engaged by Chase to collect a debt he owed. He subsequently dismissed that defendant from the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b840-8\">. Invoking the district court\u2019s supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367, Pinson also sought relief under the Florida Consumer Collections Practices Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 559.72. After entering judgment against Pinson on the FCCPA claims, the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and dismissed the \u00a7 559.72 claims without prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b842-19\">. Pinson contends that the court abused its discretion in denying him an opportunity to amend his second amended complaint. The amendment would have been futile; hence, no abuse of discretion occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
