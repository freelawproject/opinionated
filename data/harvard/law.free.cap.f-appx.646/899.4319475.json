On appeal, he argues that counsel in his direct appeal was ineffective for failing to argue that these convictions violated double jeopardy. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">After a 41-day jury trial, Fernandez was convicted of 15 counts under Florida law related to a criminal auto theft enterprise. Count 15 alleged that from March 9 through March 28, 2004, Fernandez, Carlos Torres, and Luis Manuel Planas conspired to submit false and fraudulent insurance claims. Count 2 alleged that from December 2, 2003 through April 22, 2004, Fernandez and eight other individuals, not including Planas, conspired to commit racketeering. Count 2 included the insurance fraud conspiracy from Count 15 as one of many \u201cPredicate Incident[s].\u201d Doc. 19-1 at 183.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, Count 2 alleged that from March 9 through March 28, 2004, Fernandez conspired with Torres and Planas to submit false and fraudulent insurance claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">Fernandez appealed. His counsel raised two arguments, both of which a panel of Florida\u2019s Fourth District Court of Appeals (\u201cDCA\u201d) rejected. Fernandez\u2019s counsel did not argue, however, that his convictions on Counts 2 and 15 violated his right against double jeopardy. The Fourth DCA affirmed Fernandez\u2019s convictions and sentence. <em>Fernandez v. State, </em>21 So.3d 155 (Fla. 4th DCA 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">Fernandez then filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for writ of habeas corpus in Florida\u2019s Fourth DCA, alleging that his appellate counsel was ineffective. Fernandez recognized that, generally, Florida applies the <em>Blockburger</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>test for determining if multiple convictions for offenses arising out of the same criminal conduct amount to double jeopardy. Fernandez argued, however, that the <em>Blockburger </em>test does not apply to a conspiracy case. Indeed, the Florida Supreme Court held after <em>Block-burger </em>that \u201ca single conspiracy may have for its object the violation of two or more criminal laws or two or more substantive offenses.\u201d <em>Brown v. State, </em>130 Fla. 479, 178 So. 153, 156 (1938). The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>The conspiracy is one offense and a single offense, no matter how many repeated violations of the law may have been the object of the conspiracy. And so one may not be convicted or acquitted of a conspiracy to accomplish a certain criminal act and again be put in jeopardy for the trial for the offense of the same conspiracy to commit a different criminal act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-5\"><em>Id. </em>Relying on two recent cases from Florida\u2019s Second DCA, Fernandez argued that his convictions on Counts 2 and 15 violated the prohibition against double jeopardy. <em>See Negron Gil de Rubio v. State, </em>987 So.2d 217, 219 (Fla. 2d DCA 2008) (citing <em>Brown, </em>178 So. at 156); <em>Durden v. State, </em>901 So.2d 967, 968 (Fla. 2d DCA 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The Fourth DCA denied Fernandez\u2019s habeas petition. The court explained that Fernandez\u2019s case was \u201cdistinguishable from the situation presented in <em>Negron </em>... and the other cases upon which [he] relie[d].\u201d Doc. 22-6 at 603. \u201cUnlike the defendants in [those] cases,\u201d the court continued, \u201cPetitioner entered distinct agreements to engage in distinct criminal offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court found that the conspiracy to commit insurance fraud in Count 15 involved a separate and distinct agreement from the conspiracy to commit racketeering charged in Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Fernandez next filed this <em>pro se </em>federal habeas petition, raising several arguments including the double jeopardy ineffective assistance claim. The magistrate judge recommended granting habeas relief on the double jeopardy ineffective assistance basis only, but the district court disagreed. The district court reasoned that because the Fourth DCA \u201caddressed and rejected the same double-jeopardy argument that Fernandez claims his counsel should have raised on direct appeal [to the Fourth DCA,] ... Fernandez cannot show that this argument \u201cwould have a reasonable probability of success on appeal.\u2019 \u201d Doc. 28 at 5 (quoting <em>Heath v. Jones, </em>941 F.2d 1126, 1132 (11th Cir.1991)). The court denied Fernandez\u2019s habeas petition and declined to issue a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">Fernandez filed a motion for' a COA in this Court. We granted his motion to address his claim that appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the double jeopardy issue. We subsequently appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district- court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition. <em>Ward v. Hall, </em>592 F.3d 1144, 1155 (11th Cir.2010). A district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, and mixed questions of law and fact, such as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, are reviewed <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">If a state court adjudicated a claim on the merits, a federal court may grant ha-beas relief only if the decision of the state court (1) \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established [flederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\u201d or (2) \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the [s]tate court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). A state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d federal law if \u201cthe state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than th[e] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state court\u2019s decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>law only if the state court\u2019s application of the law was objectively unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Likewise, \u201ca state-court factual determination is not unreasonable merely because the federal habeas court would have reached a different conclusion in the first instance.\u201d <em>Wood v. Allen, </em>558 U.S. 290, 301, 130 S.Ct. 841, 175 L.Ed.2d 738 (2010). \u201c[E]ven if reasonable minds reviewing the record might disagree about the finding in question ... that does not suffice to supersede the [state] court\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Fernandez argues that Florida\u2019s Fourth DCA\u2019s denial of his habeas petition was an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), which articulated the constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in a criminal case. <em>See Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>563 U.S. 170, 189, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011). To demonstrate that counsel\u2019s assistance was so defective that it requires reversal, a defendant must allege facts showing that: (1) his counsel \u201cmade errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. This standard applies to claims that counsel on direct appeal was constitutionally ineffective. <em>See Cross v. United States, </em>893 F.2d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Under the performance prong of <em>Strickland, </em>counsel\u2019s representation is judged by a standard of \u201creasonableness under prevailing professional norms,\u201d and there is a \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct [fell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688-89, 104 S.Ct. 2052, The petitioner \u201cmust establish that no competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take.\u201d <em>Callahan v. Campbell, </em>427 F.3d 897, 933 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the context of a direct appeal, our inquiry is whether \u201ccounsel unreasonably failed to discover nonfrivo-lous issues and to file a merits brief raising them.\u201d <em>Smith v. Robbins, </em>528 U.S. 259, 286, 120 S.Ct. 746, 145 L.Ed.2d 756 (2000). Because judicial review of counsel\u2019s performance is already \u201chighly deferential,\u201d a federal habeas court\u2019s review of a state court decision denying a <em>Strickland </em>claim on the deficient performance prong is thus \u201cdoubly deferential.\u201d <em>See Pinholster, </em>563 U.S. at 190, 131 S.Ct. 1388 (internal quotation marks omitted). The pertinent inquiry under \u00a7 2254(d) \u201cis whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland\u2019s deferential standard.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 105, 131 S.Ct. 770, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). If a court determines that the defendant has failed to establish the performance prong, it need not address the prejudice prong. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">Fernandez\u2019s appellate counsel was not constitutionally deficient for failing to argue on direct appeal that Fernandez\u2019s conspiracy convictions violated double jeopardy. Fernandez argues that his appellate counsel could have persuaded the Fourth DCA to adopt the rule of the Second DCA, as articulated in <em>Negron, </em>that <em>Blockburger </em>does not apply to conspiracy claims. But this argument misses the mark. The Fourth DCA did not reject the-rule articulated in <em>Negron. </em>Instead, the court reasoned that cases like <em>Negron </em>simply do not apply to the facts in'this ease, because unlike in <em>Negron, </em>here Fernandez entered into two separate agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">The Fourth\u2019s DCA\u2019s factual determination that Fernandez\u2019s conspiracy convictions arose out of separate and distinct agreements was not unreasonable in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>light of the evidence in the record. \u25a0 The two conspiracy counts charged in Counts 2 and 15 involved a different span of time \u25a0and different individuals. Specifically, Count 2 included eight individuals in addition to Fernandez but not Luis Manuel Planas, and charged conduct from December 2, 2003 through April 20 2004. Count 15, in contrast, alleged an agreement among Fernandez, Planas and Torres to engage in insurance fraud during a much narrower window in March 2004. Thus, under Florida law, the two conspiracies charged separate offenses, and a conviction on both counts did not violate Fernandez\u2019s right against double jeopardy. <em>C.f. Mathes v. State, </em>106 So.3d 73, 75 (Fla. 2d DCA 2013) (holding that a conspiracy to deliver heroin was subsumed into a conspiracy to commit racketeering because both charges named a conspiracy to commit heroine as an objective, the same individuals were implicated in both offenses, and the two conspiracies allegedly occurred during the same time frame).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">For these reasons, Fernandez\u2019s double jeopardy argument was meritless. \u201cA lawyer cannot be deficient for failing to raise a meritless claim.\u201d <em>Freeman v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>536 F.3d 1225, 1233 (11th Cir.2008). Accordingly, Fernandez cannot demonstrate that the Fourth DCA\u2019s determination that counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally adequate was unreasonable. We thus affirm without addressing prejudice. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-10\">.
