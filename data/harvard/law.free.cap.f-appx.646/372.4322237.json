The district court sentenced Serrano-Estrada to 27 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">Serrano-Estrada contends that the district court erred in denying his request for a minor-role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). That section provides for a two-level reduction \u201c[i]f the defendant was a minor participant in [the] criminal activity.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Whether Serrano-Estrada was a minor participant is a factual determination that is reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Alaniz, </em>726 F.3d 586, 626 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">The record reflects that Serrano-Estrada was recruited by \u201cChacon,\u201d an unindict-ed co-conspirator from Mexico, to transport six undocumented aliens in exchange for $50 per alien. Serrano-Estrada, in turn, recruited co-defendant Leticia Rodriguez for the purposes of harboring and concealing the undocumented aliens at her home. It is undisputed that Serrano-Estrada transported the six undocumented aliens in his vehicle for the purpose of commercial advantage and private gain. As the driver, Serrano-Estrada\u2019s role was central to the transportation of the undocumented aliens and \u201ccoextensive with the conduct for which he was held accountable.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598-99 (5th Cir.2001). The district court did not clearly err in rejecting Serrano-Estrada\u2019s request for a minor-role adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-17\">Next, Serrano-Estrada asserts that his criminal history category is \u201cover represented or inadequate,\u201d but he does not present any factual or legal basis for his claim. \u201cA party that asserts an argument on appeal, but fails to adequately brief it, is deemed to have waived it.\u201d <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 446 (5th Cir.2010) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-18\">Finally, Serrano-Estrada challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of the $100 special assessment provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013. He argues that \u201cthis is unconstitutional and is based on no evidence.\u201d Such a claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Munoz-Flores, </em>495 U.S. 385, 401, 110 S.Ct. 1964, 109 L.Ed.2d 384 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-19\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
