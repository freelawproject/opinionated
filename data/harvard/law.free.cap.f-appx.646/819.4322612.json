Procter &amp; Gamble Co., </em>356 U.S. 677, 681 n. 6, 78 S.Ct. 983, 986 n. 6, 2 L.Ed.2d 1077 (1958) (quoting <em>United States v. Rose, </em>215 F.2d 617, 628-29 (3d Cir.1954)). Despite those concerns, Bernard Roemmele, who is serving a 235-month sentence in federal prison, wants to</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>be provided with- transcripts of the grand jury proceedings in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Roemmele was the CEO and founder of CitX, a company that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApNj\">claimed to have created internet-based technology and other software used by clients around the world. CitX partnered with Professional Resource Systems International, Inc. (\u201cPRSI\u201d) to market its software. In reality, however, the two companies operated as a Ponzi scheme. Reommele and [his co-conspirator Steve] Hein also participated in investment fraud using resources from PRSI.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-6\"><em>United States v. Hein, </em>395 Fed.Appx. 652, 654 (11th Cir.2010). A jury convicted Ro-emmele of securities fraud, conspiring to commit mail or wire fraud, conspiring to launder money, and violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">After we affirmed his convictions, Roe-melle moved the district court to compel production of the grand jury transcripts in his case so that he could investigate possible government misconduct. In his motion, he contended that the first grand jury to consider the case against him did not indict him because the hard drives from CitX\u2019s computers showed that the company had the technological capabilities it claimed. He theorized that, after the first grand jury declined to bring an indictment, the government must have destroyed the allegedly exculpatory hard drives and then sought an indictment from a new grand jury, which it ultimately got. Roemelle claimed that the government\u2019s alleged destruction of the hard drives violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), his Fifth Amendment right to due process, and his rights under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause, and that production of the transcripts was necessary for him \u201cto adequately prepare\u201d those claims to be part of his soon-to-be-filed habeas corpus petition,</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Roemmele requested that the government produce all grand jury transcripts showing: (1) why the first grand jury subpoenaed the production of CitX\u2019s hard drives; (2) that the government told the first grand jury that it intended to destroy the hard drives; (3) that the government informed the first grand jury that it no longer had custody of the hard drives; (4) that the government told the second grand jury about the evidence presented to the first grand jury; (5) that the government informed the second grand jury about the hard drives; and (6) that the government informed the second grand jury that it had discarded the hard drives so that they were no longer available. He said he \u201cbelieved\u201d no such transcripts existed, and that proof of their non-existence would support an inference that the government discarded the hard drives to hide from the second grand jury the exculpatory evidence they contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">The district court denied Roemmele\u2019s motion. It noted that the government had imaged the hard drives and made those images available to Roemelle at trial. The district court reasoned that, because Ro-emmele had access to the hard drive images \u2014 and, indeed, had argued about the contents of the hard drives during the trial \u2014 he had not established a \u201cpossible injustice\u201d or a \u201cneed for disclosure\u201d exceeding \u201cthe need for continued secrecy\u201d of the jury proceedings. Roemmele appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">Roemmele seeks disclosure of the grand jury materials \u201cbased both on the district court\u2019s inherent authority and on the exception in [Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure] 6(e)(3)(E)(i).\u201d Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(3)(E) authorizes the disclosure to defendants of grand jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>matters under limited circumstances. Courts also have inherent authority\" to compel production of grand jury materials on defendants\u2019 requests, but only where there are \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Aisenberg, </em>358 F.3d 1327, 1347 (11th Cir.2004). To justify entitlement to disclosure of grand jury materials under either Rule 6(e)(3)(E) or courts\u2019 inherent authority, movants must show: (1) \u201cthat the material they seek is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding\u201d; (2) \u201cthat the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy\u201d; and (3) \u201cthat their request is structured to cover only material so needed.\u201d <em>Douglas Oil Co. of California v. Petrol Stops Northwest, </em>441 U.S. 211, 222, 99 S.Ct. 1667, 1674, 60 L.Ed.2d 156 (1979); <em>Aisenberg, </em>358 F.3d at 1347-48. We review the district court\u2019s application of those requirements only for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 1338.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Roemmele\u2019s motion. There are a number reasons why. In the first place, Roemmele had access to the imaged hard drives at the time of trial, so it was not necessary for him to review the grand jury\u2019s transcripts to determine whether the hard drives actually contained exculpatory evidence. More fundamentally, there was considerable evidence in the record undercutting Roemmele\u2019s claims that the CitX hard drives contained exculpatory evidence and that the government destroyed them. During CitX\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings, for example, Roemelle admitted that the company had not produced any products that could be copyrighted or patented, and that there was no software, licenses, or other products that could be sold to benefit CitX\u2019s creditors. His admission logically forecloses the possibility that the hard drives contained the proprietary technology Roemmele now claims that they did. And evidence from the trial shows that, after imaging the hard drives, the government returned them to the trustee in charge of CitX\u2019s bankruptcy, instead of destroying them as Roemmele alleges. Even Roemmele\u2019s suggestion that the government withheld information about the hard drives from the second grand jury is pure speculation, unsupported by any of the materials accompanying his motion. For all of those reasons, Roemmele has not established a significant need for disclosure of the grand jury transcripts, at least not one that comes near to outweighing the vital interests in preserving the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Roemmele also argues that the district court could have preserved the secrecy of the grand jury\u2019s proceedings by examining the transcripts <em>in camera, </em>and that it abused its discretion by not doing so. For that proposition, his best case is the former Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Men-endez v. United States, </em>393 F.2d 312 (5th Cir.1968). That decision did not require <em>in camera </em>inspection of the requested materials, however; it merely described such inspections as the \u201cbetter practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316. Since <em>Menendez, </em>we have held that a district court need not undertake <em>in camera </em>review where, as here, a defendant fails to show the existence of a factual basis for his claim. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>765 F.2d 1546, 1559 (11th Cir. 1985). The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to sift through the grand jury transcripts <em>in camera.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">In his reply brief,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Roemmele argues that disclosure of the grand jury materials is warranted under Federal Rule of Crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>nal Procedure 6(e)(3)(E)(ii). Because he never made that argument to the district court or in his opening brief on appeal, he forfeited it. <em>See Reider v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., </em>793 F.3d 1254, 1258 (11th Cir. 2015); <em>United States v. Noriega, </em>676 F.3d 1252, 1260 n. 2 (11th Cir.2012). Besides, it is not supported by the cases Roemmele cites. <em>Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States </em>concerned the circumstances under which a district court may dismiss an indictment for errors in grand jury proceedings, not the production of grand jury materials. <em>See </em>487 U.S. 250, 253, 108 S.Ct. 2369, 2372, 101 L.Ed.2d 228 (1988). And we vacated our opinion in <em>United States v. Sigma International, Inc., </em>244 F.3d 841 (11th Cir.2001), rendering it \u201cvoid\u201d and of \u201cno legal effect whatever.\u201d <em>United States v. Sigma Int'l, Inc., </em>300 F.3d 1278, 1280 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-5\">. Roemmele filed his reply brief after the deadline for doing so, but has moved this Court for permission to file a reply brief out of t\u00edme. <em>See </em>App. Doc. 30. We grant that motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
