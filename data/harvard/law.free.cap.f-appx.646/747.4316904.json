Ravizee argues that the administrative law judge gave insufficient weight to the opinion of his examining psychologist that he was mentally retarded. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 12.05(C). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-17\">The administrative law judge was entitled to discount the opinion of Dr. John Goff in determining whether Ravizee was mentally disabled. Dr. Goff examined Ravizee regarding his application for disability, <em>see id, </em>\u00a7 404.1527(c)(2)(i)-(ii) (providing that the length and extent of treatment affects the weight given a physician\u2019s opinion), and offered an opinion that was internally inconsistent, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(c)(4). Dr. Goff described Rav-izee as a \u201ccredible historian,\u201d but the doctor discredited Ravizee\u2019s work history and his description of his daily activities. Dr. Goff opined that Ravizee was moderately limited in his abilities to cope with coworkers, to handle customary work pressures, and to carry out simple instructions, yet the doctor acknowledged that the results of his personality assessment were \u201cinvalid\u201d and that Ravizee could understand and follow simple instructions. And Dr. Goffs opinion that Ravizee was incapable of performing activities of daily life or maintaining concentration, attention, or pace for two hours was inconsistent with Ravizee\u2019s statements about his extensive work history and his daily routine. <em>See Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1241 (11th Cir. 2004); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(2) (providing that an expert\u2019s opinion is given \u201ccontrolling weight\u201d if it is \u201cnot inconsistent with the other substantial evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-19\">Substantial evidence supports the finding of the administrative law judge that Ravizee was not mentally retarded. The administrative law judge considered Raviz-ee\u2019s work, medical, and educational records, his testimony, and opinion evidence and reasonably determined that the presumption of mental retardation created by Ravizee\u2019s intelligence score of 67 was rebutted by evidence of his adaptive functioning. <em>See Hodges v. Barnhart, </em>276 F.3d 1265, 1268-69 (11th Cir.2001) (stating that a claimant\u2019s low IQ scores create a presumption of mental retardation that may be rebutted with \u201cevidence of [the claimant\u2019s] daily life\u201d). Ravizee\u2019s accomplish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>ments and daily activities established that he could function independently. <em>See Lowery v. Sullivan, </em>979 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1992) (\u201c[A] valid I.Q. score need not be conclusive of mental retardation where the I.Q. score is inconsistent with other evidence in the record on the claimant\u2019s daily activities and behavior.\u201d). Rav-izee\u2019s work records reflected that he served in the Job Corps for two years and received certificates for carpentry and maintenance, obtained a job in construction for nine months, and then worked full-time for 12 years as a chain offbearer at a lumber company. Ravizee stated in a disability report that he stopped working because was laid off, not because he was incapacitated by his ailments. Ravizee also stated that he had never been treated or medicated for a mental condition. And Ravizee testified that he cooked, performed light housework, shopped for himself, paid bills, opened a savings account, counted his currency, had a driver\u2019s license, purchased vehicles and insurance, and walked or drove three to four times a week to stores, to socialize with friends, and to attend appointments and church services. The administrative law judge was entitled to consider the opinion of Dr. Sydney Garner, .a psychological expert, that Ravizee had borderline intellectual function because that diagnosis was more consistent with Ravizee\u2019s communication skills, his work history, and his daily life. <em>See id; see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(b), (e)(2)(h) (explaining that the Commissioner considers \u201cthe medical opinions in your case record together with the rest of the relevant evidence\u201d to determine whether an applicant is disabled).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">We AFFIRM the denial of Ravizee\u2019s application for benefits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
