California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record, including Brown\u2019s responses to counsel\u2019s motion, reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED. Brown\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and motions to discharge counsel and appoint new counsel are DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-20\">At sentencing, the district court pronounced a restitution amount of $1,230,021. However, that amount does not match the amount in the written judgment and the record contains no explanation for the discrepancy. We therefore AFFIRM Brown\u2019s conviction and sentence but REMAND with instructions to correct the clerical error in the written judgment. <em>See United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 822 (11th Cir.2006); Fed.R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-21\">MOTION TO WITHDRAW GRANTED. CONVICTION AND SENTENCE AFFIRMED; REMANDED FOR THE PURPOSE OF CORRECTING JUDGMENT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
