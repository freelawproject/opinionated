His main complaint was one of retaliation related to his efforts to challenge his criminal conviction and to make use of the prison grievance procedures in connection with three prison disciplinary proceedings and an unfavorable job assignment. He complains also that his right to due process was violated during the disciplinary proceedings. He has appealed the district court\u2019s order and judgment dismissing the complaint with prejudice as frivolous and without prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A; 28 U.S.U \u00a7 1915(e)(2); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c)(1). Our review is de novo. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-17\">A prison official may not retaliate against an inmate for accessing the courts or using a prison grievance procedure. <em>Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1164 (5th Cir.1995). \u201cTo state a valid claim for retaliation under section 1983, a prisoner must allege (1) a specific constitutional right, (2) the defendant\u2019s intent to retaliate against the prisoner for his or her exercise of that right, (3) a retaliatory adverse act, and (4) causation.\u201d <em>Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 764 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Coleman\u2019s arguments are wholly conclusional and are based primarily on his personal belief that he is the victim of retaliation. <em>See Woods, </em>60 F.3d at 1166; <em>see also Johnson v. Rodriguez, </em>110 F.3d 299, 310 (5th Cir.1997). He has not shown that the district court erred in disposing of his retaliation and due process claims. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-18\">We WARN Coleman that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous and as failing to state a claim upon which relief may be granted counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g) and that, if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
