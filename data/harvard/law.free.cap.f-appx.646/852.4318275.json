On appeal, Hardiman argues that, because he received a downward variance to the low end of the crack-cocaine guideline range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>that would have applied if he were not a career offender, he is eligible for a sentence reduction based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. 522, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011). He contends that <em>Freeman </em>abrogated our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir. 2008), in which we concluded that career offenders were not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on changes to the crack-cocaine guidelines. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Hardiman pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute fifty grams or more of crack cocaine. At his sentencing in 2009, the district court found that Hardiman had prior felony convictions that qualified him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Under the career-offender guideline range, Hardiman faced 262 to 327 months in prison. Nevertheless, the court found that the career-offender guideline, while technically applicable, produced an unreasonable sentencing range. The court therefore downwardly varied from that range, pursuant to <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and sentenced Hardiman to 130 months in prison \u2014 equivalent to the low end of the guideline range (130 to 162 months) produced by the crack-cocaine guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Since 2009, the Sentencing Commission has twice amended the drug-quantity table in \u00a7 2D1.1 to reduce the base offense levels applicable to crack-cocaine offenses. Hardiman first sought a sentence reduction in July 2012 after the Commission issued Amendment 750.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court found Hardiman ineligible for relief as a career offender and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">Hardiman next sought a sentence reduction in September 2014, which the district court construed as requesting a reduction under Amendment 782. The court again found Hardiman ineligible and denied the motion. The court explained that Amendment 782 did not apply because, \u201cAlthough the Court varied downward from the guidelines range, the Defendant was classified as a career offender and the Court\u2019s variance does not change the Defendant\u2019s career offender status.\u201d Doc. 564. Hardiman now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether- a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-16\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits district courts to reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment in the limited circumstances where the defendant was sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A defendant\u2019s eligibility for a sentence reduction is determined by calculating the \u201camended guideline range that would have been applicable\u201d if the retroactive amendment had been in effect at the defendant\u2019s original sentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). The amended guideline range is determined by substituting only the amended guideline for the one originally used. <em>Id.; see United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>A sentence reduction is not consistent with the policy of the Sentencing Commission \u2014 and therefore is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (providing that any sentence reduction must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d). The commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 explains that the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d is \u201cdetermined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\u201d U.S.S.G.'\u00a7 IBl.lOcmt. n. 1(A). The Supreme Court has held that a commentary provision \u201cwhich functions to interpret a guideline or explain how it is to be applied\u201d is binding as long as the commentary does not conflict with the Constitution, a federal statute, or the guideline at issue. <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 42-43, 45, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1917-19, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">In <em>Moore, </em>we explained that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) authorizes reductions to only those sentences that were \u201cbased on\u201d sentencing ranges that were subsequently lowered by a retroactive amendment. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327; <em>see id. </em>at 1326 (\u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment does not alter the sentencing range upon which a defendant\u2019s sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentence reduction.\u201d). Because Amendment 706 did not alter the career-offender offense levels, we concluded that it did not lower the sentencing range upon which a career offender\u2019s sentence had been based. <em>Id. </em>at 1327. We also noted that the commentary to \u00a7 lB1.10(a) \u201cma[de] clear\u201d that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction was not authorized where an amendment lowered a defendant\u2019s base offense level for the offense of conviction but not the career-offender sentencing range under which the defendant was sentenced. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A) (explaining \u25a0 that a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not consistent with the policy statement if the retroactive amendment \u201cis applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Nevertheless, we distinguished the facts in <em>Moore </em>from two out-of-circuit district court cases in which the sentencing courts, by applying a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, \u201creduced the defendants\u2019 offense levels to those that would be in effect absent the career offender guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1229-30. Those reduced offense levels were then used to determine the guideline ranges under which the defendants were sentenced. <em>Id. </em>Because Amendment 706 lowered the offense levels that were used to determine the applicable guideline ranges, we stated that \u201ca reduction in sentence is ' within \u2022 the district court\u2019s discretionary authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330. We found no similar circumstances with respect to the defendants in <em>Moore, </em>because there was no \u201cindication that the court based [the] sen-tenee[s] on the guideline range that would have applied absent the career offender designation.\u201d <em>Id,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">In <em>Freeman, </em>the Supreme Court addressed whether defendants who enter into Rule 11(c)(1)(C), Fed.R.Crim.P., plea agreements are eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. 131 S.Ct. at 2690. A four-justice plurality stated that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cshould be available to permit the district court to revisit a prior sentence to whatever extent the sentencing range in question was a relevant part of the analytic framework the judge used to determine the sentence or to approve the agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>2692-93. The plurality concluded that the judge\u2019s decision to accept a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea \u201cis likely to be based on the Guidelines; and when it is, the defendant should be eligible to seek \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2695.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">In an opinion concurring in the judgment, Justice Sotomayor determined that sentences imposed pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreements, as a general matter, were not \u201cbased on\u201d the guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 2696-97 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment). But a particular defendant may be eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief if the agreement \u201cexpressly uses a Guidelines sentencing range to establish the term of imprisonment, and that range is subsequently lowered by the Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2698 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In <em>Lawson, </em>we rejected the argument that <em>Freeman </em>overruled or abrogated our decision in <em>Moore. United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012). We explained that neither the plurality opinion nor Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence dealt with the issue presented in <em>Moore </em>\u2014 \u201cdefendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, <em>Moore </em>remains binding precedent in this Circuit. <em>Id. </em>at 1321; <em>see also United States v. Tellis, </em>748 F.3d 1305, 1309-10 (11th Cir.2014) (again rejecting the argument that <em>Freeman </em>overruled Moore).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Here, the district court properly denied Hardiman\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Despite Hardiman\u2019s contention that <em>Moore </em>has been abrogated by <em>Freeman, </em>we have held that <em>Moore </em>continues to be good law in this Circuit. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Because Hardiman was found to be a career offender and sentenced under \u00a7 4B1.1, Amendment 782 did not have the effect of lowering the guideline range upon which his sentence was based. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327. Amendment 782 lowered the crack-cocaine base offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1 but did nothing to the career-offender base offense levels in \u00a7 4B1.1. Accordingly, under <em>Moore </em>and <em>Lawson, </em>Amendment 782 did not alter the career-offender guideline range upon which his sentence was based, so a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is not authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">Acknowledging these general points, Hardiman counters that his sentence in fact was \u201cbased on\u201d the crack-cocaine guideline range because the sentencing court downwardly varied from the career-offender guideline range to the low end of the range calculated under \u00a7 2D1.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In similar circumstances, the Sixth Circuit held that a career offender was eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief when the sentencing judge varied from the career-offender guideline range to a range \u201cthat would have applied to [the defendant] under the crack cocaine guidelines if he were not a career offender.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>678 F.3d 442, 444-45 (6th Cir.2012). Even our decision in <em>Moore </em>suggested that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief may not be completely foreclosed to a career offender when there is an \u201cindication that the court based [the] sentence on the guideline range that would have applied absent the career offender designation.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">Nonetheless, commentary to the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reductions, which became effective in November 2011, fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>closes Hardiman\u2019s argument. Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), any sentence reduction must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and a reduction is not consistent with the Commission\u2019s policy statement if the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). The commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10, in turn, defines the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d as the range \u201cdetermined before consideration of ... any variance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A). Therefore, Hardiman\u2019s eligibility for a sentence reduction is determined before considering the downward variance he received at sentencing. In effect, the fact that Hardiman received a downward variance from the career-offender guideline range is irrelevant to his eligibility for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Hardiman asserts without further analysis that the commentary defining \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d is inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 '3582(c)(2) in <em>Freeman. </em>However, <em>Freeman </em>addressed the question of whether a term of imprisonment was \u201cbased on\u201d a sentencing range that has been lowered. <em>See </em>131 S.Ct. at 2690-91. <em>Freeman </em>did not address \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2019s other explicit requirement that any reduction must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The relevant commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 explains how to determine when a reduction is consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reductions \u2014 specifically when an amendment \u201clower[s] the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). The commentary does not interpret, and is not plainly inconsistent with, \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Accordingly, we reject Hardiman\u2019s argument on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">In sum, the district court properly denied Hardiman\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because he was sentenced as a career offender and Amendment 782 did not lower his applicable guideline range, even though he received a downward variance to a term of imprisonment within the range that would have applied if he were not a career offender. &gt;'</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-15\">. In the underlying motion, Hardiman appears to have moved for relief based on Amendment 750, but the district court construed his requpst as based on Amendment 782, as the court previously had denied Har-diman relief under Amendment 750. Our analysis is the same regardless of the particular amendment at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b879-8\">. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b879-10\">. Hardiman also requested relief under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, but this Act cannot serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction and does not apply retroactively. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377-78 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b881-8\">. We note that there is some force to this position because, from a practical standpoint, Hardiman\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d the crack-cocaine guideline range, and Hardiman may very well have received a sentence below 130 months of imprisonment had Amendment 782 been in effect at the time of his original sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
