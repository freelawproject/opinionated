The petition seeks review of the BIA\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Tan-jala\u2019s appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of his untimely motion to reopen and reconsider a prior decision granting voluntary departure after he was notified that he was removable for committing a crime involving moral turpitude. Mr. Tan-jala argues that his motion was timely filed and that we should remand to the BIA to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>reinstate his voluntary departure. He also asserts that he did not commit the crime that subjected him to removal and that he qualified for relief based on his political opinion and membership in a particular social group. Additionally, Mr. Tanjala argues that the IJ did not properly weigh the evidence. After careful review, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider or a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007); <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). Under this standard, \u201cour review is limited to determining whether an exercise of administrative discretion occurred and whether it was arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1226 (11th Cir.2008). An IJ does not need to discuss every piece of evidence before him, but is required to consider the evidence submitted. <em>See Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1376 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Generally, only one motion to reconsider is allowed, and it must be filed within 30 days of the entry of the removal order. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(A), (B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(A), (B). Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, a party may only file one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion \u201cshall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C). There is no time limit, however, where the motion to reopen is to file for asylum and is based on changed country conditions, if such information was not available and would not have been known at the previous hearing. <em>See </em>INA 240(c)(7)(C)(ii), 8 U.S.C. 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">For several reasons, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Mr. Tan-jala\u2019s appeal of the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen and reconsider. First, the motion was untimely, as it was filed after the 30-day time period for motions to reconsider and after the 90-day period for motions to reopen. Second, Mr. Tanjala did not establish changed country conditions; he merely reiterated general facts about corruption in Romania. The record indicates that the IJ considered the evidence submitted, and so we find unavailing Mr. Tanjala\u2019s argument that the IJ did not properly weigh the evidence. Finally, Mr. Tanjala\u2019s arguments on appeal are insufficient to warrant a remand to the BIA because those arguments were previously presented; therefore, the BIA\u2019s decision was not arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
