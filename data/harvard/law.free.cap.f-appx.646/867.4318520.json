On appeal, Donis-Galan asserts that the district court erred in sentencing him because it denied him (1) a two-level \u201csafety-valve\u201d reduction pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(17) and 5C1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, and (2) a two-level \u201cminor role\u201d reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2(b) of the Guidelines. We conclude that the district court did not commit reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-17\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b894-18\">\u201c[W]e review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines and its application of the Guidelines to the facts de novo, but we review its findings of fact only for clear error\u201d <em>United States v. Register, </em>678 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2012). Specifically, \u201c[w]hen reviewing the denial of safe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>ty-valve relief, we review for clear error [the] district court\u2019s factual determinations.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1301 (11th Cir.2004) (per cu-riam). In addition, \u201ca district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant qualifies for a minor role adjustment under the Guidelines is a finding of fact that [is] reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 934 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). \u201cFor a finding to be clearly erroneous, [we] must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rothenberg, </em>610 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">A. <em>The District Court Did Not Err in Denying Donis-Galan a Safety-Valve Reduction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Section 2Dl.l(b)(17) of the Guidelines provides that a defendant may receive a two-level reduction if he meets the safety-valve criteria set forth in \u00a7 501.2(a). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(17). The defendant has the burden of proving that he meets all of the safety-valve criteria. <em>See United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997). Among those criteria is the requirement that: \u201cnot later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(5). Under this requirement, \u201c[t]he burden is on the defendant to come forward and to supply truthfully to the [G]overnment <em>all </em>the information that he possesses about his involvement in the offense, including information relating to the involvement of others.\u201d <em>Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1557 (emphasis added). A district court cannot apply the safety valve if it determines that the defendant \u201cwithheld or misrepresented information.\u201d <em>See United States v. Figueroa, </em>199 F.3d 1281, 1282-83 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">At Donis-Galan\u2019s sentencing hearing, he admitted that he did not provide the Government with the names of his co-conspirators, even though he possessed such information. This admission demonstrated that Donis-Galan did not \u201cfully disclose information within h[is] knowledge relating\u201d to his offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 1283. Therefore, the district court did not err in refusing to apply the safety-valve reduction to his sentence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">B. <em>The District Court Did Not Err in Denying Donis-Galan a Minor Role Reduction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">The Guidelines provide for a two-level reduction if a defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the relevant criminal activity. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2(b); <em>Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939-40. A minor participant is a participant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n.5. A district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant was a minor participant \u201cshould be informed by two principles\u201d: (1) \u201cthe de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>fendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which []he has been held accountable at sentencing,\u201d and (2) his \u201crole as compared to that of other participants in h[is] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. Neither of these principles supports a finding that Donis-Galan was a minor participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">First, the relevant conduct for which the district court held Donis-Galan accountable was conspiring and attempting to possess several kilograms of cocaine for the purpose of distribution. Donis-Galan\u2019s specific criminal activity included: contacting a seller of cocaine on behalf of his co-conspirators, negotiating terms related to the sale of the cocaine, communicating to the seller and his co-conspirators a time and location for the sale, personally exchanging cash for a portion of the cocaine, and taking a cut of the cash for himself. Donis-Galan was only held accountable for the cocaine related to these efforts. Accordingly, his \u201cactual and relevant conduct were the same and he did not play a minor role in that conduct.\u201d <em>See United States v. Alvarez-Coria, </em>447 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (holding that a defendant who pled guilty to conspiring and attempting to possess with intent to distribute drugs did not qualify for a minor role reduction partly because he \u201cwas held accountable for only the drugs ,.. .that [he] admitted conspiring to transport\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Second, Donis-Galan has \u201cpresented no evidence showing that his responsibilities ,., were less important to the conspira-ey[/attempt to obtain the cocaine] than those of\u2019 the other participants in that conduct. <em>See id. </em>Indeed, Donis-Galan was entrusted with arranging the exchange for and personally obtaining the sought after cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Given that Donis-Galan\u2019s actual and relevant conduct were the same and that he has not shown that he was less culpable than other participants in such conduct, the district court did not clearly err in denying him a minor role reduction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 1343-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b895-8\">. Donis-Galan argues that he was not required to provide the Government with the names of his co-conspirators under \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5) because the Government already had that information. However, \u00a7 5C 1.2(a)(5) \"does not permit a sentencing court to [consider] ... the possible utility of any information possessed by the defendant.\u201d <em>See Figueroa, </em>199 F.3d at 1283. Rather, the dispositive issue when considering the \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5) requirement is whether the defendant \"withheld or misrepresented information.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Thus, Donis-Galan\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b896-6\">. Subsequent to Donis-Galan\u2019s sentencing, Amendment 794 to the Guidelines \u2014 which amended the Commentary to \u00a7 3B1.2 \u2014 went into effect. Donis-Galan argues that the amendment applies retroactively and that, based on the amendment\u2019s changes to the \u00a7 3B1.2 Commentary, he qualifies for a minor role reduction. But, even if the amendment is retroactive, Donis-Galan would remain ineligible for a minor role reduction in light of his above-discussed role in the relevant conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
