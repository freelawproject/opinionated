Because Polanco did not show that, but for his trial counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance, a reasonable probability exists that he would have pleaded guilty and actually received a lower sentence, the district court did not err in denying the \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-20\">Polanco was sentenced to a below-guidelines sentence. The sentencing court seemed to consider a variety of postulated events, including one in which Polanco would have gotten credit for assuming responsibility. Then, the sentencing court found that the sentence of 87 months was a reasonable and just sentence in the light of the sentencing factors and of all the considered postulated propositions. Accordingly, Polanco has not shown prejudice that would be required to be shown to get 2255 relief on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
