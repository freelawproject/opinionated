Gomez-Martinez argues that the enhancement of his sentence based upon a conviction that was not alleged in the indictment violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">We review constitutional sentencing issues <em>de novo. United States v. Harris, </em>741 F.3d 1245, 1248 (11th Cir.2014). The Supreme Court has held that the fact of a prior conviction does not need to be charged in the indictment or put to a jury under the Constitution. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1222, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). In <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), the Supreme Court held that any fact that increases a defendant\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence is an element of the crime that must be submitted to a jury. <em>Id. </em>at 2155. However, <em>Alleyne </em>explicitly stated that it was not revisiting the \u201cnarrow exception to this general rule for the fact of a prior conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2160 n. 1. This Court has held that <em>Almendarezr-Tor-res </em>remains the law of this Circuit in the wake of <em>Alleyne. Harris, </em>741 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">The district court\u2019s enhancement of Gomez-Martinez\u2019s sentence did not violate his constitutional rights. Gomez-Martinez concedes that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding precedent. The government was not required to charge Gomez-Martinez\u2019s prior conviction in his indictment for the conviction to be a basis for enhancing his sentence. We therefore affirm Gomez-Martinez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
