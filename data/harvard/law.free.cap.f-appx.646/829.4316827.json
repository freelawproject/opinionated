The government responded by moving for a court order revoking the supervised release and replacing it with a prison sentence. The district court granted the motion, sentencing Royes to 366 days in prison. Royes appeals that sentence, contending that it was imposed in violation of his rights to procedural and substantive due process. For the reasons set forth below, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-23\">In revoking a defendant\u2019s term of supervised release and sentencing the defendant, a district court should consider (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for deterrence; (3) the need to protect the public; (4) the kinds of sentences available and the guidelines range; (5) any pertinent policy statements; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (7) the need to provide restitution to any victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e) &amp; 3553(a). A sentence is substantively unreasonable if it \u201cfails to achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d <em>United States v. Dean, </em>635 F.3d 1200, 1209 (11th Cir.2011), or if the district court has balanced the \u00a7 3553(a) factors unreasonably or placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>unreasonable weight on a single factor, <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). At the same time, nothing \u201crequires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3653(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3653(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). It is enough that the whole record shows that the district court did, in fact, consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Royes has failed to meet his burden of showing that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. In imposing the sentence, the district court mentioned many of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that it had considered. The court discussed the circumstances of the offense and Royes\u2019 history and characteristics, recognizing that he had \u201cbeen given all the chances\u201d to make supervised release work and that many of his violations were for being \u201cmore than just a few minutes\u201d tardy for curfew. It also based its sentence on reasons having to do with deterrence and respect for the law, explaining that Royes\u2019 inability to \u201cmake supervised release\u201d left it with no viable option apart from a term of imprisonment. Finally, the district court noted that it had only two options as far as sentencing\u2014 \u201cincarceration or supervised release\u201d \u2014 and considered the applicable guidelines range of 7-13 months\u2019 imprisonment. That is sufficient to show that the district court did, in fact, consider and reasonably apply the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Royes\u2019 principal argument about substantive unreasonableness is that the district court gave too much weight to his failure to comply with the terms of his supervised release, and too little weight to his success in finding employment. In particular, he argues that the district court did not sufficiently appreciate that his failures to comply with the terms of his supervised release were, in many instances, the products of his work schedule. We review a district court\u2019s weighing of the sentencing factors only for abuse of discretion, <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and we find none here. Although Royes\u2019 professed determination to comply with his employer\u2019s demands is laudable, the district court was entitled to conclude that it was outweighed by his persistent failure to comply with the terms of his .supervised release. That is particularly true because the terms of Royes\u2019 supervised release were set to accommodate his commute and work schedule, and also because the record shows that Royes\u2019 probation officer would have amended Royes\u2019 schedule to provide additional accommodation had he been provided with a letter from Royes\u2019 employer. Under the circumstances, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in finding that Royes\u2019 work schedule did not offset his failure to comply with the terms of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
