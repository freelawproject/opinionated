On appeal, Edgecombe argues that the district court procedurally erred by: (1) applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(B) to calculate his base offense level; (2) assigning criminal history points to two uncounseled convictions; (3) denying his request for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(l); and (4) failing to consider all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Ed-gecombe also argues that his 70-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">\u201cWe review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion using a two-step process.\u201d <em>United States v. Cubero, </em>754 F.3d 888, 892 (11th Cir.2014) (quotation marks omitted). We look first at whether the sentencing court committed any significant procedural error, such as misapplying the guidelines or treating them as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, choosing a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the sentence imposed. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Second, we examine whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Alvarado, </em>808 F.3d 474, 496 (11th Cir. 2015). The weight given to any particular \u00a7 3553(a) factor is within the district court\u2019s discretion, and this Court will not substitute its judgment for that of the district court. <em>Id. </em>We \"will reverse a sentence only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">With respect to procedural reasonableness, the district court did not err in calculating Edgecombe\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(B). Section 2K2.1(a)(4)(B) sets a defendant\u2019s base offense level at 20 if, <em>inter alia, </em>the defendant was a \u201cprohibited person\u201d at the time the defendant committed the offense and \u201cthe offense involved a ... semiautomatic firearm .that is capable of accepting a large capacity magazine.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(B)(i)(I), (ii)(I). The commentary to \u00a7 2K2.T defines a \u201cprohibited person\u201d as \u201cany person described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g),\u201d which includes a person who has been convicted of a felony. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n.. 3; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Under the commentary, a firearm \u201cis capable of accepting a large capacity magazine\u201d if it \u201chas the ability to fire many rounds without reloading because at the time of the offense\u201d the firearm had either attached to it or in close proximity \u201ca magazine or similar device that could accept more than 15 rounds of ammunition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>The undisputed facts in Edgecombe\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) show that: (1) Edgecombe is a convicted felon prohibited from possessing firearms; (2) he sold firearms from the gun range where he worked to another gun dealer for cash; and (3) he then voided the sales and pocketed the proceeds. Edgecombe sold 83 firearms valued at a total of $37,640.58 in this manner. At least one of those firearms was a rifle that \u201cincluded a firearm magazine with a 30-round firearm ammunition capacity.\u201d Multiple firearms Edgecombe sold were pistols that \u201cinvolved high capacity magazines capable of accepting over 15 rounds of ammunition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Edgecombe offers no authority to support his argument that his firearm sales must have been made in connection with a violent crime or to another prohibited person. Further, Edgecombe\u2019s argument is inconsistent with a plain reading of \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(B), which contains no such limitations. As the government noted, other guidelines provisions come into play when a defendant\u2019s possession of a firearm with a large capacity magazine was in connection with either a crime of violence or another criminal offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(A); 5K2.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The district court also did not err in assigning one criminal history point each to Edgecombe\u2019s 2003 uncounseled state convictions for sheltering an unmarried minor and driving on a suspended license. It is undisputed that Edgecombe pled guilty to these two offenses only after he \u201cwaived counsel.\u201d In fact, the PSI addendum, adopted by the district court, states that for each 2003 conviction, Edgecombe executed a plea agreement in which he stated that he understood he was \u201cgiving up [his] right to have a lawyer advise and represent [him] and to have a free lawyer represent [him] if [he] cannot afford to hire one.\u201d The PSI addendum further states that the federal probation officer (who prepared the PSI) gave copies of the above state court documents to counsel for both parties in this federal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">In contrast, Edgecombe did not present any evidence that either waiver of counsel was not knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>57 F.3d 1012, 1018-19 (11th Cir.1995) (explaining that at sentencing the defendant has the burden to assert sufficient facts showing that a prior conviction is void because it was obtained without a knowing and voluntary waiver of counsel). Accordingly, the district court did not err in assigning one criminal history point to each 2003 conviction for purposes of computing Edgecombe\u2019s criminal history category of III.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">Edgecombe alternatively contends the district court should have granted his request for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(l) because his resulting criminal history category of III overrepresented the seriousness of his criminal history. We lack jurisdiction to review the merits of this departure claim. <em>See United States v. Mignott, </em>184 F.3d 1288, 1289 (11th Cir.1999) (explaining that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the denial of a request for a downward departure except to the extent the district court mistakenly believed it lacked authority to grant such a departure). Thus, to the extent Edge-combe challenges the denial of his departure request on the merits, we dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">The record belies Edgecombe\u2019s claim that the district court failed to consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In imposing Ed-gecombe\u2019s sentence, the district court expressly stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which was sufficient. <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>586 F.3d 918, 936 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that a district court need not discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors individually, as its ac-knowledgement on the record that it has considered the factors is enough).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Edgecombe contends the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a)(6) factor, the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among similar defendants. The fact that the district court did not explicitly refer to this factor does not mean the district court did not consider it. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007) (explaining that the fact that the district court did not mention the defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence does not mean the district court did not consider it in determining the defendant\u2019s sentence). This is particularly true given that at sentencing Edgecombe did not point to any unwarranted sentence disparities with similar defendants. <em>See Sanchez, </em>586 F.3d at 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">As to substantive reasonableness, Edgecombe argues that the facts of his case warranted a downward variance. Specifically, Edgecombe argues that some of his prior convictions were \u201cfor driving infractions over ten (10) years ago\u201d and that the record does not show he is likely to reoffend.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">After considering the parties\u2019 arguments, the PSI, the PSI addendum, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court found that the facts of Edgecombe\u2019s case were \u201cthe kind contemplated by the Sentencing Commission\u201d and imposed a 70-month sentence; within his advisory guidelines range of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment. That Edgecombe\u2019s 70-month sentence fell at the low end of his advisory guidelines range and more than four years below the ten-year statutory maximum sentence in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(i)(l), are indications of substantive reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (noting fact that the sentence imposed fell well below the statutory maximum was a sign of reasonableness); <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that we ordinarily expect a sentence inside the advisory guidelines range to be reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Moreover, the facts do not leave us with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and arriving at a sentence at the low end of the advisory guidelines range. Edge-combe, a convicted felon who was prohibited from possessing firearms, obtained a job at a gun range. In order to do so, Edgecombe forged and produced a counterfeit firearms license to circumvent a criminal background check. Then, over a five-month period, Edgecombe stole at least 83 firearms with a total value of over $37,000 from his employer by selling them for cash to one of his employer\u2019s competitors at cost and voiding the sales transactions so that it appeared to the employer that the sales had not taken place. Under the circumstances, the district court\u2019s refusal to vary downward was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-8\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities;. and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
