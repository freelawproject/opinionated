After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b875-18\">In 1997, Defendant pled guilty to importing heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a). When Defendant failed to appear at the sentencing hearing, a warrant was issued for her arrest and she was later indicted for failure to appear at sentencing, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)\u00ae. She was finally arrested in 2012, and subsequently pled guilty to failure to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-19\">In anticipation of sentencing, the probation officer completed a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). Applying the 2011 Guidelines, the PSR grouped the two convictions together and adjusted the guidelines calculation for the heroin-importation conviction based on the failure-to-appear conviction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3D1.2(c) and 5G1.2. The PSR assigned Defendant a base offense level of 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4), because Defendant was responsible for 2,842 grams of heroin. Defendant also received a two-level adjustment for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, which resulted in a total offense level of 34. Because Defendant had no prior criminal convictions, the PSR assigned her a criminal history category of I. Based on a total offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of I, Defendant\u2019s advisory guideline range was 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>At sentencing, the parties agreed that Defendant was eligible for a safety-valve reduction. Accordingly, the district court applied a two-level reduction, which resulted in a guideline range of 121 to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment. In light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court determined that a sentence below the applicable guideline range was appropriate because Defendant was 67 years old and she was subject to deportation for the drug conviction. Consequently, the district court sentenced Defendant to 90 months\u2019 imprisonment, consisting of a 70-month sentence for the heroin-importation conviction and a consecutive 20-month sentence for the failure-to-appear conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">In 2014, Defendant filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for reduction in sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 782. She contended that she met the requirements for a two-level reduction and requested that she receive a 63-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that she was not entitled to a sentence reduction because she received a sentence below the advisory guideline range. Although Amendment 782 lowered her offense level from 32 to 30, Defendant\u2019s 70-month sentence was still lower than the amended guideline range of 97 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court also noted that it was not permitted to reduce Defendant\u2019s sentence to less than the minimum of the guideline range because the downward variance she received at sentencing was based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, not substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Defendant now appeals from that decision, arguing that she is eligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 782. She contends that she is eligible because she received a three-level safety-valve reduction, a two-level acceptance of responsibility reduction, and she provided substantial assistance to the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions on the. scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a term of imprisonment when the original sentencing range has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). To be eligible for a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant must identify an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines that is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">A defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction if a guideline amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). Moreover, the district court shall. not reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range, unless the defendant received a reduction based on substantial assistance at the time of the original sentencing. <em>Id, </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A), (B). Stated another way, if the defendant received a below-guidelines sentence at the original sentencing as result of a downward departure or variance, the district court may not reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence below the minimum of the amended guideline range. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 IB 1.10, comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">Amendment 782 reduced the base offense level by two levels for most drug offenses listed in the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(d), U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 782 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-15\">Here, the district court did not err by concluding that Defendant was not eligible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>for a sentence reduction under Amendment 782. Amendment 782 reduced Defendant\u2019s offense level from 32 to 30. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 782; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(5). Applying the other guidelines calculations from the original sentencing (2-level increase for obstruction of justice and 2-level decrease for safety-valve relief), Defendant\u2019s amended guideline range is 97 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment. U.S.S.G., Ch. 5, Pt. A (Sentencing Table); <em>see also United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998) (stating that other than the amended guideline range, \u201c[a]ll other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain intact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Defendant received a total sentence of 90 months\u2019 imprisonment, consisting of 70 months for the heroin-importation conviction and a consecutive 20 months for the failure-to-appear conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Defendant\u2019s sentence was below the minimum of the -amended guideline range, 97 months, the district court correctly determined that Defendant was not eligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.3). Moreover, the record does not support Defendant\u2019s contention that she received a substantial assistance reduction. In fact, her attorney stated at the original sentencing hearing that Defendant did not cooperate with the Government. Thus, the district court correctly determined that Defendant was not eligible for a reduction based on substantial assistance. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">As a final matter, prior to the district court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, Defendant, citing to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243, requested that the Government show cause as to why her \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion should be denied. Defendant now argues on appeal that the Government and the district court' violated \u201cHabeas Corpus Rule 4\u201d and \u00a7 2243 because the Government did not respond to her filing within three to five days and the district court did not require the Government to respond. Defendant\u2019s argument is without merit because a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not an application for a writ of habeas corpus, and is governed by the rules applying to criminal cases, not civil cases. <em>See United States v. Fair, </em>326 F.3d 1317, 1318 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is a \u201ccontinuation of a criminal ease,\u201d not a \u201ccivil post-conviction action\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">For all of the above reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-6\">. Defendant points out that she received a 90-month total sentence, not 70 months as stated by the district court. Notably, the PSR grouped Defendant\u2019s importation and failure-to-appear convictions together for guideline calculation purposes, and Defendant received a 90-month total sentence for both convictions. But regardless, both sentences are below the minimum of the amended guideline range, and Defendant is therefore ineligible for relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b877-7\">. We do not consider Defendant\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s denial of her \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion violates <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), because Defendant raised this argument for the first time in her reply brief. <em>United States v. Britt, </em>437 F.3d 1103, 1104 (11th Cir.2006), <em>But see United States v. Durham, </em>795 F.3d 1329, 1330-31 (11th Cir. 2015) (holding that an appellant on direct appeal can move to file a supplemental brief raising a new claim or theory based on an intervening decision by the Supreme Court that overrules precedent established at the time of the opening brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
