The district court, which earlier reduced Ferguson\u2019s sentence based on Amendments 706 and 750, ruled that his status as a career offender made him ineligible for a further reduction of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-16\">Ferguson pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture and possess with intent to distribute at least 50 grams of cocaine base and 5 kilograms of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), 846, and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Ferguson\u2019s presentence investigation report assigned him a base offense level of 38 because he was responsible for 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and added two levels for his possession of a firearm, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b), which resulted in an adjusted offense level of 40. Ferguson, a career offender, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(a), and an armed career offender, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.4(a), retained the adjusted offense level of 40 because that exceeded the offense level of 37 applicable to a career offender, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.4(b). Ferguson received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, and with a total offense level of 37 and a criminal history of VI, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(b), had an advisory sentencing range of 360 months to life imprisonment. Based on the motion of the government to reduce Ferguson\u2019s sentence by one third for his substantial assistance, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5K1.1, the district court sentenced Ferguson to 240 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-18\">The district court twice reduced Ferguson\u2019s sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). First, the district court reduced Ferguson\u2019s base offense level to 36 based on Amendment 706 and, after applicable adjustments, imposed a sentence of 195 months. Later, the district court reduced Ferguson\u2019s total offense level to 34 based on Amendment 750 and sentenced him to 175 months, but based on Ferguson\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the district court reduced his sentence to 157 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-19\">The district court lacked authority to further reduce Ferguson\u2019s sentence. Amendment 782 did not alter Ferguson\u2019s sentencing range. <em>See United States v. Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d 328, 337 (11th Cir. 2013). Although the Amendment decreased Ferguson\u2019s adjusted offense level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>to 34, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)-(c), because Ferguson is a career offender, <em>see id. \u00a7 </em>4B1.1, and that \u201coffense level ... is greater than the offense level [under the Amendment],\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(b), his applicable offense level is 37. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319-20 (11th Cir.2012). After a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, Ferguson had a total offense level of 34. Because Amendment 782 \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering [Ferguson\u2019s] applicable guidelines range,\u201d a reduction of his sentence \u201cis not authorized under .18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2). The district court did not err by denying Ferguson\u2019s motion to reduce.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">We AFFIRM the denial of Ferguson\u2019s third motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
