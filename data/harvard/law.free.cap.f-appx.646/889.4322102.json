The district court ruled that Ellis\u2019s associates and access to funds would enable her to flee the country to avoid trial for conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1349, and conspiring to commit international money laundering, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1956(h), and that she presented a danger to elderly and other vulnerable persons. Because the record supports the finding that Ellis was a flight risk, we need not .address the alternative finding that she posed a danger to the public. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-24\">The continuation of pretrial detention presents a mixed question of law and fact. We review findings of fact for clear error and the application of law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. King, </em>849 F.2d 485, 487 (11th Cir.1988). The district court has \u201csubstantial latitude in determining whether pretrial detention is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-25\">When a district court conducts an evi-dentiary hearing and \u201cfinds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of [a defendant] as required and the safety of any other person and the community,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>the defendant must be detained before trial. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e). Either ground may support the order of detention. <em>King, </em>849 F.2d at 488. To determine whether the defendant poses a flight risk, the district court must consider several factors, including (1) the \u201cnature and circumstances\u201d of the charged offense, (2) the weight of the evidence against the defendant, (3) the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics, including her character, her family and community ties, her past conduct, her criminal history, and her \u201crecord concerning appearance at court proceedings,\u201d and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that would be posed by the person\u2019s release. 18 U.S.C, \u00a7 3142(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The district court did not err in determining that Ellis should be detained because she presents a serious risk of flight. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3142(e). The district court found that Ellis understood the consequences of her charges, having been convicted previously of mail fraud, and that she had an incentive and ability to flee to avoid a potential sentence of imprisonment for life. The government proffered that emails, photographs, and travel documents established that Ellis had relationships and resources that would facilitate her flight. Those proffers established that Ellis had used an international counterfeiter to extend the expiration date on her passport and to create false documents for other members of her conspiracy; she had traveled frequently to Europe and Asia, where she had established or had access to bank accounts; and she had professed to be worth more than $7.8 million, with $480,000 in liquid assets. Ellis argues that the government failed to \u201ccall ... witnesses [or] present[ ] ... actual evidence\u201d to satisfy its burden of proof, but she acknowledges that the government was allowed to proceed by proffer. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f); <em>United States v. Gaviria, </em>828 F.2d 667, 669 (11th Cir.1987). Ellis also argues that her medical condition, family ties, and status as a veteran weighed in favor of release, but the district court was entitled to conclude that Ellis\u2019s \u201csignificant overseas resources and connections\u201d and her \u201ccriminal history and her character establish a preponderant risk of flight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">The district court also did not clearly err in finding that no condition or combination of conditions would reasonably assure Ellis\u2019s appearance. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f). Ellis offered to surrender her passport, but that would not eliminate the risk of flight, the district court found, because Ellis had \u201caccess to sources world-wide to obtain false travel documents.\u201d And the government proffered that Ellis had misrepresented that she had not traveled internationally for several years because travel documents established that she went abroad repeatedly in 2014 and in 2015. The district court reasonably determined that no measure short of detention would guarantee Ellis\u2019s presence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">We AFFIRM the decision to continue Ellis\u2019s pretrial detention.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
