In May 2012, a hailstorm damaged property covered by Longleafs insurance policy with QBE. Longleaf notified QBE of the damage in February 2013, but QBE refused to indemnify Longleaf. Longleaf then filed this diversity action in district court, asserting that QBE\u2019s refusal violated Longleafs policy and constituted bad faith failure to pay. The district court granted summary judgment to QBE on both Longleafs claims. The court found that QBE was not obligated to indemnify Longleaf because Longleafs policy required Longleaf to promptly notify QBE of the storm-related damage, Longleaf failed to do so, and Longleaf did not establish a justification for the delay. On appeal, Longleaf argues that a triable issue exists as to whether its delay in providing notice to QBE was justified and, as a result, summary judgment was improper.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">Summary judgment may be granted only if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cGenuine disputes are those in which the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movant.\u201d <em>Ellis v. England, </em>432 F.3d 1321, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cFor factual issues to be considered genuine, they must have a real basis in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1326 (internal quotation marks omitted). Relatedly, affidavits that are not based on personal knowledge \u201ccannot raise genuine issues of fact, and thus ... cannot defeat a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1326-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">As a threshold matter, we must identify the state law governing Longleafs claims. Because the forum state is Georgia, we apply Georgia\u2019s choice-of-law rules. <em>See Boardman Petroleum, Inc. v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co., </em>135 F.3d 750, 752 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cFederal courts sitting in diversity apply the forum state\u2019s choice-of-law rules.\u201d). In Georgia, contract-based claims, like Longleafs, are governed \u201cby the law of the place where [the contract] w[as] made\u201d unless the contract was drafted to be performed in a different state. <em>See id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Longleafs policy was issued in Georgia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>and its terms concerned property in Georgia. Thus, Georgia law controls Longleafs claims. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Under Georgia law, \u201cwhen an insurance policy includes a notice requirement\u201d and \u201cthe insured unreasonably fails to timely comply with the ... requirement, the insurer is not obligated to provide a defense or coverage.\u201d <em>See Forshee v. Emp\u2019rs Mut. Cas. Co., </em>309 Ga.App. 621, 711 S.E.2d 28, 31 (2011). As noted above, Longleafs policy required it to provide \u201cprompt notice\u201d to QBE in the event of loss or damage. \u201cPrompt notice\u201d is notice that is given with \u201creasonable diligence and within a reasonable length of time in view of the attending circumstances of each particular case.\u201d <em>See Advocate Networks, LLC v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>296 Ga.App. 338, 674 S.E.2d 617, 619 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hence, \u201cunexcused significant delay\u201d violates a policy\u2019s \u201cprompt notice\u201d requirement, but a delay in notice does not contravene such a requirement if the insured offers a valid justification for the delay. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cBecause [the insured] provides no other reasonable explanation for the four-month delay at issue, the evidence establishes, as a matter of law, that it violated the provision of the policies requiring that ... [notice] be immediately [given] to [the insurer].\u201d). An insured bears the burden of establishing a justification for the delay. <em>See Kay-Lex Co. v. Essex Ins. Co., </em>286 Ga.App. 484, 649 S.E.2d 602, 606 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Here, Longleaf did not notify QBE of the damage caused by the hailstorm until nine months after the storm. Absent a reasonable explanation, this delay clearly violated the \u201cprompt notice\u201d requirement in Longleafs policy. <em>See Advocate Networks, </em>674 S.E.2d at 619 (holding that a four-month delay without justification violated the policy\u2019s notice requirement); <em>Bituminous Cas. Corp. v. J.B. Forrest &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>132 Ga.App. 714, 209 S.E.2d 6, 8-11 (1974) (same); <em>Richmond v. Ga. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., </em>140 Ga.App. 215, 231 S.E.2d 245, 249 (1976) (\u201c[T]he eight months delay in notifying the insurer was unreasonable as a matter of law.\u201d). As such, Longleaf focuses its appeal on its excuse for the delay. Longleaf contends that the delay was justified because it did not become aware of the damage at issue until more than six months after the hailstorm.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">However, the only evidence Long-leaf offers in support of this assertion is an affidavit from its current president, and that affidavit is insufficient to create a triable issue as to whether the delay was justified. Specifically, the affidavit cannot establish a triable issue because it was not based on personal knowledge. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c)(4) (An affidavit used to oppose a motion for summary judgment \u201cmust be made on personal knowledge.\u201d); <em>Ellis, </em>432 F.3d at 1326-27. The district court held that the president\u2019s affidavit does not meet this threshold requirement, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-13\">Although [the president] states that he is Longleafs president, it is undisputed that [he] was not Longleafs president either when the loss purportedly occurred or when the loss was reported to QBE some nine months later.... [Furthermore,] [t]he Affidavit does not indicate ... the nature of [the president\u2019s] association with Longleaf during the relevant timeframe or provide any basis for his knowledge of the events discussed in the Affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number><em>See Longleaf in Vinings Homeowners Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. QBE Ins. Corp., </em>No. 13-3132, slip. op. at 14 (N.D.Ga. Mar. 12, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">We must defer to the district court\u2019s \u201clack of personal knowledge\u201d determination unless the court abused its discretion by making a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d or applying \u201cthe wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>See Corwin v. Walt Disney Co., </em>475 F.3d 1239, 1249 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>id. </em>at 1249-52 (reviewing for abuse of discretion whether the district court erred in determining that two affidavits were inadmissible because they were not supported by personal knowledge). Based on our review of the record, we cannot conclude that the court committed such error. Therefore, the affidavit is inadequate to satisfy Longleafs burden of establishing a triable issue as to whether the delayed notice was justified, <em>see Ellis, </em>432 F.3d at 1326-27, and the district court properly granted summary judgment to QBE, <em>see Advocate Networks, </em>674 S.E.2d at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-9\">. Longleaf also appears to disagree with the district court\u2019s findings that (1) under Long-leaf's policy with QBE, prompt notice was a condition precedent for coverage and (2) Longleafs notice to QBE was actually delayed. However, Longleaf makes only vague, passing references to these determinations. Therefore, it has abandoned any challenges to them. <em>See United States v. Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d 1353, 1358 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1186, 191 L.Ed.2d 142 (2015).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-8\">. In <em>Advocate Networks, </em>the court addressed a policy requiring \"immediate\u201d notice, but the court equated that requirement with a \"duty to provide [the insurer] prompt notice.\u201d <em>See </em>674 S.E.2d at 619.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
