The issue presented in this appeal is whether Constanza\u2019s 2005 New York attempted second-degree burglary conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for the purposes of a 16-point offense-level enhancement under Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Following a careful review of the record and briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-26\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Ayn\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b735-27\">We recount the facts from Constariza\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>On April 10, 2013, Constanza stole electronics and other miscellaneous items from his roommate\u2019s bedroom. On or about April 16, 2013, local Florida police officers arrested Constanza for the theft. Con-stanza provided the police with a fake Mexican consulate card.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">On April 17, 2013, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) identified Con-stanza as an individual who was probably in the United States illegally and, therefore, lodged an immigration detainer. ICE eventually discovered that Constanza was a citizen of El Salvador who was previously deported from the United States to El Salvador in 2006. He never applied for, nor did he receive, permission to re-enter the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">B. Indictment and Guilty Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">On February 11, 2015, a federal grand jury returned a one-count indictment against Constanza, charging him with being a previously deported alien who illegally reentered the United States without permission, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1). After initially pleading not guilty, Constanza changed his plea to guilty, which the district court accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">C. Prior Felony Burglary Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The PSI recounted that from January 7, 2005, to February 29, 2005, in Suffolk County, New York, Constanza \u201centered different dwellings with the purpose of committing larceny,\u201d and stole electronics and jewelry. On October 31, 2015, Con-stanza was convicted of multiple counts of attempted second-degree burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">For one of those convictions, the New York \u201cCriminal Information\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is in the record and it charges Constanza with \u201cburglary in the second degree\u201d for \u201cunlawfully enter[ing] in a dwelling located at 297 La-Fayette St., Copiague, with intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d According to the corresponding written judgment, Constan-za was convicted of \u201cATT.BURG.2,\u201d in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 110.00 and 140.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-13\">D.Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b736-14\">The PSI recommended a base offense level of eight, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). The PSI added to that base offense level a 16-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because Con-stanza was previously deported after an attempted second-degree burglary conviction in New York, which is a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The PSI also applied a three-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b) for acceptance of responsibility and cooperation with authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-15\">Constanza\u2019s total adjusted offense level was 21. Based on this total offense level and a criminal history category of III, Constanza\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-16\">Constanza filed a written objection to the 16-level \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). He argued that he was eligible for only a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D) for being deported after a \u25a0 conviction for a felony not otherwise enumerated in \u00a7 2L1.2(b). The probation officer disagreed, noting that the Criminal Information and written judgment \u2014 both <em>Shepard</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>documents \u2014 established that Constanza was convicted of attempted second-degree burglary, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 110.00 and 140.25, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">At sentencing, the district court determined that the 16-level enhancement was appropriate and overruled Constanza\u2019s objection. The court adopted the findings of fact and guidelines calculations contained in the PSI. After reviewing the PSI and considering the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, the district court varied downward 9 months below the bottom end of Con-stanza\u2019s advisory guidelines range of 46 to 57 months. The court sentenced Constan-za to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment. Constan-za then reasserted his objection to the 16-level enhancement, which the court overruled. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">On appeal, Constanza argues that his 2005 New York attempted second-degree burglary conviction is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) and, therefore, the district court erred by applying the 16-level enhancement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We first examine what constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under that Guideline at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">A.Definition of \u201cCrime of Violence\u201d in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">Section 2L1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a 16-level increase to a defendant\u2019s base offense level \u201c[i]f the defendant previously was deported ... after ... a conviction for a felony that is ... a crime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The Application Notes to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) define a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as any of several enumerated offenses, expressly including \u201cburglary, of a dwelling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n.l(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">The Application Notes also provide that a predicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d includes \u201cthe offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting\u201d to commit a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n.5. Thus, attempted burglary of a dwelling qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-15\">B. Constanza\u2019s Burglary Conviction\u2014 Modified Categorical Approach</p>\n<p id=\"b737-16\">The next question is whether Constan-za\u2019s New York attempted second-degree burglary conviction constitutes a conviction for attempted \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d as provided by the Application Notes to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l), and thus qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). To make this determination, we generally apply a categorical approach. <em>United States v. Ramirez-Flores, </em>743 F.3d 816, 820 (11th Cir.2014). However, \u201cin cases involving a \u2018divisible\u2019 statute \u2014 i.e., one that sets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative, in effect creating several different crimes\u201dwe apply a modified categorical approach. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-17\">C. Divisibility</p>\n<p id=\"b737-18\">Before applying the modified categorical approach, we examine whether Constan-za\u2019s attempted second-degree burglary conviction violated a divisible statute. <em>See United States v. Estrella, </em>758 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir.2014). The parties agree that New York\u2019s second-degree burglary statute is divisible. New York law has a tiered statutory scheme for burglary. <em>See </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 140. 20, 140.25, 140.30. At issue here is New York\u2019s second-degree burglary statute, \u00a7 140.25, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>\u00a7 140.25. Burglary in the second degree</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">\n<em>A person is guilty of burglary in the second degree when he knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein, and when:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">1. In effecting entry or while in the building or in immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">(a) Is armed with explosives or a deadly weapon; <em>or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">(b) Causes physical injury to any person who is not a participant in the crime; <em>or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">(c) Uses or threatens the immediate use of a dangerous instrument; <em>or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">(d) Displays what appears to be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-10\">2. <em>The building is a dwelling.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-11\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 140.25 (emphasis added). Thus, a person is guilty of second-degree burglary when he \u201cknowingly enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein\u201d and that \u201cbuilding is a dwelling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, New York law even narrows further the definition of a \u201cdwelling\u201d and defines it as \u201ca building which is usually occupied by a person lodging therein at night.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 140.00(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">We agree with the parties that \u00a7 140.25 is a divisible statute. Courts can usually determine whether a statute is divisible by simply reading its text and asking if its elements or means are drafted in the alternative. <em>Estrella, </em>758 F.3d at 1246. It is clear from \u201csimply reading its text\u201d that the elements or means of \u00a7 140.25 are drafted in the alternative. <em>See id. </em>Specifically, the text of \u00a7 140.25 contains a distinct subsection that creates a separate and divisible crime for unlawfully entering a building that is a dwelling with intent to commit a crime therein. N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 140.25(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we may employ the modified categorical approach to determine under which of the alternative statutory phrases Constanza was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-15\">D. <em>Shepard </em>Documents</p>\n<p id=\"b738-16\">Under the modified categorical approach, we may consult a limited class of documents, such as indictments, plea agreements, jury instructions, and undisputed facts contained in the PSI to de-teimine which alternative elements or statutory phrases formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction. <em>Ramirez-Flores, </em>743 F.3d at 820 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3. These documents are known as <em>Shepard </em>documents. <em>Id. at </em>820 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-17\">Upon review of the available <em>Shepard </em>documents, Constanza was convicted of attempted burglary of a dwelling under \u00a7\u00a7 110.00 and 140.25(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A written judgment from a New York state court provides that in 2005, Constanza was convicted of attempted burglary in the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>degree, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 110.00 and 140.25. The Criminal Information charged that Constanza \u201cunlawfully entered <em>in a dwelling </em>located at 297 La-Fayette St., Copiague, with intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d (emphasis added). The Criminal Information\u2019s use of the word \u201cdwelling,\u201d the designation of a specific address, and the omission of the other terms used in \u00a7 140.25(l)(a)-(d) make clear that \u00a7 140.25(2) was the alternative statutory phrase underlying Constanza\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">We recognize that Constanza argues that he pleaded guilty to only the offense of <em>attempted </em>second-degree burglary \u2014 as opposed to the complete offense of second-degree burglary charged in the Criminal Information. He argues that this means that he pleaded guilty to a different crime and, therefore, this Court may not rely at all on the Criminal Information here, which charged the complete offense. But this argument ignores the fact that Con-stanza did not plead guilty to a crime substantively different from the crime charged in the Criminal Information. Rather, he pleaded guilty to the attempt form of the same crime charged in the Criminal Information. Thus, we may look to the Criminal Information to determine the statutory phrase of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Constanza relies on our decision in <em>United States v. Day, </em>465 F.3d 1262 (11th Cir.2006), but that decision is materially different. The defendant in <em>Day </em>challenged his sentence enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) on the grounds that his prior burglary conviction did not qualify, as a predicate \u201cviolent felony.\u201d <em>Day, </em>465 F.3d at 1264. The charging document alleged that the defendant had unlawfully entered or remained in a dwelling and charged him with committing second-degree burglary under Florida law. <em>Id. </em>at 1266. However, the written judgment indicated that the defendant pleaded <em>nolo contendere </em>to third-degree burglary, which only required unlawful entry into an unoccupied structure other than a dwelling and did not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Day, </em>the defendant was convicted only of the substantively different crime of third-degree burglary. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">In contrast to <em>.Day, </em>the Criminal Information alleged that Constanza unlawfully entered a dwelling, a fact that comports with his conviction for attempted second-degree burglary. There is no factual in-congruence between the Criminal Information and judgment in Constanza\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">Because Constanza\u2019s conviction under \u00a7\u00a7 110.00 and 140.25(2) constitutes a conviction for an attempted \u201cburglary of a dwelling,\u201d it qualifies as a predicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) &amp; cmt. nn. l(B)(iii), 5. Constanza\u2019s previous felony conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d warranted a 16-point offense level enhancement and the district court committed no error in applying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm defendant Constanza\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>- AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-10\">.

Penal Law \u00a7 140.00(2) sets out another definition of a \"building\u201d that encompasses m\u00e1ny types of structures, such as watercraft. In contrast, \u00a7 140.25(2) has its own definition of what constitutes a building. To violate \u00a7 140.25(2), the building must be a dwelling. Thus, the broader definition of \"building\" in \u00a7 140.00(2) does not apply to this alternative crime in \u00a7 140.25(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b738-18\">.
