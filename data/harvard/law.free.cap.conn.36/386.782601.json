Held that it was the duty of the court to give such a construction to the bill of particulars if possible as to preserve rather than defeat its jurisdiction, and that in so doing it might apply the item of the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>to the first count and the remaining items to the general count, and that as it was not necessary for the plaintiff to include the note in the bill of particulars it might be considered as containing only the other items.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b395-5\">A motion for a new trial must show clearly what the error is which is claimed to have been committed upon the trial, and this court is not bound to help out an obscure and uncertain statement by any favorable construction.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b395-6\">And the same rule is applicable to a bill of exceptions and an assignment of errors upon it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-7\">Assumpsit upon a promissory note, with the common counts in general assumpsit; brought to the court of common pleas of New Haven county, and tried on the general issue, with notice of a set-off, closed to. the court, before <em>Bronson, J.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-8\">The plaintiff filed the following bill of particulars:\u2014 February 2d, 1866, One note for three hundred and \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-9\">fifty dollars with interest, $350.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOX\">\u201c \u201c \u201c By cash to S.

Stoddard, </em>with whom was <em>Blydenburgh, </em>in support of the motions.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-6\">1. The jurisdiction of the court of common pleas is limited by statute to civil causes, in which the matter in demand exceeds the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace, and does not exceed the sum of five hundred dollars. Acts of 1869, p. 313, sec. 3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-7\">2. The matter in demand is the actual amount claimed by the plaintiff in his declaration, which is determined by his bill of particulars. <em>Denison </em>v. <em>Denison, </em>16 Conn., 37 ; <em>Vila </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>33 id., 42; <em>Newtown </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>3 id., 553. This bill of particulars could be made part of the declaration by way of amendment, and such amendment ousts the court of its jurisdiction. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>36 Misso., 110.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-8\">3. The plaintiff\u2019s bill of particulars is a demand for $801.28, with interest, and therefore beyond the jurisdiction as it originally stood.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-9\">4. The court could make no order, nor allow an amendment, because it had no jurisdiction of the matter in demand. When the motion to erase was made no other question could have been made, and the court erred in permitting the amendment and in refusing to erase.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-10\">5. But if the court could legally permit the amendment, still this false credit does not bring the matter in demand within the jurisdiction of the court, for in his bill of particulars the plaintiff claims $801.28, with interest on a portion of that sum for nearly four years, and on the remainder for different periods of time. Now when this fictitious credit of $301.28 was given, the plaintiff omitted to make provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>for the interest, and while claiming it as part of his debt, gives no credit for it, and that makes the amount claimed more than $500. And where interest has accrued and is claimed, it ousts the court of jurisdiction. <em>Milburn v. Burton, </em>2 Cranch C. C., 639.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-5\">6. The only debt claimed, and the only demand made to support which evidence was offered, was contained in the bill of particulars. ' But if a portion of the demand was beyond the jurisdiction of the court, the judgment is void in toto. <em>Foy </em>v. <em>Talburt, </em>5 Cranch C. C., 124. Eor if the plaintiff might claim $1000 in one count, and $500 in another, the result is that controversies concerning amounts far beyond the jurisdiction would he adjudicated upon in that court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-6\">7. The allowance of the sum of $40 in the judgment is clearly error; or, at least, if these things do not render the judgment erroneous, they certainly entitle the defendani to a new trial upon a cause of action within the jurisdiction of the court. The judgment should be reversed or a new trial granted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-7\"><em>Robinson, </em>with whom was <em>Fox, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b398-8\">Carpenter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APR\">The declaration consists of two counts. The first is special, on a promissory note for three hundred and fifty dollars. The second is a general count in assumpsit, alleging an indebtedness of five hundred dollars. The declaration concludes with demanding five hundred dollars damages. The bill of particulars, filed in obedience to an order of the court, sets forth an indebtedness of over eight hundred dollars. The defendant thereupon moved the court to erase the cause from the docket, on the ground that the matter in demand exceeded the jurisdiction of the court. The court permitted the plaintiff to amend his bill of particulars by crediting the excess over five hundred dollars, and entertained jurisdiction of the case. Upon the trial the amount found due the plaintiff was less than five hundred dollars, for which judgment was rendered, and the defendant brings the record before this court on a. motion in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>The first two errors assigned may he considered together, being in effect but one, and that is, that the case was not within the jurisdiction of the court of common pleas. The statute limits the jurisdiction'of that court to cases wherein the matter in demand exceeds the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace, and does not exceed the sum of five hundred dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We may lay out of the case the amendment of the bill of particulars as immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Each count, on its face, is confessedly within the jurisdiction of the court, and the court cannot be ousted of its jurisdiction by uniting the indebtedness stated in the two counts, although the aggregate amount exceeds five hundred dollars. <em>Denison </em>v. Denison, 16 Conn., 37. Nor does the bill of particulars have that effect. The nature and office of a bill of particulars are clearly and correctly defined in <em>Vila </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>33 Conn., 42. Although in-a certain sense it is an amendment or amplification of the declaration, yet it does not necessarily follow that it controls the declaration in respect to jurisdictional facts. There may be a distinction between an action of general assumpsit and actions of book debt and upon specialties and promissory notes, in which the plaintiff in his declaration makes a profert of his books, or instrument declared on, and in which the defendant may demand oyer of the same, and set it out in his plea, and thus make it a part of the record. In such actions there may be reasons for determining the jurisdiction of the court upon the matter contained in the oyer which do not apply to the present action. But we have no occasion to discuss that question, as we are all satisfied, upon another ground, that the motion of the defendant ought not to have prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The bill of particulars, when carefully examined and considered, will be found to follow strictly the declaration, and to be in complete harmony with it. It does not appear that the defendant demanded it, or that the court ordered it, in respect to either count in the declaration. And the plaintiff in preparing it did not limit it, or any item in it, to either count, but left it for the court to apply each item to the count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>to which it was applicable. In doing so it was the duty of the court, if possible, to do it in such a manner as to retain rather than deprive itself of its jurisdiction. The first item is a note, the description of which corresponds with the note described in the first count, and the presumption is that it is the same. That item then is applicable to the first count. It makes no difference that it may also be applicable to the other count, as there is no presumption that the court so applied it. Besides, there was no occasion to enter it upon -the bill of particulars at all. The plaintiff probably did so out of abundant caution; but it was unnecessary, inasmuch as it was described in the declaration and admissible in evidence, if necessary, under either count, without farther specification. <em>Vila </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>supra. Inserting it in the bill of particulars can have no legal effect, unless it be to oust the court of its jurisdiction, and we are not disposed to give it that effect. The remaining items, amounting to less than five hundred dollars, are applicable to the second count. The bill of particulars may, therefore, in legal contemplation, be considered as containing the latter items only. Taking that view of it, and we are satisfied it is the correct one, it is manifest that the court did not err in retaining and exercising jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">A question is made concerning the item of forty cents in the bill of particulars, which, it appears, was proved and included in the judgment at the sum of $40. The defendant assigns as the error upon this point, that the court \u201c took the plaintiff\u2019s bill of particulars, including the said sum\u201dof forty dollars, as the matter in demand, and included the said sum of forty dollars in the judgment.\u201d It is very difficult to get any clear idea from the bill of exceptions what the precise' action of the court was which the defendant claims to have been erroneous. It appears by it that the item in the bill of particulars of forty cents for cash lent was claimed by the plaintiff upon the trial to have been' intended to be forty dollars instead of forty cents, and that the plaintiff offered evidence to prove a charge of forty dollars for cash lent, but without moving to amend the bill; and \u201c that afterwards, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>upon, the argument, without the knowledge of the court or of the defendant, he amended the bill of particulars so as to make the item forty dollars instead of forty cents, and claimed the forty dollars as part of his claim and - matter in demand,\u201d and that \u201c the court, without knowledge that any amendment had been made during the trial, treated the forty dollars as part of the matter in demand and included it in the judgment.\u201d From this it would appear that the court had no knowledge that the amendment had been made at the time the judgment was rendered, and yet the error assigned is that the court \u201c took the plaintiff\u2019s bill of particulars, including the item of forty dollars, as the matter in demand\u201d \u2014meaning of course the plaintiff\u2019s amended bill of particulars, as it was only in that that the item of forty dollars appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The case is not helped in respect to this point by the motion for a new trial. That motion states that \u201c the court admitted evidence offered by the plaintiff to prove all matters in demand and items contained in the plaintiff\u2019s bill of particulars, and admitted evidence to prove the item of forty dollars, and rendered judgment, including in said judgment the said sum of forty dollars, against the objection and protest of the defendant to the jurisdiction and to the sum of forty dollars as aforesaid.\u201d Here it appears that the bill of particulars before the court was the plaintiff\u2019s original bill of particulars, and that the court admitted evidence to prove \u201c the item of forty dollars.\u201d But there was no item of forty dollars in the plaintiff\u2019s original bill of particulars, and there is nothing in the motion to show what is meant by \u201c the item of forty dollars.\u201d It is true that by turning to the bill of exceptions we find what is meant by this item, but we are not bound to look there for the purpose of helping out the defendant\u2019s motion. The motion of itself must show clearly what the error is which is claimed to have been committed by the court; and the court is not bound to help it out by any favorable construction or supposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">We think therefore that whatever error the court may have committed on this point it is by no means manifest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>either upon the bill of exceptions or the motion for a new trial, from an utter failure of both to set out the matter with any such clearness and definiteness as to inform the court what the error is.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We are the more willing to dispose of the question in this way because there manifestly can have been no real injustice done by the ruling of the court. The plaintiff, as the court found, was entitled to the $40, and though, when the error in his bill of particulars by which it was carried out at forty cents was discovered he ought to have asked to be allowed to amend the bill, which he would undoubtedly have been permitted to do, with such delay of the trial as might be necessary for the accommodation of the defendant if he was taken by surprise and not prepared to meet the charge as thus altered, yet it is very clear that injustice would have been done to the plaintiff by a judgment in his favor for the other items of his account with a disallowance of this one, since he would have been without remedy for that part of his claim thus rejected. The defendant seems to have put his objection wholly upon the ground that the item was but forty cents in the bill of particulars, and did not ask for delay or claim to be taken by surprise. He was perhaps technically right, but we can not believe that he suffered any real injustice by the allowance of the item\u2019by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">If we could see from the whole record that any real injustice had been done the defendant we might in the exercise of our discretion help out the infirmity of his motion by the most favorable construction that could reasonably be put upon it; but the court is under no obligation to give a motion such a construction and will not do it where it would not manifestly tend to promote justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">A new trial must be denied and the judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
