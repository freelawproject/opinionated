Constitutional <em>Law'\u2014Act Authorizing Courts to Incorporate </em>Towns\u2014 <em>Legislative </em>Powers\u2014Delegation.\u2014The act of Assembly approved March 14, 1908, authorizing the circuit courts to incorporate towns of more than two hundred and less than five thousand inhabitants is not unconstitutional on the ground of conferring legislative powers on such courts. In passing said act the legislature was acting in obedience to section 117 of the Constitution, which provides that \u201cgeneral laws for the organization and government of cities and towns shall be enacted by the General Assembly, and no special act shall be passed in relation thereto, except in the manner provided in Article 4 of this Constitution, and then only by a recorded vote of two-thirds of the members elected to each house. \u201d This language of the Constitution is sufficient not only to permit, but to require, the legislature to make provision for the creation and regulation, for the organization, and for the government of municipal corporations, and hence it was competent for the legislature to delegate such power to the courts. The reasoning and conclusions of <em>Henrico County </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>106 Va. 282, are re-affirmed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b122-8\">2.

A community constituting but one continuous, contiguous, and homogeneous settlement cannot be sub-divided for the purpose of incorporation.

We shall assume that the number of electors contemplated, duly qualified as provided by law, united in the petition to the circuit court; that the description of the territory proposed to be embraced in the incorporation is correctly given; that due publication was made in accordance with the statute, and, in fine, that all matters of form were complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The first question which we shall consider arises upon the demurrer. It is insisted that the act of Assembly of the 14th of March, 1908, is unconstitutional, because it violates section 5, Art. 1, of the Constitution of 1902 (Code 1904, p. ccix.), the first paragraph of which declares that the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of the State shall be separate and distinct; and Art. 3, which declares that \u201cExcept as hereinafter provided, the legislative, executive, and judicial departments shall be separate and distinct, so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to either of the others, nor any person exercise the power of more than one of them at the same time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">By section 117 of Art. 8 of the Constitution, (Code 1904, page ccxxxviii.), it is provided that \u201cGeneral laws for the organization and government of cities and towns shall be enacted by the General Assembly, and no special act shall be passed in relation thereto, except in the manner provided in Art. 4 of this Constitution, and then only by a recorded vote of two-thirds of the members elected to each house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Plaintiffs in error contend that the act in question delegates to the circuit courts legislative functions, in deciding (1) whether the proposed incorporation is for the interest of the inhabitants of the proposed town; (2) whether the general good of the community will be promoted by incorporation; (3) whether or not the prayer of the petitioners is reasonable; (4) that it permits the courts to alter the boundaries named in the petition and to fix others, and (5) that it vests absolutely in the court the discretion to dispose of the matter as to it may seem best.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">This general subject was before this court in <em>Henrico County </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>106 Va. 282, 55 S. E. 683, 117 Am. St. Rep. 1001. That, it is true, was a case involving the constitutionality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>of an act authorizing the annexation of territory to an existing municipal corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">By section 126 of the Constitution, (Code 1904, page ccxlii.,) it is declared that \"The General Assembly shall provide by general laws for the extension and contraction, from time to time, of the corporate limits of cities and towns, and no special act for such purpose shall be valid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">When the legislature came to deal with the duty imposed by that section, it passed an act which is to be found in the Code of 1904 as section 1014-a. It imposes upon the courts substantially the same duties that they are required to exercise under the act called in question in the controversy before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The constitutionality of section 1014-a was vigorously attacked upon arguments almost identical with those under consideration,, and enforced by substantially the same line of authorities, though the industry of counsel in the case before us has added to the number. It was urged upon us in <em>Henrico County </em>v. <em>City of Richmond </em>that there was a commingling of legislative and judicial functions in the act, which rendered it null and void. It was pointed out that it was for the courts to determine the necessity for and expediency of annexation, and whether the terms and conditions set forth in the ordinance were reasonable and fair, and whether fair and just provisions were made for the future management and improvement of the annexed territory; that if the court or judge should be satisfied with the necessity for or expediency of such annexation, and that such conditions and provisions were reasonable and fair, an order should be entered providing for the annexation of the territory; but if of opinion that the annexation was unnecessary or inexpedient, then the motion for annexation should be dismissed; that it provided that if the court or judge should be of opinion that the annexation of only a part of the territory was necessary or expedient, or that the-ordinance did not contain fair and reasonable terms, or that more territory should be annexed than was embraced within the metes, and bounds originally set forth, it should enter a proper order, embodying what it deemed reasonable and fair terms upon vdfich the annexation should be had, and how much of the territory should be annexed, and direct the annexation of such territory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>in conformity with the terms and conditions so prescribed. It was made the duty of the court to draw the lines of annexation so as to have a reasonably compact body of land, and to see that no land should be taken into the city which was not adapted to \u25a0city improvements, unless necessarily embraced in said compact body; and other provisions of a like character, all of which were \u25a0claimed to be in their essence legislative functions; that the attempt to confer the exercise of such powers upon courts was in plain violation of those provisions of the Constitution intended to \u2022secure the complete separation of executive, judicial, and legislative departments, so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to either of the others, nor any person exercise the power of more than one of them at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\">The opinion of the court deals with all of these subjects, and, after a full consideration, reached the conclusion, as set forth in the syllabus, that \u2018 \u2018An act of Assembly providing for the extension \u25a0of the corporate limits of cities and towns, and which confers upon the circuit courts of the counties in which the territory lies the power to ascertain and determine the boundaries to be embraced, \u2022and the necessity for and the expediency of extending the corporate limits of cities and towns, is not unconstitutional on the ground of conferring legislative powers on such courts. Nearly or quite \u2022all of the questions of necessity and expediency submitted to the \u2022courts for their determination are questions of fact, and are to be ascertained judicially, and the limited legislative power conferred, if any, is not in violation of the Constitution. Governments could not exist if the inhibition on the intermingling of such powers in one person or body were strictly, literally, and unyieldingly applied in every situation. The manifest purpose of the legislature was to make a case to be tried in court, in which all the parties concerned are brought before the court and given an opportunity to be heard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">That case has been accepted as law, and has been acted upon in numerous instances, and is not now to be disturbed, except for the gravest and most convincing reasons. We shall not undertake to add anything to the reasoning of the court, and shall present but one authority in addition to those there considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>In <em>Wayman </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>10 Wheat. 3, 6 L. Ed. 653, Chief Justice Marshall, dealing with a kindred subject, uses language which strongly confirms the result reached by this court. Said he: \u2018 \u2018 The difference between the departments undoubtedly is that the legislature makes, the executive executes, and the judiciary construes the law; but the maker of the law may commit something to the discretion of the other departments, and the precise boundary of this power is a subject of delicate and difficult inquiry, into which a court will not enter unnecessarily. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">In passing section 1014r-a the legislature was obeying the mandate of the Constitution, which requires it to provide by general laws for the extension and contraction, from time to time, of the corporate limits of cities and towns, and no special act for such purpose shall be valid. \u201d In passing the law under consideration, it was acting in obedience to section 117 of the Constitution, which provides that \u2018' general laws for the organization and government of cities and towns shall be enacted by the General Assembly, and no special act shall be passed in relation thereto, except in the manner provided in Article 4 of this Constitution, and then only by a recorded vote of two-thirds of the members elected to each house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Admitting the correctness of the decision in <em>Henrico County </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>its binding force as authority can only be avoided by differentiating the creation of a municipal corporation from the annexation of additional territory to an existing corporation. It may be conceded that the creation of a municipal corporation is in its essence a legislative act, and the true question is whether or not it was competent for the legislature to delegate such a power to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The Constitution requires the General Assembly\u2014does not merely permit, but commands that body\u2014to enact general laws for the organization and government of cities and towns.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">This language is to be construed in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the words used. <em>To organize </em>means to arrange or 'Constitute in parts, each a special function, act, office, or relation; it means something more in the connection in which it is used than to put into working order agencies already established, for that \u25a0duty is more properly embraced under the word \u201cgovernment\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>it is required to pass laws both to organize and to govern; and it is plain to us that the language is sufficient not only to permit, but to require, the legislature to make provision for the creation axid regulation, for the organization, and for the government of municipal corporations. Certainly it cannot be said that the act passed in pursuance of the mandate here given is so plainly in excess of authority that the courts would be justified in holding it to be null and void, as in contravention of the constitutional provisions to which we have referred. It is not necessary to reiterate or to cite authorities in support of the proposition that, while courts possess power to declare acts of the General Assembly unconstitutional, they will not do so unless there is clear violation of some explicit provision of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">We are of opinion that the same process of reasoning, which in the case of <em>Henrico County </em>v. <em>City of Richmond </em>led to the conclusion that the act for the annexation of territory was valid, leads inevitably to the saxne result in dealing with the act of March 14, 1908.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">It is assigned as error that the court found that the prayer of the petition was reasonable when the evidence does not sustain that conclusion, and that it erred because, while the act authorizes the incorporation of a \u2018\u2018thickly-settled community,\u201d it does xiot justify the carving out of a part of a thickly-settled community and its incorporation. We will consider these two together.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">We have carefully considered the evidence in this case axid the maps which are made a part of the record, from which it plainly appears that there is a continuous settlement fronting upon \u201cWestern Branch\u201d; that through this settlement there passes what is known as the \u201cBelt Line\u201d railway. That portion of the settlement to the west of the railway is known as \u201cPinners,\u201d that to the east as \u201c Port Norfolk. \u201d They are contiguous to each other, and appear to be homogeneous in population and in real interests, though there may be diversity of opinion between them. They are separated only by the tracks of a railway, that is made one of the boundaries set out in the petition for the incorporation of \u201cPinners,\u201d some of the streets passing through Pinners and Port Norfolk without interruption; and we cannot think it reasonable, or to the best interests of that community, that they should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>be divided into parts, and considered and treated as two separate communities, when, in truth, they constitute but one continuous, contiguous, and homogeneous settlement. As the act requires that the town incorporated shall contain not less than two hundred inhabitants, it is conceivable that such a community might be almost indefinitely sub-divided and erected into municipal corporations, if a faction in one of the sub-divisions chanced to obtain control. We do not believe that the act contemplates anything of the kind, and when it provides for the incorporation of a thickly-settled community, it does not mean that that community shall be sub-divided in accordance with the caprice and whim of a limited portion of the people constituting the entire community. Great and unnecessary burdens might be imposed, and great wrong and injury accomplished, under such a construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">We are of opinion that the evidence does not justify the finding of the circuit court, that the prayer of the petition is reasonable, and that the general good of the community will be promoted by the incorporation of the town of Pinners.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The order appealed from is therefore reversed, and the petition is dismissed, with costs to the parties substantially prevailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
