The evidence before the jury touching the right of the defendants in error to recover was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>conflicting, and the case was fairly submitted in accordance with the law as already laid down by this court. Under such circumstances, upon well-settled principles, the verdict of the jury cannot be disturbed, and the judgment complained of must, therefore, be aflirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
