The only description contained in the contract of the land sold is \u201cforty acres of land, more or less, said land being part of 'Clifton,\u2019 and adjoining the lands of Alexander Pratt and \u2018 Belvidere.\u2019 \u201d The contract does not clearly show what the aggregate purchase price was, but it is conceded that it was $200. No survey of the land sold to Washington was made, but the evidence shows that the parties went upon the ground at the time of the sale, and agreed upon the lines and corners.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Merrill, the vendor, died about 1896, and a suit in equity was instituted in the circuit court of King George county to settle up his estate. At that time Letcher Washington had made payments on his purchase sufficient to reduce the balance due from him on the land to $109.34, which sum he paid to the administrator of William Merrill, and filed his petition in the pending chancery suit, setting up his purchase from Merrill under the contract of February 16, 1891, alleging the payment of the purchase money, and asking that a commissioner might be appointed to make him a deed. By decree of October 10, 1896, J. E. Mason, commissioner appointed for the purpose, was directed to \u201cconvey the said forty acres of land, with special warranty, to the said Letcher Washington.\u201d By this same decree the sale of the \u201cClifton\u201d farm, which had been sold by order of the court, was confirmed to the purchaser, Galen R. Smith, \u201c after deducting the forty acres purchased from William Merrill, during his lifetime, by Letcher Washington.\u201d By deed of November 10,' 1896, Mason, commissioner, conveyed to the purchaser \u201cClifton\u201d farm, \u201ccontaining, by estimation, after deducting the aforesaid purchase of Letcher Washington, three hundred and sixty acres, be the same more or less.\u201d Commissioner Mason did not make the deed, as directed, to Letcher Washington, and, by deed of November 1, 1898, C. H. Ashton, substituted commissioner, conveyed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>to Washington \u201cthe said tract of land of forty acres, lying and situate in the county of King George, and formerly a part of what is known as 'Clifton\u2019 farm, and which adjoins and is bounded by other land of the said Washington, the'land of J. H. Carpenter, and of J. M. Branigan, the \u2018Belvidere\u2019 farm, and the residue of the \u2018Clifton\u2019 farm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">In March, 1899, a final decree was entered in the cause, settling up the Merrill estate, and it was dismissed from the docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">By deed, dated June 10, 1904, Letcher Washington conveyed this land to the appellee, James B. Mullen, describing it as a certain tract or lot of land conveyed to him by C. H. Ashton, commissioner, and giving practically the same description given in the deed from the commissioner to him. By deed of February 22, 1901, the appellant, Galen R. Smith, conveyed, by metes and bounds, courses and distances, to the appellant, J. H. Carpenter, 19.68 acres, it being part of the Clifton farm purchased by the grantor from the court. This conveyance is bounded by the Washington purchase on the upper side and the rear. In April, 1907, some sixteen years after Washington\u2019s purchase, Mullen, his grantee, had the land surveyed for the first time, and found that, instead of forty acres, the Washington tract only contained 31.66 acres, a difference of 8.34 acres. Thereupon Mullen, the appellee, instituted this chancery suit in the Circuit Court of King George county, alleging that he was entitled to forty acres of land by virtue of his purchase from Washington, and asking that the court decide and determine the definite location of such forty acres of land, and that the deed from Ashton, commissioner, to Washington, and the deed from Mason, commissioner, to the appellant, Smith, be reformed, so as to make them fix definitely the boundary of his said land.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The judge of the Circuit Court of King George county being so situated as to make it improper for him to hear and decide the cause, it was, by order entered May 5, 1908, removed to the Corporation Court of the city of Fredericksburg, to be there heard and determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Since the institution of this suit, the appellee, James B. Mullen, has, by deed dated December 16,1909, conveyed the land purchased by him from Letcher Washington to Charles T. Purks, who has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>filed a petition herein, setting up his rights as the grantee of Mullen, \u2022and asking that those rights be protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">By decree of May 9, 1911, the Corporation Court of the city of Fredericksburg held that the appellee, James B. Mullen, was \u2022entitled to the relief prayed for by him, and directed a surveyor, as special commissioner appointed for the purpose, to go upon the land and, in accordance with the plat and survey made and filed by James B. Mullen with his bill, to run the lines so as to include in the Washington or Mullen tract forty acres. The result of this order was to carve out of the tract of 19.68 acres owned by J. H. Carpenter 8.34 acres, in the shape of a triangle, which was added to the Mullen tract of 31.66 acres, thereby completing the forty acres claimed by Mullen. The report of the surveyor and commissioner carrying out these directions of the court was, over the objection of the appellants, confirmed by decree of July 11, 1911. From these two decrees this appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">In his bill the plaintiff, Mullen, admits that no survey of the land sold to Washington was ever made. It is not controverted that Washington\u2019s purchase was an undefined portion of a four-hundred-acre tract, with nothing in the contract to distinguish it from any other portion of the \u201c Clifton\u201d farm, except that it joined Alexander Pratt and \u201cBelvidere, \u201d two other large farms adjoining <em>u </em>Clifton. \u2019 \u2019 The decree of the Circuit Court of King George county directing a deed to be made to Washington, and the deed made in pursuance of that decree, are as indefinite in description of the land as the contract in pursuance of which they were made. It would be impossible to locate the land intended to be sold by the description thereof in either the contract, the decree, or the deed. There is no evidence by which either the Circuit Court of King George or the Corporation Court of the city of Fredericksburg could have told what lines to run in order to cut off Washington\u2019s forty acres. The action of the Corporation Court was purely arbitrary. It could as easily have decreed that Mullen\u2019s back line be moved west to include forty acres as to decree, as it did, that his side line and his back line be pulled out in a northerly direction until forty acres were embraced, without anything to show that Merrill and Washington, the original vendor and vendee, ever contemplated any such figure of land or location of lines. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Is clear that'the contract set up in the bill and attempted to be proved is so vague and indefinite in its description of the land .sold that it cannot be enforced by a court of equity. The agreement sought to be enforced must not only be clearly proved; it must be certain and definite in all its parts. Its terms must be sufficiently precise to obviate any reasonable misunderstanding of their import, and if they be vague and uncertain a court of equity will decline to interfere to enforce it. <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>76 Va. 833; <em>Tidewater Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Hurt, </em>109 Va. 204, 63 S. E. 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">In <em>Westfall </em>v. <em>Cottrills, </em>24 W. Va. 763, a contract to sell and convey \u201cforty acres off the Spring Fork end of my tract of one hundred and forty-seven acres on Beach Fork, in Calhoun county,\u201d was held to be too vague and indefinite to be specifically enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">In <em>Blankenship </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>31 W. Va. 510, 7 S. E. 433, \u201csixty-seven and a half acres, being the lower end of a larger tract, \u201d was held to be an insufficient description of the land sold for it to be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">In the case of <em>Butcher </em>v. <em>Creel\u2019s Heirs, </em>9 Gratt. (50 Va.) 201, C conveyed to B five acres of land, including a mill and a saw-mill; \u201creserving to himself the right to build or erect a saw-mill on the opposite side of the said river, or at the further end of the dam of the aforesaid saw and grist mill.\u201d It was held that there was no such certainty in the description of the land intended to be excepted out of the conveyance as to withdraw it from the operation of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In <em>Virginia Iron, Coal &amp; Coke Co. </em>v. <em>Crane\u2019s Nest C. &amp; C. Co., </em>102 Va. 405, 46 S. E. 393, where it appeared that the contract described no definite boundary, but called for \u201ca certain piece of land lying on Sandy Ridge, in Wise county, Va., say forty or fifty acres, more or less, \u201d out of a larger boundary, it was conceded that the contract was void for uncertainty in its description of the land referred to. See also <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Hustead, </em>219 Pa. 287, 68 Atl. 839; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>121 Ill. 469, 13 N. E. 210, 2 Am. St. Rep. 119; <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>64 N. C. 734; <em>Rampke </em>v. <em>Buchler, </em>203 Ill. 384, 67 N. E. 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">In the cases cited the contracts were held unenforceable because the description of the subject matter was too vague, indefinite, .and uncertain to be enforced. The contract, decree, and deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>under which Mullen and Purks claim, in the case before us, is not more certain, definite, and specific in its identification of the land intended to be sold than in the cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The evidence shows that at the time of the sale by William Merrill to Letcher Washington, in February, 1891, the parties went upon the land, and, in the presence of witnesses, designated the lines and corners of the land intended to be bought and sold, and that both expressed themselves as satisfied with the lines and corners then indicated, and with the body of land embraced within those limits; that during Washington\u2019s ownership of the land fences were built upon the lines thus indicated by the parties, and have been ever since maintained upon those lines and regarded as showing the true boundary of the land sold by Merrill to Washington. The parties, by this practical location, assented to by both, fixed their lines, which were left indefinite in the written contract, and although, as shown by the recent survey, made at the instance of Washington\u2019s grantee, the boundary contains less than the parties may have supposed, it is all that was definitely described as constituting the subject matter of the contract, and Washington and his alienees cannot at this late day question the result of such practical location, but must abide by it, as the only definite description of the land sold under the contract, the decree, and the deed relied on.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">For these reasons, the decrees complained of must be reversed, and this court will enter such decree as the lower court ought to have entered, dismissing the original and amended bills filed by the appellee, James B. Mullen.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
