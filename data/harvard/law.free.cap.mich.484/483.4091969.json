These prerequisites are often referred to as numerosity, commonality, typicality, adequacy, and superiority.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In this case we consider the proper analysis a court must conduct when determining whether the prerequisites for class certification have been met. Additionally, we consider whether this particular class of plaintiffs was erroneously certified by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In deciding these questions, we conclude that a party seeking class certification is required to provide the certifying court with information sufficient to establish that each prerequisite for class certification in MCR 3.501(A)(1) is in fact satisfied. A court should avoid making determinations on the merits of the underlying claims at the class certification stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Additionally, we remand this case to the circuit court for clarification of its analysis of MCR 3.501(A)(1)(c) and (d) in light of our opinion today.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">This case arises from allegations that defendant, Dow Chemical Company, negligently released dioxin, a synthetic chemical that is potentially hazardous to human health, from its Midland plant into the Tittabawassee River. The representative plaintiffs allege that they, along with the proposed class members, have incurred property damage caused by the dioxin contamination. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are based on theories of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>negligence and nuisance. This dispute concerns the circuit court\u2019s decision to grant plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">At the outset, we note that Dow\u2019s alleged dioxin contamination of the Tittabawassee River has been the subject of a prior appeal in this Court <em>(Henry I).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Henry I, </em>we addressed plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that dioxin negligently released by Dow caused a risk of harm to their health.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Henry I, </em>we articulated the basic facts and procedural history surrounding the alleged dioxin contamination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">Defendant, The Dow Chemical Company, has maintained a plant on the banks of the Tittabawassee River in Midland, Michigan, for over a century. The plant has produced a host of products, including, to name only a few, \u201cstyrene, butadiene, picric acid, mustard gas, Saran Wrap, Styrofoam, Agent Orange, and various pesticides including Chloropyrifos, Dursban and 2,4, 5-trichlorophenol.\u201d Michigan Department of Community Health, Division of Environmental and Occupational Epidemiology, <em>Pilot Exposure Investigation: Dioxin Exposure in Adults Living in the Tittabawassee River Flood Plain, Saginaw County, Michigan, </em>May 25, 2004, p 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">According to plaintiffs and published reports from the [Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ)], defendant\u2019s operations in Midland have had a deleterious effect on the local environment. In 2000, General Motors Corporation was testing soil samples in an area near the Tittabawassee River and the Saginaw River when it discovered the presence of dioxin, a hazardous chemical believed to cause a variety of health problems such as cancer, liver disease, and birth defects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">By spring 2001, the MDEQ had confirmed the presence of dioxin in the soil of the Tittabawassee flood plain. Further investigation by the MDEQ indicated that defendant\u2019s Midland plant was the likely source of the dioxin. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, Remediation and Redevelopment Division, <em>Final Report, Phase II Tittabawassee/Saginaw River Dioxin Flood Plain Sampling Study, </em>June 2003, p 42 (identifying Dow\u2019s Midland plant as the \u201cprincipal source of dioxin contamination in the Tittabawassee River sediments and the Tittabawassee River flood plain soils\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">In March 2003, plaintiffs moved for certification of two classes in the Saginaw Circuit Court. The first class was composed of individuals who owned property in the flood plain of the Tittabawassee River and who alleged that their properties had declined in value because of the dioxin contamination. The second group consisted of individuals who have resided in the Tittabawassee flood plain area at some point since 1984 and who seek a court-supervised program of medical monitoring for the possible negative health effects of dioxin discharged from Dow\u2019s Midland plant. This latter class consists of 173 plaintiffs and, by defendant\u2019s estimation, \u201cthousands\u201d of putative members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">Defendant moved under MCR 2.116(C)(8) for summary disposition of plaintiffs\u2019 medicad monitoring claim. The Saginaw Circuit Court denied this motion, and denied defendant\u2019s subsequent motions for reconsideration and for a stay of proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">After the Court of Appeals denied defendant\u2019s motion for peremptory reversal amd emergency application for leave to appeal, the defendant sought emergency leave to appeal in this Court. Discovery and other preliminary proceedings on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification continued in the Saginaw Circuit Court until, on June 3, 2004, we stayed the proceedings below and granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Given that plaintiffs did not allege a <em>present </em>medical injury, we concluded that plaintiffs did not assert a viable negligence claim recognized by Michigan com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>man law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, we reversed the circuit court\u2019s denial of Dow\u2019s motion for summary disposition with regard to plaintiffs\u2019 medical monitoring claims and remanded the matter to the circuit court for entry of an order of summary disposition accordingly.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">On remand, the circuit court addressed plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification with respect to the remaining claims of negligence and nuisance, which are the subjects of the present appeal. The current proposed class consists of persons owning real property within the 100-year flood plain of the Tittabawassee River on February 1, 2002.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The proposed class is estimated by plaintiffs to consist of approximately 2,000 persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The circuit court certified the proposed class, concluding that the prerequisites for class certification in MCR 3.501(A)(1) were met. Specifically, the circuit court ruled that joinder of approximately 2,000 persons is impracticable, the question of Dow\u2019s allegedly negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>gent pollution is common to all plaintiffs, the mere fact that damages may be individualized is not sufficient to defeat class certification, the plaintiffs\u2019 property claims arise from the same alleged actions of Dow, the class members share common legal and remedial theories, and the representative plaintiffs are able to fairly and adequately protect the interests of the proposed class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Additionally, the circuit court determined that maintenance of this suit as a class action is the superior method of adjudication given that denial of class certification may result in up to 2,000 individual suits against Dow. The circuit court further reasoned that a class action would be manageable here because the class members all reside in the allegedly polluted area and similar evidence would be required to establish Dow\u2019s negligence with respect to each class member.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The Court of Appeals granted Dow\u2019s application for leave to appeal from the circuit court order granting class certification. In a divided decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the class certification with regard to the issue of Dow\u2019s liability only.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The lead opinion concluded that class certification on <em>all </em>issues, including the issue of damages, is proper.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>The lead opinion relied on the MDEQ findings submitted by plaintiffs and held that, in light of the MDEQ\u2019s findings and the fact that the parties presented contradicting theories of the dioxin contamination, the circuit court did not clearly err.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">A partial concurrence to and partial dissent from the lead Court of Appeals opinion agreed that the circuit court did not err in certifying the class with respect to Dow\u2019s liability, but concluded that individualized questions prevailed with respect to the issue of damages. Thus, the partial concurrence and partial dissent reasoned that a bifurcated proceeding would be the most appropriate manner of adjudication.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The Court of Appeals dissent concluded that the circuit court did not engage in a \u201crigorous analysis\u201d to determine whether the prerequisites for class certification are met, as required by <em>Gen Tel Co of the Southwest v Falcon, </em>457 US 147, 161; 102 S Ct 2364; 72 L Ed 2d 740 (1982). Therefore, the dissent concluded that the class was erroneously certified with respect to <em>all </em>issues.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">This Court granted Dow\u2019s application for leave to appeal, asking the parties to address, among other issues, whether the federal \u201crigorous analysis\u201d requirement for class certification also applies to state class actions and whether this particular class of plaintiffs was properly certified by the circuit court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">In order to resolve the issues presented in this case, this Court must first consider the proper application of MCR 3.501(A). The proper interpretation and application of a court rule is a question of law, which we review de novo.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This court uses the principles of statutory construction when interpreting a Michigan court rule.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We begin by considering the plain language of the court rule in order to ascertain its meaning.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cThe intent of the rule must be determined from an examination of the court rule itself and its place within the structure of the Michigan Court Rules as a whole.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">However, we note that this Court has not formally established the standard of review for class certification decisions. Therefore, we take this opportunity to do so. We have held that where a party challenges a trial court\u2019s factual findings, a review for clear error is appropriate, and where a party challenges a trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion, a review for abuse of discretion is appropriate.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Given that the analysis a trial court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>undertake in order to determine whether to certify a proposed class may involve making both findings of fact <em>and </em>discretionary determinations, we find it proper to review the trial court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and the decisions within the trial court\u2019s discretion for abuse of discretion. This differentiated standard of review for class certification decisions is consistent with the mixed nature of a proper class certification analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The parties dispute whether the federal \u201crigorous analysis\u201d requirement for class certification also applies to state class actions and whether class certification was appropriate in this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">A. WHAT IS THE PROPER ANALYSIS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER CLASS CERTIFICATION IS JUSTIFIED?</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Pursuant to MCR 3.501(A)(1), members of a class may <em>only </em>sue or be sued as a representative party of all class members <em>if </em>the prerequisites dictated by the court rule are met. Therefore, in order to proceed with a suit in the form of a class action, the following circumstances must exist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">(a) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">(b) there are questions of law or fact common to the members of the class that predominate over questions affecting only individual members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-11\">(c) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-12\">(d) the representative parties will fairly and adequately assert and protect the interests of the class; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>(e) the maintenance of the action as a class action will be superior to other available methods of adjudication in promoting the convenient administration of justice. [MCR 3.501(A)(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Next, MCR 3.501(A)(2) sets forth the following non-exhaustive list of factors that a court should consider when determining whether maintaining a suit as a class action is the \u201csuperior\u201d method of adjudication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">(a) whether the prosecution of separate actions by or against individual members of the class would create a risk of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">(i) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class that would confront the party opposing the class with incompatible standards of conduct; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">(ii) adjudications with respect to individual members of the class that would as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">(b) whether final equitable or declaratory relief might be appropriate with respect to the class;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">(c) whether the action will he manageable as a class action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-11\">(d) whether in view of the complexity of the issues or the expense of litigation the separate claims of individual class members are insufficient in amount to support separate actions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-12\">(e) whether it is probable that the amount which may be recovered by individual class members will be large enough in relation to the expense and effort of administering the action to justify a class action; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-13\">(f) whether members of the class have a significant interest in controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions. [MCR 3.501(A)(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>It is important to note that the rules governing class certification in MCR 3.501(A) very closely mirror the federal prerequisites for class certification found in FR Civ P 23. In <em>Falcon, </em>the United States Supreme Court reiterated that the class action device for litigation is \u201c \u2018an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Supreme Court concluded that district courts must conduct a \u201crigorous analysis\u201d of each of the class action prerequisites in FR Civ P 23 before certifying a class.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Dow argues that the federal \u201crigorous analysis\u201d requirement should apply to state class actions as well.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Dow asserts that representative plaintiffs will <em>always </em>allege that their proposed class complies with the prerequisites for class certification, and a trial court should not simply rely on these allegations when deciding whether to certify a class. While Dow concedes that a court may not deny class certification on the ground that plaintiffs are unlikely to prevail on the merits of their underlying claims, Dow argues that this prohibition alone does not relieve plaintiffs of their burden to establish that the prerequisites of class certification have in fact been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Conversely, plaintiffs argue that only MCR 3.501(A) governs class certification in Michigan, and that this court rule does not mandate a \u201crigorous analysis.\u201d Additionally, plaintiffs point out that no decision by this Court, or any published opinion by the Court of Appeals, has held that the federal \u201crigorous analysis\u201d requirement applies to state class actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Given that Michigan\u2019s requirements for class certification are nearly identical to the federal requirements, we find it reasonable to conclude that similar purposes, goals, and cautions are applicable to both.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> While it is true that Michigan courts are not bound by any decision requiring a \u201crigorous analysis,\u201d we question whether the purpose of the strictly articulated class certification prerequisites would be defeated if a representative plaintiffs only burden is to simply state that its proposed class does in fact meet the prerequisites.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Dow argues that this type of lax burden would give courts the authority to \u201crubber stamp\u201d a plaintiffs allegations that the prerequisites in MCR 3.501(A)(1) have been met. To avoid this danger, Dow urges this Court to clarify that the federal \u201crigorous analysis\u201d standard applies for state class actions. However, Dow\u2019s argument seems to implicate only two options: either Michigan courts must conduct a \u201crigorous analysis\u201d for class certification decisions, or Michigan courts may simply accept a plaintiffs bare assertions that the prerequisites for class certification are in fact met. We believe that Dow\u2019s argument is unnecessarily narrow in scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The plain language of MCR 3.501(A)(1) states that representative plaintiffs may pursue a class action suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number><em>\u201conly if\u2019 </em>the enumerated prerequisites are met. Thus, it is apparent that strict adherence to the class certification requirements is required. There is nothing ambiguous about this court rule. A party seeking class certification must meet the burden of establishing each prerequisite before a suit may proceed as a class action. Furthermore, there is no authority in Michigan allowing a party seeking class certification to avoid this affirmative burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The next logical inquiry is what a party must show in order to satisfy a court that the prerequisites for class certification are established. More specifically, how must a court <em>analyze </em>a party\u2019s motion for class certification to determine whether sufficient information exists to justify certification?</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Given that MCR 3.501(A)(1) contains carefully crafted prerequisites for class certification, common sense dictates that at least some greater analysis is required than simply accepting a party\u2019s bare assertion that the prerequisites have been met. The United States Supreme Court has labeled this greater analysis as a \u201crigorous\u201d one in <em>Falcon </em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The problem is that <em>Falcon </em>provides little guidance as to what a \u201crigorous analysis\u201d actually entails. Furthermore, <em>Falcon </em>is so factually distinct from the present case that we are unable to draw significant parallel conclusions.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> What we <em>can </em>infer from the <em>Falcon </em>decision is that a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>must only certify a class in circumstances where the court has actually been <em>shown </em>that the prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Before <em>Falcon, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that trial courts should not conduct \u201ca preliminary inquiry into the merits\u201d of claims when making a class certification determination.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In <em>Falcon, </em>the Supreme Court reasoned that because the decision to certify a class involves considerations \u201c \u2018enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiffs cause of action,\u2019 \u201d a court may at times need to look further than the pleadings to make a determination on class certification.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Supreme Court added that, sometimes, the question of certification will be plainly and adequately answered by the pleadings.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> After <em>Falcon, </em>the Supreme Court clarified that a trial court has broad discretion when determining whether a class should be certified; however, its discretion must be exercised within the framework of FR Civ P 23.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Now, federal courts must balance both the prohibition against delving into the merits of claims during the class certification determination with the requirement that courts conduct a \u201crigorous analysis\u201d to determine whether the class certification prerequisites are satisfied. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit recognizes that district courts must conduct a \u201crigorous analysis\u201d to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>whether the prerequisites in FR Civ P 23 are met.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In addition, the Sixth Circuit has acknowledged that it is possible to determine that the requirements for class certification are met solely on the basis of the pleadings.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Nevertheless, this determination often requires more information than the pleadings provide.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">We agree with Dow that a certifying court may not simply \u201crubber stamp\u201d a party\u2019s allegations that the class certification prerequisites are met.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> However, the federal \u201crigorous analysis\u201d requirement does not necessarily bind state courts.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> We believe that the plain language of MCR 3.501(A) provides sufficient guidance for class certification decisions in Michigan. Given that MCR 3.501(A)(1) expressly conditions a class action on satisfaction of the prerequisites, a party seeking class certification is required to provide the certifying court with information sufficient to establish that each prerequisite for class certification in MCR 3.501(A)(1) is in fact satisfied. A court may base its decision on the pleadings alone <em>only if </em>the pleadings set forth sufficient information to satisfy the court that each prerequisite is in fact met.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The averments in the pleadings of a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>seeking class certification are only sufficient to certify a class if they satisfy the burden on the party seeking certification to prove that the prerequisites are met, such as in cases where the facts necessary to support this finding are uncontested or admitted by the opposing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">If the pleadings are not sufficient, the court must look to additional information beyond the pleadings to determine whether class certification is proper.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> However, when considering the information provided to support class certification, courts must not abandon the well-accepted prohibition against assessing the merits of a party\u2019s underlying claims at this early stage in the proceedings.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Similar to the federal district courts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>state courts also have broad discretion to determine whether a class will be certified.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Certifying courts must be mindful that, when it is necessary to look beyond a party\u2019s assertions to determine whether class certification is proper, the courts shall analyze any asserted facts, claims, defenses, and relevant law without questioning the actual merits of the case.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We believe the above analysis strikes the appropriate balance between the need to ensure that the class certification prerequisites are sufficiently satisfied and the need to preserve a trial court\u2019s discretion in making class certification decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">B. DID THE CIRCUIT COURT ENGAGE IN AN APPROPRIATE ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE PREREQUISITES FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION WERE SATISFIED IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE?</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">After reviewing the circuit court\u2019s decision, we believe its articulation and application of the analysis for class certification is potentially inconsistent with the required analysis. Therefore, we give the circuit court the opportunity to evaluate the class certification prerequisites in light of this Court\u2019s articulation of the proper analysis for determining whether class certification is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Again, there are cases where the pleadings alone will be sufficient to establish that the prerequisites are met, and a court should not evaluate the merits of the case at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the class certification stage; however, mere repetition of the language of MCR 3.501(A)(1) is not sufficient to justify class certification, and there must be an adequate statement of basic facts to indicate that each prerequisite is fulfilled. As we have concluded, at least some greater analysis is required than simply accepting a party\u2019s bare assertion that the prerequisites have been met. Thus, a circuit court may not simply accept as true a party\u2019s bare statement that a prerequisite is met unless the court independently determines that the plaintiff has at least alleged a statement of basic facts and law that are adequate to support that prerequisite.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In this particular case, before conducting its analysis of the class certification prerequisites, the circuit court announced that it must \u201caccept the allegations of the plaintiff in support of the motion as true.\u201d This statement is potentially inconsistent with the standard adopted by this Court today to the extent that it could be read to require courts to accept as true plaintiffs\u2019 bare assertions that the class certification prerequisites are met.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">It is not clear whether the circuit court\u2019s understanding of the prerequisites of MCR 3.501(A)(1) was consistent with the proper analysis announced in this Court\u2019s decision today. We acknowledge that this case does not present a situation in which plaintiffs provided the circuit court with only a complaint containing bare assertions that the prerequisites of MCR 3.501(A)(1) were met and the circuit court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification on the basis of those asser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>tions alone. Instead, the circuit court conducted a two-day hearing and reviewed numerous documents from both parties, including scientific studies, affidavits from experts, and information provided by the MDEQ. In its analysis of MCR 3.501(A)(1)(a), (b), and (e), the circuit court appears to have independently determined that plaintiffs alleged a statement of basic facts and law sufficient to support each of those three prerequisites, and we hold that its analysis of those three prerequisites was sufficient. For MCR 3.501(A)(1)(c) and (d), however, the analysis conducted on the record by the circuit court was not sufficient to meet the proper analysis announced by this Court today.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">For MCR 3.501(A)(1)(c) and (d), where the analysis conducted by the circuit court on the record was not sufficient to meet the proper analysis, we do not believe that it is possible to look behind the circuit court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>analysis in order to guess whether the circuit court actually conducted the correct analysis or whether the circuit court would have reached the same result if it <em>had </em>conducted the correct analysis. Especially given the extensive evidentiary record developed in this case before the class certification decision, the circuit court may have made a valid, independent determination that the plaintiffs had alleged an adequate statement of basic facts and law sufficient to support a finding that MCR 3.501(A)(1)(c) and (d) were met. Nonetheless, because the circuit court potentially used an evaluative framework that is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s interpretation of the rule, we remand this case to the circuit court so that it may at least clarify its reasoning for ruling that MCR 3.501(A)(1)(c) and (d) were met, in light of this Court\u2019s decision today.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">We do not reach the question of if, and to what extent, the issues involved in this case should be \u201cbifurcated.\u201d However, we note that it is within the circuit court\u2019s discretion to certify a class on a limited basis and to decertify certain members of the class when it deems it appropriate under MCR 3.501(B)(3).<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Indeed, the circuit court\u2019s order suggested that it recognizes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>that it will likely be administratively easier to bifurcate at some point. Given that the most efficient method for conducting the proceedings will likely be affected by how other issues in the case develop, and given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>circuit court\u2019s extensive familiarity with the complex factual and legal issues presented, we do not think that the circuit court abused its discretion by waiting to determine to what extent bifurcation of the issues involved may be needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">A party seeking class certification bears the burden of establishing that each of the prerequisites for class certification in MCR 3.501(A)(1) is in fact satisfied. It is not sufficient for a certifying court to simply accept a party\u2019s assertion that the prerequisites are met. When it is necessary to look beyond a party\u2019s assertions in order to assess whether the prerequisites for class certification are met, a certifying court should do so without delving into the merits of the underlying claims involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Because the circuit court potentially used an evaluative framework that is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s interpretation of the rule and articulation of the proper analysis for class certification, we remand this case to the circuit court so that it may at least clarify its reasoning for ruling that MCR 3.501(A)(1)(c) and (d) were met, in light of this Court\u2019s decision today.</p>\n<judges id=\"b563-7\">Kelly, C.J., Cavanagh and Hathaway, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-10\"> See <em>infra </em>at 496-497 for the complete court rule containing the prerequisites for class certification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b543-8\"> <em>Henry v Dow Chem Co, </em>473 Mich 63; 701 NW2d 684 (2005) <em>(Hemy I).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b543-9\"> <em>Id. </em>at 67.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b544-10\"> <em>Id. </em>at 69-70.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b545-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 81.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b545-9\"> <em>Id. </em>at 102.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b545-10\"> Plaintiffs define the scope of the 100-year flood plain of the Tittabawassee River as the geographic area bounded on the west and south by River Road and Stroebel Road, including areas on the west and south side of those roads, and bounded on the east and north by Midland Road, St. Andrews Road, and Michigan Avenue, including areas on the east and north side of those roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality provides the following information regarding \u201cfloodplains\u201d on its website:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-12\">A river, stream, lake, or drain may on occasion overflow [its] hanks and inundate adjacent land areas.

The Court of Appeals wrote three separate opinions. <em>Henry v Dow Chem Co, </em>unpublished opinion of the Court of Appeals, issued January 24, 2008 (Docket No. 266433). Judge Karen Fort Hood would have affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling that the class should be certified, without qualification.

A review of the cases in the string citation serves to illustrate that the claim is simply false.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Justice YOUNG claims that in <em>Vanslembrouck v Halperin,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> t</em>he Court ignored <em>Vega v Lakeland Hosps.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, <em>Vanslembrouck </em>is distinguishable from <em>Vega </em>because <em>Vega </em>determined that MCL 600.5851(1) is a savings provision, whereas <em>Vanslembrouck </em>held that MCL 600.5851(7) is a statute of limitations. Thus, these cases examined the effect of altogether different statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Justice YOUNG also claims that in <em>Hardacre v Saginaw Vascular Services,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court failed to follow <em>Boodt v Borgess Med Ctr.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, in <em>Hardacre, </em>the Court denied leave to appeal because the allegations in the plaintiffs notice of intent to file an action did not need to comply with <em>Boodt. </em>In <em>Hardacre, </em>the burden of explication of the standard of care was minimal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Nor did the Court ignore precedents with which it disagrees in <em>Sazima v Shepherd Bar &amp; </em>Restaurant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Justice YOUNG claims that the Court failed to follow <em>Chrysler v Blue Arrow Transport Lines.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, <em>Sazima </em>involved exceptions to the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule as set forth in <em>Camburn v Northwest School Dist.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, the Court was not bound by <em>Chrysler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Justice YOUNG next claims the Court ignored <em>Smith v </em>Khouri<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> when it decided <em>Juarez v Holbrook</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, in <em>Juarez, </em>it was undisputed that the trial court performed a reasonableness analysis in calculating the proper attorney fee award. Therefore, a remand in light of <em>Smith </em>was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Likewise, Justice YOUNG is incorrect in claiming that the Court failed to enforce <em>Thornton v Allstate Ins </em>Co<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and <em>Putkamer v Transamerica Ins Corp of America</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in <em>Scott v State Farm Mut Auto Ins </em>Co.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Scott, </em>the Court of Appeals undertook a thorough analysis of the relevant no-fault jurisprudence and applied precedent as it has been understood for nearly 30 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Finally, the Court did not fail to abide by <em>Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>in <em>Chambers v Wayne Co Airport Auth.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> Chambers </em>interpreted MCL 691.1406, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>while <em>Rowland </em>interpreted MCL 691.1404(1). Thus, the cases dealt with different statutory provisions and the Court was not bound to extend <em>Rowland </em>to the statute at issue in <em>Chambers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">In summary, the accusation that the Court has been ignoring precedent is incorrect. Had other justices been in the majority in some of the decisions complained about, they might well have extended existing precedent to a new area of the law. But the refusal of those in the majority in this case to so extend precedent is quite different from a refusal on their part to apply it. This is a distinction that Justices Young, Corrigan, and Markman would do well to concede.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-8\"> See, e.g., <em>Petersen v Magna Corp, </em>484 Mich 300, 391-392; 773 NW2d 564 (2009) (Markman, J., dissenting); <em>Chambers v Wayne Co Airport Auth, </em>483 Mich 1081 (2009) (Corrigan, J., dissenting); <em>Scott v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, </em>483 Mich 1032 (2009) (Corrigan, J., dissenting); <em>Beasley v Michigan, </em>483 Mich 1025 (2009) (Corrigan, J., dissenting); <em>Juarez v Holbrook, </em>483 Mich 970 (2009) (Markman, J., dissenting).

The Michigan Court Rules govern the procedure for certifying class actions in Michigan courts. MCR 3.501(A)(1) provides specific prerequisites for proposed plaintiff classes. A party seeking class certification bears the burden of proving that these prerequisites are in fact met and must provide sufficient information to the ruling court for it to make the determination that the prerequisites are met. Because part II of the majority opinion correctly articulates the appropriate appellate standard of review for class certification decisions and part 111(A) of the majority opinion correctly articulates the appropriate legal standard a trial court must apply in ruling on a motion for class certification, I join those sections of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">While I would vacate the entirety of the trial court\u2019s class certification decision because it committed a legal error by using the wrong legal standard in certifying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>class, the majority determines only that the trial court\u2019s analysis of MCR 3.501(A)(1)(c) and (d) was insufficient and requires further explanation. In doing so, the majority also reverses <em>sub silentio </em>the determination of the Court of Appeals majority limiting the scope of the proposed class action to issues of liability only. I therefore dissent in part. Because I believe that the trial court\u2019s decision was wholly affected by its application of an incorrect standard, I would vacat\u00e9 the class certification in its entirety and remand to the trial court for a completely new ruling on the motion for class certification and limit any certification of the proposed class to issues of liability. The trial court in this case expressly indicated that it <em>must </em>\u201caccept the allegations of the plaintiff in support of the motion [for class certification] as true.\u201d This is inconsistent with the plain requirement of the court rules, which allow class certification \u201conly if\u201d the prerequisites listed in MCR 3.501(A)(1) are <em>met, </em>not merely alleged. I therefore would vacate its class certification regarding liability in its entirety and remand to the trial court so it can apply the appropriate legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">I also dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to give discretion to the trial court to certify the class on the issue of damages. The plaintiffs did not cross-appeal the decision of the Court of Appeals majority to vacate class certification on the issue of damages, and therefore this Court cannot vitiate this unappealed ruling of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Plaintiffs commenced the instant action against defendant, Dow Chemical Company, for its alleged pollution of the Tittabawassee River. They claim that the release of dioxin into the Tittabawassee River has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>either directly contaminated their properties or has otherwise adversely affected their properties. They subsequently moved for class certification. Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed class consists of all owners of real property in Saginaw County within the 100-year flood plain of the Tittabawassee River, as of February 1, 2002.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2This proposed class contains approximately 2,000 people. Defendant opposed class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">After receiving supplemental briefs and hearing oral arguments on the motion for class certification, the Saginaw Circuit Court issued its opinion and order granting class certification on October 21, 2005. At the outset of its analysis, the court explained that it was bound to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations supporting its motion for class certification as true:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">Due to the limited case law in Michigan addressing certification of class action lawsuits, the Court can refer to federal case law that interprets the federal rules on class certification. <em>Brenner v Marathon Oil Co, </em>222 Mich App 128, 133; 565 NW2d 1 (1997). When evaluating a motion for class certification, the court is to accept the allegations of the plaintiff in support of the motion as true. The merits of the case are not examined. <em>Allen v Chicago, </em>828 F Supp 543, 550 (ND 111, 1993). The plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the class should be certified. <em>Id.[</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">The court then listed the five requirements of class certification and discussed plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding each of these requirements. I reprint the trial court\u2019s analysis of the five requirements in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>a. The first requirement that the Plaintiffs must meet is that \u201cthe class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\u201d MCR 3.501(A)(1)(a). The Plaintiffs define the potential class as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201cAll persons who owned real property within the one-hundred year Flood Plain of the Tittabawassee River in Saginaw County, Michigan on February 1, 2002. For purposes of this class definition, the one-hundred year Flood Plain of the Tittabawassee River is defined as the geographic area set forth on the map attached as Exhibit A (Exhibit B attached to this order), which is generally bounded on the west and south by River Road and Stroebel Road, including property on the west and south side of such roads, and generally bounded on the east and north by Midland Road, St. Andrews Road, and Michigan Avenue, including property on the east and north sides of such roads and avenue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">The Plaintiffs also allege and the Court finds that there would be approximately 2,000 persons in the proposed class. The Court finds that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">b. There are questions of law or fact common' to the members of the class that predominate over questions affecting only individual members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">All of the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are based on the allegation that the Defendant polluted the Tittabawassee River, causing damage to the Plaintiffs in the form of reduced value of their home and property. Therefore, the alleged negligence of the Defendant, if any, as to the cause of the alleged pollution is common to all potential Plaintiffs. Equally, any questions of law would be common to the entire class. Although the question of damages may be individualized, the mere fact that damages may have to be computed individually is not enough to defeat a class action. As the Court stated in <em>Sterling v Velsicol Chem Corp, </em>855 F2d 1188, 1197 (CA 6, 1988):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">\u201cNo matter how individualized the issues of damages may he, these issues may be reserved for individual treatment with the question of liability tried as a class action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Consequently, the mere fact that questions peculiar to each individual member of the class remaining [sic] after the common questions of the defendant\u2019s liability have been resolved does not dictate the conclusion that a class action is impermissible.\u201d See also <em>Dix v Am Bankers Life Assurance Co, </em>429 Mich 410,417-419; 415 NW2d 206 (1987), and the more recent case of <em>Mejdrech v Met-Coil Sys Corp, </em>319 F3d 910 (CA 7, 2003).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">This Court finds that there are questions of law or fact common to the members of the class that predominate over questions affecting only individual members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">c. The claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">In this case, Plaintiffs contend that their property claims arise from the same course of conduct by Defendant Dow and that they share common legal and remedial theories with the members of the class. The court in <em>Cook v Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp, </em>151 FRD 378 (D Colo, 1993), stated: \u201cSo long as there is a nexus between the class representatives\u2019 claims [and] defenses and the common questions of fact or law which unite the class the typicality requirement is satisfied (citations omitted).... The positions of the named plaintiffs and the potential class members do not have to be identical. Thus, the requirement may be satisfied even though varying fact patterns support the claims or defenses of individual class members or there is a disparity in the damages claimed by the representative parties and the other members of the class. The court finds that the representative parties\u2019 claims are not adverse or antagonistic to others in the class. Therefore, the court finds that the claims or defenses of all of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class and are not antagonistic to the class.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">d. The representative parties will fairly and adequately assert and protect the interest of the class.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">There presently are approximately seven Plaintiffs who are the representative parties. Further, no proof has been submitted to this Court that would indicate that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Plaintiffs herein, the representative parties, would not fairly and adequately assert and protect the interest of the class.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-4\">e. The maintenance of the action as a class action will be superior to other available methods of adjudication in promoting the convenient administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">To deny a class action in this case and allow the Plaintiffs to pursue individual claims would result in up to 2,000 individual claims being filed in this Court. Such a result would impede the convenient administration of justice. Further, such a procedure would or could result in inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class. A class action would also assure legal assistance to the members of the class. Moreover, a class action would achieve economy of time, effort and expense. The Court specifically finds that the action would be manageable as a class action based on the facts and the reasons set forth herein. Each member of the class lives in the area alleged to have been damaged. Each member of the class allegedly suffered damages as a result of the release of contaminates in the Tittabawassee River. Almost identical evidence would be required to establish negligence and causal connection between the alleged toxic contamination and Plaintiffs\u2019 damages and the type of damages allegedly suffered. The Court stated in <em>Sterling v Velsicol Chem. </em>Corp, <em>supra </em>at 1197:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">\u201cIn the instant case, each class member lived in the vicinity of the landfill and allegedly suffered damages as a result of ingesting or otherwise using the contaminated water. Almost identical evidence would be required to establish the level and duration of chemical contamination, the causal connection, if any, between the plaintiffs\u2019 consumption of the contaminated water and the type of injuries allegedly suffered and the defendant\u2019s liability. A single major issue distinguishing the class members is the nature and amount of damages, if any, that each sustained. To this extent, a class action in the instant case avoided duplication of judicial effort and prevented separate actions from reaching inconsistent results with similar, if not identical, facts. The district court clearly did not abuse its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>discretion in certifying this action as a rule of [sic] 23(b)(3) class action. However, individual members of the class still would be required to submit evidence concerning their particularized damages, damage claims and subsequent proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\">The Court finds that the maintenance of the action as a class action will be superior to other available methods of adjudication in promoting the convenient administration of justice.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The Court of Appeals rendered three individual opinions in ruling on defendant\u2019s appeal. Judge METER and Judge FORT Hood affirmed the trial court\u2019s certification with regard to the issue of Dow\u2019s liability,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> while Judge METER and Judge K. F. KELLY determined that the individual issues predominate over class-wide issues with respect to damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant appeals the Court of Appeals judgment and claims that the trial court erred in certifying the plaintiff class.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It argues that certification should be vacated, first, because the trial court applied an erroneous legal standard in accepting plaintiffs\u2019 allegations in support of their motion for class certification as true and, second, because plaintiffs\u2019 proposed class fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">This Court has not expressly established a standard for reviewing certification of a class action, although in a peremptory order we impliedly reviewed a class cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>tification decision for clear error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals has accordingly employed a clear error standard.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cIn Michigan, the clear error standard has historically been applied when reviewing a trial court\u2019s factual findings, whereas the abuse of discretion standard is applied when reviewing matters left to the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> I concur in part II of the majority opinion and agree that legal determinations are reviewed under a de novo standard, that findings of fact are reviewed under a clear error standard, and the court\u2019s ultimate certification decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court\u2019s decision is outside the range of reasonable and principled outcomes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">III. TO BE CERTIFIED AS A CLASS OF PLAINTIFFS IN MICHIGAN COURTS, THE REQUIREMENTS PROVIDED IN MCR 3.501 MUST, <em>IN FACT, </em>BE MET</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The Michigan Court Rules govern the certification of class actions. MCR 3.501(A)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all members in a class action <em>only if:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">(a) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">(b) there are questions of law or fact common to the members of the class that predominate over questions affecting only individual members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">(c) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>(d) the representative parties will fairly and adequately assert and protect the interests of the class; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">(e) the maintenance of the action as a class action will be superior to other available methods of adjudication in promoting the convenient administration of justice.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The plain language of MCR 3.501(A)(1) is clear: representative plaintiffs may pursue a class action lawsuit \u201conly if\u201d the enumerated prerequisites have been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The procedure for certifying a class in Michigan underscores this requirement. Because a \u201cplaintiff must move for certification that the action may be maintained as a class action,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the plaintiff bears the burden of satisfying the trial court by a preponderance of the evidence that the prerequisites to class certification have been met. Moreover, once the plaintiff moves to certify a class, the trial court \u201cmay allow the action to be maintained as a class action, may deny the motion, or may order that a ruling be postponed pending discovery or other preliminary procedures.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In other words, MCR 3.501 expressly contemplates that the trial court should make an independent determination that the proposed class meets the requirements for class certification. Thus, a trial court may certify a class only if the plaintiffs have provided sufficient information that each prerequisite to class certification has been met. Because part 111(A) of the majority opinion correctly articulates this standard, I join that section of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">I also concur in the majority\u2019s decision to overrule <em>Neal v </em>James<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to the extent it \u201crequire[s] a trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>to accept as true a plaintiffs bare assertion that a class certification prerequisite is met... ,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals in <em>Neal </em>held that a trial court must \u201caccept the allegations made in support of the request for certification as true.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although the trial court in the instant case did not expressly indicate its reliance on <em>Neal, </em>as a published Court of Appeals decision, it is binding on all lower courts.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The requirement in <em>Neal </em>that a certifying court is bound to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations supporting its motion for class certification as true, however, is inconsistent with the plain meaning of MCR 3.501 as articulated above. Moreover, it cites stale federal precedent for its statement of law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>I concur with the majority that <em>Neal </em>is overruled to the extent that it is inconsistent with the rule of law articulated today.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">IV THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY CERTIFYING THE CLASS TO THE EXTENT IT STATED AND APPLIED AN ERRONEOUS STANDARD OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">A. THE TRIAL COURT ARTICULATED AN ERRONEOUS STANDARD OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Before certifying the plaintiff class, the trial court sought briefing and conducted extensive oral arguments on the motion for class certification. Nevertheless, even though it did so, the trial court\u2019s opinion made no mention of these facts. Instead, the trial court prefaced its ruling by explaining that \u201c[wjhen evaluating a motion for class certification, the court is to accept the allegations of the plaintiff in support of the motion as true.\u201d This statement has meaning, and its meaning completely rebuts plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court conducted the appropriate analysis in making its ruling on class certification. The trial court\u2019s statement indicates that it approached its analysis without the appropriate analytical independence from plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>allegations supporting class certification. It is appropriate to vacate the trial court\u2019s certification for this legal error alone.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">B. THE TRIAL COURT APPLIED AN ERRONEOUS STANDARD OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Moreover, a critical reading of the trial court\u2019s actual ruling underscores the inappropriate deference that the trial court afforded plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings on the motion for class certification. For example, in concluding that \u201cthere are questions of law or fact common to the members of the class that predominate over questions affecting only individual members,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the trial court merely reiterated plaintiffs\u2019 claims without discussing the arguments that defendant proffered in opposition to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Defendant\u2019s trial brief listed several questions of law or fact that it alleged required individualized determination:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">\u2022 How each proposed property class member uses and enjoys his, her[,] or its property (when, in fact, there are a vast array of different types of commercial, industrial, agricultural, residential, governmental, non-profit and other entities in the 20-mile-long proposed property class area, and each proposed class member uses and enjoys his, her[,] or its property in ways different from others);</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">\u2022 Whether each proposed class member has suffered a substantial and unreasonable interference with use and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>enjoyment as a result of misconduct by Dow (when, in fact, such proposed class members already have testified that they have not suffered any such interference, and the alleged interferences from others are highly variable and dissimilar);</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\u2022 Whether the different levels of dioxin on class properties constitute an unreasonable and substantial interference with use and enjoyment (when, in fact, the levels differ significantly from each other, such that some proposed class members have no level of dioxin on their soil in excess of levels upstream of Dow, some have no level of dioxin on their soil in excess of the [Department of Environmental Quality\u2019s (DEQ\u2019s)] direct contact criteria, and other proposed class members have higher levels);</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">\u2022 What duty (if any) Dow owes to each particular proposed class member (when, in fact, different types of dioxin have been deposited on different proposed class properties at different times over the past 100 years, by potentially many different entities, who would have faced vastly different standards of care and states of the art at the time of such deposits and, even focusing on the most current version of the DEQ\u2019s direct action criteria (which were not applicable until recently), different DEQ criteria apply to different types of property within the class, and those criteria differ from applicable federal criteria);</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">\u2022 Whether Dow violated any duty owed to different proposed class members (when, in fact, the various levels of dioxin on the different properties fall both above and below the various potential standards of care that could have been in effect over the past 100 years);</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">\u2022 Wdiether any proposed class member\u2019s property value was injured (when, in fact, many proposed class members already have sold their class properties at a substantial profit, including some who received more than their asking price and others who have sold for more than their recently appraised value, whereas others have no interest in ever selling their property, and others refuse to sell, and still others contend their property has been rendered \u201cworthless\u201d);</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>\u2022 Whether and how each proposed class member is situated vis-\u00e1-vis Dow\u2019s defenses, including the statute of limitations (when, in fact, many proposed class members have believed for many years that Dow polluted the Tittabawassee River, including with dioxin, and thereby diminished the use and enjoyment and value of proposed class properties).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Thus, defendant raised several issues in this case that may require individualized determination, and that therefore may bar class certification under MCR 3.501(A)(1)(b). Even if these concerns ultimately do not preclude class certification, the issues raised are ones that a trial court would have rebutted or explained if it had conducted an independent inquiry into whether the prerequisites of class certification had in fact been met. The trial court\u2019s failure to respond to <em>any </em>of these claims in its ruling, therefore, belies plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the trial court conducted an appropriate analysis of whether plaintiffs\u2019 proposed class met the requirements for class certification. Moreover, it belies the majority\u2019s assumption that the trial court conducted an appropriate analysis of <em>some </em>of the class certification prerequisites, as the predomination prerequisite is one in which the majority concluded that \u201cthe circuit court appears to have independently determined that plaintiffs alleged a statement of basic facts and law sufficient to support [the] prerequisite!] . .. .\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Because the trial court failed to address defendant\u2019s arguments in opposition to class certification, not only did it <em>articulate </em>a legal standard that was inconsistent with the plain meaning of the Michigan Court Rules, but it also <em>applied </em>that inappropriate standard in granting class certification. Accordingly, class certification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>must be vacated in its entirety, and this case must be remanded to the trial court for reconsideration of <em>all </em>the class certification prerequisites in light of the appropriate legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">C. INSTRUCTIONS FOR REMAND</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">On remand, the trial court must determine whether plaintiffs\u2019 proposed class <em>in fact </em>meets the prerequisites for class certification contained in MCR 3.501(A)(1).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> If the trial court determines that the proposed class meets the prerequisites for class certification, then the trial court may certify the proposed class. However, if it certifies the same class, it may <em>only </em>certify that class with regard to the issue of Dow\u2019s liability. Two judges on the Court of Appeals held that, as a matter of law, damages must be determined in individual proceedings.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> I would not disturb that holding; indeed, plaintiffs did not file a cross-appeal to dispute the majority\u2019s determination that proceedings to determine damages must be bifurcated from any class action regarding Dow\u2019s liability. Accordingly, I would preclude the trial court from certifying the proposed class on the issue of damages, since that legal issue has been settled for the purposes of this litigation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>The majority has reversed the Court of Appeals majority\u2019s decision that bifurcation on damages is required. Although it claims that it \u201cdo[es] not reach the question of if, and to what extent, the issues involved in this case should be \u2018bifurcated,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> it does so by subterfuge in claiming that it \u201cdo[es] not think that the circuit court abused its discretion by waiting to determine to what extent bifurcation of the issues involved may be needed.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This is in direct contradiction of the majority position of the Court of Appeals, which states unequivocally that \u201cwith regard to damages, individualized questions prevail.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This gross violation of our procedural rules is yet another indication of the majority\u2019s now familiar approach to seek its desired result whatever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>the consequences.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The plaintiffs, appellees to this case, have not filed a cross-appeal of the Court of Appeals majority\u2019s decision requiring that damages be determined on an individualized basis. It is a basic principle of appellate procedure that appellees who have not cross-appealed \u201cmay not obtain a decision more favorable to them than was rendered by the Court of Appeals.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s failure to follow this basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>principle of law by declaring that the trial court has discretion <em>not to follow the binding decision of the Court of Appeals, </em>where the majority does not even state that it is reversing any part of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment, is contrary to this Court\u2019s precedent and unworthy of a Court committed to the rule of law.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The party seeking certification of a class under MCR 3.501 bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that its proposed class <em>in fact </em>meets the requirements for class certification as articulated in the Michigan Court Rules. The trial court, therefore, is not bound to accept the allegations of the moving party, but rather must make an independent finding that the prerequisites of class certification have been met. Because the trial court in the instant case did not make such an independent determination, I would vacate class certification in its entirety and remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. I would not disturb the Court of Appeals majority\u2019s decision that the proposed class may not be certified on the issue of damages.</p>\n<judges id=\"b583-7\">Corrigan and Markman, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-9\"> A river\u2019s \u201c100-year flood plain\u201d is the land area subject to the floodwaters from a flood that has a one percent chance of occurring in any given year.

However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit subsequently undermined <em>Allen </em>in <em>Szabo v Bridgeport Machines, Inc, </em>249 F3d 672, 676 (CA 7, 2001), which precluded courts from relying uncritically on the allegations contained in motions for class certification: \u201cBefore deciding whether to allow a case to proceed as a class action, . .. a judge should make whatever factual and legal inquiries are necessary under [Federal] Rule [of Civil Procedure] 23.\u201d Therefore, even if a Michigan court \u201ccan refer to federal cases construing the federal rules on class certification,\u201d <em>Neal, </em>252 Mich App at 15, it should look only to cases that <em>remain </em>good law.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\"><em>Applicable </em>federal caselaw does not require that trial courts accept the allegations in support of the motion for class certification as true. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court expressly negated that principle. <em>Gen Tel Co of the Southwest v Falcon, </em>457 US 147, 160; 102 S Ct 2364; 72 L Ed 2d 740 (1982).

Accordingly, federal caselaw interpreting the <em>Federal </em>Rules of Civil Procedure can be instructive at most, but never controlling. As explained earlier, the plain language of MCR 3.501(A)(1) requires that the prerequisites for class certification must in fact he met before a trial court can certify a class of plaintiffs.

I see no other way of interpreting the three Court of Appeals opinions. Though fractured, they reach a clear <em>result. </em>Judge Fort Hood would have affirmed class certification entirely; Judge METER would have affirmed class certification only with respect to questions of liability; and Judge K. F. Kelly would have vacated class certification entirely. While only one Court of Appeals judge specifically mandated \u201cbifurcation,\u201d that result is the only way of reconciling the three divergent Court of Appeals positions. In any event, that result was not appealed by the plaintiffs and, as a result of the majority\u2019s opinion, plaintiffs are in a better position than they would have been had <em>defendant </em>not appealed. The only principled basis for avoiding the Court of Appeals ruling on damages would be if a <em>different </em>class were certified. However, this principled approach is unavailable to the majority because it preserves part of the class certification the trial court rendered and requires only that the trial court reconsider portions of its analysis. Thus, unless the trial court declines to certify on remand or certifies a different class, the majority has enhanced plaintiffs\u2019 position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b582-4\"> The majority\u2019s determination to ignore facts and precedent inconvenient to its desired outcome has become its <em>modus operandi. </em>See, e.g., <em>Vanslembrouck v Halperin, </em>483 Mich 965 (2009), where the new majority ignored <em>Vega v Lakeland Hospitals at Niles &amp; St Joseph, Inc, </em>479 Mich 243, 244; 736 NW2d 561 (2007); <em>Hardacre v Saginaw Vascular Services, </em>483 Mich 918 (2009), where it failed to follow <em>Boodt v Borgess Med Ctr, </em>481 Mich 558; 751 NW2d 44 (2008); <em>Sazima v Shepherd Bar &amp; Restaurant, </em>483 Mich 924 (2009), where it failed to follow <em>Chrysler v Blue Arrow Transport Lines, </em>295 Mich 606; 295 NW 331 (1940), and <em>Camburn v Northwest School Dist, </em>459 Mich 471; 592 NW2d 46 (1999); <em>Juarez v Holbrook, </em>483 Mich 970 (2009), where it failed to follow <em>Smith v Khouri, </em>481 Mich 519; 751 NW2d 472 (2008); <em>Chambers v Wayne Co Airport Auth, </em>483 Mich 1081 (2009), where it failed to follow <em>Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, </em>477 Mich 197; 731 NW2d 41 (2007); and <em>Scott v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, </em>483 Mich 1032 (2009), where it failed to enforce <em>Thornton v Allstate Ins Co, </em>425 Mich 643; 391 NW2d 320 (1986), and <em>Putkamer v Transamerica Ins Corp of America, </em>454 Mich 626; 563 NW2d 683 (1997).

I join Justice YOUNG\u2019s opinion in full. I write separately in order to discuss additional issues raised by this appeal that I believe the trial court should consider on remand before again certifying a class in this case. The trial court\u2019s October 21, 2005, opinion and order granting class certification formally defined the class to include \u201call persons who owned real property within the one-hundred year Flood Plain of the Tittabawassee River in Saginaw County, Michigan, on February 1, 2002.\u201d The class definition also included a geographic description of the relevant flood plain. But the definition did <em>not </em>limit the class to those property owners who are <em>actually injured </em>by pollution emanating from the activities of defendant, Dow Chemical Company. Rather, the order defined the class broadly to include all of the approximately 2,000 persons who owned property on approximately 13,000 acres of land. I conclude that such an indiscriminate, overbroad definition of the class failed to comport either with MCR 3.501 or with the precedent cited in the trial court\u2019s order because it included numerous class members <em>with no present injuries.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Further, such an overbroad class definition would be likely to have significant, negative effects on the hundreds of purported class members who indeed may have no present injuries. It is striking that only about 170 landowners had elected to join this suit as plaintiffs at the time of the trial court\u2019s certification decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>owners of property with no present injuries may reasonably wish <em>not </em>to be included in the class because certification of their otherwise unharmed property may <em>itself </em>guarantee reduction in their property values; these landowners will never recover against Dow because they cannot allege damages under negligence or nuisance theories, but their property values may collapse further simply as a result of their being lumped into the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">For this reason, if the trial court on remand again concludes that certification of a class is proper, I would direct the court to limit the class to those property owners with <em>actual injuries </em>as a result of Dow\u2019s activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">\n<em>THE ACTUAL INJURY REQUIREMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">It is axiomatic that each member of a plaintiff class must have suffered an actionable injury, which is a prerequisite of any tort claim. \u201c[C]lass members must have suffered actual injury to have standing to sue....\u201d <em>Zine v Chrysler Corp, </em>236 Mich App 261, 288; 600 NW2d 384 (1999). As the United States Supreme Court opined in <em>Gen Tel Co of the Southwest v Falcon, </em>457 US 147, 156; 102 S Ct 2364; 72 L Ed 2d 740 (1982): \u201cWe have repeatedly held that a class representative must be part of the class and possess the same interest and <em>suffer the same injury </em>as the class members.\u201d (Emphasis added; citation and quotation marks omitted.) Michigan cases similarly require plaintiffs to \u201cdemonstrate with common proof that the members of the class have suffered <em>a common injury.\u201d A &amp; M Supply Co v Microsoft Corp, 252 </em>Mich App 580, 599-600; 654 NW2d 572 (2002) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Likewise, the federal toxic tort cases relied on by plaintiffs and the trial court involved certification of classes explicitly defined by reference to the members\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number><em>present injuries. </em>For example, the discussion in <em>Sterling v Velsicol Chem Corp, </em>855 F2d 1188, 1197 (CA 6, 1988), which the trial court quoted at length in its October 21, 2005, order, addressed a class of residents who alleged that they \u201csuffered damages as a result of ingesting or otherwise using. . . contaminated water.\u201d <em>Sterling </em>involved plaintiffs who lived near a landfill from which toxic chemicals seeped into the ground, contaminating soil and groundwater. Much as in the present case, because several wells near the site tested positive for contamination, all residents within 1,000 acres of the site were advised to stop using their wells for any purpose. Several residents sued under theories including nuisance and negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 1192-1194. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed class certification. But the class did not indiscriminately include <em>every </em>resident within the 1,000-acre area; rather, <em>Sterling\u2019s </em>discussion and holding presuppose that each class member had a present injury because \u201ceach class member lived in the vicinity of the landfill <em>and </em>allegedly <em>suffered damages as a result of ingesting or otherwise using </em>the contaminated water.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1197 (emphasis added). Similarly, the class in <em>Olden v Lafarge Corp, </em>383 F3d 495, 507 (CA 6, 2004), was expressly defined as \u201call owners of single family residences in the City of Alpena whose persons or property <em>was damaged </em>by toxic pollutants and contaminants which originated from the Lafarge cement manufacturing facility. .. .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In contrast, as noted, the class certified here broadly included \u201call persons who owned real property\u201d within the 100-year flood plain, without reference to whether such persons could allege harm as a result of Dow\u2019s activities. Because it is apparent that such an overbroad class cannot all allege cognizable claims, I conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed class definition is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\n<em>PRESENT INJURIES UNDER THE TORTS ALLEGED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Plaintiffs sued under negligence and nuisance theories. To prove negligence, \u201ca plaintiff must demonstrate a present physical injury to person or property <em>in addition to </em>economic losses that result from that injury.\u201d <em>Henry v Dow Chem Co, </em>473 Mich 63, 75-76; 701 NW2d 684 (2005) <em>{Henry I) </em>(emphasis in original). <em>Henry I </em>created a bright line rule by unambiguously requiring a plaintiff alleging negligence to prove <em>present physical injury. </em>Here, plaintiffs cannot show that each land parcel in the 100-year flood plain is presently contaminated with pollution alleged to have originated from Dow\u2019s activities. Indeed, studies by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) expressly show that some of the land is <em>not </em>contaminated. Because the owners of uncontaminated property do not have present physical injuries, they cannot allege negligence under Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Accordingly, plaintiffs argue that even the uncontaminated properties suffer present injury in fact under a nuisance theory because they may become contaminated in the future. But Dow correctly argues that the purported injury in fact to many of these properties is too speculative to be recognized in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">To prove private nuisance, a plaintiff must show substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of his land. <em>Adkins v Thomas Solvent Co, </em>440 Mich 293, 303-304; 487 NW2d 715 (1992).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because a nuisance is a \u201cnontrespassory invasion,\u201d a plaintiff need not show <em>physical </em>intrusion upon his land to prove nuisance. <em>Id. </em>at 302.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>There are countless ways to interfere with the use and enjoyment of land including interference with the physical condition of the land itself, disturbance in the comfort or conveniences of the occupant including his peace of mind, and threat of future injury that is a present menace and interference with enjoyment. <em>[Id. </em>at 303.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Significantly, although nuisance may involve \u201c \u2018threatening or impending danger,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>quoting <em>Kilts v Kent Co Supervisors, </em>162 Mich 646, 651; 127 NW 821 (1910), a plaintiff cannot prove nuisance \u201cwhere damage and injury are both predicated on unfounded fear of third parties that depreciates property values,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 312. \u201c[Pjroperty depreciation alone is insufficient to constitute a nuisance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Here, the facts presented by plaintiffs do not suggest that all or even most of the 2,000 proposed class members can allege cognizable nuisance claims. As noted, the DEQ reports that many parcels of land are not physically contaminated. Many more parcels have not even been tested, were never subject to flooding, and are very unlikely to experience flooding even during the next <em>century. </em>Crucially, the DEQ\u2019s restrictions apply <em>only </em>to <em>contaminated </em>or <em>frequently flooded </em>land \u2014 not to <em>all </em>land in the 100-year flood plain.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>was defined on the sole basis of the geographic boundaries of the 100-year flood plain, much of the circumscribed land has only a one percent chance of flooding in a given year. See <em>ante </em>at 514 n 1 (YOUNG, J.). Moreover, the degree of risk of <em>contamination </em>from <em>future </em>flooding is questionable and somewhat speculative; Dow has already altered its activities and begun remediating past contamination of the river as was required, in part, by the DEQ.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Accordingly, although some landowners may be able to allege present harm from nuisance, many residents of the flood plain certainly cannot. Indeed, the land that is not presently contaminated, that has a low risk of flooding in the future, and that has a largely speculative risk of actual contamination as a result of future flooding, is comparable to the land in <em>Adkins </em>where the plaintiffs sought damages based on diminished property values they alleged were caused by contamination in the surrounding area. These plaintiffs\u2019 land was not actually contaminated; a groundwater divide prevented the migration of toxic chemicals from the surrounding land. <em>Adkins, </em>440 Mich at 299-300, 318. The Court held that fear-based diminution in property values was an insufficient basis for relief, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">Under such a theory, a cause of action could be stated on behalf of any individual who could demonstrate an effect on property values even if the polluted ground water had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>neither strayed from defendants\u2019 own property, nor disturbed a plaintiffs enjoyment by the fear that it would do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">If any property owner in the vicinity of the numerous hazardous waste sites that have been identified can advance a claim seeking damages when unfounded public fears of exposure cause property depreciation, the ultimate effect might be a reordering of a polluter\u2019s resources for the benefit of persons who have suffered no cognizable harm at the expense of those claimants who have been subjected to a substantial and unreasonable interference in the use and enjoyment of property. <em>[Id. </em>at 318-319.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The very problem identified in <em>Adkins </em>is present here. Plaintiffs argue that property values throughout the flood plain have been diminished in part as a result of DEQ warnings to residents concerning possible contamination and steps residents should take to avoid harmful exposure to dioxin-contaminated soil; residents were told, for example, that children and gardeners should avoid prolonged exposure to <em>contaminated </em>soil and that certain steps were required if residents wished to move or dispose of such soil. But the DEQ itself <em>also </em>reported that various areas of the flood plain were <em>not </em>harmfully contaminated, and the state-promulgated restrictions applied only to contaminated or, at most, frequently flooded land. Indeed, the depositions of some flood plain residents explicitly revealed that these residents were not directly affected by pollution and had not altered the use of their land in any way as a result of Dow\u2019s alleged polluting activities. Thus, many proposed class members would be able to argue <em>at most </em>that their property values decreased simply as a result of publicity concerning pollution of the Tittabawassee River in part due to this lawsuit. But this is precisely the sort of unfounded fear that the <em>Adkins </em>Court concluded could not underlie a nuisance claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Finally, the 170 or so plaintiffs who moved for class certification risk the very problem identified in <em>Adkins-, </em>by attempting to certify 2,000 class members, most of whom obviously had not yet chosen to participate in the suit and many of whom may not be able to allege damages from present injuries, the plaintiffs virtually guarantee both that Dow\u2019s resources will be stretched to defend uncognizable claims at the expense of those plaintiffs who suffer actual harm <em>and </em>that any fear-based diminution in property values throughout the flood plain will accelerate as a result of the overbroad class definition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, not only does the proposed class definition incorrectly suggest that undamaged land is indeed damaged in some way, but the definition likely would suspend all flood plain residents\u2019 abilities to sell undamaged land throughout the pendency of this suit, which is already over six years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">For these reasons, I conclude that the class proposed by plaintiffs is too broad and therefore is untenable. Significantly, it is not even clear that the trial court intended to accept plaintiffs\u2019 broad proposed definition when it initially certified the class. I note that the October 21, 2005, order refers to two defining characteristics of the class, one largely geographic but the other apparently based on present injury: \u201cEach member of the class lives in the area alleged to have been damaged. Each member of the class allegedly <em>suffered damages </em>as a result of the release of contaminates in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the Tittabawassee River.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, if the trial court again concludes on remand that class certification is appropriate, I would direct the court to explicitly limit any class definition to property owners who suffer present injuries.</p>\n<judges id=\"b592-6\">MARKMAN, J., concurred with CORRIGAN, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b592-7\">WEAVER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkX\">I write this separate opinion with regard to the issue of my participation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">In preparation of my 2008 income taxes, it came to my attention that I own 108 shares of Dow Chemical, which I received through a recent inheritance.

She states: \u201cJustice YOUNG also sent a separate statement to the parties expressing <em>his disagreement with my decision to notify </em>the parties in this manner.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 539 (emphasis added). This is patently untrue, as Justice WEAVER knows. What I challenged was the <em>inadequacy </em>of her disclosure to the parties concerning the nature of her ownership of stock in Dow Chemical. For example, she did not disclose when she actually became the legal owner of stock in Dow Chemical or precisely when she discovered she had this ownership interest. Moreover, she did not disclose the basis for her unilateral determination that her ownership interest is not a \u201cmore than de minimis interest\u201d or <em>why any ownership interest was not itself disqualifying. </em>In order to ensure that the context of my criticism of her disclosure is provided, I am publishing my own communication to the parties below.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">I continue to question Justice Weaver\u2019s participation in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>1 believe that <em>any </em>ownership interest in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>party precludes a judge\u2019s participation. MCR 2.003(B)(5) provides that a judge, is disqualified when \u201c[t]he judge knows that... she ... has an economic interest in ... a party to the proceeding or has any other more than a de minimis interest that could be substantially affected by the proceeding.\u201d This court rule is written in the disjunctive, which distinguishes an economic interest in a party from every other type of potentially disqualifying interest. Only those \u201cother\u201d types of interests contain an exception for de minimis interests. Without doubt, Justice WEAVER has an \u201ceconomic interest in... a party\u201d in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">This qualitative distinction made in MCR 2.003(B)(5) between economic interests and other interests is similarly found in the nearly identical federal statute regarding judicial recusal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 28 USC 455(b)(4) disqualifies a federal judge from sitting in a case if he or she \u201chas a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy . . . .\u201d The statute defines \u201cfinancial interest\u201d as \u201cownership of a legal or equitable interest, however small.\u201d 28 USC 455(d)(4). The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has determined that the federal statutory scheme</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>differentiates between two kinds of interests. If the judge has direct ownership, legal or equitable, then disqualification is required regardless of the size of the interest, unless one of the specified exceptions applies. On the other hand, an interest not entailing direct ownership falls under \u201cother interest,\u201d and requires disqualification only if the litigation could substantially affect it.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Furthermore, the leading commentators on federal practice and procedure indicate that this statutory provision</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">eliminate[s] any dispute about the substantiality of a financial interest. If a judge, or any other person within the statutory language, has <em>any </em>financial interest, as that term is defined, however small, in a party or in the subject matter in controversy, the judge must recuse. There is no room for discretion.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Under MCR 2.003(B)(5) there was no discretion here for Justice Weaver\u2019s continued participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">MY STATEMENT TO THE PARTIES</p>\n<p id=\"A5N\">My response, also communicated to the parties, challenging Justice Weaver\u2019s disclosure to the parties concerning her stock ownership is restated here as follows:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">In light of her repeated public statements regarding standards for recusal, I regret that Justice Weaver has placed the parties in the awkward position of having to decide whether she will take part in the decision of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>case notwithstanding her acknowledged financial interest as an investor in the defendant corporation. I ask that the following public information regarding Justice Weaver\u2019s stated positions on recusal be taken into consideration in making a decision on her request for remittal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\">While I have publicly supported the Court\u2019s more than a century old recusal policy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Justice Weaver has been equally publicly criticad of that longstanding policy in suggesting that she subscribes to a \u201chigher\u201d standard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">Nevertheless, Justice Weaver claims that her ownership of approximately $1,200 in defendant Dow\u2019s stock is \u201cnot a \u2018more than de minimis interest.\u2019 \u201d She has made this determination herself, which is contrary to her repeated public statements on the question of judicial recusal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-16\">For example, in this Court\u2019s March 18, 2009 order on ADM 2009-04 (Proposed Disqualification Rules for Justices), Justice Weaver reiterated her 2006 statement on disqualification and explained that \u201c [i]t is a most basic truth that the person who may be the least capable of recognizing a justice\u2019s actual bias and prejudice, or appearance of bias and prejudice, is the justice h[er]self.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Presumably consistent with that sentiment, she recused herself in <em>Kyser v Kasson Twp, </em>\u201cbecause she has a past and current business relationship with Kasson Township Supervisor Fred Lanham and his family.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-29\">Moreover, Justice Weaver has advocated a disqualification standard that requires judges to recuse themselves if there is merely an <em>appearance </em>of impropriety. She has cited with approval Canon 2 of the ADA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, which states that \u201c[a] judge shall avoid. .. the appearance of impropriety in all of the judge\u2019s activities\u201d and Model Canon 3(E)(1), which states that a judge \u201cshall disqualify ... herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-39\">The disqualification standard that she has publicly championed is an <em>objective </em>standard, not a subjective standard to be determined by her say-so. Justice Weaver\u2019s \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d standard is made without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>regard to whether an individual judge harbors an <em>actual </em>bias toward any party in the case being heard:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">\u201c[W]hen a judge recuses ... herself to avoid the appearance of impropriety, the result is that the judge avoids <em>risking </em>actual bias. Second, when a judge recuses... herself, the judge eliminates the <em>appearance </em>of impropriety and thereby engenders public confidence in the judiciary.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">Accordingly, if her support of the \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d standard is genuine &amp;emdash; and I assume that she would not have advocated it otherwise &amp;emdash; her <em>personal </em>belief that she \u201chas no personal bias or prejudice for or against either party\u201d and that the total value of her stock is \u201cnot more than a de minimis interest\u201d is irrelevant to whether she must recuse herself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">Moreover, Justice Weaver has advocated in her various published statements on disqualification standards that the disqualification decision cannot be solely vested in the judge who is the subject of disqualification but must be reviewed by other members of the Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-18\">Here, Justice Weaver has made her own determination that her Dow stock ownership is \u201cde minimis\u201d within the meaning of MCR 2.003(B)(5). But there is no basis upon which an objective observer can assess the validity of her claim and decision. Context is essential in considering what level of ownership in a party litigant is \u201cde minimis,\u201d and no one but Justice Weaver is privy to her financial status - something she has chosen not to share.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-19\">My point here is that Justice Weaver\u2019s request for remission is entirely inconsistent with her published views on what standards <em>ought </em>apply in recusal situations. Her ownership of stock in a party defendant does pose an <em>appearance </em>of impropriety from the standpoint of the public.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Can anyone imagine the public at large believing that it is perfectly appropriate for a judge to decide a case in which she owns stock in one of the parties?<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, her communication - which states her conflict, announces that her conflict does not matter, and asks the parties to agree with her - is inherently intimidating and coercive to both parties involved in this litigation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rejection of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>stated premise \u2014 that, notwithstanding her stated conflict, she should participate in the case \u2014 obviously puts the parties in the position of offending a sitting Justice. By her own stated positions on recusal, she should not be putting the parties in the position of having to bless an <em>appearance </em>of impropriety</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\">Finally, the nature of Justice Weaver\u2019s private communication with the parties does not comport with her conclusion that the Michigan Constitution, art 6, \u00a7 6, \u201crequires that a justice\u2019s self-initiated decision and reasons not to participate, or a challenged justice\u2019s decision and reasons to participate or not participate, should be in writing and <em>accessible to the </em>public.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It would seem to me that, under her proposed regime, Justice Weaver\u2019s discussion of her stock ownership should be published for public review</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">Again, I wish to state that I believe that our historic disqualification policy is constitutionally sound and should be embraced by all members of this Court. Since it has not been, and since Justice Weaver has articulated her own, purportedly \u201chigher\u201d recusal standards, I am left to wonder why Justice Weaver advocates a public position contrary to the position she practices and why she believes it appropriate that the parties should be asked to bless her conflict.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\"> Indeed, although I agree with Justice Young that the trial court should reconsider whether the proposed class satisfied <em>each </em>criterion for class certification on the question of Dow\u2019s liability, I agree with the majority that the record presents particularly problematic unanswered questions concerning whether the representative plaintiffs\u2019 claims are typical of those of the proposed class, MCR 3.501(A)(1)(c), and whether plaintiffs will \u201cfairly and adequately assert and protect the interests of the class\u201d as class representatives, MCR 3.501(A)(1)(d).

By their terms, these guidelines do not apply to uncontaminated soil.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b589-10\"> I also note, as the DEQ observed in its June 2003, Phase II Final Report, the presence of uncontaminated properties within the 100-year flood plain that are elevated above the flood level as a result of \u201clocal natural features or the introduction of clean fill material.\u201d Obviously these properties also have a low risk of future contamination from flooding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b591-6\"> Dow posits that the 100-year flood plain is too broad an area for a fact-finder to conclude that <em>every </em>owner suffers a present, nonspeculative injury sounding in nuisance. Dow reasonably asks: why not the 1,000-year or 1-million-year flood plain? Conversely, plaintiffs would be more likely to properly define a geographically based class if they focused merely on the 10- or 20-year flood plain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-10\"> Justice Young now asserts that he feels an \u201cethical obligation\u201d to raise questions about the manner in which I have handled the issue of my participation in this matter. <em>Post </em>at 541 n 1. However, I again note that since 2003,1 have raised the issue of the need for clear, written, and fair disqualification rules for Michigan Supreme Court justices, but the \u201cmajority of four\u201d (Justice Young, along with Justices Corrigan and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Markman and former Chief Justice Taylor) refused to address the issue until 2006, when this Court worked on the issue of disqualification, and the \u201cmajority of four\u201d refused to publish the proposed disqualification rules formulated by members of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">In March of this year (2009), after former Chief Justice Taylor\u2019s removal from this Court as a result of his overwhelming defeat in the 2008 election, the \u201cremaining three\u201d (Justice Young, along with Justices Corrigan and Markman) voted against publishing proposed rules for disqualification.
