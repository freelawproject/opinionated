It also raises the issue of what statements must be set forth in an NOI to satisfy the requirements of MCL 600.2912b(4) when a claim being made against the EC is based solely on a EC\u2019s vicarious liability for its physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">We hold, on the basis of the plain language of the relevant statutes, that when claims alleged against a EC are predicated on its vicarious liability for a licensed health care provider rendering professional services, an NOI must be provided. The NOI provision, MCL 600.2912b, clearly states that a plaintiff must provide all health professionals and health facilities an NOI before commencing a medical malpractice action. MCL 600.5838a delineates those health care providers and facilities against which claims of medical malpractice may be asserted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Claims asserted against providers and facilities not delineated in \u00a7 5838a sound in ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>negligence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because \u00a7 5838a specifically refers to PCs in its definitional section, a claim against a PC sounds in malpractice, but only when the claim asserted against the PC is for rendering professional services as defined in MCL 450.225. Under these circumstances, a PC must be provided an NOI.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The claim against Huron Valley Radiology, PC., is one based on vicarious liability for the professional services of its licensed health care provider-employee; hence, plaintiff Brian Potter was required to provide a timely NOI as the action is one sounding in medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Moreover, we hold that the NOI filed in this case was fully compliant with the plain language of \u00a7 2912b(4), which governs its contents. First, there is no requirement in \u00a7 2912b(4) to set forth the legal relationships between named parties; rather, the plain language of \u00a7 2912b(4)(f) only requires naming each party to be sued. Secondly, where the only claim asserted against a PC is one for vicarious liability, and hence no other standard of care is being asserted against the PC, there is no requirement within \u00a7 2912b that mandates that a claimant set forth the legal doctrine of vicarious liability in the NOI.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The claim at issue in this case was one for vicarious liability only. In light of MCL 450.225, a PC can only render professional services through its licensed health care provider. Where the NOI names both the PC and the provider, the NOI is fully compliant as long as it sets forth all the factual and medical information necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>to inform the PC of the nature of the claim being asserted against the physician-provider. Because this NOI met these requirements, it was fully compliant and there is no need to dismiss this action on the basis of the NOI. We therefore reverse the Court of Appeals judgment and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">This is a medical malpractice action involving an alleged misreading of an MRI by defendant Kristyn H. Murry, M.D., on June 7, 2001. This misreading allegedly caused a delay in a needed emergency surgical procedure on plaintiffs spine. This delay resulted in permanent nerve damage to plaintiffs spine that impairs his ability to function, including causing difficulty with such things as walking and urinating. At the time of the alleged malpractice, Murry was employed by Huron Valley Radiology.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The procedural history of this case is complicated and lengthy. This case has been pending in our appellate system for over four years as the courts have conducted an exhaustive review of the content of Potter\u2019s affidavit of merit and his NOI. The Court of Appeals has issued two opinions, and we are reviewing this case for the second time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The most recent Court of Appeals opinion summarized this long journey through our appellate system and the reasoning behind the rulings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">In these consolidated appeals, defendants appealed by leave granted orders in this medical malpractice action denying their motions for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(7). Previously, a majority of this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>reversed, holding that plaintiffs complaint should be dismissed with prejudice because the attached affidavits of merit did not conform to the requirements of MCL 600.2912d. <em>Potter v McLeary, </em>274 Mich App 222; 732 NW2d 600 (2007). In lieu of granting leave to appeal, our Supreme Court reversed the portion of this Court\u2019s judgment \u201cdismissing the complaint <em>with </em>prejudice, because the dismissal should have been <em>without </em>prejudice ....\u201d See 480 Mich 915 (2007) (emphasis in original). Our Supreme Court remanded to this Court for consideration of the remaining issues not addressed previously. We now affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">As noted in our previous opinion, the alleged malpractice took place on June 7, 2001. The period of limitations in medical malpractice cases is two years from the date the claim accrued. MCL 600.5805(6). Presuming the notice of intent was sufficient, the running of the period of limitations would have been tolled for 182 days from the date of the notice. MCL 600.2912b(l). A notice of intent was sent to defendants Huron Valley Radiology, EC., and Kristyn H. Murry, M.D., on May 30, 2003, leaving eight days remaining before the period of limitations expired. A notice of intent was sent to defendants St. Joseph Mercy Hospital Ann Arbor, Robert Domeier, D.O., and Emergency Physicians Medical Group, EC., on May 13, 2003, leaving 25 days before the period of limitations expired. The notices tolled the running of the limitations periods, which recommenced on November 30, 2003, and on November 13, 2003, respectively. The limitations period expired on December 8, 2003, for all defendants. Plaintiffs complaint was filed on November 4, 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">There was no serious dispute in our prior decision that the affidavits of merit were fatally defective because they failed to state how the physicians\u2019 alleged failures related to plaintiffs alleged injuries, so they did not contain the required statement of proximate cause. See MCL 600.2912d. No conforming affidavits of merit were filed by December 8, 2003. A majority of this Court previously determined that plaintiff had therefore not filed an affidavit of merit at all, pursuant to <em>Geralds v Munson Health</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number><em>care, </em>259 Mich App 225, 240; 673 NW2d 792 (2003), and <em>Mouradian v Goldberg, </em>256 Mich App 566, 574; 664 NW2d 805 (2003), so plaintiffs complaint should be dismissed with prejudice. This Court therefore deemed it unnecessary to address defendants\u2019 challenges to plaintiffs notices of intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">After this Court\u2019s previous decision, our Supreme Court overruled <em>Geralds </em>and <em>Mouradian </em>as having misapplied the case of <em>Scarsella v Pollak, </em>461 Mich 547, 553; 607 NW2d 711 (2000). <em>Kirkaldy v Rim, </em>478 Mich 581, 583-584; 734 NW2d 201 (2007). Our Supreme Court explained that <em>Scarsella </em>had only held that \u201ca medical-malpractice complaint filed <em>without </em>an affidavit of merit\u201d was ineffective and would not toll the running of the applicable limitations period. <em>Id. </em>at 584 (emphasis in original). It further explained that <em>Geralds </em>and <em>Mouradian </em>had wrongly extended that holding to medical-malpractice complaints that were actually filed with affidavits of merit, but where those affidavits of merit failed to conform to the requirements of MCL 600.2912d. <em>Kirkaldy, supra </em>at 584-585. Our Supreme Court concluded that an affidavit of merit is presumptively valid \u2014 and therefore tolls the running of a limitations period when filed with a complaint \u2014 until successfully challenged in a judicial proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 585-586. \u201cThus, if the defendant believes that an affidavit is deficient, the defendant must challenge the affidavit,\u201d and the proper remedy for a successful challenge is dismissal without prejudice, affording the plaintiff \u201cwhatever time remains in the period of limitations\u201d to file a complaint with a conforming affidavit. <em>Id. </em>at 586.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">Our Supreme Court\u2019s partial reversal in this case was based on its decision in <em>Kirkaldy. </em>As applied to the case at bar, plaintiffs complaint, filed with the affidavits of merit, tolled the running of the limitations period. Because we conclude that those affidavits of merit did not conform to the requirements of MCL 600.2912b, the proper remedy is for the trial court to dismiss plaintiffs complaint without prejudice. Plaintiff may then file a new complaint with conforming affidavits of merit within the time remaining in the limitations period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Because we declined to do so previously, we must address defendants Murry\u2019s and Huron Valley Radiology\u2019s challenges to the sufficiency of the notices of intent sent to them. Murry and Huron Valley Radiology first argue that the notice does not properly state the applicable standard of practice or care as required by MCL 600.2912b(4)(b). We agree, in part. The second paragraph of plaintiffs notice sets forth the following standard of care:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">\u201cThe standard of care required Drs. Murry and/or [Gary] Augustyn and/or [Richard C.] McLeary to correctly read, interpret and report the correct results to the emergency room under the circumstances. Notwithstanding that standard of care, Drs. Murry and/or Augustyn and/or McLeary failed to properly interpret the MRI images and convey accurate information to the emergency room physician in charge of the patient that night.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">The standard of care completely fails to make any reference to defendant Huron Valley Radiology. Our Supreme Court has explained that plaintiff is not obligated to provide a completely correct standard of care, but \u201cplaintiff was required to make a good-faith averment of <em>some </em>particularized standard for each of the professionals and facilities named in the notices.\u201d <em>Roberts v Mecosta Co Gen Hosp (After </em>Remand), 470 Mich 679, 694; 684 NW2d 711 (2004) (emphasis in original). The standard alleged here is more than the tautology rejected in <em>Roberts, </em>and we find it adequate with regard to defendant Murry. Plaintiff articulated a specific standard that Murry must correctly read, interpret, and report the results of the MRI test. This is specific to the requirements of the service that plaintiff received from Murry. It was sufficient to put defendant Murry on notice of the nature of the claim, which was failure to properly identify and report plaintiff\u2019s injury. Therefore, it met the requirements of MCL 600.2912b(4)(b) with regard to Murry. However, the notice cannot satisfy all the statutory requirements with regard to defendant Huron Valley Radiology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Because no other challenges to the notices of intent are raised, we will not consider them further. Therefore, the trial court properly denied summary disposition on the basis of the notices of intent to all defendants other than Huron Valley Radiology. With regard to Huron Valley Radiology, we believe that our Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of deficient \u2014 but actually filed \u2014 affidavits of merit should, by analogy, be applied to deficient \u2014 but again actually filed \u2014 notices of intent, as well. See <em>Kirkaldy, supra </em>at 586. Notices of intent are presumed to be valid and proper, so they support the filing of a complaint after the notice period has run, unless and until the notice is successfully challenged. The remedy to be applied if a notice is successfully challenged is dismissal without prejudice, affording the plaintiff the opportunity to cure the deficiency within the time remaining within the limitations period as theretofore tolled by the now-invalidated notice or the subsequent filing of the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\">We hold as follows: summary disposition is granted without prejudice to Huron Valley Radiology on the basis of the notice of intent, summary disposition is denied to all other defendants on the basis of the notices of intent, and summary disposition is granted without prejudice to all defendants on the basis of the affidavits of merit. The applicable limitations periods remain tolled until entry of the grants of summary disposition. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">On March 20, 2008, plaintiff filed an application for leave to appeal asking this Court to grant leave to consider whether his NOI complied with the content requirements of \u00a7 2912b. On October 1, 2008, this Court granted leave; however, the issue was limited to the threshold question of whether it was necessary to provide an NOI to a PC. That order provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">On order of the Court, the application for leave to appeal the March 20, 2008, judgment of the Court of Appeals is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>considered and, it is granted, limited to the issue whether defendant Huron Valley Radiology, EC., is a \u201chealth facility or agency\u201d to which a plaintiff is required to provide notice under MCL 600.2912b(l). See MCL 333.20106(1).[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Despite the limited grant order, the parties addressed the content of the NOI and whether it was defective in their briefing and in oral argument while advancing their respective positions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After oral argument, the Court expanded the grant order by asking the parties to file supplemental briefs on the additional issue of the tolling of the statute of limitations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">Oral argument having been heard on March 4,2009, the parties are directed to submit supplemental briefs addressing the issue whether, if a defendant professional corporation is not an entity to whom notice is required to be provided under MCL 600.2912b, the applicable statute of limitations, MCL 600.5805(6), was nonetheless subject to statutory tolling provided in former MCL 600.5856(d).[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">As we have resolved the threshold issue by holding that Potter must provide an NOI to Huron Valley Radiology, we must also resolve the underlying issue of whether this NOI is defective in order to conclude the analysis in this case. We take particular note of the fact that it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>been over eight years since the malpractice occurred and nearly six years since the subject NOI was mailed to defendants. Further, it has been over 5x/2 years since the complaint was filed, with the last four years having been devoted to the appeal of issues relating to the affidavit of merit and the NOI. The parties are still waiting to have a court address the merits of the case. Given that we have had briefing and argument on all necessary issues, we can decide in this opinion both whether the plaintiff must provide a PC an NOI before commencing an action as well as whether the subject NOI was compliant with \u00a7 2912b.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The issues presented are issues of statutory interpretation. Statutory interpretation is a question of law, which this Court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This Court also reviews de novo a trial court\u2019s decision regarding a motion for summary disposition.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Interpretation of the NOI provision presents questions of statutory construction. Assuming that the Legislature has acted within its constitutional authority, the purpose of statutory construction is to discern and give effect to the intent of the Legislature.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In determining the intent of the Legislature, this Court must first look to the language of the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court must, first and foremost, interpret the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>of a statute in a manner that is consistent with the intent of the Legislature.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018As far as possible, effect should be given to every phrase, clause, and word in the statute. The statutory language must be read and understood in its grammatical context, unless it is clear that something different was intended.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, when considering the correct interpretation, the statute must be read as a whole.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Individual words and phrases, while important, should be read in the context of the entire legislative scheme.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In defining particular words in statutes, we must consider both the plain meaning of the critical word or phrase as well as its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> A statute must be read in conjunction with other relevant statutes to ensure that the legislative intent is correctly ascertained.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Finally, the statute must be interpreted in a manner that ensures that it works in harmony with the entire statutory scheme.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">A. THE NATURE OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Before we address whether a plaintiff must provide an NOI to a PC, it is necessary to review the legal structure of a PC and understand the nature of the services it provides. Since a professional corporation is a statutory creature, we look to the Professional Service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Corporation Act, MCL 450.221 <em>et seq., </em>for guidance. The relevant provision of that act provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\"><em>A corporation organized and incorporated under this act shall not render professional services within this state except through its officers, employees, and agents who are duly licensed or otherwise legally authorized to render the professional services within this state. </em>The term employee does not include secretaries, bookkeepers, technicians, and other assistants who are not usually and ordinarily considered by custom and practice to be rendering professional services to the public for which a license or other legal authorization is required. [MCL 450.225 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">This provision makes clear that a PC, while a separate legal entity, does not render professional services on its own; rather, it can only render professional services through its employees or agents who are licensed or legally authorized to render the professional services. This language stands as a legislative recognition that when a PC renders professional services, it is inexorably linked to the licensed health care provider. For all practical purposes, the PC and the health care provider are treated as the same entity when professional services are involved.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, a PC can perform other types of services or take other actions through unlicensed employees or agents, but such actions would not constitute professional services under the act. This delineation of types of services is emphasized not only in the first sentence, it is reasserted in the second sentence of MCL 450.225, which states that \u201c[t]he term employee does not include secretaries, bookkeepers, technicians, and other assistants who are not usually and ordinarily considered by custom and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>practice to be rendering professional services to the public for which a license or other legal authorization is required.\u201d Thus, a PC can engage in two different types of actions: those that are professional services and those that are not. While the PC is vicariously hable for either of these types of actions pursuant to MCL 450.226,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> this distinction is pertinent in determining whether the medical malpractice statutes apply to a particular cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">B. PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIONS AND THE NOI REQUIREMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">We now examine whether a plaintiff is required to provide an NOI to a PC before commencing a medical malpractice action. We start our analysis by examining the language of the NOI provision itself. Section 2912b states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>(1) <em>Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person shall not commence an action alleging medical malpractice against a health professional or health facility </em>unless the person has given the health professional or health facility written notice under this section not less than 182 days before the action is commenced. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The first sentence in this section provides critical guidance. The statute expressly limits the requirement of an NOI to an action alleging medical malpractice: \u201c[A] person shall not commence an action alleging medical malpractice. . . .\u201d Thus, the first step in the analysis is to determine whether the action sounds in medical malpractice or ordinary negligence. Only those actions sounding in medical malpractice are governed by the mandates of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">This Court recently reiterated the method by which claims of medical malpractice and ordinary negligence are distinguished. In <em>Kuznar, </em>this Court was asked to determine whether a claim against a pharmacy for the actions of its non-licensed technicians sounded in medical malpractice or in ordinary negligence. In holding that the claims sounded in ordinary negligence, <em>Kuznar </em>reiterated the longstanding rule that claims sound in medical malpractice only when a two-pronged test is met. First, the claim must occur in the course of a professional relationship and, second, the claim must pose questions of medical judgment outside the realm of common knowledge and experience. If either prong is not met, the action sounds in ordinary negligence rather than medical malpractice.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> With regard to the first prong, <em>Kuznar </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>A professional relationship exists if a person or an entity capable of committing medical malpractice was subject to a contractual duty to render professional health-care services to the plaintiff. Under the common law, only physicians and surgeons were potentially liable for medical malpractice. But in MCL 600.5838a(l), the Legislature expanded the scope of those who could be liable for medical malpractice. It provided for medical malpractice claims to be brought against \u201ca person or entity who is or who holds himself or herself out to be a licensed health care professional, licensed health facility or agency, or an employee or agent of a licensed health facility or agency ....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">The primary issue in this case is whether the pharmacy technician and the pharmacy are covered by MCL 600.5838a(l).[<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-6\"><em>Kuznar </em>correctly opined that only those health care providers and facilities designated within \u00a7 5838a could be sued for malpractice. Therefore, only those providers and facilities covered by \u00a7 5838a can meet the professional relationship prong of the test. Accordingly, <em>Kuznar </em>reviewed the language of \u00a7 5838a(l) to determine if a pharmacy was a designated entity. Section 5838a(l)(a) defines a \u201clicensed health facility or agency\u201d as \u201ca health facility or agency licensed under article 17 of the public health code, Act No. 368 of the Public Acts of 1978, being sections 333.20101 to 333.22260 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Because \u00a7 5838a(l)(a) limits its application to only those health facilities and agencies licensed under article 17 of the Public Health Code, <em>Kuznar </em>next turned its attention to MCL 333.20106(1) to determine whether a pharmacy was within the list of designated entities. MCL 333.20106(1) provides that \u201chealth facility or agency\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>(a) An ambulance operation, aircraft transport operation, nontransport prehospital life support operation, or medical first response service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">(b) A clinical laboratory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">(c) A county medical care facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">(d) A freestanding surgical outpatient facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">(e) A health maintenance organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">(f) A home for the aged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">(g) A hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">(h) A nursing home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">(i) A hospice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">(j) A hospice residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-14\">(k) A facility or agency listed in subdivisions (a) to (h) located in a university, college, or other educational institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-15\"><em>Kuznar </em>concluded that because pharmacies were not included within this list, the claims asserted against them did not sound in medical malpractice.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Rather, the claims asserted against the pharmacy sounded in ordinary negligence, and, accordingly, the medical malpractice statutes simply did not apply. It is this same statutory provision and analysis that has led to the question we now address. Because this same list of health facilities contained in \u00a7 333.20106(1) does not include PCs, the question arises whether PCs are exempt from any of the requirements of the medical malpractice statutory scheme. We conclude that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>unnecessary to refer to the list in \u00a7 333.20106(1) in this instance because the plain language of \u00a7 600.5838a, as amended effective April 1, 1994, expressly includes professional corporations within its definitional section.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Section 5838a(l), as amended, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">For purposes of this act, <em>a claim based on the medical malpractice of a person or entity who is or who holds himself or herself out to be a licensed health care professional, licensed health facility </em>or agency, or an employee or agent of a licensed health facility or agency who is engaging in or otherwise assisting in medical care and treatment, <em>whether or not the licensed health care professional, licensed health facility or agency, or their employee or agent is engaged in the practice of the health profession in a </em>sole proprietorship, partnership, <em>professional corporation, </em>or other business entity, accrues at the time of the act or omission that is the basis for the claim of medical malpractice, regardless of the time the plaintiff discovers or otherwise has knowledge of the claim. <em>As used in this </em>subsection:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">(a) \u201cLicensed health facility or agency\u201d means a health facility or agency licensed under article 17 of the public health code, Act No. 368 of the Public Acts of 1978, being sections 333.20101 to 333.22260 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">(b) <em>\u201cLicensed health care professional\u201d means an individual licensed or registered under article 15 of the public health code, Act No. 368 of the Public Acts of 1978, being sections. 333.16101 to 333.18838 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, and engaged in the practice of his or her health profession in a </em>sole proprietorship, partnership, <em>professional corporation, </em>or other business entity. However, licensed health care professional does not include a sanitarian or a veterinarian. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">This amendment of \u00a7 5838a was enacted as part of the same package of bills that created the NOI provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>in April 1994.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The amended \u00a7 5838a refers to professional corporations twice. Before this amendment, \u00a7 5838a made no reference whatsoever to professional corporations.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This specific addition of <em>professional corporations </em>to \u00a7 5838a was a clear statement by the Legislature that it intended a PC to be an entity against which a medical malpractice action could be asserted. Further, the placement of the reference to <em>professional corporations </em>within \u00a7 5838a(l)(b) (defining heath care professionals), rather than within \u00a7 5838a(l)(a) (defining health facilities), stands as a recognition of the nature of services as delineated in the Professional Service Corporation Act, MCL 450.225. When a PC renders professional services, it is rendering those professional services through the licensed health care pro-vider and the two are treated as though they are one entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Finally, \u00a7 5838a recognizes that some services provided by a PC are professional services while others are not. Where the services provided are <em>professional services </em>rendered by a licensed health care provider, any claim challenging those services as being negligent sound in medical malpractice, and the statutes governing medical malpractice apply. Where the services provided by a PC are not professional services as defined in MCL 450.225, the claim would not be subject to the medical malpractice requirements because those claims sound in ordinary negligence. To hold otherwise would negate the intent of the Legislature and ignore the proper rules of statutory construction, which require that any one statute be read in conjunction with other relevant statutes to ensure that legislative intent is being correctly ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Accordingly, in the instant case, the first prong of the <em>Kuznar </em>test is met because a PC is a covered entity under \u00a7 5838a and the services provided were professional services. The second prong of the <em>Kuznar </em>test is also met because there is no dispute that the claims asserted posed questions of medical judgment outside the realm of common knowledge and experience. Consequently, because both prongs of the <em>Kuznar </em>test have been met, we conclude that this is a claim that sounds in medical malpractice. Because \u00a72912b(l) clearly requires a claimant to provide a timely NOI before commencing a medical malpractice action, plaintiff was required to provide this PC with a timely NOI.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">C. THE CONTENT REQUIREMENTS OF MCL 600.2912b</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Because plaintiff did provide an NOI to Huron Valley Radiology, the next issue is whether the NOI was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>defective. The resolution of this issue requires an examination of the content requirements of \u00a7 2912b. The Court of Appeals ruled that the instant NOI contained a defect, thereby necessitating dismissal of the action without prejudice. The purported defect in the NOI can be summarized as the failure of plaintiff to set forth a statement in the NOI that Dr. Murry was the employee of Huron Valley Radiology and that this PC was vicariously liable for the actions of its employee-doctor. We take note of the fact that both the trial court and the Court of Appeals held that the NOI was fully compliant with the content requirements under \u00a7 2912b(4) in all respects regarding Dr. Murry, a holding with which we fully agree. Also, we note that the only claim pursued against Huron Valley Radiology was one for vicarious liability for the actions of Dr. Murry, and the NOI fully informed Huron Valley Radiology and Dr. Murry of the claim being asserted against Dr. Murry. Thus, we are compelled to review \u00a7 2912b to determine if there is a statutory mandate to specifically set forth the legal relationship between these two parties in the NOI, and whether there is a statutory mandate to set forth that the claim asserted is one for vicarious liability when no other claims are being asserted. Our inquiry once again necessarily begins with an examination of the language of \u00a7 2912b.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The first question we examine is whether \u00a7 2912b requires that legal and employment relationships between the parties be set forth in an NOI. We hold that the answer is no. The content requirements for an NOI are set forth in subsection 2912b(4):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">The notice given to a health professional or health facility under this section shall contain a statement of at least all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">(a) The factual basis for the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>(b) The applicable standard of practice or care alleged by the claimant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">(c) The manner in which it is claimed that the applicable standard of practice or care was breached by the health professional or health facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">(d) The alleged action that should have been taken to achieve compliance with the alleged standard of practice or care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">(e) The manner in which it is alleged the breach of the standard of practice or care was the proximate cause of the injury claimed in the notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">(f) The names of all health professionals and health facilities the claimant is notifying under this section in relation to the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">We find no language in this subsection that requires a claimant to set forth the nature of the relationship between the parties to be sued. To the contrary, subsection f clearly states that all that need be done in this regard is to identify the names of the health professional and facility being notified. We cannot add a requirement that is not contained in the statute\u2019s plain language. Moreover, we cannot assume that defendants were unable to comprehend the nature of the relationship between them without having a claimant advise them in writing that such a relationship exists. Certainly they are fully aware of the legal relationship between them.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> More importantly, however, there simply is no requirement in the statute that a claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>advise the defendants of their legal or employment relationship.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Accordingly, Potter\u2019s NOI was not defective in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Our next query is whether \u00a7 2912b(4) contains a requirement that the claimant specifically set forth the legal theory of vicarious liability within the NOI, when vicarious liability is the only claim asserted. We again hold that the answer is an unequivocal no. There is nothing in the language of \u00a7 2912b(4) that states that a claimant must set forth the legal theory of vicarious liability. Nor can we add such a requirement to the statute. The statute is focused on a requirement that the claimants advise the recipient of the factual and medical basis of the claim being asserted.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> If no other claim is asserted against the PC, then there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>possibility for confusion regarding the nature of the claim being asserted against it. If the claimant wishes to make some other claim against the PC, then the claimant would be required to set forth that additional claim in order to satisfy the \u00a7 2912b(4)(b) \u201capplicable standard of care\u201d requirement. But if the only claim asserted against the PC is one for vicarious liability, the \u201capplicable standard of care\u201d requirement is met because there is only one standard of care: the standard of care for the provider. There is no separate standard of care for the PC. This analysis not only holds true to the statutory language, but also fully recognizes that the agent and principal share a singular identity for purposes of performing professional services, pursuant to the statute governing professional corporations.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Accordingly, where the NOI adequately sets forth the claim against the agent or employee, the claimant need not repeat the same information, or state the words \u201cvicarious liability\u201d in the NOI, because the statute does not require the claimant to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Moreover, we find Huron Valley Radiology\u2019s assertions especially troubling because it openly admits knowing and understanding that it is vicariously liable for the actions of its employee, Dr. Murry. In other words, while admitting that it employs Dr. Murry, Huron Valley Radiology simultaneously asks that we dismiss plaintiffs case for plaintiffs failure to tell it that it employs Dr. Murry. We query what purpose such a statement would serve. Huron Valley Radiology\u2019s proposition exalts form over substance in an intolerable manner. More importantly, however, because there is no requirement in the statute to state the legal term \u201cvicarious liability\u201d within the NOI, we will not hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>plaintiff to this requirement, nor will we write such a requirement into the statute.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">This holding is also consistent with this Court\u2019s longstanding principles forming the foundation of vicarious liability. A master is bound to keep his or her servants within their proper bounds, and is responsible if he or she does not. \u201cThe law contemplates that their acts are his acts, and that he is constructively present at them all. \u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This Court has long held that a principal \u201cis only liable because the law creates a practical identity with his men [agents], so that he is held to have done what they have done.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> This longstanding legal doctrine is embodied in MCL 450.225. As previously discussed, that statute recognizes that a PC can only render professional services through its licensed health care providers. Accordingly, with regard to vicarious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>liability claims, the parties are in fact the same actor, and therefore, there is no need for a claimant to duplicate the same information in the NOI for both parties. If the information contained within the NOI is sufficient with regard to the agent, it is sufficient with regard to the principal, because they share a practical identity for purposes of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In sum, the issue is whether Huron Valley Radiology could reasonably be held to comprehend the nature of the claims being asserted against it. The NOI provided the necessary information for both the PC and the doctor to have such an understanding. The only claim asserted against Huron Valley Radiology was for the actions of Dr. Murry, and those actions were fully and adequately set forth in the NOI. Nothing more is required. We conclude that the NOI in this case was not defective and dismissal of the action is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">We hold that a plaintiff must provide a timely NOI to a PC before commencing a medical malpractice action when the claims alleged against the PC are predicated on its vicarious liability for a licensed health care provider who is rendering professional services. Because the claim against Huron Valley Radiology is based on vicarious liability for the professional services of its employee, a licensed health care provider, plaintiff was required to provide a timely NOI as the action is one sounding in medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Moreover, we conclude that the NOI filed in this case was fully compliant with the plain language of \u00a7 2912b(4), which governs its contents. First, there is no requirement in \u00a7 2912b(4) to set forth the legal relationships between named parties; rather, the plain language of \u00a7 2912b(4)(f) only requires naming each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>party to be sued. Secondly, where the only claim asserted against a PC is one for vicarious liability, and hence no other standard of care is being asserted against the PC, there is no requirement within \u00a7 2912b that mandates that a claimant set forth the legal doctrine of vicarious liability in the NOI.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The claim at issue in this case was one for vicarious liability only. In light of MCL 450.225, a PC can only render professional services through its licensed health care provider. Where the NOI names both the PC and the provider, the NOI is fully compliant so long as it sets forth all of the factual and medical information necessary to inform the PC of the nature of the claim being asserted against the physician-provider. Because this NOI meets these requirements, it is fully compliant and there is no need to dismiss this action on the basis of the NOI.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">We therefore reverse the Court of Appeals judgment and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Furthermore, we vacate the order abeying the application for leave to appeal in <em>Potter v McLeary </em>(Docket Nos. 136338 and 136339) and deny the application in light of this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b480-6\">Kelly, C.J., and Cavanagh and Weaver, JJ, concurred with Hathaway, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-9\"> MCL 600.2912b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-10\"> <em>Kumar v Raksha Corp, </em>481 Mich 169, 177; 750 NW2d 121 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\"> See <em>id. </em>at 172.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b457-8\"> Conversely, when a claim asserted against a PC involves the actions of an employee or agent who is unlicensed or not rendering professional services as delineated in MCL 450.225, the NOI requirement would he unnecessary, because such a claim would sound in ordinary negligence rather than medical malpractice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b458-9\"> <em>Potter v McLeary, </em>482 Mich 1004 (2008); <em>Potter v McLeary, </em>480 Mich 915 (2007); <em>Potter v McLeary, </em>278 Mich App 279; 748 NW2d 599 (2008); <em>Potter v McLeary, </em>274 Mich App 222; 732 NW2d 600 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\"><em> Potter, </em>278 Mich App at 281-286.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b463-8\"> <em>Potter, </em>482 Mich at 1004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b463-9\"> Defendant Huron Valley Radiology addressed the sufficiency of the NOI issue extensively in its brief on appeal.

The service provided must also be a professional service, the determination of which requires further analysis. For example, while hospitals are included in the list, not all hospital employees, such as janitors and dietary aides, provide professional services. However, inclusion within either \u00a7 5838a or the Public Health Code lists is a necessary predicate to an action sounding in medical malpractice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b472-6\"> Section 5838a and \u00a7 2912b were both amended by 1993 PA 78, effective April 1, 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\"> The former \u00a7 5838a(l) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">A claim based on the medical malpractice of a person who is, or who holds himself or herself out to be, a licensed health care professional, licensed health facility or agency, employee or agent of a licensed health facility or agency who is engaging in or otherwise assisting in medical care and treatment, or any other health care professional, whether or not licensed by the state, accrues at the time of the act or omission which is the basis for the claim of medical malpractice, regardless of the time the plaintiff discovers or otherwise has knowledge of the claim.

The provider may have either an actual employment relationship with the PC or they may have a complex independent contractor arrangement. While the PC can be vicariously liable for the acts of either under MCL 450.226, the statute logically imposes no requirement on the claimant to allege the precise nature of the relationship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\"> However, even assuming for the sake of argument that there was a requirement to set forth legal relationships in the statute, the NOI meets that burden. Plaintiffs NOI does more than merely name the entities to be sued; the NOI names Huron Valley Radiology as well as the three individual physicians and \u201ctheir employees or agents, actual or ostensible, thereof.\u201d This phrase is repeated three times throughout the NOI. This language is more than sufficient to provide Huron Valley Radiology with notice of the facts establishing the legal relationships at such an early stage of the proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\"> Any argument that it is necessary to plead facts supporting vicarious liability or to state the phrase \u201cvicarious liability\u201d as part and parcel of the \u201cfactual basis of the claim\u201d is misplaced and misreads the NOI statute. Section 2912b(4) does not contain such a requirement and we must assume that the absence of the requirement was purposeful. If the Legislature wanted such a requirement, it could have easily included it. It could have phrased \u00a7 2912b(4)(a) as \u201cthe factual and legal basis for the claim and whether the claim is for direct liability or vicarious liability.\u201d But it did not do so. The Legislature could also have inserted additional mandates, such as requiring the claimant to set forth that the \u201cprovider is licensed to practice medicine in Michigan\u201d or \u201cthe provider is licensed under a specific provision of the public health code.\u201d However, again, the Legislature chose not to do so. Absent statutory guidance, we cannot impose additional requirements upon claimants. The better judicial practice is to refrain from adding requirements to a statute that are not contained within its language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\"> MCL 450.225.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b478-5\"> We do not believe that this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Roberts v Mecosta Co Gen Hosp (Roberts II), </em>470 Mich 679; 684 NW2d 711 (2004), is dispositive. <em>Roberts II </em>discussed a similar issue that arose when the plaintiff asserted claims in a manner that left confusion regarding whether the claims asserted were for direct liability, vicarious liability, or both.

Thus, these cases examined the effect of altogether different statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Justice MARKMAN also claims that in <em>Hardacre v Saginaw Vascular </em>Services,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Court failed to follow <em>Boodt v Borgess Med Ctr.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, in <em>Hardacre, </em>the Court denied leave to appeal because the allegations in the plaintiffs notice of intent to find an action did not need to comply with <em>Boodt. </em>In <em>Hardacre, </em>the burden of explication of the standard of care was minimal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Nor did the Court ignore precedents with which it disagrees in <em>Sazima v Shepherd Bar &amp; </em>Restaurant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Justice MARKMAN claims that the Court failed to follow <em>Chrysler v Blue Arrow Transport Lines.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, <em>Sazima </em>involved exceptions to the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule as set forth in <em>Camburn v Northwest School Dist.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, the Court was not bound by <em>Chrysler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Justice MARKMAN next claims the Court ignored <em>Smith v </em>Khouri<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> when it decided <em>Juarez v Holbrook</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, in <em>Juarez, </em>it was undisputed that the trial court performed a reasonableness analysis in calculating the proper attorney fee award. Therefore, a remand in light of <em>Smith </em>was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">In <em>Beasley v Michigan,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court considered the statutory notice provision of MCL 600.6431(3). Thus, contrary to Justice Markman\u2019s claim, the Court was not bound by <em>Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> Rowland </em>interpreted the notice provision of MCL 600.1404(1); thus, the cases involved different statutory provisions altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">Likewise, Justice MARKMAN is incorrect in claiming that the Court failed to enforce <em>Thornton v Allstate Ins </em>Co<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and <em>Putkamer v Transamerica Ins Corp of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>America<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> in <em>Scott v State Farm Mut Auto Ins </em>Co.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In <em>Scott, </em>the Court of Appeals undertook a thorough analysis of the relevant no-fault jurisprudence and applied precedent as it has been understood for nearly 30 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Finally, the Court did not fail to abide by <em>Rowland </em>in <em>Chambers v Wayne Co Airport Auth.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> Chambers </em>interpreted MCL 691.1406, while <em>Rowland </em>interpreted MCL 691.1404(1). Thus, the cases dealt with different statutory provisions and the Court was not bound to extend <em>Rowland </em>to the statute at issue in <em>Chambers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In summary, the accusation that the Court has been ignoring precedent is incorrect. Had other justices been in the majority in some of the decisions complained about, they might well have extended existing precedent to a new area of the law. But the refusal of those in the majority in this case to so extend precedent is quite different from a refusal on their part to apply it. This is a distinction that Justices MARKMAN, CORRIGAN, and YOUNG would do well to concede.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\"> See, e.g., <em>Petersen v Magna Corp, </em>484 Mich 300, 391-392; 773 NW2d 564 (2009) (Markman, J., dissenting); <em>Chambers v Wayne Co Airport Auth, </em>483 Mich 1081, 1082 (2009) (Corrigan, J., dissenting); <em>Scott v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, </em>483 Mich 1032, 1036 (2009) (Corrigan, J., dissenting); <em>Beasley v Michigan, </em>483 Mich 1025, 1027 (2009) (Corrigan, J., dissenting); <em>Juarez v Holbrook, </em>483 Mich 970 (2009) (Markman, J., dissenting).

I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority\u2019s holding that defendant Huron Valley Radiology, EC. (Huron), was entitled to an NOI. Instead, I concur with and join part I of Justice YOUNG\u2019s partial concurrence and partial dissent with regard to whether plaintiff was required to serve defendant Huron with an NOI to commence a medical malpractice action under MCL 600.2912b. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>fully agree with Justice YOUNG that Huron is neither a \u201chealth professional\u201d nor a \u201chealth facility\u201d entitled to notice under MCL 600.2912b. Whether the Legislature, by oversight or design, excluded professional corporations such as Huron from the statutory definition of \u201chealth facility or agency\u201d in MCL 333.20106(1), it is for the Legislature, and not this Court, to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Because Huron was not entitled to an NOI, plaintiff was not entitled to tolling. I share Justice MARKMAN\u2019s concerns as discussed in part III(C) of his partial concurrence and partial dissent regarding Justice YOUNG\u2019s analysis of the tolling issue. Specifically, I disagree that as long as an NOI is sufficient as to one defendant, the statute of limitations is tolled as to all defendants. I agree with Justice MARKMAN\u2019s conclusion that plaintiffs complaint here was untimely filed. Accordingly, I would hold that the action against Huron was barred by the statute of limitations. Moreover, I also concur with part III(D) of Justice MARKMAN\u2019s opinion concerning whether plaintiff can retroactively amend an NOI.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Additionally, I dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that plaintiffs NOI as to Huron was sufficient. As an initial matter, I would not reach the sufficiency of the notice issue at all for the reasons set forth in part III(E) of Justice MARKMAN\u2019s partial concurrence and dissent, with which I fully concur and join. I also concur with Justice MARKMAN\u2019s discussion of this issue, <em>post </em>at 455 n 1. Because the Court\u2019s limited grant order did not instruct the parties to brief this issue and because both the litigants and the public should be able to rely on our orders, I would not resolve issues in this Queen of Hearts fashion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\"> See Lewis Carroll, <em>Alice\u2019s Adventures In Wonderland </em>(New York: Signet Classic, 2000), ch 12, p 115 (\u201c \u2018No, no!\u2019 said the Queen. \u2018Sentence first \u2014 verdict afterwards.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>YOUNG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-k\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I concur only in the result of the majority opinion, which holds that defendant, Huron Valley Radiology, EC.

Such a defendant is neither a \u201chealth professional\u201d nor a \u201chealth facility\u201d under the NOI statute; thus, a plaintiff is not required to give that defendant written notice under the NOI statute before commencing a medical malpractice action. I would additionally hold that plaintiffs claim against defendant Huron was tolled pursuant to MCL 600.5856(d) because plaintiff provided an NOI in compliance with the NOI statute for \u201ca claim\u201d that would have been barred during the applicable notice period.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">I further dissent from the majority\u2019s analysis whether plaintiffs NOI was deficient. The NOI statute requires that the plaintiff provide a statement of \u201c[t]he factual basis for the claim.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A necessary factual predicate for a vicarious liability claim is that there is an employer-employee (or other principal-agent) relationship, but such a statement of defendant Huron\u2019s relationship to the other individual defendants is not found in plaintiffs NOI; thus, plaintiffs NOI is defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">As the majority opinion itself demonstrates, it is swiftly becoming increasingly acceptable for this Court to avoid attempting a precise or meaningful statutory analysis in favor of imprecise vagaries and broad pronouncements. Such analyses are favored only by those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>who seek a particular result and cannot find an explicable justification for it. The majority\u2019s analysis threatens to render the statutory notice procedure nugatory and undermines, if not overrules, this Court\u2019s precedent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I believe that this Court\u2019s decisions should be grounded in precise and rigorous analysis of the relevant statutory text and that this Court should avoid creating \u201cinconsistencies among its cases and... reduce confusion in [the Court\u2019s] jurisprudence by overruling conflicting decisions.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Accordingly, I would reverse the Court of Appeals and hold that defendant is not entitled to dismissal due to plaintiffs defective NOI.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">I. PLAINTIFF WAS NOT REQUIRED TO SERVE DEFENDANT HURON, A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION, WITH AN NOI.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The Court of Appeals held that plaintiff served defendant Huron, a professional corporation, with a defective NOI and that entitled Huron to dismissal. However, only a \u201chealth professional\u201d and \u201chealth facility\u201d are entitled to notice under the NOI statute, MCL 600.2912b.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, a threshold issue is whether defendant Huron is a \u201chealth professional\u201d or \u201chealth facility.\u201d If not, the defect in plaintiffs NOI is rendered moot and does not entitle defendant to dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Because plaintiff has persuasively argued in this Court that defendant Huron is neither a \u201chealth professional\u201d nor a \u201chealth facility\u201d entitled to notice under the NOI statute, I would hold that plaintiffs defective NOI as to defendant Huron was inconsequential.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>This Court has previously defined the term \u201chealth facility\u201d in the NOI statute through reference to the Public Health Code (PHC),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which defines \u201chealth facility or agency\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>(a) An ambulance operation, aircraft transport operation, nontransport prehospital life support operation, or medical first response service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">(b) A clinical laboratory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">(c) A county medical care facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">(d) A freestanding surgical outpatient facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">(e) A health maintenance organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">(f) A home for the aged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">(g) A hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">(h) A nursing home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">(i) A hospice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-12\">(j) A hospice residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-13\">(k) A facility or agency listed in subdivisions (a) to (h) located in a university, college, or other educational institution. [<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">Several of the health facilities listed could be incorporated as professional corporations. Significantly, however, defendant Huron, although a professional corporation, is not a listed health facility. Thus, defendant Huron is not a \u201chealth facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">The PHC does not define \u201chealth professional.\u201d \u201cProfessional,\u201d however, is commonly defined as \u201ca member of a profession, [especially] one of the learned professions.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The PHC defines \u201chealth profession\u201d as \u201ca vocation, calling, occupation, or employment <em>performed by an individual </em>acting pursuant to a license or registration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>issued under this article.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, only an \u201cindividual\u201d can practice a \u201chealth profession.\u201d Because the PHC defines \u201cindividual\u201d as \u201ca natural person,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> only a natural person can be a \u201chealth professional,\u201d and defendant Huron is therefore not a \u201chealth professional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Instead of applying these interpretations consistent with our precedent, the majority relies on the definition of \u201clicensed health care professional\u201d in the accrual statute, MCL 600.5838a:<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201can <em>individual </em>licensed or registered under article 15 of the public health code .. . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>and engaged in the practice of <em>his or her </em>health profession in a sole proprietorship, partnership, professional corporation, or other business entity.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As stated, a professional corporation is not an \u201cindividual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Interestingly, the majority simply disregards this Court\u2019s very recent interpretation of the definition of \u201clicensed health care professional\u201d in the accrual statute. In <em>Kuznar, </em>the defendant pharmacy sought the benefit of the shortened period of limitations for medical malpractice and argued that it was subject to medical malpractice liability because it was a \u201clicensed health care professional\u201d under the accrual statute. Just last year, we <em>unanimously </em>rejected that argument and explained that \u201c[t]he flaw in defendant\u2019s position is that the Public Health Code defines \u2018individual\u2019 to mean \u2018a natural person.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s argument here suffers the same flaw that we <em>unanimously </em>rejected. A professional corporation is not \u201ca natural person.\u201d Furthermore, a professional corporation is not \u201clicensed or registered under article 15 of the public health code.\u201d The majority cannot acknowledge the existence of <em>Kuznar </em>without overruling it or changing its rationale here. It has therefore chosen to ignore <em>Kuznar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The majority\u2019s analysis is superficial. The majority merely announces that it discovered the term \u201cprofessional corporation\u201d in a related statute and, therefore, a professional corporation is entitled to notice. In serious statutory construction, context matters and so does grammar.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In the accrual statute, \u201clicensed health care professional\u201d is defined by modifying the subject, \u201can indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>vidual,\u201d with the clause \u201cengaged in the practice of his or her health profession in a sole proprietorship, partnership, professional corporation, or other business entity.\u201d Thus, instead of providing that a professional corporation is a \u201clicensed health care professional,\u201d the statute provides that practice of a health profession in a professional corporation is simply one way for \u201can individual\u201d to meet the requirements to be a \u201clicensed health care professional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The context of subsection (1) of the accrual statute also betrays the majority\u2019s position. It provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">a claim based on the medical malpractice of a person ... who is ... a licensed health care professional,.. . whether or not the licensed health care professional... is engaged in the practice of the health profession in a sole proprietorship, partnership, professional corporation, or other business entity, accrues at the time of the act or omission that is the basis for the claim of medical malpractice .... [MCL 600.5838a(l).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Thus, the reference to a professional corporation makes clear that practice in a professional corporation does not affect when a medical malpractice claim accrues.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s interpretation is repudiated by the rule of statutory interpretation that prohibits rendering statutory terms surplusage or nugatory.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The majority proclaims that \u201c[f]or all practical purposes, the PC and the health care provider are treated as the same entity when professional services are involved.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This pronouncement is designed to ignore reality and the actual text of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>To arrive at its conclusion that a professional corporation is included in the NOI statute, the majority conflates common-law principles with its obligation to accurately construe this statute. It therefore emphasizes the unremarkable proposition of common-law vicarious liability that a corporation can only act through its officers and agents,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but ignores the equally unremarkable proposition that a corporation is a distinct legal entity.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The flaw in this analysis is that it imports common-law theories of liability to defeat the statutory enumeration of covered entities that does not include a professional corporation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Legislature is free to include and exclude any entity from the statutory notice procedure that it desires. By importing extra-textual theories of liability into this statutory procedural requirement, the majority deprives the Legislature of that option and renders surplusage portions of the statute the Legislature enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">As stated, the majority holds that a professional corporation is a \u201chealth professional\u201d because the term \u201cprofessional corporation\u201d appears in the accrual stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>ute definition of \u201clicensed health care provider.\u201d That definition, however, also includes any \u201cother business entity.\u201d By the majority\u2019s logic, any \u201cother business entity\u201d is a \u201chealth professional.\u201d If that were true, then the terms \u201chealth facility\u201d in the NOI statute and \u201clicensed health facility or agency\u201d in \u00bfhe accrual statute would be needless surplusage. For example, a hospital is listed in the PHC definition used to define \u201chealth facility\u201d and \u201clicensed health care facility or agency.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> A hospital may be incorporated and, as such, is any \u201cother business entity.\u201d Thus, under the majority\u2019s analysis, a hospital is, \u201cfor all practical purposes,\u201d a \u201clicensed health care professional.\u201d The same is true for all other entities listed in the PHC definition of \u201clicensed health facility or agency.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Because it renders the term \u201chealth facility\u201d in the NOI statute needless surplusage, the majority\u2019s interpretation is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Because defendant Huron is neither a \u201chealth facility\u201d nor a \u201chealth professional,\u201d I would hold that plaintiff was not required to serve it with an NOI before commencing a medical malpractice action against it.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, plaintiffs claim against defendant Huron was not subject to dismissal for a defective NOI.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>II. THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR PLAINTIFF\u2019S CLAIM AGAINST DEFENDANT HURON WAS TOLLED UNDER MCL 600.5856(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">This Court ordered supplemental briefing on \u201cwhether, if a defendant professional corporation is not an entity to whom notice is required to be provided under MCL 600.2912b, the applicable statute of limitations, MCL 600.5805(6), was nonetheless subject to statutory tolling provided in former MCL 600.5856(d).\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> If the statute of limitations was not tolled under former subsection (d) of the tolling statute, MCL 600.5856, then plaintiffs claim against defendant Huron was filed after the period of limitations expired and defendant Huron would be entitled to dismissal with prejudice. I am persuaded that the statute of limitations for plaintiffs claim against Huron was tolled under former subsection (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The tolling statute applicable here provided:<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">The statutes of limitations or repose are tolled:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">(a) At the time the complaint is filed and a copy of the summons and complaint are served on the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">(b) At the time jurisdiction over the defendant is otherwise acquired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">(c) At the time the complaint is filed and a copy of the summons and complaint in good faith are placed in the hands of an officer for immediate service, but in this case the statute is not tolled longer than 90 days after the copy of the summons and complaint is received by the officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">(d) If, during the applicable notice period under section 2912b, <em>a claim </em>would be barred by the statute of limitations or repose, for not longer than a number of days equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>to the number of days in the applicable notice period after the date notice is given in compliance with section 2912b. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Plaintiff argues that because subsection (d) uses the indefinite article \u201ca,\u201d not the definite article \u201cthe,\u201d it is not claim specific and, therefore, tolls all claims in the complaint. Defendant argues that tolling only applies for \u201ca claim\u201d to which <em>\u201cthe applicable </em>notice period under section 2912b\u201d applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">I believe that the dispositive question is <em>\u201cwhat </em>is being tolled?\u201d The first sentence of the tolling statute states that \u201c[t]he statutes of limitations or repose <em>are </em>tolled.\u201d The plural form suggests that more than one statute of limitations can be tolled by each subsection, including subsection (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">By their nature, each of the other tolling provisions, \u00a7 5856(a) through (c), apply to all claims in a complaint, not just individual claims. Thus, the plural form in the prefatory clause is consistent with those provisions because they could involve multiple statutes of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Based on the prefatory provision, there is a strong textual argument that under subsection (d), \u201c[t]he statutes of limitations . . . are tolled\u201d for all claims in a complaint when \u201cduring the applicable notice period under section 2912b, <em>a claim, </em>would be barred by the statute of limitations or repose.\u201d Thus, for example, in a complaint alleging a malpractice claim and a negligence claim, if the requirements of subsection (d) are met, the \u201cstatutes of limitations . . . <em>are </em>tolled\u201d for both claims. I believe that this is the superior textual argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">Although the prefatory clause does not specify which statutes of limitations are tolled, there is no textual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>basis for restricting tolling to a single claim.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Subsection (d) only requires \u201ca claim\u201d to be barred during the notice period and notice to be given in compliance with the NOI statute; the prefatory clause provides that multiple statutes are tolled as a result.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>I note that the current tolling provision is more precise on this issue. MCL 600.5856(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">The statutes of limitations or repose are tolled in any of the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">(c) At the time notice is given in compliance with the applicable notice period under section 2912b, if during that period a claim would be barred by the statute of limitations or repose; but in this case, <em>the statute is tolled </em>not longer than the number of days equal to the number of days remaining in the applicable notice period after the date notice is given. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">As indicated by the highlighted text, the significant distinction between current subsection (c) and former subsection (d) is that the current provision restates what is tolled (\u201cthe statute\u201d), which specifies that tolling is limited to only one statute while the former provision remained unlimited by the prefatory clause (\u201c[t]he statutes\u201d). Thus, current subsection (c) is expressly claim specific and only tolls <em>\u201cthe </em>statute\u201d for the previously referenced claim that would be barred.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Here, plaintiffs NOI was sufficient as to co-defendant Murry.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Subsection (d) applied to plaintiffs claim against Murry because the period of hmitations would have expired during the notice period if the statute of limitations was not tolled. Thus, \u201cnotice [was] given in compliance with section 2912b\u201d for \u201ca claim\u201d that \u201cwould [have been] barred by the statute of limitations,\u201d so \u201c[t]he statutes of hmitations ... [were] tolled.\u201d Accordingly, I would reverse the Court of Appeals and hold that defendant Huron was not entitled to dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">III. PLAINTIFF\u2019S NOI WAS DEFICIENT.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">I join part III(E) of Justice MARKMAN\u2019s dissent<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> regarding the majority\u2019s decision to address and resolve an issue that the parties were specifically directed not to address. The majority has deprived the parties of an opportunity to brief and argue the merits of the sufficiency of plaintiffs NOI. As such, the majority\u2019s action suggests that parties should follow our grant orders at their peril. No serious court should function in this fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Although not properly before this Court nor pertinent to my analysis, I address the majority\u2019s analysis that plaintiffs NOI was not deficient because it will likely affect how lower courts evaluate an NOI. I believe that plaintiffs NOI was deficient and the majority\u2019s analysis is no more than a shallow gloss over the statutory text.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>As stated, a plaintiff must serve an NOI before commencing a medical malpractice action against a health facility or health professional.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In subsection (4) of the NOI statute, the Legislature has enumerated six specific topics that the plaintiff must address in his NOI:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">The notice given to a health professional or health facility under this section shall contain a statement of at least all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">(a) The factual basis for the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">(b) The applicable standard of practice or care alleged by the claimant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">(c) The manner in which it is claimed that the applicable standard of practice or care was breached by the health professional or health facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">(d) The alleged action that should have been taken to achieve compliance with the alleged standard of practice or care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">(e) The manner in which it is alleged the breach of the standard of practice or care was the proximate cause of the injury claimed in the notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">(f) The names of all health professionals and health facilities the claimant is notifying under this section in relation to the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">\u201cSubsections 2912b(l) and (4) clearly place the burden of complying with the notice of intent requirements on the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">In <em>Roberts II, </em>this Court established the standard for whether an NOI complied with the statutory requirements of subsection (4) of the NOI statute: \u201cthe claimant is required to make good-faith averments that provide details that are <em>responsive </em>to the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>sought by the statute and that are as <em>particularized </em>as is consistent with the early stages of the proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> An NOI that does not meet this standard is deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Subsection (a) requires the plaintiff to provide a statement of \u201c[t]he factual basis for the claim.\u201d Here, plaintiff has alleged that defendant Huron is vicariously liable for the acts of its agents, defendants Murry, Dr. Richard D. McLeary, and Dr. Gary Augustyn. Thus, \u201cthe claim\u201d is vicarious liability. An essential factual predicate for plaintiffs vicarious liability claim is that the individual defendants were defendant Huron\u2019s employees. Nowhere in the notice does plaintiff suggest that any employer-employee (or other principal-agent relationship) existed between the defendants.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Because plaintiff omitted \u201c[t]he factual basis for the claim,\u201d he failed to meet the <em>Roberts II </em>standard and, therefore, the NOI is deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The majority holds that there is \u201cno language in [subsection (4) of the NOI statute] that requires a claimant to set forth the nature of the relationship between the parties to be sued.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> To support its conclusion, the majority states that no such requirement is found in subsection (f).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> That is true, but no more sufficient than stating that no such requirement is found in subsection (e). The majority offers no discussion of subsection (a) \u2014 \u201c[t]he factual basis for the claim\u201d \u2014 and why a principal-agent relationship is not part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>the factual basis of plaintiffs vicarious liability claim. The majority proclaims that it is not \u201cnecessary to plead facts supporting vicarious liability.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> As stated, here, \u201cthe claim\u201d is vicarious liability. Thus, the majority has proudly announced that it is not necessary to state the factual basis for the claim.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This is most likely a relief to plaintiffs and a shock to the Legislature and anyone who has read the NOI statute since it was enacted. The majority cannot square its analysis with the text of the relevant statute, so it does not attempt such folly.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The majority buttresses its conclusion with its assessment of defendant Huron\u2019s subjective knowledge: \u201cCertainly they are fully aware of the legal relationship between them.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s reliance on the knowledge of <em>this </em>defendant is not a relevant assessment of what the Legislature has required a plaintiff to provide in its NOI.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>This Court previously rejected such a construction of subsection (4) of the NOI statute for an obvious reason: it would render the statutory notice procedure completely nugatory.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The NOI statute, in plain and unambiguous terms, places the burden on the plaintiff to provide \u201cwritten notice under this section\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> that \u201ccon-taints] a statement\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> of six specific topics. Thus, the Legislature has not required that the defendant \u201cfill in the blanks.\u201d Undeterred, the majority replaces the legislative standards with its own requirement and creates a slippery slope in which the plaintiff complies with the NOI statute by simply declaring \u201cI went to the doctor and something bad happened.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Under the majority\u2019s analysis, the burden is on the defendant to fill in the remainder of the missing but required NOI information.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The majority fails to comprehend the significance of its decision. Our decisions do not resolve only the case before us, but rather, all cases subsequently filed in Michigan raising similar issues; we are obligated to ensure that all cases are resolved in a manner that is consistent with the text of the applicable statute.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Consider, for example, a corporate defendant that never employed or worked with any of the other individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>defendants listed \u2014 one that is named in the NOI through mistake or error. How does an NOI that fails to allege any relationship between the corporate defendant and the individual defendants inform that defendant of the factual basis for the claim against it? The majority\u2019s analysis threatens to deprive a named defendant of the notice that the statutory procedure is designed to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The justification that a particular defendant might have knowledge about data the plaintiff is statutorily obligated to supply is just a fancy way for the majority to subvert a statute it does not like. At the very least, the majority is not pretending any longer to enforce the plain language of the NOI statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The majority\u2019s lack of concern for the implications of its discussion is illustrated by its treatment of <em>Roberts II. </em>The majority purports to leave for another day the question whether <em>Roberts II </em>was correctly decided.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Nevertheless, it states that \u201cthe issue is whether [Huron] could reasonably be held to comprehend the nature of the claims being asserted against it.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> That standard is distinctly <em>not </em>the <em>Roberts II </em>standard set out above. Indeed, that standard is similar to the standard articulated by the <em>dissent </em>in <em>Roberts II: </em>\u201cThe statement simply must provide notice of a potential claim sufficient to allow potential defendants to ascertain the basis for the claim and enter into settlement discussions.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Once again, such a view is inconsistent with the statutory text.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">This continues a disturbing trend in which the majority</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">overrules by indirection, or at least leaves the impression that it is doing so, thereby sowing the seeds of confusion and making it difficult for the citizens of this state to comprehend precisely what our caselaw requires. This appears to be an unfortunate return to our predecessors\u2019 past practice of \u201cfrequently pa[ying] little attention to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>inconsistencies among its cases and declin[ing] to reduce confusion in [the Court\u2019s] jurisprudence by overruling conflicting <em>decisions.\u201d[</em><footnotemark><em>46</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">I do not believe that defendant Huron is a \u201chealth professional\u201d or \u201chealth facility\u201d entitled to notice under the NOI statute and, therefore, plaintiff was not required to serve defendant Huron with an NOI. I also believe that plaintiffs claim against defendant Huron was tolled pursuant to subsection (d) of the tolling statute. Accordingly, I would reverse the Court of Appeals and hold that defendant Huron is not entitled to dismissal because of plaintiffs defective NOI.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-8\"> MCL 600.2912b(4)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-8\"> See <em>Roberts v Mecosta Co Gen Hosp (After Remand), </em>470 Mich 679; 684 NW2d 711 (2004) <em>(Roberts II).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b486-9\"> <em>Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>473 Mich 562, 571 n 19; 702 NW2d 539 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b486-10\"> MCL 600.2912b(l) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person shall not commence an action alleging medical malpractice against a <em>health professional </em>or <em>health facility </em>unless the person has given the health professional or health facility written notice under this section not less than 182 days before the action is commenced. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b487-6\"> The NOI statute only applies to medical malpractice actions. This is clearly a medical malpractice action, but not for the reasons stated by the majority. Huron is subject to medical malpractice liability because a principal sued for the medical malpractice of its agent is sued in medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The first step when determining whether a plaintiff has alleged medical malpractice is to consider \u201cwhether [the claim] is being brought against someone who, or an entity that, is capable of malpractice.\u201d <em>Bryant v Oakpointe Villa Nursing Centre, Inc, </em>471 Mich 411, 420; 684 NW2d 864 (2004). This Court has consistently explained that the accrual statute, MCL 600.5838a, does not define, but rather <em>expands, </em>who may be sued for medical malpractice. <em>Bryant, supra </em>at 420-421; <em>Kuznar v Raksha Corp, </em>481 Mich 169, 177; 750 NW2d 121 (2008). Here, plaintiff raises a claim of vicarious liability, not direct liability, against defendant Huron. See <em>Cox v Flint Bd of Hosp Managers, </em>467 Mich 1, 11; 651 NW2d 356 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Michigan courts have consistently recognized actions against a principal in medical malpractice under a vicarious liability theory <em>when the principal was not identified in the accrual statute </em>but the agent was subject to medical malpractice liability. See, e.g., <em>Francisco v Parchment Med Clinic, PC, </em>407 Mich 325; 285 NW2d 39 (1979) (vicarious liability action against a professional corporation for medical malpractice of a general practitioner and surgeon <em>before </em>the amendment of MCL 600.5838a adding \u201cprofessional corporation\u201d in 1994, 1993 PA 78); <em>Becker v Meyer Rexall Drug Co, </em>141 Mich App 481; 367 NW2d 424 (1985) (vicarious liability action against a pharmacy, which is not identified in that accrual statute, <em>Kuznar, supra, </em>for medical malpractice of a pharmacist); <em>Simmons v Apex Drug Stores, Inc, </em>201 Mich App 250; 506 NW2d 562 (1993) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">Conversely, this Court has held that vicarious liability claims against corporate entities were stated in ordinary negligence <em>because </em>the agent could not be hable in medical malpractice. See <em>Kambas v St Joseph\u2019s Mercy Hosp of Detroit, </em>389 Mich 249, 256; 205 NW2d 431 (1979) (decided when the accrual statute did not refer to a \u201clicensed health facility or agency\u201d or otherwise include a hospital, and holding that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>defendant hospital\u2019s liability, being herein predicated upon the theory of <em>respondeat superior, </em>and having determined that nurses are not subject to the two year malpractice statute of limitations, we conclude that the three year statute of limitations is applicable to injuries arising from the negligent act of a nurse and is equally applicable to defendant employer hospital herein\u201d); <em>Kuznar, supra </em>at 172 (holding that because the employee could not be liable in medical malpractice, \u201cvicarious liability for [the employee\u2019s alleged negligence] by the pharmacy [which is not referenced in \u00a7 5838a(l)] may also proceed under the three-year statute of limitations for ordinary negligence\u201d). Thus, when the principal is not identified in the accrual statute, a vicarious liability claim is not automatically an ordinary negligence claim. Rather, the nature of the claim depends on whether the <em>agent </em>is sued in medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The nature of the claim against the agent defines the vicarious liability claim. If the agent is sued in medical malpractice, the vicarious liability claim against the principal is in medical malpractice. This <em>does not </em>malee the principal a \u201clicensed health care professional.\u201d MCL 600.5838a(l)(b). It makes the principal <em>liable </em>for the acts of a \u201clicensed health care professional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Here, defendant Huron\u2019s agents, defendants Dr. Kristyn Murry and Dr. Richard McLeary, are radiologists subject to medical malpractice liability. There is no dispute that plaintiffs claim sounds in medical malpractice. See <em>Bryant, supra </em>at 422; <em>ante </em>at 414 n 23. Accordingly, plaintiffs vicarious liability claim against defendant Huron is a medical malpractice claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b488-11\"> See <em>Omelenchuk v City of Warren, </em>461 Mich 567, 571 n 11; 609 NW2d 177 (2000).

Neither the parties nor this Court raised the issue whether the professional corporation there was required to receive an NOI in <em>Roberts I </em>or <em>Roberts II. </em>I prefer to base my analysis on issues that we did address rather than consider inferences from issues that we did not and were not asked to address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b495-12\"> 483 Mich 922 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b495-13\"> The tolling statute was amended by 2004 PA 87, effective April 22, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b497-6\"> Justice Markman misconstrues my analysis. I do not suggest that more than one statute of limitations is <em>always </em>tolled. <em>Post </em>at 469. Certainly, if there is only one claim, then only one statute of limitations is tolled. Nor do I suggest that \u201call claims against all defendants in Michigan\u201d are tolled by a single sufficient NOI as to a single defendant. <em>Post </em>at 472 n 16 (emphasis omitted). Hyperbole aside, I believe that there is simply no textual basis for treating subsection (d) of the tolling statute different than subsection (a) through (c) of the tolling statute. The Legislature is perfectly capable of providing such a basis for distinction; see my discussion of subsection (c) of the tolling statute as amended hy 2004 PA 87 below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\"> I agree with Justice Markman that \u201cthe notice of intent must contain all of the statements required by \u00a7 2912b(4) as to <em>\u2018each </em>particular [defendant] named in the notice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Post </em>at 470, quoting <em>Roberts II, supra </em>at 692. Because a plaintiff is statutorily prohibited from commencing a medical malpractice action without first giving the notice required under the NOI statute, dismissal is appropriate when a plaintiff fails to give such notice. See MCL 600.2912b(l); <em>Burton v Reed City Hosp Corp, </em>471 Mich 745, 753; 691 NW2d 424 (2005) (holding that \u201cdismissal is an appropriate remedy for noncompliance with the notice provisions\u201d of the NOI statute). Thus, contrary to Justice Markman\u2019s concern that my analysis would deprive defendants the notice that the statutory procedure is designed to provide, <em>post </em>at 473-474, a plaintiffs failure to provide a defendant with a sufficient NOI still entitles that defendant to dismissal, tolling notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Justice Markman suggests that I create a \u201ctrap for unwary plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 474 n 19. Admittedly, a plaintiff will be unable to re-file <em>some </em>claims \u2014 specifically, those for which an NOI is required. However, as I discussed above, a professional corporation that is not a \u201chealth facility\u201d is not entitled to notice; thus, a defective NOI is inconsequential for such a defendant. Moreover, if that claim is dismissed, tolling afforded by subsection (d) of the tolling statute is not rendered moot because the plaintiff will not need to wait the notice period to re-file his complaint. It is for this reason that my interpretation does not create an irreconcilable conflict with MCL 600.2912b(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\"> Justice Markman correctly states that under my analysis of who must receive an NOI and my interpretation of current subsection (c) of the tolling statute, \u201cthe plaintiff would have to file his medical malpractice action against the professional corporation before he filed a medical malpractice action against the physician, if the period of limitations would have expired within 182 days after the plaintiff served his notice of intent on the physician.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 471 n 14. Although this procedure seems unusual, we are without authority to question the wisdom of the Legislature and \u201cfix\u201d perceived problems.

The notice of intent did not contain a statement of \u201c[t]he applicable standard of practice or care alleged by the claimant\u201d with regard to HVR, as is required by MCL 600.2912b(4)(b). As this Court explained in <em>Roberts v Mecosta Co Gen Hosp (After Remand), </em>470 Mich 679, 693-694; 684 NW2d 711 (2004) <em>(Roberts IT), </em>a notice of intent must include a \u201cparticularized standard for each of the professionals and facilities named in the notices,\u201d which necessarily must indicate \u201cwhether plaintiff [is] alleging that [the] defendants were vicariously or directly liable to [the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>tiff].\u201d Because the notice of intent here did not include such a statement, it was clearly defective with regard to HVR.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">We held in <em>Roberts v Mecosta Co Gen Hosp, </em>466 Mich 57; 642 NW2d 663 (2002) <em>(Roberts I), </em>that a defective notice of intent does not toll the statute of limitations. Because the period of limitations in a medical malpractice action is two years, MCL 600.5805(6), and because the alleged malpractice in this case occurred on June 7, 2001, and the complaint was not filed until November 4, 2003, the complaint was untimely filed, and thus the action against HVR is barred by the statute of limitations. I would affirm the portions of the Court of Appeals opinion that held that the notice of intent was sufficient as to defendant Murry and insufficient as to defendant HVR, but reverse the portions of that opinion that held that the defective notice of intent tolled the statute of limitations and, thus, that a dismissal without prejudice was appropriate. The action against HVR should be dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">I. FACTS AND HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The alleged medical malpractice occurred on June 7, 2001. Plaintiff alleges that Murry, a radiologist working for HVR, \u201cfailed to properly interpret and report back the true and correct results of the MRI....\u201d He further alleges \u201c[t]hat as a result of the. . . delay in surgical [intervention, he] has suffered permanent neurologic injury and deficit.\u201d On May 30, 2003, just eight days before the expiration of the two-year period of limitations, plaintiff served defendants Murry and HVR with a notice of intent to file suit. On November 4, 2003, plaintiff filed his medical malpractice complaint against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>The trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion for summary disposition. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that because plaintiffs affidavits of merit were defective, the complaint had to be dismissed with prejudice. <em>Potter v McLeary, </em>274 Mich App 222; 732 NW2d 600 (2007). This Court reversed \u201cthe portion of the judgment of the Court of Appeals dismissing the complaint <em>with </em>prejudice, because the dismissal should have been <em>without </em>prejudice as to the affidavit of merit issue.\u201d <em>Potter v McLeary, </em>480 Mich 915 (2007) (emphasis in the original). We remanded to the Court of Appeals for consideration of defendants\u2019 remaining issues. On remand, the Court of Appeals held that plaintiffs notice of intent was sufficient as to defendant Murry, but insufficient as to defendant HVR. However, the Court of Appeals held that the defective notice of intent tolled the statute of limitations, and thus dismissed without prejudice as to HVR. <em>Potter v McLeary, </em>278 Mich App 279; 748 NW2d 599 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In Docket No. 136336, plaintiff appealed the portion of the Court of Appeals decision that held that the notice of intent was defective as to HVR, and in Docket Nos. 136338 and 136339, defendants appealed the portion of the Court of Appeals decision that held that the defective notice of intent tolled the statute of limitations, and, thus, that a dismissal without prejudice was appropriate, and the portion that held that the notice of intent was sufficient as to defendant Murry. In Docket No. 136336, we granted plaintiffs application \u201climited to the issue whether defendant Huron Valley Radiology, EC., is a \u2018health facility or agency\u2019 to which a plaintiff is required to provide notice under MCL 600.2912b(l).\u201d 482 Mich 1004 (2008).

ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AWM\">A. NOTICE OF INTENT</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">I agree with the majority that HVR was entitled to a notice of intent. The majority concludes that HVR was entitled to a notice of intent because \u201cthe action is one sounding in medical malpractice.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 403. Although I agree that the action here is \u201cone sounding in medical malpractice,\u201d this is only the first step in the analysis to determine whether a notice of intent was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">MCL 600.2912b(l) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person shall not commence an action alleging medical malpractice against a health professional or health facility unless the person has given the health professional or health facility written notice under this section not less than 182 days before the action is commenced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Because \u00a7 2912b(l) only applies to an \u201caction alleging medical malpractice,\u201d the majority is correct that \u201cthe first step in the analysis\u201d is to determine whether the action is one \u201calleging medical malpractice.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 414. It is undisputed that the action at issue here is such an action, because it \u201callege[s] an action that (1) occurred within the course of a professional relationship and (2) poses questions of medical judgment outside the realm of common knowledge and experience.\u201d <em>Kuznar v Raksha Corp, </em>481 Mich 169, 176-177; 750 NW2d 121 (2008), citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>Bryant v Oakpointe Villa Nursing Ctr, Inc, </em>471 Mich 411, 422; 684 NW2d 864 (2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">However, despite the majority\u2019s initial recognition that whether this action is one \u201calleging medical malpractice\u201d is only the \u201cfirst step in the analysis\u201d in determining whether a notice of intent was required, <em>ante </em>at 414, the majority does not address the second step. Rather, it concludes that \u201c[b]ecause \u00a7 2912b(l) clearly requires a claimant to provide a timely NOI before commencing a medical malpractice action, plaintiff was required to provide this [professional corporation] with a timely NOI.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 419. However, \u00a7 2912b(l) requires a notice of intent only if: (a) the action is one \u201calleging medical malpractice\u201d; <em>and </em>(b) the defendant is a \u201chealth professional or health facility.\u201d Despite this clear language, the majority does not address whether HVR is a \u201chealth professional or health facility.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Nevertheless, I believe that HVR is a \u201chealth professional\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 2912b. I reach this conclusion on the basis that plaintiff is seeking to hold HVR vicariously liable for its employee\u2019s alleged malpractice and such employee is unquestionably a \u201chealth professional.\u201d In <em>Cox v Flint Bd of Hosp Managers, </em>467 Mich 1, 11; 651 NW2d 356 (2002), this Court explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>under the principle of vicarious liability, \u201cthe principal \u2018is only liable because the law creates a practical identity with his [agents] (Citation omitted.) Subsequently, in <em>Nippa v Botsford Gen Hosp (On Remand), </em>257 Mich App 387, 391-392; 668 NW2d 628 (2003), on remand from this Court for reconsideration in light of <em>Cox, </em>the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">For all practical purposes the hospital stands in the shoes of its agents (the doctors).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">Thus, we opine that with regard to vicarious liability, medical-malpractice law applicable to a physician is also applicable to the physician\u2019s hospital.... All procedural requirements are applicable to the hospital in the same manner and form as [they are to] the doctor .... This is so because the law creates a practical identity between a principal and an agent....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">. . . Vicarious liability imposes a legal fiction on defendant hospital providing that the principal is only liable because the law creates a practical identity with its agents .... The law treats the principal and the agent as sharing a single identity ... [<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Because, with regard to vicarious liability, \u201c[t]he law treats the principal and the agent as sharing a single identity,\u201d and because, in the instant case, plaintiff is seeking to hold HVR vicariously liable for its employee\u2019s alleged malpractice, and because such employee is unquestionably a \u201chealth professional\u201d entitled to a notice of intent, the law treats HVR as also being a \u201chealth professional\u201d entitled to a notice of intent.4 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>plaintiff was required to provide a notice of intent to HVR before commencing a medical malpractice action in accordance with \u00a7 2912b.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">B. SUFFICIENCY</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">As discussed above, \u00a7 2912b(l) provides, <em>\u201ca </em>person <em>shall not </em>commence an action alleging medical malpractice against a health professional or health facility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>unless </em>the person has given the health professional or health facility written notice under this section not less than 182 days before the action is commenced.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">In <em>Roberts II, </em>470 Mich at 700-701, this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-14\">Under MCL 600.2912b(4), a medical malpractice claimant is required to provide potential defendants with notice that includes a \u201cstatement\u201d of each of the statutorily enumerated categories of information. Although it is reasonable to expect that some of the particulars of the information supplied by the claimant will evolve as discovery and litigation proceed, the claimant is required to ... provide details that are <em>responsive </em>to the information sought by the statute and that are as <em>particularized </em>as is consistent with the early notice stage of the proceedings. .. . This is not an onerous task: all the claimant must do is specify what it is that she is <em>claiming </em>under each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the enumerated categories in \u00a7 2912b (4). Although there is no one method or format in which a claimant must set forth the required information, that information must, nevertheless, be specifically identified in an ascertainable manner within the notice. [Emphasis in the original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">In <em>Roberts II, </em>the plaintiff brought a medical malpractice action against a hospital, a professional corporation, an obstetrician, a physician\u2019s assistant, and an emergency room physician. This Court held that the plaintiff must \u201caver the specific standard of care that she <em>is claiming </em>to be applicable to each particular professional or facility that is named in the notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 692 (emphasis in the original). Because the notice of intent \u201cfail[ed] to indicate whether plaintiff was alleging that these defendants [the hospital and professional corporation] were vicariously or directly liable to her,\u201d the plaintiffs notice of intent failed to allege \u201ca standard specifically applicable to the defendant facilities . ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693. For this reason, <em>Roberts II </em>held that the notice of intent was insufficient as to the defendant hospital and the defendant professional corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In the instant case, the Court of Appeals similarly held that the notice of intent was insufficient as to HVK because it did not state the applicable standard of practice or care as is required by \u00a7 2912b(4) through (b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>1 agree. The notice of intent completely fails to indicate what standard of practice or care plaintiff believes is appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>cable to defendant HVR, and it does not indicate whether plaintiff is alleging that defendant HVR is directly or vicariously liable to him. Indeed, as the Court of Appeals held, \u201c[t]he standard of care completely fails to make any reference to defendant Huron Valley Radiology.\u201d <em>Potter, </em>278 Mich App at 284. In fact, the notice of intent as a whole only references HVR twice: once on the first page where it lists the health care professionals and entities to whom the notice of intent is intended to apply, and then again on the last page, where it lists the health care professionals and entities being notified of the action. Because the notice of intent does not contain a statement indicating what standard of practice or care is allegedly applicable to HVR, as is required by \u00a7 2912b (4) (b), I agree with the Court of Appeals that the notice of intent is insufficient as to defendant HVR.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Although the majority \u201cquestion[s] whether <em>Roberts II </em>was correctly decided,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 424 n 32,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it does not expressly overrule <em>Roberts II </em>because it concludes that this decision is not \u201cdispositive.\u201d It is not dispositive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>says the majority, because <em>\u201cRoberts II </em>opined that because there was confusion with regard to whether the claim was for direct or vicarious liability, the [professional corporation] was unable to understand the nature of the claims being asserted,\u201d but, \u201c[i]n the case before us, no such potential for confusion exists . . . <em>Ante </em>at 424 n 32. First, that is not what <em>Roberts II </em>held; rather, it held, 470 Mich at 693, 702, that because the plaintiffs notice of intent did not include a statement \u201cindicating] whether plaintiff was alleging that these defendants were vicariously or directly liable to her,\u201d \u201cplaintiff did not fulfill her obligation under \u00a7 2912b . . . .\u201d Second, as with <em>Roberts II, </em>a \u201cpotential for confusion,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 424 n 32, <em>does </em>exist here because HVR could be sued on the basis of either direct or vicarious liability, or both, and the notice of intent does not indicate on which basis plaintiff intended to sue HVR.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Furthermore, that <em>Roberts II </em>involved a situation in which the notice of intent may have implied that the plaintiff was seeking to hold the defendants directly liable, while the complaint implied that the plaintiff was seeking to hold the defendants vicariously liable, whereas in the instant case nothing can be implied from plaintiffs notice of intent regarding direct or vicarious liability, while the complaint seeks to hold HVR vicariously liable, is a distinction utterly without any significance in this case. The issue here is whether the <em>notice of intent </em>was sufficient as to HVR. Being a professional corporation, HVR could be sued on the basis of either direct liability or vicarious liability. See <em>Cox, </em>467 Mich at 11, stating that \u201c[a] hospital may be 1) directly liable for malpractice, through claims of negligence in supervision of staff physicians as well as selection and retention of medical staff, or 2) vicariously liable for the negligence of its agents.\u201d MCL 600.2912b(4)(b) requires the notice of intent to contain a statement of \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>applicable standard of practice or care alleged by the claimant.\u201d Obviously, the \u201capplicable standard of practice or care\u201d would depend on whether the claimant is suing the professional corporation on the basis of direct liability or vicarious liability. Accordingly, a notice of intent must indicate whether the claimant is suing the professional corporation on the basis of direct liability, vicarious liability, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The majority holds that \u201cwhen vicarious liability is the only claim asserted,\u201d it is unnecessary to \u201cspecifically set forth the legal theory of vicarious liability within the [notice of intent].\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 422. However, if the notice of intent does not indicate that the plaintiff is planning on suing the defendant professional corporation on the basis of vicarious liability, how will the defendant know that \u201cvicarious liability is the only claim asserted\u201d? The majority fails to recognize that the whole point of the exercise of a notice of intent is to apprise the defendant of the claims that the plaintiff plans to bring <em>before </em>a complaint is filed. Here, because the notice of intent was silent on the subject, HVR did not know until plaintiff filed his complaint that plaintiff was suing on the basis of vicarious liability. That is, HVR did not know what \u201cstandard of practice or care\u201d plaintiff was alleging that HVR breached until plaintiff filed his complaint against HVR. This is most clearly a violation of \u00a7 2912b(4)(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>The majority misunderstands the issue. Contrary to its contention, <em>ante </em>at 425, the issue is not whether HVR \u201ccould reasonably be held to comprehend the nature of the claims being asserted against it.\u201d Instead, as Justice YOUNG explains, <em>ante </em>at 446-447, the issue is whether the notice of intent \u201c (provide[s] details that are <em>responsive to </em>the information sought by the statute ....\u2019\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 446-447, quoting <em>Roberts II, </em>470 Mich at 701 (emphasis in the original). More specifically, the issue here is whether the notice of intent contains a statement of \u201c[t]he applicable standard of practice or care alleged by the claimant,\u201d as is required by \u00a7 2912b(4)(b). <em>Boodt v Borgess Med Ctr, </em>481 Mich 558, 560-561; 751 NW2d 44 (2008) (\u201cAlthough the instant notice of intent may conceivably have apprised [defendant] of the nature and gravamen of plaintiffs allegations, this is not the statutory standard; \u00a7 2912b(4)[b] requires something more.\u201d). Because the notice of intent at issue here did not contain a statement of the \u201capplicable standard of practice or care\u201d with regard to HVR, the notice of intent did not comply with \u00a7 2912b(4)(b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Alqv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>c.

The term \u201cshall\u201d \u201cdenote[s] a mandatory, rather than discretionary action.\u201d <em>Roberts I, </em>466 Mich at 65. The term \u201call\u201d exemplifies that each and every one of the statements required by \u00a7 2912b(4)(a) through (f) must be contained in the notice of intent. Therefore, only a notice of intent that is \u201cin compliance with section 2912b\u201d tolls the statute of limitations and a notice of intent must contain all of the statements required by \u00a7 2912b (a) through (f) in order to be \u201cin compliance with section 2912b.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Because, as discussed earlier, the notice of intent in this case does not contain the statements required by \u00a7 2912b (4) (a) and (b) with regard to HVR, it is not \u201cin compliance with section 2912b.\u201d Because the notice of intent is not \u201cin compliance with section 2912b,\u201d the notice of intent does not toll the statute of limitations. And because the period of limitations in a medical malpractice action is two years, MCL 600.5805(6), and the alleged malpractice in this case occurred on June 7, 2001, and the complaint was not filed until November 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>2003, the complaint was untimely filed, and the action against HVR is barred by the statute of limitations. Therefore, the action against HVR should be dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The Court of Appeals relied on <em>Kirkaldy v Rim, </em>478 Mich 581; 734 NW2d 201 (2007), to support its conclusion that a defective notice of intent tolls the statute of limitations, and thus a dismissal without prejudice is appropriate. However, this case is significantly distinguishable from <em>Kirkaldy. </em>In <em>Kirkaldy, </em>478 Mich at 586, this Court held that the filing of a complaint and a defective affidavit of merit tolls the statute of limitations until the affidavit of merit is successfully challenged. This is so because nothing in MCL 600.5856(a), which provides for tolling upon the filing of a complaint,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or MCL 600.2912d, which requires an affidavit of merit to be filed with a complaint,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> limits tolling to an affidavit that is in compliance with \u00a7 2912d. However, \u00a7 5856(d) <em>does </em>limit tolling to a notice of intent that is \u201cin compliance with section 2912b.\u201d Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>while the filing of a complaint and a defective affidavit of merit may toll the statute of limitations, the serving of a defective notice of intent does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Justice YOUNG contends that the statute of limitations was tolled with regard to HVR because, although the notice of intent was insufficient as to HVR, it was sufficient as to defendant Murry. That is, he concludes that as long as a notice of intent is sufficient as to <em>one </em>of the defendants, the statute of limitations is tolled as to <em>all </em>of the defendants. I respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">As discussed above, \u00a7 5856 provided at the time of the filing of the complaint, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">The statutes of limitations or repose are tolled:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">(d) If during the <em>applicable notice period under section 2912b, </em>a claim would be barred by the statute of limitations or repose, for not longer than a number of days equal to the number of days in the <em>applicable notice period </em>after the date <em>notice is given in compliance with section 2912b. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Justice YOUNG is correct that \u00a7 5856 does indicate that \u201cmore than one statute of limitations can be tolled .. . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 442. For example, if multiple defendants receive a notice of intent that is sufficient as to all of them, all of their statutes of limitations are tolled. However, this does not mean that \u201cmore than one statute of limitations\u201d is <em>always </em>tolled. Obviously, if there is only one defendant, only one statute of limitations would be tolled, and such a conclusion is not contrary to the reference in \u00a7 5856 to the \u201cstatutes of limitations.\u201d See MCL 8.3b, which provides that \u201cevery word importing the plural number may be applied and limited to the singular number.\u201d Similarly, concluding that a notice of intent only tolls the statute of limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>tions that applies to the defendant who has actually received a sufficient notice of intent, but not the statute of limitations that applies to the defendant who has <em>not </em>received such a notice, is also not inconsistent with the reference in \u00a7 5856 to the \u201cstatutes of limitations.\u201d Further, such a conclusion is required by the reference in \u00a7 5856(d) to \u201cthe applicable notice period under section 2912b,\u201d and \u201cthe applicable notice period after the date notice is given in compliance with section 2912b,\u201d because there is no \u201capplicable notice period under section 2912b,\u201d if the notice of intent is not \u201cin compliance with section 2912b.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">As discussed earlier, \u00a7 2912b states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person shall not commence an action alleging medical malpractice against a health professional or health facility unless the person has given the health professional or health facility written notice under this section not less than 182 days before the action is commenced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">(4) The notice given to a health professional or health facility under this section shall contain a statement of at least all of the following ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Accordingly, as this Court held in <em>Roberts I, </em>466 Mich at 64, a notice of intent only tolls the statute of limitations if the notice contains <em>all </em>the statements required by \u00a7 2912b(4). In addition, as this Court held in <em>Roberts II, </em>470 Mich at 692, the notice of intent must contain all of the statements required by \u00a7 2912b (4) as to <em>\u201ceach </em>particular [defendant] named in the notice.\u201d (Emphasis added.) That is, the notice of intent only tolls the statute of limitations as to each particular defendant if the notice contains all the statements required by \u00a7 2912b(4) as to each particular defendant. Thus, if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>notice of intent contains all the required statements as to the defendant physician, but does not contain all the required statements as to the defendant professional corporation, the statute of limitations would only be tolled as to the defendant physician because a notice \u201cin compliance with section 2912b\u201d has not been served on the defendant professional corporation and thus there is no \u201capplicable notice period\u201d as to the defendant professional corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Contrary to Justice YOUNG\u2019s contention, \u00a7 5856(d)\u2019s reference to \u201ca claim\u201d does not alter the outcome.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The language \u201ca claim\u201d must be read in context. To <em>which </em>\u201cclaim\u201d is \u00a7 5856(d) referring? When \u00a7 5856(d) is read in its entirety, it is clear that the \u201cclaim\u201d to which it is referring is the \u201cclaim\u201d that \u201cwould be barred by the statute of limitations\u201d \u201cduring the applicable notice period under section 2912b.\u201d However, \u201ca claim\u201d would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>not be \u201cbarred by the statute of limitations\u201d \u201cduring the applicable notice period under section 2912b\u201d where a sufficient notice of intent had not yet been served upon the defendant. Where a sufficient notice of intent had not yet been served upon the defendant, there would be no \u201capplicable notice period under section 2912b\u201d and, thus, there would be no claim that would be \u201cbarred by the statute of limitations\u201d \u201cduring the applicable notice period.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because I believe that \u201ca claim\u201d in \u00a7 5856(d) is referring to \u201ca claim\u201d that would be \u201cbarred by the statute of limitations\u201d \u201cduring the applicable notice period,\u201d and the claim against HVR would not have been \u201cbarred by the statute of limitations\u201d \u201cduring the applicable notice period\u201d (because there was no \u201capplicable notice period\u201d), I conclude that the statute of limitations was not tolled as to plaintiffs claim against HVR.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Moreover, under Justice Young\u2019s analysis, although HVR is not even entitled to a notice of intent because it is a professional corporation, he would hold that under \u00a7 5856(d) a notice of intent that does not comply with \u00a7 2912b tolls the statute of limitations applicable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>HVR. That is, he concludes that, although HVR is not entitled to a notice of intent, plaintiff still gets the benefit of notice of intent tolling. This conclusion, in which the defendant is denied the benefit of a notice of intent, and yet the plaintiff is afforded the benefit of an extended period of limitations, is illogical and inconsistent with the statute.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The whole reason for providing a plaintiff with notice of intent tolling is to compensate for the fact that he or she must file a notice of intent 182 days before filing a complaint. If, however, a plaintiff does not have to file a notice of intent and then wait 182 days before filing a complaint, why should the plaintiff be afforded 182 more days in which to file the complaint?</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Justice YOUNG observes that the \u201cmajority\u2019s analysis threatens to render the statutory notice procedure nugatory and undermines, if not overrules, this Court\u2019s precedent,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 432, and that it \u201cthreatens to deprive a named defendant of the notice that the statutory procedure is designed to provide,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 450. Although I agree with these observations, I believe that the same possibly can be said of Justice Young\u2019s own analysis.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He concludes that a notice of intent that is sufficient as to one defendant tolls the statute of limitations for all the defendants, regardless of how defec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>tive the notice of intent is as to these other defendants or whether these other defendants were even entitled to a notice of intent in the first place. That is, although \u00a7 2912b(4) and <em>Roberts II </em>clearly require the plaintiff to provide all defendants with a notice of intent that is sufficient as to each, and although \u00a7 5856(d) and <em>Roberts I </em>clearly limit tolling to notices that are \u201cgiven in compliance with section 2912b,\u201d Justice YOUNG concludes that a notice of intent that is clearly not \u201cin compliance with section 2912b\u201d as to multiple defendants nevertheless tolls the statute of limitations as to these defendants as long as at least one defendant is given a notice of intent that is \u201cin compliance with section 2912b.\u201d How are <em>other </em>defendants to receive the \u201cnotice that the statutory procedure is designed to provide\u201d?<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AX7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>D. RETROACTIVE AMENDMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Although the majority does not address this issue because it concludes that the notice of intent is sufficient, in <em>Bush v Shabahang, </em>484 Mich 156, 181 n 44; 772 NW2d 272 (2009), the majority concludes that, pursuant to MCL 600.2301, a plaintiff can simply amend a defective notice of intent and such amendment will \u201crelate back to the time that the original [notice of intent] was mailed\u201d or the courts alternatively can simply \u201cdisregard any error or defect\u201d in the notice of intent. I respectfully disagree. See <em>Bush, </em>484 Mich at 194-195 (MARKMAN, J., dissenting). MCL 600.2301 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">The court in which any action or proceeding is <em>pending, </em>has power to amend any process, pleading or proceeding in such action or proceeding, either in form or substance, for the furtherance of justice, on such terms as are just, at any time before judgment rendered therein. The court at every stage of the action or proceeding shall disregard any error or defect in the proceedings which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">As this Court explained in <em>Boodt, </em>481 Mich at 563 n 4, \u201c\u00a7 2301 only applies to pending actions.\u201d As discussed above, \u00a7 2912b(l) provides, \u201ca person <em>shall not commence an action </em>alleging medical malpractice against a health professional or health facility unless the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>has given the health professional or health facility written notice under this section not less than 182 days before the action is commenced.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 2912b(4) states that the \u201cnotice given to a health professional or health facility under this section <em>shall contain </em>a statement of at least <em>all </em>of the following ....\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, as we explained in <em>Boodt, </em>481 Mich at 562-563, \u201ca plaintiff cannot commence an action before he or she files a notice of intent that contains all the information required under \u00a7 2912b(4).\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Because plaintiffs notice of intent here did not contain all the information required under \u00a7 2912b (4) as to HVR, plaintiff could not have commenced a medical malpractice action against HVR.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Therefore, \u00a7 2301 is inapplicable, and plaintiff cannot retroactively amend the notice of intent and the courts cannot \u201cdisregard any error or defect\u201d in the notice of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">E. MAJORITY PROCEDURES</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">As noted in n 1 of this opinion, the majority addresses issues that are not even properly before it. In Docket No. 136336, plaintiff appealed the portion of the Court of Appeals decision that held that the notice of intent was defective as to HVR, and in Docket Nos. 136338 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>136339, defendants appealed the portion of the decision that held that the defective notice of intent tolled the statute of limitations, and thus that a dismissal without prejudice was appropriate, and the portion that held that the notice of intent was sufficient as to defendant Murry. In Docket No. 136336, we granted plaintiffs application <em>\u201climited </em>to the issue whether defendant Huron Valley Radiology, EC., is a \u2018health facility or agency\u2019 to which a plaintiff is required to provide notice under MCL 600.2912b(l).\u201d 482 Mich 1004 (2008) (emphasis added). In Docket Nos. 136338 and 136339, we held defendants\u2019 application in abeyance for plaintiffs application. 756 NW2d 85 (2008). Subsequently, in Docket No. 136336, we directed the parties to file briefs addressing \u201cwhether, if a defendant professional corporation is not an entity to whom notice is required to be provided under MCL 600.2912b, the applicable statute of limitations, MCL 600.5805(6), was nonetheless subject to statutory tolling provided in former MCL 600.5856(d).\u201d 483 Mich 922 (2009). However, we never asked the parties to address the sufficiency of the notice of intent as to either HVR or Murry. As a result, the parties did not, in fact, brief or argue these issues. See n 1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Thus, despite the fact that the parties have not had an opportunity to brief or argue these issues, and, indeed, despite the fact that the issue regarding the sufficiency of the notice of intent as to defendant Murry has been formally <em>obeyed, </em>the majority nonetheless addresses these issues and implicitly overrules <em>Roberts II </em>in the process.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The majority implicitly overrules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>Roberts II </em>by refusing to follow its holdings: (a) that a notice of intent must indicate whether the plaintiff is seeking to hold the defendant professional corporation vicariously or directly liable, and instead holding that as long as the plaintiff is only going to sue the defendant on the basis of vicarious liability it does not have to indicate this in the notice of intent; and (b) that a notice of intent must contain all the statements required by \u00a7 2912b(4), and instead holding that a notice of intent is sufficient as long as the defendant \u201ccould reasonably be held to comprehend the nature of the claims being asserted against it.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 425.

As this Court held in <em>Roberts I, </em>a defective notice of intent does not toll the statute of limitations. Because the complaint was filed more than two years after the alleged malpractice occurred, the action against HVR is time-barred. Accordingly, I would affirm the portions of the Court of Appeals opinion that held that the notice of intent was sufficient as to defendant Murry and insufficient as to defendant HVR, but reverse the portions that held that the defective notice of intent tolled the statute of limitations and thus that a dismissal without preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>dice was appropriate. The action against HVR should be dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-8\"> Despite this abeyance, and despite the fact that the parties have not been given an opportunity to brief or argue the issues raised in defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal (Docket Nos. 136338 and 136339), or even, given this Court\u2019s limited grant order, the issue raised in plaintiffs application for leave to appeal (the sufficiency of the notice of intent as to HVR), the majority addresses the issue raised in plaintiffs application and one of the issues raised in defendants\u2019 application (the sufficiency of the notice of intent as to Murry), and then announces that it is now denying defendants\u2019 application. Only because the majority addresses these issues in its opinion today do I also address these. Contrary to the majority\u2019s contention, <em>ante </em>at 409, neither one of the parties argued the sufficiency of the notice of intent in their briefs filed after this Court granted plaintiffs application limited to a different issue, and only the plaintiff briefly raised the sufficiency issue at oral arguments; defendants did not say anything at all regarding the issue (which was to be expected given that this Court had not granted leave on that issue). The majority contends that \u201c[djefendant [HVR] addressed the sufficiency of the NOI issue extensively in its brief on appeal.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 409 n 8. However, page one of defendant\u2019s brief states, \u201cThis brief concerns the singular issue of whether Appellee, HVR, is entitled to pre-suit notice pursuant to MCL 600.2912b(l).\u201d The only mention thereafter regarding the sufficiency issue is in the \u201cprocedural history\u201d section in which defendant describes its bases for its motion for summary disposition. There is no discussion of the sufficiency issue in defendant\u2019s \u201cArgument\u201d section of its brief. Finally, contrary to the majority\u2019s contention, <em>ante </em>at 409 n 8, defendant\u2019s prayer for relief does not \u201caskQ us to decide the remaining issues in plaintiffs application for leave to appeal.\u201d Instead, defendant expressly states that \u201cPlaintiff-Appellant\u2019s Application For Leave To Appeal should be denied.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\"> In the instant case, the services provided were unquestionably professional services rendered by a licensed health care professional, i.e., a radiologist, and thus the claims at issue here allege an action that occurred in the course of a professional relationship.

I also agree with him, <em>ante </em>at 435, that HVR is not a \u201chealth facility\u201d because it is not a clinical laboratory, a hospital, a nursing home, or any other type of facility listed in MCL 333.20106(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b512-10\"> After the Court of Appeals rendered its decision on remand from this Court, this Court denied leave to appeal. 469 Mich 1005 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b512-11\"> Justice Young concludes that the action against HVR is a medical malpractice action because plaintiff is seeking to hold HVR vicariously hable for the actions of one of its employees who is a health professional, but then overlooks vicarious liability in terms of determining whether HVR is entitled to a notice of intent. Because a medical malpractice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>action can only be brought against \u201c \u2018a person or entity who is or who holds himself or herself out to be a licensed health care professional, licensed health facility or agency, or an employee or agent of a licensed health facility or agency\u2019 who is engaging in or otherwise assisting in medical care and treatment,\u201d <em>Kuznar, </em>481 Mich at 177, quoting in part MCL 600.5838a(l), either Justice Young\u2019s position is inconsistent with <em>Kuznar </em>and \u00a7 5838a(l) or it is internally inconsistent. That is, pursuant to <em>Kuznar, </em>Justice Young must determine that HVR is a \u201chealth professional\u201d in order to conclude that this is a medical malpractice action; however, if he were to determine that HVR <em>is </em>a \u201chealth professional\u201d for purposes of concluding that HVR can be sued for medical malpractice, he could not then also determine that HVR is <em>not </em>a \u201chealth professional\u201d for purposes of concluding that HVR is not entitled to a notice of intent. It simply cannot be both ways. If HVR is subject to a medical malpractice action on the basis of vicarious liability, HVR is entitled to a notice of intent on the basis of vicarious liability. Contrary to Justice Young\u2019s contention, <em>ante </em>at 437, concluding that HVR is a \u201chealth professional\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2912b because plaintiff is seeking to hold HVR vicariously liable for the actions of one of its employees who is unquestionably a \u201chealth professional,\u201d is not inconsistent with Kuznar\u2019s conclusion that the defendant pharmacy in that case was not a \u201chealth professional\u201d because in <em>Kuznar </em>the plaintiff was seeking to hold the pharmacy vicariously liable for the actions of one of its employees who was unquestionably <em>not </em>a \u201chealth professional.\u201d That is, <em>Kuznar </em>did not involve the kind of case that we are dealing with here, in which the plaintiff is seeking to hold the defendant vicariously liable for the actions of its employee, who <em>is </em>unquestionably a \u201chealth professional.\u201d Indeed, Justice Young\u2019s position is inconsistent with prior caselaw. See, for example, <em>Roberts I, </em>466 Mich at 59, and <em>Roberts II, </em>470 Mich at 693, in which this Court held (in thoughtful opinions authored by Justice Young) that because the plaintiffs notice of intent was defective as to the professional corporation, the statute of limitations was not tolled. Why would it matter that the notice of intent was defective as to the professional corporation if a professional corporation is never entitled to a notice of intent in the first place?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\"> Defendant Murry argues that the notice of intent does not satisfy the requirements set forth in \u00a7 2912b(4)(b) through (d). Although I agree with the majority that the notice of intent is sufficient as to defendant Murry, I cannot say that I agree with the majority\u2019s analysis because it provides none. In my judgment, the notice of intent does satisfy \u00a7 2912b(4)(b) because it states, \u201cThe standard of care required Dr.[] Murry... to correctly read, interpret and report the correct results to the emergency room under the circumstances.\u201d In addition, the notice of intent does satisfy \u00a7 2912b(4)(c) and (d) because it states that defendant Murry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>\"failed to properly interpret the MRI images and convey accurate information to the emergency room physicians in charge of the patient that night.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b516-10\"> Specifically, the majority \u201cquestion[s] whether <em>Roberts II </em>was correctly decided because it adds a requirement not found in the language of the statute; namely, that statements be \u2018particularized.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 424 n 32. Despite the fact then that \u00a7 2912b(l) clearly requires a notice of intent to be sent to each defendant, and \u00a7 2912b(4) clearly requires the notice of intent to contain certain statements, the majority apparently would prefer to conclude that the notice of intent is not required to contain each of these statements as to each defendant. For example, the majority apparently would hold that if a plaintiff sues both a nurse and a physician for their own direct malpractice, as long as the notice of intent contains the required \u201capplicable standard of practice or care statement\u201d as to the nurse, the notice would be sufficient as to the physician as well. Fortunately, the majority leaves this issue for another day, one that hopefully will not arrive soon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b518-6\"> The majority concludes that HVR\u2019s claim that plaintiffs notice of intent was defective because it did not indicate whether plaintiff was planning on suing HVR on the basis of direct or vicarious liability is \u201ctroubling\u201d because HVR \u201copenly admits knowing and understanding that it is vicariously liable for the actions of its employee, Dr. Murry.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 423. What I find to be \u201ctroubling\u201d instead is that the majority ignores the significant distinction between (a) knowing and understanding that a professional corporation <em>may </em>be held vicariously liable for the actions of its employees; and (b) knowing and understanding that someone is planning on bringing a cause of action against the profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>sional corporation to hold that corporation vicariously liable for the actions of its employees. The majority erroneously equates knowledge of potential liability with knowledge of an imminent lawsuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\"> Although neither the parties nor the lower courts addressed this issue, the majority concludes that \u00a7 2912b does not \u201crequire!] a claimant to set forth the nature of the relationship between the parties to be sued.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 421. While I agree with the majority, <em>ante </em>at 421 n 28, that the notice need not allege the \u201cprecise nature of the relationship,\u201d i.e., whether there is an \u201cactual employment relationship with the [professional corporation] or... a complex independent contractor arrangement,\u201d the majority fails to recognize that \u00a7 2912b(4)(a) <em>does </em>require the notice of intent to contain a statement of the \u201cfactual basis for the claim. \u201d In this case, plaintiff sued multiple physicians, multiple professional corporations, and a hospital. %t, plaintiff\u2019s notice of intent nowhere includes a \u201cfactual basis for the claim\u201d against HVR. That is, the notice of intent does not even indicate that the reason that HVR is being sued is because HVR is where Murry was working at during the time of the alleged malpractice. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\u00a7 2912b(4)(a) requires the notice of intent to include the \u201cfactual basis for the claim,\u201d and the notice of intent at issue here did not include the fact that Murry was working at HVR at the time of the alleged malpractice, which, indeed, is one of the most important facts in a case in which the claim is based on vicarious liability, I also agree with Justice Young, <em>ante </em>at 447, that plaintiffs notice of intent fails to satisfy \u00a7 2912b(4)(a): Contrary to the majority, <em>ante </em>at 422 n 29, summarily naming \u201cHuron Valley Radiology as well as the three individual physicians and \u2018their employees or agents, actual or ostensible, thereof \u201d in the notice of intent does not indicate what the \u201cfactual basis for the claim\u201d is. Because I believe that the notice of intent does not satisfy the requirements set forth in \u00a7 2912b(4)(a) and (b), there is no need to address whether the notice of intent satisfies the other requirements of \u00a7 2912b (4), and the only reason that I even address \u00a7 2912b(4)(a) is to respond to the majority\u2019s incorrect conclusion that \u00a7 2912b(4) does not \u201crequire!] a claimant to set forth the nature of the relationship between the parties to be sued.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 421.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b520-10\"> The Legislature has since amended \u00a7 5856.

See <em>ante </em>at 443-444. In light of his view that a professional corporation that is not a \u201chealth facility\u201d is not entitled to a notice of intent, combined with his view that the amended version of \u00a7 5856 only tolls the statute of limitations if the defendant has received a sufficient notice of intent, Justice Young apparently would conclude that a notice of intent that is sufficient as to the defendant physician would toll the statute of limitations as to the defendant physician, but would not toll the statute of limitations as to the defendant professional corporation. Under this view, a plaintiff would have to serve the defendant physician with a notice of intent and wait 182 days to file suit against the defendant physician, but the plaintiff would have to go ahead and file suit against the defendant professional corporation before the period of limitations expired as to that corporation since the corporation would not be entitled to notice of intent tolling. Therefore, the plaintiff would have to file his medical malpractice action against the professional corporation before he filed a medical malpractice action against the physician, if the period of limitations would have expired within 182 days after the plaintiff served his notice of intent on the physician.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\"> For further discussion of this point, see my dissenting opinion in <em>Bush, </em>484 Mich at 192-193.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b526-7\"> Justice Young concludes that \u201cthere is no textual basis for restricting tolling to a single claim.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 442-443.

In other words, the statutes of limitations for <em>all </em>claims against <em>all </em>defendants in Michigan would seem to be tolled as long as one plaintiff files a proper notice of intent with one defendant. This could hardly have been the intent of the Legislature. Contrary to Justice Young\u2019s contention, <em>ante </em>at 443 n 24, there <em>is </em>a \u201ctextual basis for treating subsection (d) of the tolling statute differently than subsection (a) through (c) of the tolling statute.\u201d That is, as discussed above, subsection (d), unlike subsections (a) through (c), limits tolling to \u201ca claim [that] would be barred by the statute of limitations\u201d \u201cduring the applicable notice period\u201d if it were not for the \u201cnotice [that] is given in compliance with section 2912b.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b527-6\"> For the same reason that a notice of intent that does not comply with \u00a7 2912b does not toll the statute of limitations, a notice of intent that is not required by \u00a7 2912b does not toll the statute of limitations.

However, this interpretation would seem to create a trap for unwary plaintiffs because MCL 600.2912b(6) prohibits the \u201ctacking or addition of successive 182-day periods ....\u201d As this Court explained in <em>Mayberry v Gen Orthopedics, PC, </em>474 Mich 1, 3; 704 NW2d 69 (2005), \u201cSection 2912b(6) prohibits a plaintiff from giving presuit notice to a defendant multiple times in order to initiate multiple tolling periods that repeatedly extend the period of limitations.\u201d Accordingly, if a notice that was filed within 182 days before the period of limitations would have expired and that is sufficient as to the defendant physician but defective as to the defendant hospital tolls the statute of limitations as to both, and \u00a7 2912b requires dismissal as to the hospital (as a result of the defective notice), the plaintiffs next notice sent to the hospital would not toll the statute of limitations (as a result of \u00a7 2912b[6]), and thus the plaintiffs action against the hospital would then be barred by the statute of limitations (since there would be no way for the plaintiff to file a sufficient notice and then wait 182 days to file suit against the hospital without the benefit of <em>another </em>182-day tolling period). That is, what Justice Young gives with one hand (defective notice tolls), he takes away with the other hand (defective notice requires dismissal and plaintiff cannot refile). Assuming that Justice Young\u2019s response to this conundrum is that the original complaint tolls the statute of limitations applicable to the hospital, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>\u00a7 5856(a) (although the complaint has been dismissed against the hospital), he would then create a situation in which a plaintiff would have absolutely no incentive to file a notice that complies with \u00a7 2912b as to the hospital or any other defendant as long as he files a notice that complies with \u00a7 2912b as to one defendant, because the statute of limitations would presumably be tolled indefinitely by the complaint that has not been dismissed. The plaintiff would then apparently have an unlimited period of time in which to file a sufficient notice and to refile the complaint against the remaining defendants (or at least until all the claims were dismissed or otherwise adjudicated).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b530-6\"> For further discussion of <em>Boodt, </em>see my dissenting opinion in <em>Bush, </em>484 Mich at 195, 199-200.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b530-7\"> In <em>Bush, </em>484 Mich 170 n 26, the majority mischaracterized <em>Boodt </em>as holding that \u201cbecause no tolling was afforded in the presence of a defect pursuant to \u00a7 5856(d), the plaintiffs action was not commenced under \u00a7 2912b(l).\u201d However, it was not the lack of tolling that prevented the plaintiffs action from commencing, it was the lack of a notice of intent in compliance with \u00a7 2912b.

For illustrations of this phenomenon, see e.g., <em>Vanslembrouck v Halperin, </em>483 Mich 965 (2009), in which the new majority ignored <em>Vega v Lakeland Hosps, </em>479 Mich 243, 244; 736 NW2d 561 (2007); <em>Hardacre v Saginaw Vascular Services, PC, </em>483 Mich 918 (2009), in which it failed to follow <em>Boodt, </em>481 Mich 558; <em>Sazima v Shepherd Bar &amp; Restaurant, </em>483 Mich 924 (2009), in which it failed to follow <em>Chrysler v Blue Arrow Transport Lines, </em>295 Mich 606; 295 NW 331 (1940), and <em>Camburn v Northwest School Dist (After Remand), </em>459 Mich 471; 592 NW2d 46 (1999); <em>Juarez v Holbrook, </em>483 Mich 970 (2009), in which it failed to follow <em>Smith v Khouri, </em>481 Mich 519; 751 NW2d 472 (2008); <em>Beasley v Michigan, </em>483 Mich 1025 (2009), in which the majority failed to follow <em>Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, </em>477 Mich 197; 731 NW2d 41 (2007); <em>Scott v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, </em>483 Mich 1032 (2009), in which the majority failed to enforce <em>Thornton v Allstate Ins Co, </em>425 Mich 643; 391 NW2d 320 (1986), and <em>Putkamer v Transamerica Ins Corp of America, </em>454 Mich 626; 563 NW2d 683 (1997); and <em>Chambers v Wayne Co Airport Auth, </em>483 Mich 1081 (2009), in which the majority again failed to abide by <em>Rowland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Chief Justice Kelly contends that \u201cthe accusation that the Court has been ignoring precedent is incorrect.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 429. As Justice CORRIGAN explained in <em>Beasley, </em>483 Mich at 1029-1030 (CORRIGAN, J., dissenting), in response to this same contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">Chief Justice Kelly attempts to explain away the new majority\u2019s actions hy sharing her views regarding the prior caselaw that the new majority has otherwise chosen to ignore. But Chief Justice Kelly\u2019s interpretation of a prior case in a concurring statement is not a decision of the Court. More importantly, her argument overlooks the fundamental problem: the new majority\u2019s continuing failure to explain its apparent disregard of this Court\u2019s precedent undermines the predictability and stability of the rule of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">[T]he new majority offers no articulable reasons whatsoever for its apparent detours from stare decisis. Instead, the majority declines to explain whether \u2014 and, if so, why \u2014 it is overruling precedent despite the obvious appearance that it is doing so. If it intends to alter legal principles embedded in this Court\u2019s decisions, then the new majority should explain its reasons clearly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>intelligibly. Instead, the new majority overrules by indirection, or at least leaves the impression that it is doing so, thereby sowing the seeds of confusion and making it difficult for the citizens of this state to comprehend precisely what our caselaw requires. This appears to be an unfortunate return to our predecessors\u2019 past practice of \u201cfrequently palying] little attention to the inconsistencies among its cases and declin[ing] to reduce confusion in [the Court\u2019s] jurisprudence by overruling conflicting decisions.\u201d <em>Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>473 Mich 562, 571 n 19 (2005).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">See also <em>Rowland, </em>477 Mich at 226-227 (Markman, J., concurring), for further discussion of the penchant of some justices to ignore inconvenient precedents, thereby \u201c[leaving] intact precedents that were inconsistent with new decisions, essentially allowing future litigants to choose among inconsistent precedents as in columns A and B of a Chinese restaurant menu.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">In the end, there is no shortcut to resolving whether the majority or the dissenting justices are correct in their characterizations of what the majority is doing. We can only identify what we believe to be the questionable decisions of the majority, identify the relevant precedents, and invite the reader to reach his or her own conclusions. <em>[Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 392 n 47 (Markman, J. dissenting).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
