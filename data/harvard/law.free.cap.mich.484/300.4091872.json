J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_m\">We granted leave to appeal in this case to determine the parties against whom attorney fees may be prorated under MCL 418.315(1). We conclude that the term \u201cprorate\u201d in MCL 418.315(1) applies only to employers and their insurance carriers. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">This case involves a dispute over workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Plaintiff Rick Petersen began working <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>for codefendant Koleasco, a trucking company, in February 1997. In March 1997, Koleasco hired codefendant BCN Transportation Services (BCN), a human resources \u201cemployee leasing\u201d company, to administer its employee benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">In November 1997, plaintiff was injured when he fell from a flatbed truck while securing a load of Christmas trees. After the accident, he underwent surgery on his right foot and applied for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The following year, he required treatment for back pain, which his treating physician believed was caused by the November 1977 fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Several questions were taken to a workers\u2019 compensation magistrate: (1) who was plaintiffs employer at the time of his injury, BCN or Koleaseco? (2) was Midwest Employers Casualty Company the relevant insurer for workers\u2019 compensation purposes? (3) was plaintiff disabled? and (4) if so, which injury caused his disability? The magistrate bifurcated these issues into two trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In the first trial, the magistrate ruled that plaintiff was a Koleaseco employee on the date of his injury despite the fact that BCN paid his wages. Thus, because BCN had stipulated that it was plaintiffs employer, the magistrate ruled that both BCN and Koleaseco were plaintiffs employers and both were liable for plaintiffs workers\u2019 compensation benefits. On appeal, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appellate Commission (WCAC) affirmed that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">In the second trial, the magistrate considered (1) was plaintiffs counsel entitled to an attorney fee of 30 percent of plaintiffs medical bills unpaid by defendant? and (2) who was responsible for paying plaintiffs future medical and weekly benefits? With respect to plaintiffs attorney fees, the magistrate ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>[Although Midwest... was paying the plaintiff weekly benefits, it refused to pay medical bills related to [plaintiffs] injury.... The total amount of the medical bills incurred... which defendant refused to pay is $153,448.54.1 find that plaintiffs counsel is entitled to a 30 percent attorney fee for these unpaid medical bills under Section 315(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">With respect to whether BCN or Koleaseco was responsible for paying plaintiffs ongoing medical and weekly benefits, the magistrate ruled that BCN and its insurance carrier, Midwest, were primarily responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Again, both parties appealed to the WCAC, which affirmed the award of attorney fees, observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">While the magistrate failed to explicitly so find, in this case ... defendant knew of the medical bills in question well in advance of trial, and simply refused to pay them claiming they were not work related. Once the magistrate so found, given that prior knowledge and refusal to pay, the action in awarding attorney fees was within his discretion and hence proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Magna Corporation, another \u201cemployee leasing\u201d company insured by Midwest, and Midwest sought leave to appeal both WCAC orders. The Court of Appeals initially denied the applications.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We remanded the case for consideration as on leave granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">On remand, the Court of Appeals affirmed the WCAC.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court found that competent evidence supported the factual findings of both the magistrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>and the WCAC with respect to plaintiffs employment. Regarding the assessment of attorney fees, the Court held that \u00a7 315(1) is ambiguous because it does not identify the entity against which the magistrate may assess such fees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The Court concluded, \u201c[W]here the remainder of [\u00a7 315(1)] discusses the employer and/or the [insurance] carrier, it follows that the attorney fees are to be calculated or divided between those entities. The plain language of the statute does not mandate that the health care provider assume responsibility for any portion of those fees.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We granted leave to appeal to consider the proper interpretation of \u00a7 315(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">II. MCL 418.315(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The proper interpretation and application of a statute presents a question of law that we review de novo.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> MCL 418.315(1), part of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (WDCA),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">The employer shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to an employee who receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment, reasonable medical, surgical, and hospital services and medicines, or other attendance or treatment recognized by the laws of this state as legal, when they are needed.... After 10 days from the inception of medical care as provided in this section, the employee may treat with a physician of his or her own choice by giving to the employer the name of the physician and his or her intention to treat with the physician. The <em>employer or the employer\u2019s carrier </em>may file a petition objecting to the named physician selected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>by the employee and setting forth reasons for the objection. If <em>the employer or carrier </em>can show cause why the employee should not continue treatment with the named physician of the employee\u2019s choice,... the ... magistrate may order that the employee discontinue treatment with the named physician or pay for the treatment received from the physician.... If the employer fails, neglects, or refuses so to do, the employee shall be reimbursed for the reasonable expense paid by the employee, or payment may be made in behalf of the employee to persons to whom the unpaid expenses may be owing, by order of the workers\u2019 compensation magistrate. <em>The workers\u2019 compensation magistrate may prorate attorney fees at the contingent fee rate paid by the employee. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">A. STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">This is a case of statutory interpretation. The primary goal of such interpretation is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The first step in ascertaining such intent is to focus on the language of the statute itself. If statutory language is unambiguous, the Legislature is presumed to have intended the meaning expressed in the statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The words of a statute provide the most reliable evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent, and as far as possible, effect should be given to every phrase, clause, and word in a statute.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the statutory language is certain and unambiguous, judicial construction is neither required nor permitted, and courts must apply the statute as written.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">However, when statutory language is ambiguous, this Court has consistently held that a court construing it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>may go beyond the plain language of the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In fact, where the language leaves the statute\u2019s meaning ambiguous, it is the duty of the courts to construe it, giving it an interpretation that is reasonable and sensible.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, a finding of ambiguity has important interpretive ramifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">In this case, the Court of Appeals held that the last sentence of \u00a7 315(1) is ambiguous in that it is unclear who is responsible for an injured employee\u2019s attorney fees. Thus, the threshold question is whether, in light of the plain language of the entire provision, the last sentence of \u00a7 315(1) is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Section 315(1) gives magistrates the discretionary authority to prorate attorney fees at the contingent fee rate paid by the employee. \u201cProrate\u201d means \u201cto divide, distribute, or calculate proportionately.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In \u00a7 315(1), the term \u201cprorate\u201d could reasonably apply to employers, their insurance carriers, health care providers, employees seeking workers\u2019 compensation benefits, or to any combination of them. Moreover, neither \u00a7 315 as a whole nor any other provision of the WDCA indicates the parties to whom a division or distribution of attorney fees applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">I agree with the Court of Appeals conclusion that the final sentence of \u00a7 315(1) applies only to employers and their insurance carriers. This is because that interpretation harmonizes the final sentence with the remainder of \u00a7 315(1). The final sentence does not stand alone.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>must be construed in the context of \u00a7 315(1) in its entirety and harmonized with the statute\u2019s other provisions to satisfy the purpose intended by the Legislature.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Here is how that construction operates. Section 315(1) concerns employer liability to pay medical benefits to workers injured in the course of employment. The statute as a whole provides a process for employers and their insurance carriers to object to the medical treatment that an injured employee seeks. Hence, \u201cprorate\u201d in the final sentence of \u00a7 315(1), when read with the remainder of the statute, applies to the parties who might contest the payment of medical benefits: employers and their insurance carriers.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This interpretation unifies the last sentence of \u00a7 315(1) with the remainder of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">I now consider the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cmay\u201d with respect to prorating attorney fees. The word \u201cmay\u201d is permissive in nature. As applied to \u201cprorate,\u201d \u201cmay\u201d indicates that magistrates have discretion in determining whether to award attorney fees. Hence, magistrates are allowed to award attorney fees, but they are not required to do so.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Likewise, the word \u201cmay\u201d bears on whether a proration must occur if a magistrate does award attorney fees. I would hold that the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d grants magistrates the discretion to prorate attorney fees among employers and their insurance carriers. Should a magistrate determine that only one of those parties is liable, the magistrate may impose attorney fees against only that party. Conversely, should the magistrate find multiple parties liable, fees may be prorated accordingly. This interpretation affords the phrase \u201cmay prorate\u201d its full meaning.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Nonetheless, as evidenced by the dissents in this case, competing reasonable interpretations of \u00a7 315(1) exist when its language alone is considered.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In fact, the words of \u00a7 315(1), in light of the entire statute and the WDCA, do not clearly indicate the parties to whom a proration of attorney fees applies. As a consequence, I am unable to ascertain the intent of the Legislature based solely on the language of the statute. I turn next to the question whether \u00a7 315(1) is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">1. <em>LANSING MAYOR v PUB SERVICE COMM</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">This Court\u2019s most recent pronouncement on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>proper standard for discerning whether statutory language is ambiguous was espoused in <em>Lansing Mayor v Pub Service Comm.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In that case, the Court examined MCL 247.183 to determine whether it required a company to obtain local government consent before beginning pipeline construction. Critical to the Court\u2019s analysis was its discussion of the proper method for discerning statutory ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">The Court stated that statutory provisions are not ambiguous unless one \u201cirreconcilably conflicts\u201d with another or unless a term is \u201cequally susceptible to more than a single meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Applying this definition, the <em>Lansing Mayor </em>majority observed that \u201c[o]nly a few provisions are truly ambiguous.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\"><em>Lansing Mayor\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d is unsupported by any Michigan law whatsoever, having been derived, as it were, from thin air.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Rusinek v Schultz, Snyder &amp; Steele Lumber Co </em>is the only Michigan case predating <em>Lansing Mayor </em>that employs the language \u201cequally susceptible.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> However, <em>Rusinek </em>did not state that language is ambiguous only if it is equally susceptible to different interpretations. Instead, <em>Rusinek </em>simply held that statutes in derogation of common law must be strictly construed.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Also unsupported as a threshold for finding ambiguity is the \u201cirreconcilably conflicts with another provision\u201d language found in <em>Lansing Mayor. </em>The <em>Lansing Mayor </em>majority cited <em>Klapp v United Ins Group Agency, Inc</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for this definition of \u201cambiguity,\u201d but <em>Klapp </em>simply states that language is ambiguous when \u201cits provisions are capable of conflicting interpretations.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It neither requires an irreconcilable conflict nor that the language be equally susceptible to more than one interpretation. Thus, the two-pronged \u201cequally susceptible\u201d and \u201cirreconcilably conflicts\u201d test adopted in <em>Lansing Mayor </em>has no basis in Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Furthermore, the <em>Lansing Mayor </em>majority made two explicit and glaring misstatements of law. First, it cited <em>Klapp </em>for the proposition that a finding of \u201cambiguity is a finding of last resort.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>Klapp </em>did not say this. Instead, <em>Klapp </em>held that the rule of <em>contra proferentem.</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is a rule of last resort. Indeed, <em>Klapp </em>concluded that the language at issue in that case was ambiguous, without commenting on whether such a conclusion was a \u201cgood\u201d or a \u201cbad\u201d thing.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Wholly absent from <em>Klapp, </em>or other Michigan law, is any indication that consideration of whether language is ambiguous should be given only as a last resort.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Second, I note that the <em>Lansing Mayor </em>majority expressly rejected the \u201creasonable minds\u201d standard for discerning ambiguity as applied by the dissent in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>case. The majority stated \u201c[t]hat is not, and has never been, the standard either for resolving cases or for ascertaining the existence of an ambiguity in the law.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> However, the Court cited no authority for this proposition. In fact, this holding was a blatant misstatement of the law.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Because it was based on a mythical definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d and egregious misstatements of law, I reject <em>Lansing Mayor\u2019s </em>standard for discerning statutory ambiguity.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">i. STARE DECISIS<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Because I conclude that <em>Lansing Mayor\u2019s </em>definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>of \u201cambiguous\u201d is unsupported by Michigan law, I must now determine whether it ought to remain the controlling method for discerning ambiguity in the laws of this state. I treat the definition as governed by stare decisis for purposes of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Stare decisis is short for <em>stare decisis et non quieta movere, </em>which means \u201cstand by the thing decided and do not disturb the calm.\u201d Stare decisis attempts to balance two competing considerations: the need of the community for stability in legal rules and decisions and the need of courts to correct past errors.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This doctrine has been part of the American legal landscape since the country\u2019s formation.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Alexander Hamilton wrote that, to \u201cavoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that [courts] should be bound down by strict rules and precedents which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>them ... .\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In the early twentieth century, Justice (then-Judge) Cardozo wrote that the \u201clabor of judges would be increased almost to the breaking point if every past decision could be reopened in every case, and one could not lay one\u2019s own course of bricks on the secure foundation of the courses laid by others who had gone before him.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Although any rule is only as solid as its boundaries are clear, it was not until recently that this Court formally established a test to determine when it should depart from stare decisis. In 2000, in <em>Robinson v Detroit,</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court held that the first question in deciding whether to overrule precedent is whether an earlier decision was wrongly decided.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Next, according to <em>Robinson, </em>courts should review (1) whether the decision defies practical workability, (2) whether reliance interests would work an undue hardship if the decision were overturned, and (3) whether changes in the law or facts no longer justify the decision.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Thus, <em>Robinson </em>enunciated a test premised on whether the questioned decision was wrongly decided, to be followed by a three-pronged analysis of whether stare decisis nonetheless counsels upholding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Although the <em>Robinson </em>test was implemented as a mechanism for determining when a prior decision of the Court should be upheld, its application has proven superficial and cursory.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In fact, an examination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>cases applying the <em>Robinson </em>test demonstrates that <em>not once </em>has the Court cited it as a basis for upholding a prior decision.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>statement that a wrongly decided case should \u201cinvariably\u201d be overruled was a chilling signal that a conclusion that precedent has been wrongly decided is sufficient justification for overruling it.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">These facts alone suffice to show that <em>Robinson </em>is insufficiently respectful of precedent. Therefore, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>would modify it by shifting the balance back in favor of precedent and expanding on <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>list of factors to consider in applying stare decisis.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">I would hold that a stare decisis analysis should always begin with the presumption that upholding the precedent involved is the preferred course of action. The presumption should be retained until effectively rebutted by the conclusion that a compelling justification exists to overturn the precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\"><em>Robinson, </em>by contrast, contained no such presumption. Moreover, the Court\u2019s applications of <em>Robinson </em>suggest that such a presumption was never considered. Even if it had been initially applied, once a case was deemed to have been wrongly decided, any presumption in favor of upholding precedent disappeared.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark>1 would reject this approach and reiterate that a rebuttable presumption exists in favor of upholding precedent.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The question arises what deference should be paid to cases in which <em>Robinson </em>was used to overturn existing precedent. I believe that a lower level of deference should be accorded to these cases because they represent a departure from the traditional notions of stare decisis. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>Adarand Constructors, Inc v Pena,</em><footnotemark><em>49</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the United States Supreme Court expressly addressed the distinction between consideration of well-established law and cases representing a recent departure from precedent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">It is worth pointing out the difference between the applications of <em>stare decisis </em>in this case and in <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa v Casey. Casey </em>explained how considerations of <em>stare decisis </em>inform the decision whether to overrule a long-established precedent that has become integrated into the fabric of the law. Overruling precedent of that kind naturally may have consequences for \u201cthe ideal of the rule of law.\u201d In addition, such precedent is likely to have engendered substantial reliance, as was true in <em>Casey </em>itself. (\u201c[F]or two decades of economic and social developments, people have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail.\u201d). But in this case, as we have explained, we do not face a precedent of that kind, because <em>Metro Broadcasting </em>itself <em>departed </em>from our prior cases \u2014 and did so quite recently. By refusing to follow <em>Metro Broadcasting, </em>then, we do not depart from the fabric of the law; we restore it. We also note that reliance on a case that has recently departed from precedent is likely to be minimal, particularly where, as here, the rule set forth in that case is unlikely to affect primary conduct in any event[<footnotemark>50</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Furthermore, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">Our past practice in similar situations supports our action today. In <em>United States v Dixon, </em>we overruled the recent case of <em>Grady v Corbin, </em>because <em>Grady </em>\u201clack[ed] constitutional roots\u201d and was \u201cwholly inconsistent with earlier Supreme Court precedent.\u201d In <em>Solorio v United States, </em>we overruled <em>O\u2019Callahan v Parker, </em>which had caused \u201cconfusion\u201d and had rejected \u201can unbroken line of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>decisions from 1866 to 1960.\u201d And in <em>Continental TV, Inc v GTE Sylvania Inc, </em>we overruled <em>United States v Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co, </em>which was \u201can abrupt and largely unexplained departure\u201d from precedent, and of which \u201c[t]he great weight of scholarly opinion ha[d] been critical.\u201d See also, <em>e.g., Payne v Tennessee </em>(overruling <em>Booth v Maryland, </em>and <em>South Carolina v Gathers, Monell v New York City Dept of Social Servs </em>(partially overruling <em>Monroe v Pape, </em>because <em>Monroe </em>was a \u201cdeparture from prior practice\u201d that had not engendered substantial reliance); <em>Swift &amp; Co v Wickham </em>(overruling <em>Kesler v Department of Public Safety of Utah, </em>to reaffirm \u201cpre- <em>Kesler </em>precedent\u201d and restore the law to the \u201cview. . . which this Court has traditionally taken\u201d in older cases).[<footnotemark>51</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Thus, there is substantial support for applying a decreased presumption in favor of precedent when that precedent itself represents a recent departure from prior established caselaw.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The next inquiry should be whether there exists a compelling justification for overruling precedent.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> A com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>pelling justification is <em>not </em>a mere belief that a precedential case was wrongly decided or that the Court, as currently composed, would have decided the case differently. Rather, in determining whether a compelling justification exists, the Court should consider several evaluative criteria, none of which, standing alone, is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">These criteria include, but are not limited to: (1) whether the rule has proven to be intolerable because it defies practical workability, (2) whether reliance on the rule is such that overruling it would cause a special hardship and inequity, (3) whether related principles of law have so far developed since the rule was pronounced that no more than a remnant of the rule has survived, (4) whether facts and circumstances have so changed, or come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the old rule of significant application or justification, (5) whether other jurisdictions have decided similar issues in a different manner, (6) whether upholding the rule is likely to result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests, and (7) whether the prior decision was an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Not all of these factors will be applicable in every case. Nor is there a magic number of factors that must favor overruling a case in order to establish the requisite compelling justification. Rather, I believe that the conclusion about whether these factors support finding a compelling justification should be reached on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">ii. APPLICATION OF STARE DECISIS TO <em>LANSING MAYOR</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">As stated above, I begin my stare decisis analysis with a presumption in favor of upholding precedent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Only if a compelling justification exists should the Court overrule the prior decision. Although <em>Lansing Mayor </em>was wrongly decided with respect to the definition of \u201cambiguity,\u201d this fact does not constitute the requisite compelling justification to overrule it. Instead, we must examine additional factors to determine whether there exists a compelling justification to overrule it.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">First, I consider whether the method for discerning ambiguity in <em>Lansing Mayor </em>has proven intolerable because it defies practical workability. I believe that it does. Intrinsically, an analytical approach to interpreting statutes on the basis of their \u201cplain meaning,\u201d where reasonable minds disagree on what that meaning is, is unworkable. This standard gives judges unfettered discretion to pick and choose among available \u201cplain meanings\u201d or dictionary definitions, and thus sheds little light on what the Legislature intended statutory language to mean.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> It also potentially leads to arbitrary outcomes and injects instability into the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Moreover, the mere fact that different justices of this Court, judges of the Court of Appeals, and trial judges disagree on the meaning of statutory language suggests that ambiguity exists. Allowing a judge to pick one meaning among sever\u00e1l equally plausible meanings without using the rules of statutory construction is quite simply an exercise in speculation. As Justice Stevens of the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">[T]he \u201cminimalist\u201d judge who holds that the purpose of [a] statute may be learned only from its language retains greater discretion than the judge who will seek guidance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>from every reliable source. A method of statutory interpretation that is deliberately uninformed, and hence unconstrained, increases the risk that the judge\u2019s own policy preferences will affect the decisional process.[<footnotemark>55</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">I share Justice Stevens\u2019s concerns and believe that <em>Lansing Mayor\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d is inherently unworkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">I also note that application of <em>Lansing Mayor\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d has never once led the Court to find statutory language ambiguous.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> If a rule of statutory interpretation inevitably leads to the same result in each case in which it is applied, such a rule is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>innately unworkable. Accordingly, this factor weighs strongly in favor of abrogating the <em>Lansing Mayor </em>definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Second, I examine whether reliance on the rule is such that overruling it would cause a special hardship and inequity. I believe that litigants have reasonably relied on <em>Lansing Mayor\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cambiguity.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Its application potentially leads to a different statutory interpretation than one based on alternative definitions. Hence, I conclude that rejecting the definition may prejudice current litigants who have relied on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">However, I also recognize that litigants have continued to rely on previous standards for discerning ambiguity. This reliance is also reasonable given the inconsistent application of <em>Lansing Mayor\u2019s </em>definition,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> as well as the disagreement over the proper definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u201cambiguity\u201d among the justices of this Court.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Such reliance is not surprising given that <em>Lansing Mayor\u2019s </em>definition is so vastly different from the definitions of \u201cambiguity\u201d that preceded it for more than 150 years.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> In fact, despite its explicit holding, <em>Lansing Mayor </em>did not overrule or cite <em>any </em>previous cases that addressed the proper method for discerning ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Nevertheless, because <em>Lansing Mayor </em>stands as the most recent declaration of how to discern statutory ambiguity, litigants reasonably relied on it for this point. I therefore conclude that this factor weighs moderately in favor of upholding the definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Third, I consider whether related principles of law have so far developed since the <em>Lansing Mayor </em>definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d was pronounced that only a remnant of the definition has survived. This factor is inapplicable to the stare decisis analysis in this case. The definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d is a tool of judicial construction. Its only relevance is to discern ambiguity or the lack of it in a given statute. Thus, the definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d stands alone and is not inherently related to other principles of law. Accordingly, this factor weighs neither in favor of nor against replacing the <em>Lansing Mayor </em>definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Fourth, I examine whether facts and circumstances have so changed, or have come to be seen so differently, as to rob the old definition of significant justification. This factor focuses on real-world practicalities.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>ever, the definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d is not beholden to the underlying facts and circumstances of a given case. Accordingly, because the definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d does not implicate practical concerns, I do not believe that this factor weighs in favor of or against replacing the <em>Lansing Mayor </em>definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Fifth, I consider whether other jurisdictions have decided similar issues in a different manner. My review indicates that <em>Lansing Mayor\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d is unsupported by any other jurisdiction. In fact, not a single jurisdiction, state or federal, requires an irreconcilable conflict between provisions or that language be equally susceptible to more than one meaning before finding statutory ambiguity.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Accordingly, this factor weighs strongly in favor of rejecting the <em>Lansing Mayor </em>definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">I note that the sixth factor, whether upholding the <em>Lansing Mayor </em>definition is likely to result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests, has no bearing on this case. As previously stated, the definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d is merely a tool of statutory interpretation. As such, its application has no relevance to public interests because the definition of \u201cambiguity,\u201d standing alone, does not dictate any course of action in a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Finally, I consider whether the prior decision was an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from precedent. As noted earlier, <em>Lansing Mayor\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d is nothing more than a legal fiction, wholly unsupported by <em>any </em>law. Furthermore, it represented a decisive and abrupt shift from precedent without recognition of the prior standards for discerning statutory ambiguity. Accordingly, this factor weighs heavily in favor of abrogating <em>Lansing Mayor\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cambiguity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Under my analysis of the aforementioned factors, <em>Lansing Mayor\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d has proven unworkable, is unsupported by other jurisdictions, and represents an abrupt and unexplained departure from precedent. Although it has been relied on in Michigan, reliance has been uneven and short-lived. Accordingly, I conclude that a compelling justification exists for replacing it.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>2. THE PROPER METHOD OF DISCERNING AMBIGUITY</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Having rejected the <em>Lansing Mayor </em>definition of \u201cambiguity,\u201d I now iterate the proper method of discerning statutory ambiguity. Before <em>Lansing Mayor </em>was decided, Michigan courts used several analogous variations of statutory interpretation. For example, in <em>In re MCI Telecom </em>Complaint,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> we held that \u201c[s]hould a statute be ambiguous on its face ... so that reasonable minds could differ with respect to its meaning, judicial construction is appropriate to determine the meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> This Court has applied the \u201creasonable minds\u201d standard on numerous other occasions.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>This Court has also employed a \u201cdoubtful\u201d standard in deciding whether ambiguity exists. In <em>Smith v Grand Rapids City Comm,</em><footnotemark><em>67</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we held that \u201c[w]here . . . the language of a statute is of doubtful meaning, the court should give it a reasonable construction looking to the purpose to be subserved thereby, and the object sought to be accomplished and its occasion and necessity.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Finally, this Court has used a \u201csusceptible\u201d standard. Applying this method of interpretation, we held that \u201c[i]t is only where a statute is unclear and susceptible to more than one interpretation that judicial construction is allowed.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> These corresponding approaches to evaluating statutes for ambiguity have endured in Michigan caselaw throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">These historical standards for discerning ambiguity are easily reconcilable and analogous. The crux of the \u201creasonable minds\u201d standard is that, when two persons reasonably afford different meanings to statutory language, it is ambiguous. As for the \u201cdoubtful\u201d standard, it suggests that a statute is ambiguous when its language is of questionable or unclear meaning. The \u201csusceptible\u201d standard is self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>explanatory in that, if a statute is susceptible to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">I adopt a definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d that encompasses all three of the aforementioned well-established standards for determining ambiguity.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Specifically, I would hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">[W]hen there can be reasonable disagreement over a statute\u2019s meaning, or, as others have put it, when a statute is capable of being understood by reasonably well-informed persons in two or more different senses, [a] statute is ambiguous. For example, this Court has concluded that statutes [are] ambiguous when one word in the statute has an unclear meaning, when a statute\u2019s interaction with another statute has rendered its meaning unclear, or when application of the statute to facts has rendered the correct application of the statute uncertain.[<footnotemark>72</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">This standard gleans the fundamental principles from the \u201creasonable minds,\u201d \u201cdoubtful,\u201d and \u201csusceptible\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>tests. It has been applied, in some variation, by every other state in the country,<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> all the federal circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>courts,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> and the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">B. APPLICATION TO \u00a7 315(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">I believe that \u00a7 315(1) is ambiguous because the statute is capable of being understood by reasonably well-informed persons in two or more different senses. As mentioned before, the term \u201cprorate\u201d could reasonably be understood to apply to employers, their insurance providers, health care providers, and to employees seeking workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Indeed, \u00a7 315 and the entire WDCA are entirely silent as to who, among these parties, is subject to a proration of attorney fees. Absent extra-textual sources, any determination of the Legislature\u2019s intent becomes a mere exercise in speculation. Thus, having found that \u00a7 315(1) is ambiguous, I may now look to extra-textual sources to aid in its interpretation.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>1. HARMONIZATION WITH THE WDCA</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">I seek an interpretation of \u00a7 315(1) that is in accord with the principles underlying the WDCA as a whole. The act is remedial in nature.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Thus, where ambiguity exists and judicial construction of the act is necessary, we construe the act\u2019s terms liberally to grant rather than deny benefits to injured workers.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> This canon of statutory construction is deeply embedded in both American and Michigan jurisprudence.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The WCAC has explicitly recognized the importance of holding employers and their insurance carriers responsible for a proration of attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 315(1). In <em>Harvlie v Jack Post Corp, </em>the WCAC stated, \u201c[T]he purpose of [the] attorney fee provisions ... is not merely to assure that a claimant\u2019s attorney is paid, but also <em>to deter employers from breaching their statutory duty to provide medical treatment to injured </em>workers.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">I find this reasoning persuasive and applicable to this case. If employers and their insurance carriers are not held accountable for a prorated share of attorney fees, they will have an incentive to deny medical benefits.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>They will be tempted to deny an injured employee\u2019s request for coverage in the hope that, in subsequent litigation, they will not be found liable. And even if they were found liable, they would be responsible only for actual medical expenses but not for attorney fees, despite their wrongful denial of valid claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Likewise, if injured workers were forced to pay a prorated portion of their own attorney fees, their ultimate recovery could be reduced below their actual costs of securing medical treatment. Such a result would violate the remedial goal of the WDCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">2. CASELAW HAS EMPLOYED SIMILAR REASONING</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Caselaw also supports my interpretation of \u00a7 315(1). I find persuasive the fact that every previous case that has analyzed \u00a7 315(1) with respect to the proration of attorney fees has employed reasoning similar to mine.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The Court of Appeals first considered the proration of attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 315(1) in <em>Boyce v Grand </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number><em>Rapids Asphalt Paving Co </em><footnotemark><em>82</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There, the plaintiff argued that his health care provider should be held responsible for a portion of his attorney fees. The Court rejected this argument, noting that a party does not become liable for attorney fees merely by accepting the benefits of an attorney\u2019s services.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> The Court also ruled that \u00a7 315(1) could be construed to require either the employer or its insurance carrier to pay a plaintiffs attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Finally, the Court noted that Administrative Rule 14 of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, which was in effect when the plaintiff was injured, precluded attorneys from recovering a percentage fee for accrued medical services.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> The Court questioned the soundness of Rule 14, noting that requiring employers or insurance carriers to pay attorney fees when they refuse to pay mandatory medical benefits would serve justice.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>In <em>Watkins v Chrysler Corp,</em><footnotemark><em>86</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court of Appeals reaffirmed the principle expounded in <em>Boyce </em>that the term \u201cprorate\u201d in the final sentence of \u00a7 315(1) applies to employers and their insurance carriers. <em>Watkins </em>involved an injured plaintiff who sought and was awarded workers\u2019 compensation benefits. He subsequently requested a hearing regarding his right to attorney fees related to medical expenses ultimately paid by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. The magistrate ruled that he was not entitled to such fees. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (WCAB) reversed the magistrate\u2019s decision and awarded attorney fees to be paid by the plaintiffs employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the imposition of attorney fees under \u00a7 315(1) would be unconscionable. It noted that the plaintiffs medical expenses had been timely paid and that there had been no neglect, breach of duty, or failure to provide medical care.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the Court reiterated that the WCAB had improperly ignored the policy aspect of <em>Boyce </em>that an employer and its insurer should bear attorney fees when medical expenses are not timely paid.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In contrast to <em>Watkins, </em>defendants in this case did not timely pay plaintiffs medical expenses such that there was no neglect, breach of duty, or failure to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>medical care. Midwest failed to pay medical expenses <em>despite </em>the fact that it was paying other workers\u2019 compensation benefits to plaintiff. As the WCAC noted, Midwest knew of plaintiff\u2019s medical bills well in advance of trial, yet simply refused to pay them. Thus, the employer \u201cfail[ed], neglect[ed], or refus[ed]\u201d to furnish reasonable medical expenses for plaintiff\u2019s injuries under \u00a7 315(1).<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Finally, in <em>Harvlie v Jack Post Corp,</em><footnotemark><em>90</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court of Appeals found a unity of purpose for \u00a7 315(1) by holding that its last sentence authorizes a magistrate to prorate attorney fees among an employer and its insurance carrier. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">Here, the WCAC majority\u2019s construction of \u00a7 315(1) is consistent with a harmonious reading of the last two sentences of \u00a7 315(1). The third sentence of \u00a7 315(1) provides that \u201cthe... magistrate may prorate attorney fees at the contingent fee rate paid by the employee.\u201d Standing alone, this sentence contains ambiguity because it fails to identify whom the magistrate may order to pay the attorney fees. This sentence is not to be construed in isolation, however, but instead must be read in the context of the whole statute and harmonized with the statute\u2019s other provisions in a manner that effectuates the purpose intended by the Legislature. The second sentence of \u00a7 315(1) addresses the consequences of an employer\u2019s failure to pay medical expenses and authorizes a magistrate to order the employer to reimburse either the injured claimant or the claimant\u2019s medical insurance provider for the reasonable medical expenses incurred. This second sentence addresses the consequences to a nonpaying employer that \u201cfails, neglects, or refuses\u201d to provide reasonable medical services. The WCAC properly construed the final two sentences of \u00a7 315(1) and provided a unity of purpose for this statute.[<footnotemark>91</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8D\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>The Court noted that its holding was consistent with prior interpretations of 315(1).<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">In sum, I agree with the magistrate, the WCAC, the Court of Appeals, and established caselaw that employers and their insurance carriers are the only parties subject to a proration of attorney fees under \u00a7 315(1). This interpretation harmonizes the last sentence of \u00a7 315(1) with the preceding sentences of the provision as well as with the remedial goals of the WDCA. Workers\u2019 compensation magistrates may thus prorate an employee\u2019s attorney fees incurred in procuring payment for medical expenses against an employer, or against its insurance carrier, or against both.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Here, the magistrate\u2019s proration of attorney fees against defendants was appropriate, given defendants\u2019 failure to pay plaintiffs medical services as mandated by \u00a7 315(1). Accordingly, I conclude that the magistrate properly prorated plaintiffs attorney fees under \u00a7 315(1) against Midwest and Magna.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">III. THE INAPPLICABILITY OF THE AMERICAN RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Finally, I note that Michigan courts follow the so-called \u201cAmerican rule\u201d with respect to the payment of attorney fees.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> We have held that, \u201c[u]nder the American rule, attorney fees are not recoverable from the losing party as costs in the absence of an exception set forth in a statute or court rule expressly authorizing such an award.\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> This rule is codified at MCL 600.2405(6), which provides that among items that may be taxed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>costs are \u201c[a]ny attorney fees authorized by statute or court rule.\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Here, \u00a7 315(1) explicitly grants magistrates the discretionary authority to prorate attorney fees related to an employer\u2019s failure to provide services in accordance with the statute. Thus, the statute contemplates that a party other than a plaintiff could, in the discretion of the magistrate, be ordered to pay attorney fees in connection with a plaintiffs suit. Accordingly, \u00a7 315(1) constitutes an express statutory authorization of attorney fees, which trumps the otherwise applicable American rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">I recommend that the Court modify and expand the principles set forth in <em>Robinson v Detroit </em>governing when the Court should depart from the principle of stare decisis. A stare decisis analysis should always begin with a presumption that upholding precedent is the preferred course of action. Next, the Court should determine whether a compelling justification exists to overturn the precedent. A compelling justification is not a mere belief that the precedential case was wrongly decided or that the Court as currently composed would have decided the case differently. The factors listed in this opinion should be used on a case-by-case basis to determine whether a compelling justification exists to overrule an existing precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">However, consistent with United States Supreme Court precedent, I would accord a lower level of deference to cases that represent a recent departure from the traditional notions of stare decisis.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>I also reject as unworkable the definition of statutory ambiguity espoused in <em>Lansing Mayor. </em>I conclude that MCL 418.315(1) is ambiguous because it is capable of being understood by reasonably well-informed persons in two or more different senses. As a consequence, the statute fails to clearly indicate the parties among whom attorney fees may be prorated.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Finally, we would hold that the Legislature intended that the term \u201cprorate\u201d in the last sentence apply only to employers and their insurance carriers.

For example, such an approach may lead to the selection of one dictionary definition among many for a specific term. Lacking may be any sound explanation why the chosen definition was the one that the Legislature intended to use.

I offer the following response.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">(1) As I state <em>supra </em>at 313 n 36, I continue to believe that tools of statutory interpretation, such as the definition of \u201cambiguity,\u201d are not entitled to stare decisis status. However, Justice Markman, other members of this Court, the Court of Appeals, and lower courts have treated <em>Lansing Mayor\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d as fully entitled to it. See <em>id. </em>Hence, a thorough analysis of that case\u2019s definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d and its precedential worth is appropriate, even if not mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">(2) My fealty to stare decisis speaks for itself. As evidenced by this opinion, only because I find that, after a thorough examination of the relevant factors, a compelling justification exists for overruling precedent do I do so. This stands in stark contrast to the former majority\u2019s approach to stare decisis, as shown at notes 44 and 47 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">(3) Justice Markman claims that \u201cwhen the previous majority overruled a precedent, it was to ensure that the decisions of this Court more closely reflected the judgments of the people\u2019s elected legislative representatives . . . .\u201d <em>Post </em>at 391. This is simply a reflection of his personal opinion and that of the justices who shared his view in those cases. As indicated earlier, the former majority\u2019s overrulings showed little respect for the doctrine of stare decisis and developed a superficial rule in <em>Robinson </em>to deal with it. They disdained cases that had stood for many years before the former majority\u2019s ascension to the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">(4) Contrary to Justice Markman\u2019s contention, I have not ignored precedent in any of the cases he cites. For a comprehensive response to Justice Markman on this issue, see my concurring opinion in <em>Potter v McLeary, </em>484 Mich 397, 426-429; 774 NW2d 1 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">(5) Justice Markman claims that I have never joined an opinion that articulates a \u201ccompelling justification\u201d for upholding a prior decision that I believe was wrongly decided. This comes as no surprise, however. The finding of a compelling justification as a requisite to overruling precedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>has <em>never </em>been the standard in Michigan during my years as a justice. <em>Robinson </em>did not require a compelling justification to overrule precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">(6) Justice Markman\u2019s claim that I \u201cfind[] it necessary to depart from the 150-year old standard [regarding stare decisis] that [I] previously hailed\u201d is hopelessly off the mark. Justice Markman <em>himself </em>joined the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Robinson, </em>which established an unprecedented test for evaluating prior decisions of the Court. Although I objected to it, I followed <em>Robinson </em>in subsequent cases. See, e.g., <em>Perry v Golling Chrysler Plymouth Jeep, Inc, </em>477 Mich 62, 71; 729 NW2d 500 (2007) (Kelly, J., dissenting). Moreover, my position in <em>Rowland, </em>is entirely consistent with this opinion. As I stated in <em>Rowland, </em>\u201cthe doctrine [of stare decisis] carries such persuasive force that we have always required a departure from precedent to be supported by some special justification.\u201d <em>Rowland, supra </em>at 253-254, citing <em>United States v IBM, supra. </em>Only now do I expand upon <em>Robinson </em>and define the boundaries of a \u201ccompelling justification\u201d because of <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>insufficient deference to precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\"> <em>In re MCI Telecom Complaint, </em>460 Mich 396; 596 NW2d 164 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"65\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 411-412.

It seems obvious that the \u201cjudicial power\u201d must include the authority to interpret statutes as written and interpret ambiguity where appropriate.

See notes 73, 74, and 75 of this opinion. To the contrary, it is Justice Markman who fails to advance any justification for the definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d that he favors.

Section 315(1) mandates that employers furnish an employee with medical treatment needed for an injury arising out of and in the course of employment. The statute also enumerates certain types of treatment for which reimbursement costs can be contested by employers and their insurance carriers. However, if an employer fails, neglects, or refuses to provide covered medical expenses, the employer must reimburse the employee for the expenses, or make a payment to a medical provider for unpaid expenses that may be owing. The last sentence of \u00a7 315(1) gives a magistrate the discretion to prorate attorney fees at the contingent fee rate paid by the employee to recoup costs expended to recover medical expenses. Thus, the term \u201cprorate\u201d in the final sentence of the \u00a7 315(1), when read with the rest of the statute, applies to parties who might contest the payment of medical benefits: employers and their insurance carriers.

I fully join in part IV of Justice MARKMAN\u2019S dissenting opinion. I further dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe term \u2018prorate\u2019 in MCL 418.315(1) applies <em>only </em>to employers and their insurance carriers,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and with Chief Justice KELLY\u2019s conclusion that a workers\u2019 compensation claimant may <em>never </em>be deemed responsible for a portion of the attorney fees incurred because doing so would \u201cviolate the remedial goal of the [Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Normally, a workers\u2019 compensation claimant is responsible for bearing the costs of his portion of the litigation, including attorney fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I believe that MCL 418.315(1) serves as an exception to this general rule, permitting the magistrate to prorate attorney fees between the claimant and the employer when the employer refuses to pay \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201cneeded\u201d medical expenses for an injury \u201carising out of and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>course of employment.\u201d When an employer unjustifiably refuses to fulfill its statutory duty to pay for medical expenses incurred as a result of a work-related injury, it is entirely appropriate for the magistrate to consider whether to exercise the discretionary powers the Legislature has provided to prorate the fees between the parties according to the respective merits of their positions. In sum, the discretionary authority to prorate is a fee shifting power that <em>reduces </em>the claimant\u2019s usual obligation to bear the entire burden of his own attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In contrast, the majority allows only proration between the employer and its insurer, while the claimant is relieved of paying any portion of his attorney fees. As such, the majority position must be predicated on the assumption that <em>every </em>claim for benefits is meritorious and that any contest of such a claim venal. The reality is that some claims have merit and some should be contested; others may involve unresolved factual and legal questions under the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (WDCA) that can be definitively resolved only by the magistrate and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appellate Commission (WCAC). In consideration of this reality, I believe that the proration provision was a legislative recognition that neither the employer nor the claimant may have entirely meritorious positions in a particular case. Thus, the magistrate has been authorized to \u201csplit the baby\u201d and divide the claimant\u2019s fees when the respective merits of the party\u2019s positions warrant this. The majority does not prorate so much as shift the <em>entire </em>attorney fee burden from the claimant to the employer in every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">I. STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The statute at issue, MCL 418.315(1), provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>The employer shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to an employee who receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment, reasonable medical, surgical, and hospital services and medicines, or other attendance or treatment recognized by the laws of this state as legal, when they are needed.... If the employer fails, neglects, or refuses so to do, the employee shall be reimbursed for the reasonable expense paid by the employee, or payment may be made in behalf of the employee to persons to whom the unpaid expenses may be owing, by order of the worker\u2019s compensation magistrate. The worker\u2019s compensation magistrate may prorate attorney fees at the contingent fee rate paid by the employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">It is clear that an employer has an affirmative statutory obligation to furnish \u201creasonable\u201d medical treatment for personal injuries \u201carising out of and in the course of employment\u201d when such treatment is \u201cneeded.\u201d However, if the employer fails to do so, the statute provides two options. If the claimant has paid the medical expenses, the \u201cemployee shall be reimbursed for the reasonable expense.\u201d However, if the expenses remain \u201cunpaid,\u201d \u201cpayment may be made in behalf of the employee to persons to whom the unpaid expenses may be owing, by order of the worker\u2019s compensation magistrate.\u201d This sentence gives the magistrate the discretion to direct payment to the third-party medical provider on \u201cbehalf of the employee.\u201d The last sentence provides that the \u201cworker\u2019s compensation magistrate may prorate attorney fees at the contingent fee rate paid by the employee.\u201d As I agree with the majority that the word \u201cprorate\u201d simply means to divide or distribute proportionately, the question in this case is simply whether the attorney fees are to be divided between the claimant and the employer, or the claimant and the medical provider.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Reading the first sentence of the statutory provision together with the last two sentences leads to the conclusion that the fees <em>may </em>be prorated between the claimant and the employer. The first sentence establishes an affirmative duty on the employer to pay reasonable medical expenses for work-related injuries. However, if the employer \u201cfails, neglects, or refuses so to do,\u201d payment can be compelled, either by reimbursing the claimant or paying the claimant\u2019s medical creditors directly. The last sentence of the statute relates to the sentence preceding it, permitting the proration of attorney fees between the parties when the employer \u201cfails, neglects, or refuses\u201d to pay needed and reasonable medical expenses related to the claimant\u2019s work-related injury. In effect, this provision permits shifting to the employer some of the attorney fee burden that the claimant would otherwise bear.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">II. ANALYTIC PROBLEMS WITH THE MAJORITY</p>\n<p id=\"AR4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s analysis, there is no principled basis to distinguish an employer from its insurance carrier for the purposes of prorating attorney fees. It makes little sense to suggest, as the majority does, that the claimant\u2019s attorney fees can only be <em>prorated </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>between the employer and its carrier. The reasons are fairly obvious. The statute does not say that proration can <em>only </em>occur between an employer and its insurer. Moreover, when an employer is <em>insured, </em>its carrier is merely its agent: the insurer\u2019s duty is to indemnify and defend its insured according to the terms of the insurance contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the case of a <em>self-insured </em>employer, the majority\u2019s analysis makes even less sense since there is only one entity \u2014 the employer \u2014 and thus no one with whom to prorate, as the majority has exempted the claimant from the proration equation. <em>En fin, </em>whether the employer is self-insured or insured, the claim is paid from the same pocket. Thus, the majority deprives the word \u201cprorate\u201d of any value under any circumstance, and employers will always bear the <em>entire </em>cost of attorney fees. If the Legislature had intended that <em>only </em>the employer pay a claimant\u2019s attorney fees, it could have easily said as much and presumably would have done so in much more direct language.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">As noted, this Court and the WDCA have long recognized that a workers\u2019 compensation claimant is ordinarily responsible for paying his own personal attorney fees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s holding that workers\u2019 compensation claimants are categorically excluded from <em>ever </em>paying <em>any </em>portion of their attorney fees under MCL 418.315(1) represents a major departure from our caselaw and is inconsistent with MCL 418.858, which permits the director to limit the \u201cmaximum attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>fees\u201d \u201cpaid by the employee.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This legislative enactment, permitting the limitation of attorney fees for those representing injured workers in a workers\u2019 compensation claim, applies exclusively to disputes between attorneys and their clients<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and recognizes that attorney fees are generally payable by the claimant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s claim that requiring a claimant to pay a portion of his attorney fees would \u201cviolate the remedial goal of the WDCA,\u201d decades of caselaw, as well as the plain language of MCL 418.858(2), indicate otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The majority holds that the term \u201cprorate\u201d is limited to \u201cthe parties who might contest the payment of medical benefits: employers and their insurance carriers.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As an initial matter, nothing in the language of this provision limits the term \u201cprorate\u201d to the party <em>\u201ccontesting\u201d </em>the payment of medical benefits, to the exclusion of the party <em>\u201cseeking\u201d </em>the payment of medical benefits. The majority adds language to the statute because the majority imagines that an employer might \u201cbe tempted to deny an injured employee\u2019s request for coverage in the hope that, in subsequent litigation, <em>they </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>will not be found liable.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, contrary to the apparent beliefs of the majority, an employer is not statutorily liable for every medical expense submitted by a claimant. Rather, pursuant to MCL 418.315, an employer is only obligated to pay <em>reasonable </em>and <em>needed </em>medical expenses for <em>work-related injuries. </em>I find nothing strange or reprehensible, much less unlawful, about an employer declining to pay medical expenses that it had <em>no legal obligation </em>to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Where there are legitimate legal or factual disputes to be resolved on disputed workers\u2019 compensation claims, the hearing before the workers\u2019 compensation magistrate is the <em>sole </em>mechanism that settles those disputes and determines whether the medical treatment was needed and reasonable, and whether the medical treatment was related to \u201ca personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d While employers should be discouraged from <em>wrongly </em>denying medical benefits, the majority articulates no legal or logical basis for concluding that an employer should be discouraged from or punished for <em>correctly </em>denying claims to which a claimant is not entitled, or from seeking a resolution of arguable legal or factual disputes that call into question the employer\u2019s obligation to pay.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Here, Chief Justice Kelly\u2019s lead opinion states that \u201cthe magistrate\u2019s proration of attorney fees against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>defendants was appropriate, given defendants\u2019 failure to pay plaintiffs medical services as mandated by \u00a7 315(1).\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, in this case, where plaintiff was a \u201cleased\u201d employee, there were genuine factual and legal issues to be resolved regarding whether Koleaseco or BCN Transportation Services was plaintiffs employer, and whether a valid workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy existed between BCN Transportation and Midwest Employers Casualty Company. In light of these unresolved issues, it is unclear that Midwest unreasonably refused to pay plaintiffs medical benefits. Moreover, the magistrate did not find that Midwest unreasonably refused to pay medical benefits as the basis for assessing attorney fees against Midwest. Rather, the magistrate assessed attorney fees against Midwest on the basis of the \u201csubstantial amount of work\u201d and time expended by plaintiffs counsel in litigating the case. However, awarding attorney fees based on the amount of work and time expended by the attorney is in direct contravention of the last sentence of \u00a7 315(1), which contemplates the payment of attorney fees on a <em>contingent </em>rather than hourly system. I would remand this case to the magistrate to assess the issue of attorney fees under the appropriate legal standard.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-8\"> <em>Ante </em>at 303.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\"> <em>Ante </em>at 333 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\"> <em>Gilroy v Gen Motors Corp (After Remand), </em>438 Mich 330, 340; 475 NW2d 271 (1991) (\u201cAs in any other civil litigation, a workers\u2019 compensation claimant is ordinarily responsible for personal attorney fees.\u201d); see also <em>Gross v Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co, </em>87 Mich App 448; 274 NW2d 817 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b399-5\"> For the reasons explained earlier, I believe that the majority has simply concluded that the employer must <em>always </em>pay the claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>attorneys fees.

On remand, the Court of Appeals affirmed the WCAC\u2019s imposition of liability against certain defendants, and that issue is not the subject of this appeal. The Court of Appeals also affirmed the WCAC\u2019s assessment of attorney fees against defendants. Unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued April 17,2008 (Docket Nos. 273293 and 273294). The majority determined that attorney fees could be imposed on employers and their insurers under \u00a7 315(1), while Judge ZAHRA, in dissent, concluded that \u00a7 315(1) did not allow such imposition. This Court granted leave to appeal to consider the meaning of \u00a7 315(1), 482 Mich 994 (2008), and now affirms the Court of Appeals. Because I believe the Court of Appeals dissent is correct, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Questions of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo. <em>Brackett v Focus Hope, Inc, </em>482 Mich 269, 275; 753 NW2d 207 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">III. STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">MCL 418.315(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>The employer shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to an employee who receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment, reasonable medical, surgical, and hospital services and medicines, or other attendance or treatment recognized by the laws of this state as legal, when they are needed . .. The employer shall also supply to the injured employee dental service, crutches, artificial limbs, eyes, teeth, eyeglasses, hearing apparatus, and other appliances necessary to cure, so far as reasonably possible, and relieve from the effects of the injury. If the employer fails, neglects, or refuses so to do, the employee shall be reimbursed for the reasonable expense paid by the employee, or payment may be made in behalf of the employee to persons to whom the unpaid expenses may be owing, by order of the worker\u2019s compensation magistrate.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] The worker\u2019s compensation magistrate may prorate attorney fees at the contingent fee rate paid by the employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The instant dispute centers on the meaning of the final sentence, specifically what it means for the magistrate to be allowed to \u201cprorate attorney fees.\u201d Plaintiff contends, and a majority of this Court agrees, that this sentence allows a magistrate, when granting a recovery under the penultimate sentence, to order the employer to pay, in addition to the amount awarded for reimbursement of unpaid medical expenses, the employee\u2019s attorney fees attributable to the unpaid benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendants, however, argue that the final sentence allows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>a magistrate, when ordering an employer to pay unpaid medical expenses to \u201cpersons to whom the unpaid expenses may be owing,\u201d to deduct a proportionate share from those payments for the employee\u2019s attorney fees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">The primary goal of statutory interpretation is to discern and give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Neal v Wilkes, </em>470 Mich 661, 665; 685 NW2d 648 (2004). A court first looks at the statute\u2019s language, <em>Brown v Detroit Mayor, </em>478 Mich 589, 593; 734 NW2d 514 (2007), from which \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s intent must be gathered,\u201d <em>Frankenmuth Mut Ins Co v Marlette Homes, Inc, </em>456 Mich 511, 515; 573 NW2d 611 (1998) (quotation marks omitted). When reviewing the statute, \u201c[a]ll words and phrases shall be construed and understood according to the common and approved usage of the language,\u201d MCL 8.3a, and \u201ca word or phrase is given meaning by its context or setting,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Koontz v Ameritech Services, Inc, </em>466 Mich 304, 318; 645 NW2d 34 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">I agree with the Court of Appeals dissent, and with defendants, that the better interpretation of \u00a7 315(l)\u2019s final sentence is that a magistrate can apportion an amount of the employee\u2019s attorney fees from an employer\u2019s payment to the medical care providers. This interpretation rests principally on the meaning of \u201cprorate,\u201d which means \u201cto divide, distribute, or calculate proportionately.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1997). Thus, the final sentence can be read to allow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>magistrate to either divide or distribute proportionately attorney fees. That the division or distribution must be proportionate necessarily implies that there must be some <em>basis, </em>or rational calculation, upon which the total amount of attorney fees can be divided or distributed. This basis becomes increasingly apparent when \u00a7 315(l)\u2019s final sentence is considered with the previous sentence, in which the magistrate is directed to order the employer to make \u201cpayment... in behalf of the employee to persons to whom the unpaid expenses may be owing.\u201d Thus, payments will be made to medical providers in the amount of the unpaid expenses owed by the employee. These payments logically supply the basis upon which the attorney fees can be proportionately divided, because each payment constitutes a portion of the whole on which the employee\u2019s attorney fees are calculated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That is, if the magistrate orders payment to multiple medical providers, then a share of the employee\u2019s attorney fees is deducted from each payment based on the proportion of the whole that each payment represents.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cmay\u201d to confer upon the magistrate the authority to \u201cprorate attorney fees\u201d lends further support to this interpretation. By this word choice, the Legislature has indicated that there are times when a magistrate might <em>not </em>\u201cprorate attorney fees.\u201d If \u201cprorate\u201d is interpreted to allow a division of fees between medical care providers, then the use of \u201cmay\u201d in this context makes sense. In those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>instances that the magistrate directs payment to the medical providers, the magistrate <em>would </em>divide the fees, but when the magistrate only ordered reimbursement to the employee for his or her \u201creasonable expenses paid,\u201d the magistrate would not divide the fees. Thus, the final sentence recognizes that under the penultimate sentence the magistrate may direct payment either to the employee, in which case the division of attorney fees would be inappropriate, or the magistrate may direct payment to multiple medical care providers, or to the employee and medical care providers, in which case division of the attorney fees would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">By contrast, the majority interpretation of \u00a7 315(l)\u2019s final sentence allows a magistrate to impose attorney fees against the employer, in addition to the payment for unpaid medical expenses, with utterly no direction concerning the circumstances in which the magistrate should do so. That is, the majority interpretation accords the magistrate the <em>discretion </em>to assess attorney fees against an employer when the employer \u201cfails, neglects, or refuses\u201d to pay benefits, but provides no guidance for ascertaining when that discretion should or should not be exercised. Had the Legislature truly intended for the magistrate to impose attorney fees against an employer, it seems likely that the Legislature would have included <em>some </em>standard for determining the circumstances under which fees should be assessed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Even more troubling is that the Chief Justice apparently finds the entire final sentence of \u00a7 315(1) irrelevant in concluding that a magistrate can impose attorney fees against an employer. She states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\">[T]he word \u201cmay\u201d bears on whether a proration must occur if a magistrate does award attorney fees.... Should a magistrate determine that only one [party] is liable, the magistrate may impose attorney fees against only that party Conversely, should the magistrate find multiple parties liable, fees may be prorated accordingly. <em>[Ante </em>at 310.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Thus, the Chief Justice interprets \u00a7 315(1) to' allow a magistrate to impose attorney fees absent any \u201cproration\u201d of the fees because she interprets \u201cmay\u201d as according the magistrate the discretion to decide \u201cwhether a proration must occur,\u201d <em>after he has already decided to award attorney fees. </em>If the magistrate determines that the attorney fees should be imposed on \u201cmultiple parties,\u201d then the magistrate can \u201cprorate\u201d or divide the fees among those parties. However, if \u201conly one [party] is hable,\u201d the magistrate can impose the fees \u201cagainst only that party\u201d without having to \u201cprorate\u201d or divide the fees at all. This completely fails to recognize that \u00a7 315(1) only allows the magistrate to \u201cprorate\u201d or not \u201cprorate\u201d attorney fees. Interpreting \u00a7 315(1) to allow the magistrate to impose attorney fees without relying on the specific authority to \u201cprorate\u201d reads an authorization into the statute that clearly does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The Chief Justice supports her interpretation by reasoning that because the \u201cstatute . . . provides a process for employers and their insurance carriers to object to the medical treatment that an injured employee seeks,\u201d the final sentence \u201cwhen read with the remainder of the statute, applies to the parties who might contest the payment of medical benefits: employers and their insurance carriers.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 309. That is, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u201charmonized the final sentence with the remainder of \u00a7 315,\u201d and to avoid the final sentence \u201cstanding] alone,\u201d \u00a7 315(l)\u2019s final sentence must be read to impose additional liability on employers and their insurers, in order to maintain a \u201cunity of purpose.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 308-309, 336; see also <em>ante </em>at 342 (HATHAWAY, J., concurring). Contradicting this pursuit of \u201charmony\u201d and \u201cunity,\u201d however, are fundamental differences between \u00a7 315(l)\u2019s final sentence and the preceding sentences, which clearly establish an employer\u2019s liability for <em>particular </em>expenses. In these preceding sentences, the Legislature states that the employer \u201cshall furnish, or cause to be furnished,\u201d various reasonable medical expenses and that the employer \u201cshall also supply\u201d various correctional devices (e.g., eyeglasses, artificial limbs, crutches). MCL 418.315(1). If the employee pays these reasonable expenses, then under the penultimate sentence the employee \u201cshall be reimbursed\u201d for the reasonable expense paid by the employee. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the penultimate sentence relates back to the listed expenses that an employer \u201cshall\u201d pay. Attorney fees are not included in those expenses; yet the majority interpretation effectively gives the phrase \u201cmay prorate\u201d the same meaning as the phrases \u201cshall furnish\u201d and \u201cshall supply\u201d so that the final sentence imposes an additional payment obligation upon the employer. This conclusion is contrary to the logical assumption that, had the Legislature intended to affirmatively impose payment of attorney fees upon an employer, it would have done so with at least approximately the same clarity with which it imposed liability for other expenses upon the employer earlier within the same subsection.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Instead, the Legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>lature chose to use considerably different language in the final sentence than in the immediately preceding sentences.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The final sentence is much better read, in my judgment, as an adjunct to the magistrate\u2019s ability to direct payment to medical providers established in the penultimate sentence. The legislative amendment adding the final sentence to \u00a7 315(1) specifically supports such a relationship. Before this amendment, the then-final sentence of former MCL 412.4, which is now \u00a7 315(l)\u2019s penultimate sentence, only allowed the <em>employee </em>to receive payment for medical expenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">If the employer shall fail, neglect or refuse so to do, such employee shall be reimbursed for the reasonable expense incurred by or on his behalf in providing the same, by an award of the commission. [MCL 412.4, as amended by 1955 PA 250.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">When the Legislature amended the statute to allow payment to also be directed to the medical providers, it added the now-final sentence in dispute here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">If the employer shall fail, neglect or refuse so to do, such employee shall be reimbursed for the reasonable expense paid by' him, or payment may be made in behalf of such employee to persons to whom such unpaid expenses may be owing, by an award of the commission. The commission may prorate attorney fees in such cases at the contingent fee rate paid by such employee and it may also prorate such payments in the event of redemptions. [MCL 412.4, as amended by 1963 PA 199.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Thus, the magistrate\u2019s ability to \u201cprorate attorney fees\u201d directly accompanied the magistrate\u2019s ability to direct payments to medical providers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This association seems to indicate that the Legislature recognized that when medical providers received payment from the employer, the medical providers themselves could fairly be said to have been enriched by the work of the employee\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Prior to the amendment, a medical provider was relegated to seeking payment from the employee through a separate cause of action. Even if the medical providers recovered the full amount in the action, each would still have to pay its own attorney costs due to the longstanding \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d regarding attorney fees.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In effect, the Legislature set forth a shortcut to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>this practice in \u00a7 315(1). Rather than requiring medical providers to hire their own attorneys and commence separate actions against the employee, \u00a7 315(1) now allows the medical provider to recover through the action instituted by the employee.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Medical providers receive the same reimbursement amount as they did before the amendment, while employees retain more of the recovery to which they are entitled.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>The majority interpretation would impose an additional cost upon the workers\u2019 compensation process by penalizing employers and forcing them to pay not only for their own attorneys, but also for their employees\u2019 attorneys. This increased expense is at odds with MCL 418.801(3), in which the Legislature has <em>already </em>provided a penalty for unpaid medical benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-4\">If medical bills or travel allowance are not paid within 30 days after the carrier has received notice of nonpayment by certified mail, in cases where there is no ongoing dispute, $50.00 or the amount of the bill due, whichever is less, shall be added and paid to the worker for each day over 30 days in which the medical bills or travel allowance are not paid. Not more than $1,500.00 in total may be added pursuant to this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The majority interpretation would establish a new penalty provision with \u00a7 315(l)\u2019s final sentence that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>inconsistent with the WDCA\u2019s actual penalty provision, in which the Legislature expressly provides for a penalty payment only \u201cwhere there is no ongoing dispute.\u201d Nothing in the majority interpretation prevents the attorney-fees penalty from operating even in the presence of a dispute, which is directly contrary to when the Legislature has stated a penalty should apply. If the Legislature intended \u00a7 315(1) to operate as a penalty provision, then it would seem that such penalty would at least be assessed consistently with the penalty provided under \u00a7 801(3). This lack of consistency casts further doubt on the majority interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">With respect to the magistrate\u2019s authority over medical providers that are not parties to the action, \u00a7 315(2) implies that the magistrate indeed does have authority over medical providers when they are operating in the context of \u00a7 315 by providing that any recovery by a medical provider can be reduced by the magistrate to the \u201cmaximum charge established <em>under the rules.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, the magistrate may reduce the provider\u2019s recovery even if the provider is not a party to the action. It follows that the magistrate has the same ability to reduce the recovery to pay for an employee\u2019s attorney fees when the statute grants the magistrate such authority in \u00a7 315(1).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>In conclusion, several clues supplied by \u00a7 315(1) and the WDCA support the interpretation set forth in this dissent. Particularly relevant in this regard are: (1) the use of \u201cprorate,\u201d the proportionality of the division this term conveys, and the fact that there is some logical standard or basis for calculating proportions under this interpretation, but not under the majority interpretation; (2) the use of \u201cmay\u201d in describing the magistrate\u2019s authority to prorate, and the fact that there is some logical standard or basis for exercising this authority under this interpretation, but not under the majority interpretation; (3) the consistency of this interpretation, and the lack of consistency of the majority interpretation, with the penalty provision in \u00a7 801(3); (4) the fact that the majority interpretation reads words into \u00a7 315(1) that are absent and nullifies words that are present; (5) the significant differences in language between the introductory sentences of \u00a7 315(1), which clearly establish an employer\u2019s liability for particular expenses, and its final sentence, which does nothing equivalent; (6) the logical implications drawn from \u00a7 315(l)\u2019s final sentence being positioned after the penultimate sentence, and the legislative amendment of \u00a7 315(1); and (7) the similarity in the arrangement between employees\u2019 attorneys and medical providers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>set forth in this dissent and the arrangement between employees\u2019 attorneys and nonparties set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 821 and 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">IV RESPONSE TO THE CHIEF JUSTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Not content with merely misconstruing the law, the Chief Justice adopts an approach to statutory interpretation that can only be described as bizarre. She <em>begins </em>her interpretation by asserting that the \u201cthreshold question is whether . . . the last sentence of \u00a7 315(1) is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 308.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> After an entirely gratuitous citation to the dictionary definition of \u201cprorate,\u201d one that promptly proves to be irrelevant to any subsequent analysis, the Chief Justice determines that \u201cthe term \u2018prorate\u2019 could reasonably apply to employers, their insurance carriers, health care providers, employees seeking workers\u2019 compensation benefits, or to any combination of them.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 308. This finding should come as no surprise considering the Chief Justice\u2019s focus on the word \u201cprorate\u201d without regard to its context. Next, the Chief Justice initially determines that \u201cneither \u00a7 315 as a whole nor any other provision of the WDCA indicates the parties to whom a division or distribution of attorney fees applies,\u201d but nevertheless proceeds to adopt her own interpretation because it \u201cunifies the last sentence of \u00a7 315(1) with the remainder of the statute.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 308-309. Satisfied that her interpretation also gives effect to the word \u201cmay,\u201d cf. <em>supra </em>at 356, the Chief Justice then concludes that her interpretation \u201caffords the phrase \u2018may prorate\u2019 its full meaning.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 310. After all of this, the Chief Justice continues to answer her \u201cthreshold question\u201d in the affirmative, concluding that the statute is ambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>because other \u201cinterpretations of \u00a7 315(1) exist.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 310. That is, rather than even giving the <em>appearance </em>that she has reached the conclusion that the statute is \u201cambiguous\u201d based upon her difficulty in ascertaining its meaning, the Chief Justice withdraws from the process of statutory interpretation once other interpretations are presented. It is apparently much easier to summarily declare \u201cambiguity,\u201d and thereby avoid the inconvenience of having to actually carry out one\u2019s judicial duties by deciding what the statute or contract actually states.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">a. ambiguity</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">As evident from her \u201cinterpretation\u201d here, the Chief Justice\u2019s dependence on an extraordinarily low threshold for finding ambiguity, and her resultant conclusion that \u00a7 315(1) is, of course, \u201cambiguous,\u201d are essential to her analysis. The Chief Justice then proceeds on the assumption that, once ambiguity has been established, a judge is essentially unencumbered by any serious restraints imposed by the language of a statute or contract and effectively has carte blanche to utilize whatever factors are deemed appropriate in reaching a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">I disagree with this approach to \u201cinterpretation,\u201d not merely because it divorces the interpretative process from the law that is purportedly being \u201cinterpreted,\u201d but also because it raises the unavoidable suspicion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>a judge is reaching the result he or she would <em>personally </em>prefer rather than the result compelled by the law. That is, instead of abiding by the traditional exercise of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d in which the judge, employing the statute or contract itself as the lodestar, says only what the law \u201cis,\u201d the Chief Justice by her understanding of ambiguity would effectively exercise the \u201clegislative power\u201d to say what the law \u201cought to be\u201d by arbitrarily picking and choosing among a practically limitless variety of available extra-textual considerations.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For the Chief Justice, the concept of ambiguity is one to be both casually and peremptorily invoked \u2014 as in this case in which no party has even asserted that the statute is ambiguous \u2014 to avoid the discipline of the traditional judicial process, while maintaining at least some appearance that this process has been respected. The lower the barrier to finding ambiguity, the more effortlessly a judge can dispense with the hard work of giving meaning to difficult and complex provisions of statutes and contracts, and the less risk that this regular process of interpretation will lead to the \u201cwrong\u201d results. A facile resort to ambiguity affords the judge a readily available means of acting beyond the scope of his or her authority to exercise exclusively the \u201cjudicial power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">It is hard to conceive of a much lower barrier to ambiguity than that propounded by the Chief Justice. A statute, we are instructed, is \u201cambiguous\u201d when it is \u201ccapable of being understood by reasonably well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>informed persons in two or more different senses.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Ante </em>at 331. If this definition does not describe almost <em>all </em>litigation coming before this Court, it certainly describes <em>much </em>of this litigation. There are relatively few appellate litigants \u2014 most of whom have undertaken the financial burdens of litigation, accepted the psychological and emotional tolls of a protracted legal process, and endured trial, intermediate appeal, Supreme Court appeal, remands, and motions for reconsideration, all while being represented by attorneys who are ethically obligated to ensure some degree of meritoriousness in their clients\u2019 legal positions \u2014 whose statutory and contractual disputes could not be fairly characterized under the Chief Justice\u2019s definition as entailing ambiguity. Indeed, little would be clearly <em>excluded </em>from the realm of ambiguity by her definition other than genuinely frivolous lawsuits, which are both rare and sanction-able. Matters of interpretation are resolved in judicial venues precisely because statutes and contracts are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>susceptible to \u201cbeing understood by reasonably well-informed persons in two or more different senses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Even more remarkable, however, is that the Chief Justice\u2019s own \u201canalysis\u201d in this case does not even satisfy her own low threshold for discerning ambiguity, since there is nothing therein that suggests that <em>either </em>the plaintiffs or the defendants\u2019 position is \u201creasonable.\u201d In fact, the Chief Justice never once compares <em>any </em>interpretation other than her own to the statute. She simply notes the \u201cexistence]\u201d of competing interpretations and declares ambiguity. <em>Ante </em>at 310. Essentially, the Chief Justice\u2019s standard for discerning ambiguity is more accurately stated as: \u201cA statute is ambiguous when parties offer conflicting interpretations.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The Chief Justice has previously observed, \u201cI find frequent ambiguity in statutory language.\u201d <em>Haynes v Neshewat, </em>477 Mich 29, 40; 729 NW2d 488 (2007) (KELLY, J., concurring).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This is not surprising. For once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>a statute or contract has been deemed \u201cambiguous,\u201d this Court \u201cmay go beyond the plain language of the statute [or contract],\u201d <em>ante </em>at 307-308, and then employ decision-making factors that would ordinarily be unavailable in the interpretative process. There is no lack of variety in these newly available factors. As I offered in my concurring opinion in <em>Haynes:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\">Having reached the proper result in this case through a proper legal analysis, Justice Kelly in a concurrence to her own majority opinion proceeds to demonstrate that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>could have reached the same result through less disciplined means. Not content to rely, as she does in her majority opinion, on the actual language of the law, Justice KELLY invokes an array of alternative techniques to \u201cinterpret\u201d the law in her concurring opinion. She relies upon a \u201cliberal construction\u201d of the statute in question; she relies upon characterizations of the statute as \u201cbroad\u201d and \u201cremedial\u201d; she relies upon a summary description of the law as \u201cambiguous,\u201d therefore apparently affording her the discretion to pick and choose the law she prefers; she relies upon the Legislature\u2019s inaction in the wake of an earlier court decision, equating this to approval of the Court\u2019s decision; she disparages the value of dictionaries as an essential tool in the interpretative process; and she relies upon an extraordinarily broad understanding of \u201clegislative history.\u201d For the sake of future reference, a further catalogue of language-avoidance \u201cinterpretative\u201d techniques would include the following: divining the \u201cspirit of a statute\u201d; relying upon considerations of \u201cpublic policy\u201d; standardlessly applying \u201cequity\u201d; characterizing statutes with which a judge disagrees as \u201cabsurd\u201d; and concocting creative \u201cbalancing\u201d and \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d tests. Innovatively applied, each of these techniques can be relied upon to avoid the hard task of having to discern a statute\u2019s meaning from its actual language. [Haynes, 477 Mich at 48-49 (Markman, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The use of these and other factors to reach a decision far more closely resembles the exercise of the constitution\u2019s \u201clegislative power\u201d than its \u201cjudicial power.\u201d It is an undisciplined and standardless approach to giving meaning to the law, enabling the judge at his or her discretion to determine which factors to take into account, and what priority to give those factors.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>an approach that disrespects the separation of powers<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and that enhances the power of judges at the expense of the rule of law.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">B. DISSENT AND AMBIGUITY</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The Chief Justice\u2019s definition of ambiguity stands in contrast to what has been the predominant approach in our state. In <em>Mayor of Lansing v Pub Service Comm, </em>470 Mich 154, 166; 680 NW2d 840 (2004), this Court stated that \u201ca provision of the law is ambiguous only if it \u2018irreconcilably conflict[s]\u2019 with another provision or when it is <em>equally </em>susceptible to more than a single meaning.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Similarly, in <em>Klapp v United Ins Group Agency, Inc, </em>468 Mich 459, 467; 663 NW2d 447 (2003), this Court found a contract to be ambiguous because two provisions \u201cirreconcilably conflict[ed]\u201d with each other.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Such an understanding of ambiguity restricts the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>to saying what the law \u201cis\u201d based on the words chosen by the Legislature in all but the most extraordinary circumstances. While the Chief Justice suggests that the relative rarity of a finding that a law or contract is ambiguous under this definition constitutes its vice, <em>ante </em>at 322-323, by preserving a broader realm within which the ordinary process of interpretation may proceed, and in which deference will be shown to the decisions of the lawmaker, this may be better understood as its principal virtue.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\"><em>Many </em>disputes before this Court involve difficult or complex interpretations of statutes and contracts, yet it remains our responsibility to sort out these difficulties and complexities and finally determine what constitutes the <em>most reasonable, </em>if not always the perfect or the crystalline, meaning of the law. Judges have traditionally approached this responsibility by looking to the language of a statute or contract, considering relevant dictionary definitions of words and phrases,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> assessing the existence and meanings of \u201cterms of art,\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> evaluating the context of words<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and grammatical, syntactical, and punctuational clues,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> comparing related and companion provisions of the law,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> discerning the organization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>and structure of statutes and contracts,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> invoking traditional default rules and maxims of interpretation,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and applying proper understandings of legal purpose and precedent.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">This should not be understood as a mechanical process, for judges engaged conscientiously in this exercise will sometimes disagree about the meaning of the law, but it is a process in which the focus is directed <em>outwardly </em>toward the language of the statute or contract, rather than <em>inwardly </em>toward the personal predilections of the judge.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> As Justice Felix Frankfurter once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>remarked, \u201cthe highest exercise of judicial duty is to subordinate one\u2019s personal will and one\u2019s private views to the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">C. PREMISES OF AMBIGUITY RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Despite the Chief Justice\u2019s view that an understanding of ambiguity does not constitute \u201cbinding precedent,\u201d she nonetheless undertakes a strenuous effort to identify precedents in support of her position, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>undertaking no discernible effort to actually justify her own understanding. Rather than constituting an \u201caberrant\u201d approach to interpretation, <em>ante </em>at 328 n 66, <em>Mayor of Lansing </em>and <em>Klapp </em>set forth a rule of statutory interpretation that, as with most other such rules, is grounded in logic and common sense, and is designed to faithfully ascertain the intentions of the Legislature. The understanding of ambiguity articulated in <em>Mayor of Lansing </em>and <em>Klapp </em>is premised upon longstanding principles of sound constitutional government that are suggested by the following inquiries directed toward those who would advocate a broader understanding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\">\u2014-When ambiguity is discerned, ordinary rules of interpretation no longer apply \u2014 as the Chief Justice asserts, a court may then \u201cgo beyond the plain language of a statute [or contract]\u201d \u2014 and judges are accorded broad and arbitrary discretion to pick and choose from among a wide variety of factors as to how the law should be given meaning. Why would any responsible legal system wish to depart from its ordinary processes, from ordinary rules of interpretation and traditional exercises of the judicial power, with any greater frequency than is absolutely required?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">\u2014When ambiguity is discerned, ordinary rules of interpretation no longer apply \u2014 as the Chief Justice asserts, a court may then <em>\u201cgo </em>beyond the plain language of a statute [or contract]\u201d \u2014 and judges are accorded broad and arbitrary discretion to pick and choose from among a wide variety of factors as to how the law should be given meaning. Why would any responsible legal system wish to replace a reasonably predictable rule of law with arbitrary, and possibly idiosyncratic, determinations of judges any more often than is absolutely required?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">\u2014-When ambiguity is discerned, ordinary rules of interpretation no longer apply \u2014 as the Chief Justice asserts, a court may then <em>\u201cgo </em>beyond the plain language of a statute [or contract]\u201d \u2014 and judges are accorded broad and arbitrary discretion to pick and choose from among a wide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>variety of factors as to how the law should be given meaning. Why would any responsible legal system wish to minimize the realm in which judges are bound by the written law and instead maximize the realm in which written law is subrogated to a variety of indeterminate factors at a judge\u2019s disposal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">\u2014When ambiguity is discerned, ordinary rules of interpretation no longer apply \u2014 as the Chief Justice asserts, a court may then \u201cgo beyond the plain language of a statute [or contract]\u201d \u2014 and judges are accorded broad and arbitrary discretion to pick and choose from among a wide variety of factors as to how the law should be given meaning.

What conceivable arguments does the <em>Chief Justice </em>have for favoring an expansion in the range of judicial decision-making within which judges are empowered to devise, at their discretion, <em>ad hoc </em>and unpredictable criteria for determining how the law will be defined? Hers is a hollow opinion, evidenced not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>by her failure to abide even by her <em>own </em>standards for identifying ambiguity, but also by her failure to articulate even a minimal justification for these standards.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">D. LOGIC OF AMBIGUITY RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The Chief Justice asserts that language is ambiguous when it is \u201ccapable of being understood by reasonably well-informed persons in two or more different senses,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 331, but she never supplies any explanation for how this definition is to operate practically in the real world. She fails to answer, or even ask, whether there is some <em>threshold </em>beyond which it can be said that an interpretation is \u201ccapable of being understood by reasonably well-informed persons in two or more different senses.\u201d Is it sufficient, for example, in finding ambiguity that 10% or 20% or 30% of all \u201creasonably well-informed persons\u201d might subscribe to a particular interpretation? Indeed, is it sufficient that the parties merely disagree, or must the Court intervene to determine that the position of each side is itself reasonable?</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Given that the <em>Mayor of Lansing/Klapp </em>standard can be quantified as a 50% test \u2014 i.e., if there are two equally reasonable interpretations, a law is ambiguous; otherwise it is not \u2014 how would the Chief Justice characterize <em>her </em>standard? What is the approximate threshold at which a law should be found ambiguous? Unless <em>any </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>disagreement by <em>any </em>single \u201creasonably well-informed personf]\u201d would be sufficient to trigger a finding of ambiguity, where is this threshold point? If 90 percent of all \u201creasonably well-informed persons\u201d believe that the proper interpretation of a statute is X, and 10 percent believe that it is Y, or if a judge is 90% persuaded that the more reasonable interpretation is X, and 10% persuaded that it is Y, is there ambiguity? Obviously, the Chief Justice\u2019s threshold for finding ambiguity falls somewhere below 50%, but approximately where? Are there any other areas of the law in which a judge, in the exercise of the judge\u2019s fundamental obligation to interpret the law, must subordinate his or her own judgment concerning the meaning of the law to that of \u201creasonably well-informed [other] persons,\u201d or to any other group of persons?</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Given that the Chief Justice\u2019s threshold must necessarily be less than 50%, why should that level ever be deemed sufficient to allow a judge to dispense with the language of a statute or contract as the dispositive factor in determining its meaning? That is, if a judge is 51% or 61% or 71% persuaded that some interpretation of the law is the better, or the \u201cmost reasonable,\u201d interpretation, what is the rationale for allowing a judge to interpret the law in some different fashion? Why would a judge ever adopt an interpretation that he or she believes is the second-best, or the second most reasonable, interpretation? If <em>any </em>interpretation of the law, concerning which a judge is less than 100% certain \u2014say a 95% certainty \u2014 will ever permit that judge to adopt such interpretation as the better, or the \u201cmost reasonable\u201d interpretation, what is the reason why a 51% or 61% or 71% interpretation should <em>not </em>prevail over a 29% or 39% or 49% interpretation \u2014 much less with respect to what the Chief Justice describes as \u201cmore\u201d interpretations .that might be offered, see <em>ante </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>at 329, none of which may draw their legitimacy from the words of a statute or contract? Why shouldn\u2019t the better, or the \u201cmost reasonable,\u201d interpretation always prevail? Absent a perfectly clear statute or contract, why should a judge not prefer the 51% or 61% or 71% interpretation? Why should a 29% or 39% interpretation ever be placed on par with a 71% or 61% interpretation? Indeed, why should a definition of ambiguity be adopted that allows a judge to determine that <em>neither </em>the 75% nor the 25% \u201cmost reasonable\u201d interpretations will be adopted? <em>Ante </em>at 328-329. Why isn\u2019t it fair to conclude that the better, or the \u201cmost reasonable,\u201d interpretation \u2014 which may be the 51% interpretation \u2014 is simply the correct interpretation of the law?</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The Chief Justice has little interest in parsing \u00a7 315(1), little interest in explaining why either of the parties\u2019 interpretations is \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201cunreasonable,\u201d and little interest in explaining why, in either constitutional or logical terms, her understanding of ambiguity makes sense, much less why it makes better sense than what <em>Mayor of Lansing </em>and <em>Klapp </em>have set forth. Instead, the Chief Justice is content to proceed, without explanation, upon her deconstruction of the law of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">E. NO PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED RULES</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">After her \u201canalysis\u201d of \u00a7 315(1) \u2014 one consuming nearly a full paragraph and in which a sideways glance at the sentence immediately preceding the one in dispute is apparently seen as excessively rigorous \u2014 the Chief Justice deems the statute \u201cambiguous,\u201d i.e., alternative interpretations could \u201creasonably apply.\u201d She then proceeds to select from among the available \u201cinterpretative\u201d tools and adopt those that purportedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>support her result. Apparently, for every ambiguous statute or contract reaching this Court, and there will be many such statutes and contracts if the Chief Justice\u2019s position ever prevails, she will re-embark upon this \u201cinterpretative\u201d process, picking and choosing at her discretion from among some uncertain array of tools lying \u201cbeyond the plain language of the statute [or contract].\u201d See <em>Haynes, </em>477 Mich at 48-49 (MARKMAN, J., concurring), for a partial listing of such tools. The litigants will, of course, have no notice beforehand of which tools are to be employed, for the justices themselves will not know this beforehand. Among the universe of potential tools extending \u201cbeyond the plain language of the statute [or contract],\u201d the Chief Justice will, by some means never quite explained, determine which of these are deemed to be relevant in interpreting the statute or contract in that case, and after several turns and twists of the mechanisms of her own internal Enigma machine, some result will emerge. One result will emerge if the \u201crelevant\u201d legislative history, for example, is the Senate committee report, another result will emerge if the \u201crelevant\u201d legislative history is the House committee report. Still other results will emerge if the \u201crelevant\u201d legislative history is comprised of the statements of the Senate or House committee chairman, the floor statements of the Senate or House majority leader, the committee testimony of witness A in the Senate or that of witness B, C, or D in the House, the staff analyses of the House or the Senate, or the floor colloquy of two random members of the House or two other random members of the Senate.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> All in all, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>this is a fine process, except that it is not a legal or judicial process. Instead, it is a process in which judges in the very guise of selecting the tools and factors to be employed in \u201cinterpreting\u201d the law are effectively its formulators \u2014 in short, judges who are wielding the legislative, not the judicial, power.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">A critical strength of a judicial philosophy committed to exercising only the constitution\u2019s \u201cjudicial power\u201d is that reasonably clear rules of decision-making are established <em>before the fact. </em>That is, a judge essentially promises the parties that he or she will decide their case, as with all others, by attempting to discern the reasonable meaning of relevant statutes or contracts and that this will be done by relying upon recognized rules, and tools, of interpretation. By contrast, under the Chief Justice\u2019s approach to ambiguity, in which there is essentially a limitless array of rules, and tools, that may be employed for \u201cdefining\u201d the law apart from its language, there is no consistently applied interpretative process with which the judge promises beforehand to comply. He or she may promise to\" be \u201cfair,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>he or she may seek to be fair, but there are no rules for how this fairness is to be achieved. There is only the promise that the judge will address each dispute on a case-by-case basis, using whatever rules, and whichever tools, he or she believes are required in that instance. And the suspicion simply cannot be avoided that these varying and indeterminate rules, and tools, may be largely a function of the outcome preferred by the judge and by his or her personal attitudes toward the parties and their causes. Any interpretative rules will be identified only <em>after the fact, </em>and these \u201crules\u201d may or may not have been invoked in resolving yesterday\u2019s dispute, and may or may not be employed in resolving tomorrow\u2019s dispute. Any judge can concoct an <em>after-the-fact </em>rationale for a decision; the <em>judicial </em>process, however, is predicated upon <em>before-the-fact </em>rationales. An <em>ad hoc </em>process is not a judicial process at all. In the place of predetermined rules \u2014 otherwise understood as the rule of law \u2014 the Chief Justice would substitute rules to be determined later.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>E CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019S TOOLS IN THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">What among the universe of available post-ambiguity tools does the Chief Justice choose to consider in reaching her decision here? The Chief Justice states that \u201ccaselaw,\u201d among other tools, supports her interpretation of \u00a7 315(1). In evaluating this factor, the Chief Justice mainly invokes broad \u201cpublic policy\u201d considerations. For example, the Chief Justice, citing <em>Harvlie v Jack Post Corp, </em>2006 Mich ACO 69, emphasizes that the \u201cWCAC has explicitly recognized the importance of holding employers and their insurance carriers responsible for a proration of attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 315(1).\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 332. Yet, in <em>Harvlie, </em>this \u201cimportance\u201d was drawn from the following: \u201cThe attorney fee provision of Section 315 was <em>designed to promote the assistance of counsel </em>in medical dispute cases where there are minimal or no wage loss benefits from which to obtain an attorney fee.\u201d 2006 ACO 69, at 3 (emphasis added). In essence, <em>Harvlie </em>found that interpreting \u00a7 315(l)\u2019s final sentence to require an employer to pay attorney fees made it more likely that an attorney would take a case in which the only recovery available was based on medical costs. Thus, the \u201cimportance\u201d of enforcing the majority interpretation is based on this putative \u201cdesign\u201d even though the reasoning in <em>Harvlie </em>in no way bears this out. The majority interpretation does not obviously \u201cpromote the assistance of counsel\u201d because the employee\u2019s attorney recovers the same amount \u2014 the contingency fee calculated on the recovered medical expenses \u2014 regardless of who pays his fees. See notes 4 and 5 of this opinion. Thus, the supposed \u201cdesign\u201d set forth in <em>Harvlie </em>is a false one. Nonetheless, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Chief Justice insists that this reasoning somehow sustains her interpretation and supplies better guidance than the actual words of \u00a7 315(1).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">The Chief Justice next relies on <em>Boyce v Grand Rapids Asphalt Paving Co, </em>117 Mich App 546, 552; 324 NW2d 28 (1982), in which, after resolving a workers\u2019 compensation attorney fees dispute on the grounds that an administrative rule did not allow an employee to recover fees from a medical provider or employer,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> the Court proceeded to opine that such a result did not serve \u201cjustice.\u201d However, whatever an individual judge\u2019s personal sense of \u201cjustice,\u201d it is the responsibility of that judge to do \u201cjustice under law.\u201d Judges have no proper authority to countermand the decisions of the lawmaker by substituting a personal sense of \u201cjustice\u201d for the justice of the law. I agree that there can be reasonable disagreement as to whether the position asserted by plaintiff or by defendants in this case is more \u201cjust.\u201d However, that question has never been thought to be dispositive, or even relevant, in giving meaning to statutes and contracts, and it is not made more dispositive or relevant because it was addressed by the lower court. Many persons, including judges, may have a strong personal sense of \u201cjustice\u201d \u2014 how public resources should be apportioned, how rights and respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>sibilities should be understood, how the limits of government should be defined \u2014 but it is \u201cjustice <em>under law\u201d </em>that is the tool of the trade of the judge and that defines the judicial power. Moreover, even if ascertaining what constituted abstract \u201cjustice\u201d in the instant case <em>did </em>define this Court\u2019s mission, the Chief Justice never even purports to explain why <em>her </em>conception of \u201cjustice\u201d \u2014 requiring employers to pay employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation attorney fees \u2014 is somehow superior to alternative conceptions of \u201cjustice,\u201d including that of the Legislature, which has chosen to rely upon a different rule than the Chief Justice.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">The Chief Justice also relies on the WDCA\u2019s \u201cremedial . . . nature\u201d to support her interpretation. <em>Ante </em>at 332. The WDCA is indeed remedial, because it provides a remedy for employees injured on the job. Yet, the Chief Justice fails to explain why this purpose, as important as it obviously is, should be elevated above every other purpose of the Legislature. The WDCA is the Legislature\u2019s attempt to fulfill at least two pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>poses: \u201cto \u2018provide ... not only for employees a remedy which is both expeditious and independent of proof of fault, but also for employers a liability which is limited and determinate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Simkins v Gen Motors Corp (After Remand), </em>453 Mich 703, 710; 556 NW2d 839 (1996) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> By arbitrarily establishing priorities among the several purposes of the WDCA, the Chief Justice undermines the real-world negotiations and compromises that were engaged in by the Legislature. In the place of a statute enacted by a majority of the 148 members of the Legislature, the majority interpretation substitutes a statute approved only by four judges acting well beyond their proper authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The Chief Justice then asserts that she is empowered to \u201cconstrue the act\u2019s terms liberally,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 332\u2014 rather than merely \u201creasonably.\u201d As a result of this process, one essentially indistinguishable from a judge asserting his or her right to place a thumb on the scales of justice, the Chief Justice proclaims that plaintiff is entitled under the WDCA to the greatest possible amount of recovery. <em>Ante </em>at 332. Is there anything more to the Chief Justice\u2019s \u201cliberal\u201d construction than that plaintiff prevails on everything? Is this all that is implied by a \u201cliberal\u201d construction? At what point does the Court decide that its \u201cliberal\u201d construction has fully accomplished the goals of the WDCA? When the employee receives all that he asks for? When an employer can no longer afford to maintain its insurance, or cannot afford to maintain an employee? Does a \u201cliberal\u201d construction militate in favor even of a recovery of benefits that is not contemplated by the actual language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>of the WDCA? Having declined from the outset to attempt any \u201creasonable\u201d interpretation of \u00a7 315(1), the Chief Justice is far more enthusiastic about proclaiming \u201cambiguity\u201d and immediately proceeding to a \u201cliberal\u201d interpretation. That is, in the place of an interpretation that is grounded in some meaningful way upon the law itself, the Chief Justice much prefers an \u201cinterpretation\u201d that is not really an interpretation at all. She engages in what is merely a political impulse, rather than any serious construction of the law as might once have been expected from a justice of the Supreme Court of this state. Rather than working to achieve the \u201cbest\u201d possible or \u201cmost reasonable\u201d interpretation of the law, the Chief Justice, apparently fearing that little good would come from such an approach, instead exercises a power that does not belong to judges under the pretext that she is actually engaging in some genuine interpretation of the law, albeit a \u201cliberal\u201d interpretation. While a genuine interpretation of the law is designed to achieve as perfect an understanding as possible of what the lawmaker has intended, a \u201cliberal\u201d interpretation appears here to be little more than a means to achieving a particular result.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">In short, the Chief Justice invokes her own understanding of ambiguity for the purpose of providing some justification for her preferred course of \u201cgoing beyond the plain language of the statute,\u201d and thereby avoiding the difficult process of giving fair meaning to a statute, the fair meaning of which may not be to her liking. \u201cNo judge should manufacture ambiguity.\u201d <em>Paige v Sterling Hts, </em>476 Mich 495, 542; 720 NW2d 219 (2006) (CAVANAGH, J., concurring in part) (emphasis omitted). Yet, there is no longer any need to \u201cmanufacture ambiguity\u201d in light of the extraordinarily low threshold by which it can be found under the Chief Justice\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>definition. In virtually every instance in which ambiguity is invoked, the Chief Justice would circumvent the actual language of a statute or contract in favor of her own notion of how that statute or contract should be configured.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">G. STARE DECISIS</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">After stating that \u201cstare decisis does not apply\u201d to the <em>Mayor of Lansing </em>standard for determining ambiguity, <em>ante </em>at 314 n 36, the Chief Justice nonetheless devotes almost a third of her opinion to rejecting the stare decisis test in <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), constructing a new test, and then \u201capplying]\u201d it to <em>Mayor of Lansing. </em>It should be emphasized that only one other justice is in agreement.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> This leads to several reflections concerning the Chief Justice and precedent:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">(1) The Chief Justice has repeatedly criticized other justices for \u201cunnecessarily\u201d overruling precedent.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> What could be less \u201cnecessary\u201d than to overturn a case she characterizes as nonbinding precedent? The Chief Justice has also previously stated that a departure from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>precedent must be supported by some \u201cspecial justification.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> What \u201cspecial justification\u201d could exist to overrule a case that she does not consider formally binding precedent?<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">(2) Given that in this case the Chief Justice would expressly overrule, not one, but two of this Court\u2019s prior decisions,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">one is naturally tempted to re-inquire, see <em>Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, </em>477 Mich 197, 223-228; 731 NW2d 41 (2007) (MARKMAN, J., concurring), whether the ongoing dispute between the [former] majority and Justice KELLY over overrulings of precedent truly concerns attitudes toward stare decisis or merely attitudes toward particular previous decisions of this Court. <em>[People v Smith, </em>478 Mich 292, 322-323 n 17; 733 NW2d 351 (2007).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u201cA justice\u2019s perspective on stare decisis is not evidenced by her willingness to maintain precedents with which she <em>agrees, </em>but by her willingness to maintain precedents with which she <em>disagrees.\u201d Rowland, </em>477 Mich at 224-225 n 3 (MARKMAN, J., concurring). Now that the Chief Justice is positioned to overrule decisions with which she disagrees, her actions increasingly demonstrate that her former claims of fealty toward stare decisis were considerably overstated. Despite all her rhetoric concerning the importance of stare decisis for the exercise of the judicial power, see, e.g., her hollow claim that she possessed a \u201cdiffering [and elevated] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>esteem for stare decisis\u201d than another justice, <em>People v Gardner, </em>482 Mich 41, 88 n 31; 753 NW2d 78 (2008), such rhetoric was in reality little more than a means of communicating her opposition to overruling <em>particular </em>past decisions with which she agreed.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">(3) As I also asserted in <em>Rowland, </em>477 Mich at 226:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">[N]o meaningful discussion of a court\u2019s attitude toward precedent can be based solely on an arithmetical analysis in which raw numbers of overrulings are simply counted. Such an analysis obscures that not all precedents are built alike, that some are better reasoned than others, that some are grounded in the exercise of discretionary judgments and others in the interpretation of plain language, that some are thorough in their analyses and others superficial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The chart attached to my concurring opinion in <em>Rowland </em>demonstrates that the former majority\u2019s overrulings of precedent overwhelmingly occurred in cases involving what the then-majority justices viewed as the \u201cmisinterpretation of straightforward words and phrases in statutes and contracts, in which words that were <em>not </em>there were read into the law or words that <em>were </em>there were read out of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226, 228-247. In contrast, the new majority\u2019s overrulings of precedent has moved toward just the opposite result, replacing decisions that sought to give reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>meaning to the words of the law with decisions in which \u201cwords that were <em>not </em>there were read into the law or words that <em>were </em>there were read out of the law.\u201d That is, when the previous majority overruled a precedent, it was to ensure that the decisions of this Court more closely reflected the judgments of the people\u2019s elected legislative representatives and it was to more closely align case law and statutory law. By contrast, when the new majority has overruled, or at least ignored, a precedent, it has been to create a greater disparity between that case law and the statutory law.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">(4) Indeed, since Chief Justice KELLY became a part of the new majority, this majority has dealt with precedents it did not like in an especially inappropriate manner \u2014 by simply ignoring them. In the interest of clearing the law of this state of multiple and inconsistent precedents on the same matters of law, the former majority forthrightly and explicitly overruled precedents and never sought to obscure this process or to misleadingly minimize the number of overturned precedents, by either ignoring disfavored precedents or by dubiously \u201cdistinguishing\u201d prior case law. Doubtlessly, because it is cognizant of the gap between its past rhetoric extolling the importance of stare decisis and its present actions disregarding stare decisis, the new majority has made an increasingly regular practice of simply ignoring inconvenient precedents.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> As a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>for years to come, the clear rule of law will be stunted in this state as legal practitioners and judges will be able to pick and choose between competing and inconsistent precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">(5) The Chief Justice concludes that Robinson\u2019s standard for overruling binding precedent is \u201cinsufficiently respectful of precedent\u201d because \u201cnot once has the Court cited it as a basis for upholding a prior decision.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 315-316 (emphasis omitted). The Chief Justice, however, fails to illuminate the reader as to the number of occasions on which <em>she </em>has concluded that binding precedent was wrongly decided and yet joined an opinion maintaining that precedent. Perhaps, this is because the answer is \u201cnever.\u201d Not once has the Chief Justice joined an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>opinion finding a \u201ccompelling justification,\u201d or any other basis, for upholding a prior decision that she believed was wrongly decided.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> More to the point, however, in disparaging the impact of <em>Robinson, </em>the Chief Justice disregards that cases in which <em>Robinson </em>would have been viewed as militating <em>against </em>an overruling of precedent would have been precisely those cases in which there never would have been an opinion issuing from this Court in the first place.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">(6) In response to my concurring opinion in <em>Rowland, </em>then-Justice KELLY stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">Justice MAEKMAN challenges me to develop my \u201cown standards\u201d concerning when I would overturn precedent.

As noted in <em>McDowell [v Oyer], </em>when precedents are \u201cfree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>from absurdity, not mischievous in practice, and consistent with one another,\u201d they should be retained. <em>McDowell, </em>21 Pa [417, 423 (1853)].

Thus, the employee retains an attorney to recover benefits, and the recovery subject to the assignment helps pay the employee\u2019s attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Likewise, pursuant to \u00a7 827, a nonparty employer can recover through the efforts of an employee\u2019s attorney pursuing a third-party liability action, whereby an employee can seek recovery for the same damages he \u201cwould be entitled to recover in an action in tort.\u201d MCL 418.827(5). If the employee recovers, then he shall first \u201creimburse the employer or carrier for any amounts paid or payable\u201d under the WDCA, reduced by \u201cexpenses of recovery,\u201d <em>id., </em>which include \u201creasonable expenditures, including attorney fees, incurred in effecting recovery,\u201d MCL 418.827(6). Thus, the employer does not recover the full amount it paid under its workers\u2019 compensation policy. Rather, the full amount is less any attorney fees, which the employer would have had to pay had it sued the third party for recovery as it is entitled to do. MCL 418.827(1) (employer can bring suit against third party in name of employee if one year has passed since the employee\u2019s injury). This reduction of the recovery amount is the same as when a magistrate \u201cprorates\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 315(l)\u2019s final sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\"> The financial outcome for medical providers remains the same, whereas, hy eliminating the need for providers to hire attorneys, the employee actually keeps more of his medical expenses. For example, assume that an employee has paid $3,000 in medical expenses provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>for in \u00a7 315(1) and still owes a medical provider $2,000 for such expenses. Further assume that attorney fees are 30% of any recovery. Prior to the addition of \u00a7 315(l)\u2019s final sentence, an employee would seek recovery of $5,000 from the employer and, upon receiving that amount, would owe his attorney $1,500. After the medical provider commenced an action for the $2,000 and obtained ajudgment for that amount, the employee would be left with $1,500, half of what he paid. The medical provider would owe its attorney $600, meaning that the medical provider recovered $1,400 for its $2,000 bill. Thus, the employee retained $1,500, the medical provider retained $1,400, and the attorneys (employee\u2019s and medical provider\u2019s) went home with $2,100. On the other hand, after the addition of \u00a7 315(l)\u2019s final sentence as interpreted in this dissent, the magistrate would direct payment of $2,000 to the medical provider but with $600 appropriated for the employee\u2019s attorney. The magistrate would also direct payment of $3,000 to the employee but with $900 appropriated for the employee\u2019s attorney. As a result, the medical provider recovers the same amount that it would have recovered in a separate action against the employee, but the employee is left with $2,100, which is $600 more than he would have recovered under the old system. The $600 is available because the Legislature provided a way in which recovery could be realized by both the employee and the medical provider without requiring both to hire their own attorneys.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b416-7\"> I also respectfully disagree with Justice Young\u2019s interpretation that \u00a7 315(1) \u201cpermit\u00eds] the magistrate to prorate attorney fees between the claimant and the employer .. ..\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 343. First, he does not account for why the magistrate\u2019s authority to \u201cprorate attorney fees\u201d is only triggered \u201c[w]hen an employer unjustifiably refuses to fulfill its statutory duty to pay for medical expenses ....\u201d <em>Ainte </em>at 344. It would seem more logical under his interpretation that a magistrate could impose attorney fees against an employer <em>any time </em>the employer \u201cfails, neglects, or refuses\u201d to pay for the medical expenses. Nowhere does the statute include the caveat that the refusal must be \u201cunjustified\u201d before the magistrate can \u201cprorate\u201d the fees. Second, the statute directs proration \u201cat the contingent fee rate paid by the employee,\u201d MCL 418.315(1), not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>\u201caccording to the respective merits of [the parties\u2019] positions,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 344. Third, the penultimate sentence \u201cprovides two options\u201d \u2014 the magistrate can direct payment to the employee or to medical providers \u2014 and Justice Young, in my judgment, fails to recognize that these options provide an obvious statutory basis upon which the magistrate can exercise his discretion to \u201cprorate attorney fees.\u201d Finally, although medical providers are, in fact, \u201centitled to the entirety of their fees\u201d before litigation, <em>ante </em>at 346 n 4, the reality is that a recovery will always be subject to attorney fees. Rather than \u201cimpos[ing]\u201d fees against the providers, the Legislature created a mechanism whereby the fees are simply deducted from the recovery being paid to the provider, and whereby the number of \u201cparties to the litigation\u201d can be reduced, without affecting the outcome to those potential parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\"> I note that this approach has not garnered majority support on this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b419-7\"> Because interpreting either statutes or contracts requires a court to give meaning to specific language, the interpretative approach signaled by a particular view of ambiguity \u201capplies with equal force whether the court is interpreting a statutory text or a contractual one.\u201d <em>Mayor of Lansing v Pub Service Comm, </em>470 Mich 154, 165 n 6; 680 NW2d 840 (2004).

The Chief Justice then defends her own approach to the judicial role by effectively declaring that all interpretation is nothing but a fiction in which the judge, one way or another, gets to impose his own personal will.

By equating the imperfections inherent in a human process in which language is taken seriously with the fundamental defects inherent in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>process in which language is subordinate to a judge\u2019s personal sense of which results are to be preferred, it is hard to imagine a more mistaken, and cynical, view of the judicial enterprise, albeit one that encapsulates well the persistent constitutional and jurisprudential divide between the justices in the majority and the dissenting justices.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Concerning <em>Liberty Hill Housing Corp v City of Livonia, </em>480 Mich 44, 57; 746 NW2d 282 (2008), which the Chief Justice cites as somehow exemplifying the defects of the \u201cplain meaning\u201d approach, this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">The third, fourth, and fifth meanings in the definition are clearly not relevant here. The first meaning defines \u201coccupy\u201d as \u201cto have, hold,. .. possess,... or claim[.]\u201d These parts of the definition are synonymous with ownership. Because the statute uses the conjunctive term \u201cowned <em>and </em>occupied,\u201d however, the Legislature must have intended different meanings for the words \u201cowned\u201d and \u201coccupied.\u201d Otherwise, the word \u201coccupied\u201d would be mere surplusage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">See also <em>id. </em>at 57 n 12.

Thus, contrary to the Chief Justice\u2019s assertion, <em>Liberty Hill </em>demonstrated that a responsible judge, attempting faithfully to give meaning to the law, does not have \u201cunfettered discretion to pick and choose among available \u2018plain meanings,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante </em>at 321, but rather is bound by existing rules, and by interpretative approaches, that are well-known both to the judge and the parties beforehand. While such an \u201cinterpretivist\u201d or \u201ctextualist\u201d approach cannot dispense entirely with the exercise of judgment, unlike the approach preferred by the Chief Justice, the interpretative \u201crules of the game\u201d under the former approach will be known in advance and are designed to reasonably ascertain the intentions of the lawmaker.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\"> The Chief Justice asserts that she need not justify her standard in light of the fact that other jurisdictions utilize similarly worded standards. <em>Ante </em>at 330-331 &amp; nn 73-75.

It should not go unremarked that in this case, it is the <em>dissent </em>that cites legislative history, albeit a uniquely persuasive and statutorily grounded type of legislative history, as a relevant factor in interpreting \u00a7 315(1), while the Chief Justice, the presumed advocate of legislative history, for no apparent reason excludes this from her post-ambiguity toolbox. Why?

But where there are 49 other state jurisdictions in the United States, and thousands of other local jurisdictions, and millions of other private contracts entered into in these jurisdictions, it would not seem terribly difficult to identify somewhere and someplace a statute or contract whose interpretation can be invoked in support of an interpretation sought to he obtained in this state. Nor is there any apparent reason why in an appropriate case one of the Chief Justice\u2019s amorphous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>post-ambiguity tools could not consist of a judicial decision from France, New Guinea, or Azerbaijan.
