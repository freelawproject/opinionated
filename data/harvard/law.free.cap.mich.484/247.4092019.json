We also overrule <em>Mason v Simmons,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which the lower courts relied on, because its holding is inconsistent with the statutory language of the CCA and inconsistent with longstanding principles of Michigan custody jurisprudence. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">In 2002, Tammy Jo Hunter and her husband, Jeff Hunter, lived in Indiana with their four young children, who ranged in age from two to nine years. There is no evidence in the record that Indiana child welfare authorities ever investigated or sought jurisdiction over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the family. Tammy and Jeff began using crack cocaine. In August 2002, Tammy left her four children in Jeffs care at home and did not return for six days. During her absence, Jeff contacted his brother and sister-in-law in Michigan, plaintiffs Robert and Lorie Hunter, and requested their assistance. Robert drove to Indiana, collected the children, and returned to Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Two months later, Tammy and Jeff came to Michigan and retrieved their children, claiming that they had successfully overcome their drug addictions. A short time later, however, plaintiffs learned that Tammy and Jeff had relapsed. Plaintiffs again drove to Indiana and brought the children to Michigan. Robert testified that he and Lorie told Tammy and Jeff that \u201cwe were taking the kids . .. and told them they had to give us the kids and sign these guardianship papers.\u201d Tammy signed papers establishing a limited guardianship with plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Seven months later, in May 2003, Tammy and Jeff petitioned the Oakland Circuit Court to terminate plaintiffs\u2019 guardianship. However, they failed to appear at a June 2003 hearing because they were again using cocaine. On July 1, 2003, the circuit court dissolved the limited guardianship and appointed plaintiffs full guardians of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Tammy\u2019s life further deteriorated when she was incarcerated in August 2004. She was released from prison in April 2005 and, three months later, filed a petition in the Oakland Circuit Court seeking an opportunity to visit her children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The circuit court required her to verify her drug-free status since her release from prison. She was required to undergo biweekly drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>testing, attend Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous meetings, and maintain weekly telephone contact with her children. She complied with each of these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">On November 9, 2005, the circuit court ordered Tammy to begin paying child support and allowed supervised visits with the children. At a review hearing conducted six months later, the circuit court noted that Tammy\u2019s visitation had gone well and that she regularly paid child support. The circuit court expanded her parenting time, awarding her unsupervised weekend visits in Michigan during May and June 2006 and overnight, unsupervised visits in Indiana beginning in July 2006. The court also continued her child support obligation and ordered her to submit to weekly drug screens. She again met each of the court\u2019s requirements. By the time this case was filed, Tammy was having monthly unsupervised weekend visits with the children at her Indiana home and in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In May 2006, plaintiffs filed this action seeking legal and physical custody of the children. The parties stipulated that the Friend of the Court (FOC) referee would make a preliminary finding regarding the children\u2019s established custodial environment and whether Tammy was a \u201cfit parent,\u201d using Mason <em>v Simmons </em>\u201cas its guide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The referee determined that the children had an established custodial environment with plaintiffs and that Tammy was an unfit parent. Tammy filed objections to the referee\u2019s report and requested a hearing de novo. Ten days after receiving the referee\u2019s report, the circuit court entered another order. It required Tammy to attend parenting classes, submit to random drug screens, participate in substance abuse counseling, and attend family counseling sessions with her children and her live-in boyfriend. Tammy again complied with all requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>At the evidentiary hearing, several witnesses testified regarding the circumstances in 2002 and 2003 that led to the establishment of plaintiffs\u2019 guardianship of the children. Tammy testified that she had remained drug-free since August 2004 and supplied the court with a compendium of negative drug screen reports. She also testified that she earned $10.50 an hour as an assistant sales manager and lived with her boyfriend in a four-bedroom home in Indiana. A family therapist who had evaluated the children pursuant to a circuit court order reported that the children were \u201cattached\u201d to Tammy and \u201chave a preference to move [in] with her full time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The circuit court concluded that Tammy was not a fit parent. In its bench ruling, the court gave its reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">Now, as to the issue of mom\u2019s fitness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">I believe that mom is a very nice person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">That she loves these children very dearly and I think they love her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">And I\u2019m impressed by the progress that she has made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">But I don\u2019t believe that her love for the children is equivalent to being a fit parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-12\">When we look at the definition of fitness, it\u2019s not about whether she\u2019s a nice person, it is not about whether today she has made progress \u2014 and, again, she has made progress \u2014 it is about what happened in conjunction with these kids.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-13\">And in 2002 the parents were drug addicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-14\">They could not provide a home for the children and the family intervened and rather than having [Children\u2019s Protective Services] involvement and have these children go to foster care the family took over and stepped in and provided a stable and loving home for these four kids, it doesn\u2019t happen very often and it\u2019s wonderful when that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>does happen and I think, again, these kids are doing as well as they are today because of that intervention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">And mom has made progress but there are still numerous questions and numerous issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">These kids have never really lived with her for the last five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">And in Dr. [Jerome] Price\u2019s report he talks about that, that they regard going to mom\u2019s as vacation time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">They have not had to do the grueling, day to day, sort of parenting and be tested that way so we can make some determination about what the current situation is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">And mom lives with a man, who seems like a very nice individual also, a hard working person, but they live in an out of wedlock relationship and exposing the children to an out of wedlock relationship, given all of the other instability of their lives at this point is questionable judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">I heard his testimony that he\u2019s listed her as a beneficiary on his life insurance and he expects that he will leave her his assets should he pass away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-11\">But the truth of the matter is she has no legal rights as a live together person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-12\">There is a reason that we have marriage in this society and marriage protects her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-13\">The relationship she is in gives her no protection and if at any time Mr. McConnell wants to tear up the letter, change the beneficiary, move out, he, of course is free to do so, as she is, and there are no legal ramifications to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-14\">So she is not really very well protected and without his assistance she cannot maintain the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-15\">She\u2019s been in a home for six months; that\u2019s a lease home and she admitted herself that she could not possibly maintain the children financially without Mr. McConnell being there and without his financial assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>So I think she has made terrific strides but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s at a point yet where we can say she is able to provide a stable and secure home for these four children, who have been out of her care for five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">So I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the definition of fitness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The court then held a best interests hearing. After considering the testimony, the court agreed with the referee\u2019s findings. The court determined that 9 of the 12 best interest factors<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> favored plaintiffs and that the parties were equal with respect to 2 of the factors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court also stated on the record that it had \u201ctaken into consideration\u201d the remaining factor, the reasonable preference of the children,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in reaching its decision. The court held that it was in the children\u2019s best interests to remain with plaintiffs and granted them physical and legal custody. It also ordered Tammy to pay child support and $4,000 of plaintiffs\u2019 attorney fees. The court later denied Tammy\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Tammy filed an application for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals. In a split, unpublished decision, the Court of Appeals majority affirmed the custody determination, but reversed the award of attorney fees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Judge GLEICHER dissented. She would have reversed the custody determination because the circuit court\u2019s decision regarding parental fitness was unconstitutional and against the great weight of the evidence. We granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>II. LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">We review de novo questions of law involving statutory interpretation and questions concerning the constitutionality of a statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Findings of fact in child custody cases are reviewed under the great weight of the evidence standard.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The central issues in this case are (1) what is the proper application of MCL 722.25(1) and MCL 722.27(l)(c); and (2) do the federal constitutional standards concerning the fundamental rights of parents to raise their children control our answer to the first question?</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">A. UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The importance of the family and the \u201cessential,\u201d \u201cbasic,\u201d and \u201cprecious\u201d right of parents to raise their children are well established in United States Supreme Court jurisprudence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This right is not easily relinquished. \u201cThe fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, to satisfy constitutional due process standards, the state \u201cmust provide the parents with fundamentally fair procedures.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>In 2000, in the case of <em>Troxel v Granville,</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the United States Supreme Court delivered its most relevant pronouncement in this area of the law. In a plurality opinion, the Court struck down the state of Washington\u2019s \u201cbreathtakingly broad\u201d visitation statute as an unconstitutional infringement on the fundamental right of parents to rear their children.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The statute authorized \u201c \u2018any person\u2019 \u201d to petition for visitation rights and authorized state courts to grant such visitation whenever it \u201c \u2018may serve the best interest of the child.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">B. APPLICABLE MICHIGAN LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In 1970, the Michigan Legislature enacted the CCA. Among its provisions are statutory presumptions that apply in custody disputes. The presumptions pertinent to this case are found in MCL 722.25(1) and MCL 722.27(l)(c). MCL 722.25(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">If a child custody dispute is between the parents, between agencies, or between third persons, the best interests of the child control. If the child custody dispute is between the parent or parents and an agency or a third person, the court shall presume that the best interests of the child are served by awarding custody to the parent or parents, unless the contrary is shown by clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">MCL 722.27(l)(c), by contrast, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>If a child custody dispute has been submitted to the circuit court as an original action under this act or has arisen incidentally from another action in the circuit court or an order or judgment of the circuit court, for the best interests of the child the court may do 1 or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\">(c) Modify or amend its previous judgments or orders for proper cause shown or because of change of circumstances until the child reaches 18 years of age .... The court shall not modify or amend its previous judgments or orders or issue a new order so as to change the established custodial environment of a child unless there is presented clear and convincing evidence that it is in the best interest of the child. The custodial environment of a child is established if over an appreciable time the child naturally looks to the custodian in that environment for guidance, discipline, the necessities of life, and parental comfort. The age of the child, the physical environment, and the inclination of the custodian and the child as to permanency of the relationship shall also be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Thus, a conflict arises between these sections when a court hears a custody dispute between a child\u2019s natural parent and a third party with whom the child has an \u201cestablished custodial environment.\u201d This Court has not addressed the proper application of these sections of the CCA in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">On numerous occasions before <em>Troxel </em>was decided, the Court of Appeals considered the interplay of these two presumptions. Panels of the Court came to conflicting conclusions about how to reconcile them.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>after <em>Troxel, </em>in <em>Heltzel v Heltzel, </em>the Court recognized that, to properly protect a parent\u2019s fundamental liberty interest, the presumption of MCL 722.25(1) in favor of the natural parent must control.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\"><em>Heltzel </em>further concluded that it was imperative that trial courts balance the two significant interests. First, the lower courts must adequately safeguard the fundamental constitutional nature of the parental liberty interest. Second, they must simultaneously maintain the statutory focus of the CCA on the best interests of the child. To achieve this balance, <em>Heltzel </em>held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">[C]ustody of a child should be awarded to a third-party custodian instead of the child\u2019s natural parent only when the third person proves that all relevant factors, including the existence of an established custodial environment and all legislatively mandated best interest concerns within [MCL 722.23], taken together clearly and convincingly demonstrate that the child\u2019s best interests require placement with the third person.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The Court of Appeals thoroughly considered <em>Heltzel\u2019&amp; </em>analysis when it decided <em>Mason. </em>It noted that no published Court of Appeals case had addressed the applicability of <em>Heltzel </em>in cases in which a natural parent was unfit or had neglected or abandoned a child.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Without citing authority to support its conclusion, <em>Mason </em>then distinguished <em>Heltzel, </em>saying that it applies only to custody disputes involving fit parents. It held that when \u201ca parent\u2019s conduct is inconsistent with the protected parental interest, that is, the parent is not fit, or has neglected or abandoned a child, the reasoning and holding of <em>Heltzel </em>do not govern.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Mason </em>thus affirmed the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant was not entitled to the constitutional deference afforded a fit parent under <em>Heltzel </em>and <em>Troxel. </em>It extended that reasoning to justify denying the natural parent the benefit of the statutory presumption in MCL 722.25(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">III. THE CCA\u2019S PROTECTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Custody cases involving natural parents inherently implicate the parents\u2019 fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of their children.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, they implicate the constitutional protections identified in the United States Supreme Court cases previously discussed. The threshold question this Court must address is whether the relevant provisions of the CCA adequately protect a fit parent\u2019s fundamental rights under existing United States Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>A. UNDER <em>TROXEL, </em>MCL 722.25(1) MUST CONTROL OVER MCL 722.27(l)(c) IN ORDER TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT FIT PARENTS\u2019 FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\"><em>Troxel </em>established a floor or minimum protection against state intrusion into the parenting decisions of fit parents. It invalidated the state of Washington\u2019s third-party visitation statute as a violation of a natural parent\u2019s fundamental rights. It reasoned that the Washington statute was flawed because it afforded no deference to a fit parent\u2019s decision about his or her children\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Rather, the statute allowed \u201cany third party seeking visitation to subject any decision by a parent concerning visitation of the parent\u2019s children to state-court review.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Troxel </em>also forbade courts from overturning decisions by a fit custodial parent based \u201csolely on the judge\u2019s determination of the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Rather, it held that courts must give some \u201cspecial weight\u201d to the parents\u2019 determination of their children\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The constitutional protection in <em>Troxel </em>centers on the \u201ctraditional presumption that a fit parent will act in the best interest of his or her child.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The Washington statute\u2019s lack of deference to a fit parent\u2019s decision was inconsistent with the presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children. Hence, it was constitutionally infirm. Using that reasoning, <em>Troxel </em>established that a natural parent\u2019s fitness to parent is the touchstone for invoking the constitutional protections of fundamental parental rights. The application of the statutory presumption in MCL 722.25(1) must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>therefore be considered specifically in the context of a fit parent to determine whether it satisfies constitutional scrutiny under <em>Troxel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In <em>Heltzel, </em>our Court of Appeals recognized Troxel\u2019s mandate: In order to protect a fit natural parent\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, the parental presumption in MCL 722.25(1) must control over the presumption in favor of an established custodial environment in MCL 722.27(l)(c). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Several considerations compel this conclusion. First, <em>Troxel </em>explicitly requires courts to give some deference to a parent\u2019s decision to pursue custody because it is inherently central to the parent\u2019s control over his or her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">By contrast, unlike the parental presumption in MCL 722.25(1), no constitutional protections for third persons underlie the established custodial environment presumption in MCL 722.27(l)(c). This Court has held that no constitutional or statutory basis exists for third parties to have standing to seek child custody solely because they have an established custodial relationship with the child.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Finally, we note that the vast majority of Michigan cases interpreting the CCA support the conclusion that these presumptions were not meant to be given equal weight.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> This conclusion is also in accord with Michigan\u2019s longstanding history of affording great respect to parental authority while consistently recognizing that the best interests of the child control the analysis.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> For these reasons, we conclude that, when these presumptions conflict, the presumption in MCL 722.27(l)(c) must yield to the presumption in MCL 722.25(1).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">A remaining constitutional question involves the amount of deference due under <em>Troxel </em>to fit parents. We conclude that the statute provides sufficient deference to a fit natural parent\u2019s fundamental rights to the \u201ccare, custody, and management of their child . .. ,\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>We so hold because the statute requires, in order to rebut the parental presumption, clear and convincing evidence that custody by the natural parent is not in a child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The clear and convincing evidence standard is \u201cthe most demanding standard applied in civil cases .. . .\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> This showing must \u201c \u00a3produce[] in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established, evidence so clear, direct and weighty and convincing as to enable [the fact-finder] to come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts in issue.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We agree with the Court of Appeals in <em>Heltzel </em>that, given the unique constitutional considerations in custody disputes involving natural parents, \u201cit is not sufficient that the third person may have established by clear and convincing evidence that a marginal, though distinct, benefit would be gained if the children were maintained with him.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> A third party seeking custody must meet a higher threshold. He or she must establish by clear and convincing evidence that it is not in the child\u2019s best interests under the factors specified in MCL 722.23 for the parent to have custody. This is entirely consistent with <em>TroxeV </em>s holding. Although a fit parent is presumed to act in his or her child\u2019s best interests, a court need give the parent\u2019s decision only a \u201cpresumption of validity\u201d or \u201csome weight.\u201d That is precisely what MCL 722.25(1) does when it requires clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Given our determination that (1) the parental presumption in MCL 722.25(1) prevails over the presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>tion in favor of an established custodial environment in MCL 722.27(l)(c) and that (2) the parental presumption can be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence that custody with the natural parent is not in the best interests of the child, we conclude that MCL 722.25(1) satisfies constitutional scrutiny under <em>Troxel.</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>B. <em>TROXEL </em>DOES NOT REQUIRE A THRESHOLD DETERMINATION OF PARENTAL FITNESS IN CUSTODY CASES IF NO STATUTORY REQUIREMENT EXISTS</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Defendant and some of the amici curiae argue that this Court must read into the statute an implicit requirement for a fitness determination in order to protect parents\u2019 fundamental rights. Even if the presumption in MCL 722.25(1) supersedes the presumption in MCL 722.27(l)(c), defendant argues that the court must make a preliminary determination whether a natural parent is a fit parent. Thus, defendant insists, <em>Troxel </em>prevents courts from allowing a third party to rebut the presumption using a best interests analysis because it would insufficiently protect the parent\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Defendant relies on <em>In re JK </em>in support of her argument. In that case, this Court stated that \u201c[a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>due-process violation occurs when a state-required breakup of a natural family is founded solely on a \u2018best interests\u2019 analysis that is not supported by the requisite proof of parental unfitness.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Defendant urged us to examine the Probate Code, the juvenile code, and other sections of Michigan law to adopt a test for evaluating parental fitness. She claims that, to satisfy constitutional scrutiny, such a test must be based on objective factors similar or identical to those listed in those statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">We reject defendant\u2019s arguments as beyond the scope of the holdings of <em>Troxel </em>and <em>In re JK. </em>As noted previously, <em>Troxel </em>carefully limited the constitutional scope of the parental presumption to the extent that a court need give decisions by fit custodial parents only a \u201cpresumption of validity.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Since MCL 722.25(1) applies a substantial presumption of the validity of decisions by all parents, including fit custodial parents, the constitutional underpinnings of <em>Troxel </em>are satisfied.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>In re JK </em>is distinguishable from the case before us. It was a case involving termination of parental rights. Termination cases introduce a significantly heightened intrusion upon a parent\u2019s fundamental right to parent because they involve an all-or-nothing proposition: whether a parent\u2019s right to be a parent and make decisions regarding his or her child\u2019s upbringing is permanently severed. It follows logically that under circumstances where the parental interest is most in jeopardy, due process concerns are most heightened.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">A custody award to a third party, by contrast, represents a lesser intrusion into the family sphere. It does not result in an irrevocable severance of parental rights or \u201c <em>\u2018a </em>unique kind of deprivation\u2019 \u201d that forces parents to confront the state.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The Legislature has addressed these concerns by requiring the state to prove parental unfitness by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d in termination cases. It has listed specific statutory factors that it has determined make a parent per se unfit and warrant terminating his or her rights to a child.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The quoted language from <em>In re JK </em>is inapplicable in custody cases such as this because it does not involve the \u201cstate-required breakup\u201d of a family. In termination cases, the natural parent and the state are the parties to the action. To protect the parental interest from improper state intrusion, the Legislature requires the state to prove by clear and convincing evidence that at least one statutory ground for termination exists. Hence, the state must show that the natural parent is unfit.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">In custody cases, by contrast, the state does not initiate the proceedings in which the natural parent\u2019s rights are at stake. Rather, custody determinations in cases such as this merely give \u201crecognition to a family unit already in existence. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Under such circumstances, \u201c[w]hatever might be required in other situations, we cannot say that the State was required in this situation to find anything more than that [its decision was] in the \u2018best interests of the child.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Finally, we note that a natural parent\u2019s fitness is an intrinsic component of a trial court\u2019s evaluation of the best interest factors in MCL 722.23.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Therefore, although we hold that due process does not require a fitness determination where the statute does not mandate it, we observe that fitness is an inextricable component of the court\u2019s inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">For example, MCL 722.23(f) to (g) require the trial court to compare the \u201cmoral fitness\u201d and the \u201cmental and physical health\u201d of the parties. These factors reflect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>the legislative determination that concerns about parental fitness are of paramount importance in custody determinations. Therefore, MCL 722.25(1) uses the clear and convincing evidence standard to safeguard the constitutionally protected fundamental rights of fit custodial parents, as identified in <em>Troxel. </em>MCL 722.23, on the other hand, simultaneously fulfills the legislative purpose of maintaining the focus of the inquiry on the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">C. <em>MASON </em>ERRONEOUSLY INTERPRETED MCL 722.25(1) BY ADDING A DETERMINATION OF FITNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">We again note, as a preliminary observation, that MCL 722.25(1) does not refer to fitness of the natural parent as a prerequisite for applying the statutory presumption in the parent\u2019s favor. MCL 722.25(1) applies to all natural parents who are parties in custody disputes with third persons, not merely fit natural parents. Nothing in the statute explicitly or implicitly suggests that the presumption applies only in cases involving a parent adjudged to be a fit parent. Rather, we believe that, in enacting the CCA, the Legislature set forth clear best interest factors in MCL 722.23 that constitute a de facto evaluation of each individual\u2019s fitness to raise a child.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> In doing so, the Legislature rejected the amorphous fitness/neglect/abandonment standard outlined in <em>Mason </em>by not including any reference to that standard.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\"><em>Mason </em>erred by holding that the statutory presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>tion in the natural parent\u2019s favor applies only to fit parents. This was an improper interpretation of <em>Heltzel, Troxel, </em>and the CCA generally. The statutory presumption in MCL 722.25(1) is \u201c \u2018a presumption of the strongest order,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and one that \u201cdoes not turn solely on the question of fitness.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Numerous cases decided since the CCA was enacted have agreed: the parental presumption controls unless the third party shows by clear and convincing evidence that custody with the natural parent is not in the best interests of the child.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">As discussed earlier in this opinion, the parental presumption has some constitutional provenance, whereas the custodial environment presumption has none. This persuades us that the parental presumption should properly control over the established custodial environment presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><em>Mason </em>held that the parental presumption controls with regard to fit parents only because they alone are constitutionally protected. <em>Mason </em>further held that unfit parents have the burden \u201cto show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a change in the established custodial environment with the guardian was in the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">However, <em>Mason </em>and its predecessors created this new standard out of thin air.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> In the case before us, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Legislature has provided us with two standards that irreconcilably conflict. Rather than resolve the conflict by divining a new standard, as <em>Mason </em>did, we believe that the better course is to decide which of the two presumptions controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">We are convinced that the parental presumption must control. We are persuaded of this (1) by the fact that, whereas the parental presumption has some constitutional provenance, the established custodial environment presumption does not; (2) by caselaw interpreting the tension between MCL 722.25(1) and MCL 722.27(l)(c); and (3) by the lack of reference to fitness in the CCA. The Court is unwilling to restrict the parental presumption absent clear evidence from the Legislature that a restriction was intended. Moreover, the CCA\u2019s notable silence regarding fitness, abandonment, or neglect of children suggests these words should not be read into the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The statutory presumption favoring natural parents is not contravened merely because the statute provides greater protection for parental rights than <em>Troxel </em>mandated as a constitutional matter. <em>Mason\u2019s </em>contrary holding is contradictory to the weight traditionally afforded to the parental presumption.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Because the parental presumption in MCL 722.25(1) satisfies the constitutional standards mandated for fit parents, no justification existed for <em>Mason </em>to restrict that presumption only to fit parents. Nothing in <em>Troxel </em>can be interpreted as precluding states from offering <em>greater </em>protection to the fundamental parenting rights of natural parents, regardless of whether the natural parents are fit. This rule applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Defendant also argues that <em>Mason\u2019s </em>arbitrary and subjective fitness standard, and the trial court\u2019s equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>subjective application of that standard in this case, violated her Fourteenth Amendment<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> due process rights. She claims that, because the <em>Mason </em>standard does not utilize objective criteria for evaluating parental fitness, it lacks procedural protections sufficient to protect her due process rights. Given our holding that <em>Mason </em>improperly limited the parental presumption in MCL 722.25(1), we find it unnecessary to reach defendant\u2019s constitutional argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">We conclude that <em>Mason </em>erred by reading a fitness requirement into the parental presumption in MCL 722.25(1). The statute is entirely silent on the issue of a parent\u2019s fitness.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Nothing in the statute or the CCA generally<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> suggests that parental fitness is a prerequisite to entitlement to the parental presumption in MCL 722.25(1). Because <em>Mason\u2019s </em>holding was neither constitutionally mandated nor consistent with the statute, <em>Mason </em>is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">D. ADDITIONAL CONCERNS</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Justice CORRIGAN\u2019s partial concurrence raises a number of issues that we believe deserve a response regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>scope of this opinion. We offer the following observations to more explicitly address what this opinion does <em>not </em>do:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">(1) This case deals with custody actions initiated under the CCA involving both the parental presumption in MCL 722.25(1) and the established custodial environment presumption in MCL 722.27(l)(c). This opinion should not be read to extend beyond CCA cases that involve conflicting presumptions or to cases that involve parental rights generally but are outside the scope of the CCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">(2) This opinion does not create any new rights for parents. The United States Supreme Court decisions regarding the constitutional rights of parents previously discussed in this opinion provide guidance that informs our analysis. This opinion does not magically grant parents additional rights or a constitutional presumption in their favor. It does not grant unfit parents constitutional rights to their children other than due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">(3) Parents may not bring actions under the CCA and invoke the parental presumption in MCL 722.25(1) as an end run around previous custody determinations. We agree with Justice CORRIGAN\u2019S conclusion that [principles of collateral estoppel generally prevent a party from relitigating an issue already established in a prior proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> This Court has long recognized the applicability of these principles to probate court orders such as the guardianship orders in this case.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Subsequently, we reiterated that \u201corders of probate courts have the force and effect of judgments and are <em>res judicata </em>of the matters involved and cannot be attacked collaterally.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Therefore, a parent whose rights have been terminated or suspended cannot initiate an action for custody under the CCA because it would amount to a collateral attack on the earlier proceedings. A termination order, by its nature, finds that custody with the natural parent is not in the child\u2019s best interests. A parent\u2019s only recourse in such cases is to appeal the order. A guardianship order, similarly, suspends a parent\u2019s parental rights and grants those rights in the child, including a right to physical and legal custody, to the guardian under MCL 700.5215. Thus, defendant in this case would have been collaterally estopped from initiating a custody action under the CCA. A parent\u2019s recourse under these circumstances is to file a motion to terminate the guardianship.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">In sum, collateral estoppel principles provide a sufficient basis to preclude parents from initiating an action for custody under the CCA in order to circumvent valid court orders affecting custody.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Art\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>IV PLAINTIFF\u2019S BURDEN OF PROOF ON REMAND</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Given our conclusion that <em>Mason </em>incorrectly interpreted MCL 722.25(1), we remand this case for reevaluation under the correct legal standards.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> On remand, the circuit court shall conduct a new best interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>hearing in which it must consider all relevant, up-to-date information.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> At that hearing, the court shall apply MCL 722.25(1) in defendant\u2019s favor. The court shall not grant custody to plaintiffs unless plaintiffs demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that custody with defendant does not serve the children\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> In order to make this showing, plaintiffs must prove that \u201call relevant factors, including the existence of an established custodial environment and all legislatively mandated best interest concerns within [MCL 722.23], taken together clearly and convincingly demonstrate that the child\u2019s best interests require placement with the third person.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">We hold that the established custodial environment presumption in MCL 722.27(l)(c) must yield to the parental presumption in MCL 722.25(1). The parental presumption can be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence that custody with the natural parent is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>in the best interests of the child. We also hold that MCL 722.25(1) satisfies constitutional scrutiny under <em>Troxel. </em>Due process does not require a threshold determination of parental fitness in custody cases. The Court of Appeals decision in <em>Mason </em>v <em>Simmons </em>is overruled. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the circuit court for a new best interests hearing. We do not retain jurisdiction. Finally, defendant\u2019s motion to preserve the confidentiality of the psychiatric evaluation report is granted. The report shall be removed from the copies of the plaintiffs\u2019 appendix and placed under seal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b334-4\">Cavanagh, Young, Markman, and Hathaway, JJ., concurred with Kelly, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-10\"> MCL 722.21 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b305-11\"> \u201cDefendant\u201d herein refers to appellant Tammy Jo Hunter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b305-12\"> <em>Mason v Simmons, </em>267 Mich App 188; 704 NW2d 104 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b306-8\"> Tammy obtained a divorce from Jeff while he was incarcerated in Indiana.

Michigan appears to fall near the middle of the spectrum. At one end are the strict \u201cparental rights\u201d jurisdictions, which base a parent\u2019s right to custody on the fitness of the parent. At the opposite end are the \u201cbest interests\u201d jurisdictions, which base custody exclusively on the child\u2019s needs and welfare. The standards in between usually give preference to the biological parent through a rebuttable presumption that the best interests of the child are served by giving custody to the natural parent. See, generally, Anno: <em>Award of custody where contest is between child\u2019s parents and grandparents, </em>31 ALR3d 1187, 1197-1198; <em>In re Guardianship of Jane Doe, </em>93 Hawaii 374, 384-385; 4 P3d 508 (Hawaii App, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Under the doctrine most deferential to natural parents, the parents are entitled to the custody of their children unless (1) it clearly appears that they are unfit, (2) they have abandoned their right to custody, or (3) \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d exist that require they be deprived of custody. <em>Id.; Ex parte GC, </em>924 So 2d 651, 656 (Ala, 2005) (requiring \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d of parental unfitness to rebut the presumption in favor of the natural parent) (citations omitted); <em>State ex rel KF, </em>2009-UT 4, \u00b6 67; 201 P3d 985, 1000 (2009) (requiring evidence of three factors establishing unfitness in order to rebut the presumption in favor of the natural parent). Most courts using this standard rarely evaluate the best interests of the child when resolving the issue. Rebutting the parental presumption in the states using this standard typically hinges on a determination of unfitness. Hence, this standard undoubtedly provides sufficient deference to a natural parent\u2019s decisions regarding the care, custody, and maintenance of his or her child to satisfy <em>Troxel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Michigan, along with many other states, applies an intermediate parental presumption standard that favors the biological parent. It is rooted in the <em>Troxel </em>rationale that custody with the natural parent serves the best interests of the child. Usually, nonparents may rebut the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>presumption favoring the parent only by a showing of clear and convincing evidence that custody with the natural parent is not in the child\u2019s best interests. MCL 722.25(1); <em>In re Guardianship of Doe, </em>93 Hawaii at 385.</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">The standard least deferential to the natural parent\u2019s wishes is often referred to simply as the \u201cbest interests of the child standard.\u201d It focuses on the interests of the child and defines the relative benefits to the child of being with one or the other party. It requires the court to compare the totality of the circumstances of the two potential custodians, usually on the basis of statutory considerations similar to those embodied in MCL 722.23. Courts using this standard typically grant custody by determining, by a preponderance of the evidence, which placement is in the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"AF\">The states that use this best interests of the child standard often give some deference to the natural parent. But they are less deferential to the natural parent\u2019s wishes than Michigan is in MCL 722.25(1). For example, Or Rev Stat 109.119 (2007) provides a parental presumption. But it allows a third party having an established parent-child relationship with the child to rebut it. The third party need produce a mere preponderance of the evidence that granting custody to the third party is in the best interests of the child. The Oregon Supreme Court upheld the statute in the face of a due process challenge based on <em>Troxel.

Rather, in the context of motions to terminate a guardianship or to modify custody in favor of a natural parent, many courts have distinguished <em>Troxel </em>because it \u201cwas concerned with judicial interference in the day-to-day child-rearing decisions of fit, custodial parents.... It did not address situations in which the parent no longer has custody.\u201d <em>In re MJK, </em>200 P3d 1106, 1109 (Colo App, 2008), citing In <em>re Guardianship of LV, </em>136 Cal App 4th 481, 493; 38 Cal Rptr 3d 894 (2006); see also <em>In re MNG, </em>113 SW3d 27, 33 (Tex App, 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b322-9\"> Defendant would have the Court require a demonstration of parental unfitness before allowing the parental presumption to be rebutted where no such demonstration is required by the statute.

Under Justice Corrigan\u2019s approach, a parent who is deemed unfit by a court or admits being unfit at any time is never entitled to benefit from the parental presumption in MCL 722.25(1). Thus, defendant in this case is not entitled to the presumption in her favor because \u201cdefendant\u2019s unfitness was clearly established at prior proceedings.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 298. Justice Corrigan\u2019s approach is contrary to <em>Fletcher\u2019s </em>mandate that a court consider up-to-date information \u201cand any other changes in circumstances\u201d when making custody determinations. Fletcher, 447 Mich at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Our position is not that <em>Fletcher </em>precludes a circuit court from taking into account a past finding of parental unfitness. <em>Post </em>at 297 n 13. Surely, when a court evaluates the best interest factors in MCL 722.23, a past finding may still he considered. Determinations of past, admitted unfitness are inevitably reconsidered when there are ongoing proceedings before the court. Indeed, as Justice Corrigan observes, \u201ca parent\u2019s fitness or custody rights are governed by an ongoing proceeding \u2014 such as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>guardianship proceeding here ....\u201d <em>Post </em>at 284-285. We do not ourselves opine on whether \u201cdefendant\u2019s lack of fitness here diminished ....\u201d <em>Post </em>at 297 n 13. We simply observe that the judge overseeing the guardianship proceedings acknowledged such a progression in his increasingly generous visitation orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Thus, our main disagreement with Justice Corrigan\u2019s conclusion is the extent to which she would make a prior finding of unfitness largely dispositive in resolving the conflicting presumptions in the CCA. Here, plaintiffs relied primarily on defendant\u2019s past conduct as a basis for opposing her requests for increased visitation. Nevertheless, the court overseeing the guardianship proceedings repeatedly ruled in defendant\u2019s favor. During those proceedings, defendant was fulfilling increasing duties to her children and gaining increased visitation time. By complying with what the court required of her, defendant properly attempted to overcome the prior finding of unfitness that plaintiffs rely on heavily in this custody action. Indeed, had defendant filed a motion to terminate the guardianship under MCL 700.5208, her admission of unfitness would have been relevant. But the relevance would have been only to the extent that it still affected the best interests of the children. Justice CORRIGAN states that defendant\u2019s current fitness may certainly be given weight during the best interests analysis. <em>Post </em>at 297 n 13. Yet she would make the initial admission of unfitness dispositive of which presumption controls when an established custodial environment has been established and \u201cwhen a parent\u2019s lack of fitness continues over time .. ..\u201d <em>Post </em>at 298 n 13. This case is an apt illustration of how such an analysis begs the question. Is the establishment of the established custodial environment due to the parent\u2019s unfitness sufficient in itself? It would appear not, because the parent\u2019s lack of fitness must also \u201ccontinue!] over time.\u201d In this case, has defendant\u2019s \u201clack of fitness,\u201d diminished as the probate court found it to be, extended over a long enough time?

However, when a parent\u2019s lack of fitness has been previously established or admitted <em>and </em>a third party has an established custodial environment with the child, that parent should not benefit from the presumption in \u00a7 5(1).

Plaintiffs thus gained rights and responsibilities akin to those of a parent with regard to the children under MCL 700.5215, which states, in most pertinent part: \u201cA minor\u2019s guardian has the powers and responsibilities of a parent who is not deprived of custody of the parent\u2019s minor and unemancipated child. . . .\u201d See MCL 700.5206(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Defendant could have regained custody of the children by substantially complying with her placement plan, in which she promised to seek drug treatment and provide a drug-free household for the children.

Although they petitioned to terminate the limited guardianship in May 2003, the court denied their petition and, instead, ordered them to continue drug treatment, verify their employment, and maintain more regular visitation with the children. Nonetheless, they returned to crime. They were arrested.

On June 17, 2003, the court conducted a hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 petition. Neither parent appeared and their whereabouts were unknown. The court suspended their visitation rights until further order. On July 16, 2003, the court appointed plaintiffs full guardians of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Defendant and her husband were subsequently rearrested and incarcerated. Defendant apparently skipped bail again after her second release. She was ultimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>convicted and imprisoned in August 2004. In July 2005, after her release from prison, defendant sought visitation with her children. By this time she had not seen them in over two years. The court restored her visitation rights in November 2005 and defendant began paying a small amount of child support. After several months of successful visits and regular child support payments, the court ordered expanded, unsupervised parenting time to begin in May 2006, with overnight visits at defendant\u2019s home in Indiana to begin in July 2006. By this time, the children had been living with plaintiffs in Michigan for about four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In May 2006, apparently prompted by the order increasing defendant\u2019s visitation rights, plaintiffs exercised their rights under MCL 722.26b to seek custody under the CCA and to stay the guardianship proceedings. MCL 722.26b(4). Defendant counterclaimed for custody under the CCA. The court employed the now-outdated rubric in <em>Mason v Simmons, </em>267 Mich App 188; 704 NW2d 104 (2005), to declare defendant unfit and award custody to plaintiffs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">II. SUPERIOR JURISDICTION OF PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">First, I agree that the guardianship proceedings here precluded defendant from separately seeking custody under the CCA. <em>Ante </em>at 276. Generally, when two courts have concurrent jurisdiction, the first court that acquired jurisdiction retains it until the matter is fully resolved. See <em>Schell v Schell, </em>257 Mich 85, 88; 241 NW 223 (1932).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, if a parent\u2019s fitness or custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>rights are governed by an ongoing proceeding \u2014 such as the guardianship proceeding here or a child protective proceeding under the juvenile code \u2014 the parent may not separately invoke the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction by filing a simultaneous custody action under the CCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Because this holding is a crucial element of the majority opinion, I offer an example to illustrate the importance of this jurisdictional rule. Child protective proceedings under the juvenile code are designed to protect children from abuse and neglect \u2014 often by temporarily removing them from their parents\u2019 custody under emergency conditions \u2014 while aiding parents to rectify unfit conditions and regain custody of their children. The purposes of these proceedings would be nullified if a parent could avoid them by regaining custody in a separate proceeding under the CCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The juvenile code protects children who, among other things, are subjected to abuse, neglect, or unfit living conditions. MCL 712A.2(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The code empowers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>the Department of Human Services (DHS) to petition for temporary removal of a child from his parent\u2019s home for these reasons. The court may authorize the petition \u201cupon a showing of probable cause that 1 or more of the allegations in the petition are true and fall within the provisions of section 2(b) . . ..\u201d MCL 712A.13a(2). If the court orders the child\u2019s removal from the parent\u2019s custody and orders the child into court or state custody, a process begins during which the DHS works with the parent, if possible, to restore custody with the parent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As I will explain further, this process is statutorily designed to take up to one year. See MCL 712A.19a(l). Within 30 days of the child\u2019s removal, and every 90 days thereafter, the DHS must provide service plans detailing its efforts and the services provided to prevent removal or to rectify the conditions that caused removal, as well as the efforts to be made and services to be offered to facilitate the child\u2019s return to his parent, if appropriate. MCL 712A.18f. The court generally reviews the case within 182 days of the child\u2019s removal and every 91 days thereafter. MCL 712A.19(3). At each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>review hearing, the court must evaluate the parent\u2019s compliance with the service plan, MCL 712A.19(6) and (7), and may order additional services or actions, MCL 712A.19(7)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">If a child remains outside his home, the court must conduct a permanency planning hearing within one year of the child\u2019s removal. MCL 712A.19a(l). At that hearing, if the court determines that the \u201creturn of the child to his or her parent would not cause a substantial risk of harm to the child\u2019s life, physical health, or mental well-being, the court shall order the child returned to his or her parent.\u201d MCL 712A.19a(5). If the court determines that the parent poses a substantial risk to the child, it may order the DHS to initiate proceedings to terminate parental rights. MCL 712A.19a(6). If termination is not in the child\u2019s best interests, the court may also consider alternative placement plans, including a guardianship. MCL 712A.19a(7). Crucially, the burden of proof is elevated to clear and convincing evidence only at this final stage, the termination of parental rights proceeding. MCL 712A.19b(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Because of the different evidentiary standards in the CCA and the juvenile code, a parent could subvert child protective proceedings if the <em>Schell </em>rule did not mandate superior jurisdiction in the child protective proceedings. This is because, as noted, the requisite conditions for removal of a child from his parent\u2019s custody under MCL 712A.2(b) of the juvenile code must be proved by \u201ca showing of probable cause,\u201d MCL 712A.13a(2). But, particularly under the majority\u2019s interpretation of the CCA, the DHS or a third party custodian can prevent a parent from regaining custody under the CCA only by rebutting the parental presumption <em>by clear and convincing evidence. </em>MCL 722.25(1). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Because the CCA creates a higher burden for a third party seeking custody, the parent could regain custody under the CCA; while the initial conditions warranting emergency removal may have been supported by <em>probable </em>cause, the DHS may not yet have gathered enough evidence to meet the heightened <em>clear and convincing </em>evidence standard of the statutory presumption in MCL 722.25(1), as would be necessary to prevent the parent from immediately regaining custody. Thus, if the parent could seek custody under the CCA, the Legislature\u2019s carefully crafted child protective process \u2014 which both protects children <em>and </em>ultimately benefits willing parents \u2014 could be nullified.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">A related problem involving guardianships would arise if a parent could invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction under the CCA although the parent\u2019s rights were eligible for termination under the juvenile code. Indeed, although the court may conclude that a child should not be returned to his parent because the parent poses an ongoing substantial risk of harm, the court may place the child with a permanent guardian in lieu of terminating the parent\u2019s rights. MCL 712A.19a(6) and (7)(c). That guardianship may continue until the child is emancipated, MCL 712A.19a(7)(c), and the guardian gains all the traditional parent-like rights and duties inherent in a guardianship established under EPIC, MCL 712A.19a(8). If the natural parent could nonetheless obtain custody under the CCA, the purposes and terms of these pre-termination guardianships would be obviated. Particularly under the majority\u2019s rule, the parent could file under the CCA to shift the burden to the guardian, thereby requiring the guardian to prove by clear and convincing evidence that placement with the parent is not in the child\u2019s best interests. The court\u2019s determination during the child protective proceedings that the parent posed a significant harm to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>child would become irrelevant and the guardian would be forced to litigate in defense of his appointment. In addition to subverting the statutory scheme in favor of pre-termination guardianships, this result likely would cause voluntary guardians to decide against accepting guardianship appointments.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In sum, important, practical reasons undergird the <em>Schell </em>rule and the principles of collateral estoppel addressed by the majority. Once a court attains jurisdiction of a child\u2019s custody under the juvenile code or EPIC, as the first court to attain jurisdiction over these matters, it retains jurisdiction until the proceeding is closed. <em>Schell, </em>257 Mich at 88. A parent cannot simply file separately for custody under the CCA and regain custody by invoking the parental presumption. Permitting a parent to do so would undermine the very purposes of the other statutory schemes addressing custody and child welfare, not to mention the havoc and confusion in courts attempting to properly protect children and adjudicate parental rights under the correct statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Finally, the CCA itself confirms this result by providing a single, explicit exception to the normal application of the <em>Schell </em>rule. MCL 722.26b, which grants a guardian standing to seek custody under the CCA, provides the only apparent context in which a CCA action may override decisions of another court with ongoing jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 rights to the children.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>722.26b(4) explicitly states that, when a guardian seeks custody, \u201cguardianship proceedings concerning that child in the probate court are stayed until disposition of the child custody action\u201d and permits an ensuing circuit court order to supersede probate court orders concerning the guardianship of the child. The CCA does not, in turn, permit a parent with the limited rights inherent in guardianship proceedings to sue for custody or stay the guardianship proceedings. Rather, as the majority notes, a parent\u2019s recourse would lie in his explicit right to petition the probate court to terminate the guardianship under MCL 700.5208.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">III. SECTIONS 5(1) AND 7(l)(c) OF THE CHILD CUSTODY ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Although I agree with the majority on the point just discussed, I disagree with the majority\u2019s resolution of the apparent conflict between MCL 722.25(1) and MCL 722.27(l)(c) as it applies here, where the guardians invoked MCL 722.26b. I certainly agree with the majority, <em>ante </em>at 257, that the \u201cfundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State.\u201d <em>Santosky v Kramer, </em>455 US 745, 753; 102 S Ct 1388; 71 L Ed 2d 599 (1982). And thus, to satisfy constitutional due process standards, the state \u201cmust provide the parents with fundamentally fair procedures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 754; see also <em>ante </em>at 257. But, when a parent\u2019s unfitness has been established, as it was here, fundamentally fair procedures do not require the court to give that parent the full benefit of the parental presumption. Rather, a parent\u2019s rights to a child are limited when he has failed in his duties to that child. In the majority\u2019s own words, neither <em>Troxel </em>nor the majority opinion \u201cgrant[s] <em>unfit </em>parents consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>tutional rights to their children other than due process rights.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 276 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Thus, the presumption that a parent will act in his child\u2019s best interests is a <em>conditional presumption </em>that applies <em>only </em>\u201cso long as a parent adequately cares for\u201d his child. <em>Troxel, </em>530 US at 68 (opinion by O\u2019Connor, J.). Indeed, the parental right derives from a parent\u2019s \u201c \u2018high duty\u2019 \u201d to care for his children. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, when a parent fails to care adequately for his child \u2014 and particularly when third parties carry out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the parent\u2019s high duty in his stead \u2014 the automatic presumption in favor of the parent no longer strictly applies. Therefore, although fit parents benefit from a constitutional presumption that they will \u201cact in the best interests of their children,\u201d <em>Troxel, </em>530 US at 68; <em>ante </em>at 262, the constitutional presumption in favor of <em>fit </em>parents does not imbue the presumption in \u00a7 5(1) of the CCA with heightened constitutional meaning so that it always prevails over the mandate concerning established custodial environments in \u00a7 7(l)(c) without regard to a parent\u2019s fitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">MCL 722.25(1) states that if a child custody dispute \u201cis between the parent or parents and an agency or a third person, the court shall presume that the best interests of the child are served by awarding custody to the parent or parents, unless the contrary is established by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d But the powers of the circuit court in any action under the CCA are also governed by MCL 722.27, which circumscribes the orders a court may enter regarding a complaint for custody. MCL 722.27(1) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>If a child custody dispute has been submitted to the circuit court as an original action under this act or has arisen incidentally from another action in the circuit court or an order or judgment of the circuit court, for the best interests of the child the court may do 1 or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-4\">(a) Award the custody of the child to 1 or more of the parties involved or to others and provide for payment of support for the child, until the child reaches 18 years of age----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">(b) Provide for reasonable parenting time of the child by the parties involved, by the maternal or paternal grandparents, or by others, by general or specific terms and conditions. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">(c) Modify or amend its previous judgments or orders for proper cause shown or because of change of circumstances .... The court shall not modify or amend its previous judgments or orders or issue a new order so as to change the established custodial environment of a child unless there is presented clear and convincing evidence that it is in the best interest of the child. The custodial environment of a child is established if over an appreciable time the child naturally looks to the custodian in that environment for guidance, discipline, the necessities of life, and parental comfort. The age of the child, the physical environment, and the inclination of the custodian and the child as to permanency of the relationship shall also be considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">(d) Utilize a guardian ad litem or the community resources in behavioral sciences and other professions in the investigation and study of custody disputes and consider their recommendations for the resolution of the disputes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">(e) Take any other action considered to be necessary in a particular child custody dispute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">MCL 722.27(l)(c) clearly mandates that the court <em>\u201cshall not </em>modify or amend its previous judgments or orders or issue a new order so as to <em>change the established custodial environment of a child unless there is </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number><em>presented clear and convincing evidence that it is in the best interest of the child.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, \u00a7 (7)(l)(c) expressly <em>deprives the court of the power </em>to change the established custodial environment absent the requisite showing by clear and convincing evidence that such a change is in the child\u2019s best interest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Yet the majority directs circuit courts to ignore this man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>date in <em>all </em>cases where <em>any </em>natural parent \u2014 except one whose parental rights were previously terminated or suspended, <em>ante </em>at 277 \u2014 seeks custody from a third party with an established custodial environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">But in light of the strong mandate expressed in \u00a7 7(l)(c), and because the constitutional parental presumption applies only to <em>fit </em>parents, I would hold that the presumption in \u00a7 5(1) prevails over the mandate in \u00a7 7(l)(c) by necessity <em>only </em>when a <em>fit </em>parent seeks custody from a third person with an established custodial environment. Where an unfit parent is concerned, no statutory or constitutional reason exists to simply ignore \u00a7 7(l)(c) if a third person has an established custodial environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Further, because the constitutional parental presumption applies <em>only </em>to <em>fit </em>parents, a parent\u2019s fitness remains relevant. I acknowledge that the CCA does not refer to fitness. See <em>ante </em>at 273. But this bare observation does not adequately consider the various proceedings at which a parent\u2019s fitness may be questioned\u2014 indeed, it does not consider the very proceedings that likely led to a custodial environment being established with a third party custodian in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\"><em>Troxel </em>equated a fit parent with one who \u201cadequately cares for his or her children.\u201d <em>Troxel, </em>530 US at 68 (opinion by O\u2019Connor, J.). It illustrated the presumption in favor of fit parents as \u201ca presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making life\u2019s difficult decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68 (quotation marks and citation omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ted). Various proceedings call upon courts to make findings, or call upon parents to make admissions, <em>counter </em>to these presumptions in order to fulfill the state\u2019s duties to protect its children. The child protective proceedings described above and guardianship proceedings like this case are good examples of proceedings that, by their nature, may establish a parent\u2019s unfitness. Principles of collateral estoppel generally prevent a party from relitigating an issue already established in a prior proceeding. See <em>Storey v Meijer, Inc, </em>431 Mich 368, 373 n 3; 429 NW2d 169 (1988). Indeed, as the majority observes, this Court has \u201clong recognized\u201d the applicability of collateral estoppel, including to \u201cprobate courts orders such as the guardianship orders in this case.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 276, citing <em>Chapin v Chapin, </em>229 Mich 515; 201 NW 530 (1924). Such orders \u201care <em>res judicata </em>of the matters involved and cannot be attacked collaterally.\u201d <em>In re Ives, </em>314 Mich 690, 696; 23 NW2d 131 (1946). Further, permitting a parent to avoid past findings or admissions of unfitness <em>and nonetheless gain a constitutional advantage despite unfitness </em>clearly runs the risk of endangering the child and compromising state laws aimed at upholding the state\u2019s duties to its child citizens. Most significant to our purposes, if a parent\u2019s lack of fitness has been established, there is no longer a constitutional reason to ignore the mandate in MCL 722.27(l)(c) in favor of MCL 722.25(1). Accordingly, I conclude that in cases where a parent\u2019s lack of fitness was either determined or admitted in a prior proceeding, the parent cannot later claim fitness and benefit from the presumption in \u00a7 5(1) in a proceeding under the CCA.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Here, defendant and her husband admitted unfitness in 2002 when they sought the limited guardianship because they were jobless, addicted to crack, and unable to care for their children. They could have regained custody of the children by substantially complying with their placement plan. Instead, they relapsed, continued their involvement with crime, and failed to appear at the hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 petition to establish a full guardianship.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, defendant\u2019s unfitness was clearly established at prior proceedings. Indeed, defendant admitted her unfitness and willfully forwent her statutorily granted right to regain custody despite the admission. Defendant further could have challenged the results of the guardianship proceedings by appealing, but she did not do so. The court should not now be directed to sweep such findings and admissions under the rug by applying a constitutional presumption in favor of <em>fit </em>parents in an action involving the very people who cared for defendant\u2019s children in the face of her parenting failures. For these reasons I conclude that when, as here, a third party establishes a custodial environment after proof of a parent\u2019s unfitness, the procedure for changing an established custodial environment mandated by MCL 722.27(l)(c) controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>rv conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">In conclusion, I agree with the majority that a <em>fit </em>parent who properly seeks custody under the CCA benefits from the parental presumption in MCL 722.25(1). But, contrary to the majority, I would conclude that, where a parent\u2019s lack of fitness is established, MCL 722.27(l)(c) controls if a third party has an established custodial environment for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Further, if parental or custody rights are governed by other proceedings, a parent is precluded from using the CCA as an end run around such proceedings; rather, the first court to gain jurisdiction over these matters retains jurisdiction. The CCA provides a single exception to this rule in MCL 722.26b, which plaintiffs properly invoked in this case and which permits guardians to seek custody although guardianship proceedings are ongoing. But, finally, I agree with the majority that even when a custody action is properly filed under \u00a7 6b, as here, the circuit court is not bound to award custody to any party. Instead, it has broad discretion to act \u201cfor the best interests of the child . . . .\u201d MCL 722.27(1). Accordingly, the court in its discretion may dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 custody action in light of plaintiffs\u2019 apparent attempt to subvert the ongoing guardianship proceedings in which defendant was fulfilling increasing duties to her children and gaining increased visitation time.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-5\"> The majority observes that all proceedings in this case took place in the Oakland Circuit Court although there were two separate cases: the probate court guardianship case and the circuit court CCA case. It is helpful to note that the Family Division of the Oakland Circuit Court and the Oakland County Probate Court share jurisdiction over selected matters pursuant to a concurrent jurisdiction plan authorized by MCL 600.406. Thus, although probate courts generally have jurisdiction over guardianship proceedings and circuit courts have jurisdiction over CCA proceedings, all the proceedings between the parties in this case effectively took place before the same court. Even absent a concurrent jurisdiction plan, the probate judge assigned to a guardianship matter must be assigned to serve as the circuit court judge in a subsequent CCA case brought by the guardians. MCL 722.26b(5). Here Judge Eugene A. Moore presided over the guardianship proceedings but later disqualified himself in the CCA matter. The CCA proceedings were ultimately presided over by Judge Linda S. Hallmark. Judges Moore and Hallmark are both Oakland County Probate Court judges assigned to the Family Division of the Oakland Circuit Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b336-6\"> By design, limited guardianships give parents the opportunity to correct whatever conditions led them to give up custody of their children and to regain custody upon proof of compliance with a limited guardianship placement plan. MCL 700.5205(2). A parent has the right to petition to terminate the limited guardianship under MCL 700.5208 and, if the parent has \u201csubstantially complied\u201d with the placement plan, the court must terminate the guardianship.

Paternal authority is subordinate to the supreme power of the State. <em>Every child born in the United States has, from the time it comes into existence, a birthright of citizenship which vests it with rights and privileges, entitling it to governmental </em>protection\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">\u201cAnd such government is obligated by its duty of protection, to consult the welfare, comfort, and interests of such child in regulating its custody during the period of its minority.\u201d <em>Mercein v. People, </em>25 Wend. (N. Y.) 64 (35 Am. Dec. 653).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\"><em>The power of parental control, though recognized as a natural right and protected when properly exercised, is by no means an inalienable one. </em>When the \u201cright of custody\u201d is involved between respective claimants for a child, the courts, though in the first instance recognizing <em>prima facie </em>rights of relationship, in the final test are not strictly bound by demands founded upon purely technical claims or naked legal rights, but may and should, in making the award, be governed by the paramount consideration of what is really demanded by the best interests of the child. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Thus <em>Gould </em>emphasized that a child\u2019s rights to be protected from abuse and neglect inform and limit a parent\u2019s rights. As we reiterated 50 years later in <em>Herbstman v Shiftan, </em>363 Mich 64, 67-68; 108 NW2d 869 (1961):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\"><em>A child also has rights, </em>which include the right to proper and necessary support; education as required by law; medical, surgical and other care necessary for his health, morals, or well-being; the right to proper custody by his parents, guardian, or other custodian; and the right to live in a suitable place free from neglect, cruelty, drunkenness, criminality, or depravity on the part of his parents, guardian, or other custodian. It is only when these rights of the child are violated by the parents themselves that the child becomes subject to judicial control. <em>A parent having violated the rights of a child forfeits his right to the custody, control and upbringing of that child; and when the safety and best interests of the child demand it, the rights of the child must be protected by the court. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b348-6\"> The majority opines that \u201cno constitutional protections for third persons underlie the established custodial environment presumption in MCL 722.27(l)(c).\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 263. This may be so. But we should not minimize the importance that the CCA\u2019s terms place on the established custodial environment, which serves a <em>child\u2019s </em>needs. Indeed, an \u201cestablished custodial environment\u201d is defined in terms similar to those used to describe a child\u2019s \u201crights and privileges entitling it to governmental protection,\u201d which obligate the government \u201cto consult the welfare, comfort, and interests of such child in regulating its custody during the period of its minority.\u201d <em>Gould, </em>174 Mich at 670 (quotation marks and citation omitted). An established custodial environment exists under \u00a7 7(1) (c) \u201cif over an appreciable time the child naturally looks to the custodian in that environment for guidance, discipline, the necessities of life, and parental comfort.\u201d Compare the rights of a child listed by <em>Herbstman, </em>363 Mich at 67: \u201cproper and necessary support; education as required by law; medical, surgical, and other care necessary for his health, morals, or well-being; the right to proper custody by his parents, guardian, or other custodian . ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\"> My conclusions here stem from my willingness to agree, for purposes of this analysis, with the majority\u2019s assumption that MCL 722.25(1) and MCL 722.27(l)(c) \u201cirreconcilably conflict\u201d when a parent seeks custody from a third party with an established custodial environment, <em>ante </em>at 273; both provisions appear to mandate action from the court, stating respectively that \u201cthe court <em>shall </em>presume that the best interests of the child are served by awarding custody to the parent,\u201d \u00a7 5(1), and that \u201c[t]he court <em>shall not... </em>change the established custodial environment of a child unless there is presented clear and convincing evidence that it is in the best interest of the child,\u201d \u00a7 7(l)(c). (Emphasis added.) Yet because \u00a7 7 broadly circumscribes the circuit court\u2019s power in <em>all </em>cases under the CCA, I would be more inclined to hold that the prohibition on changing an established custodial environment in \u00a7 7(l)(c) clearly controls, as a textual matter, whenever the terms of both \u00a7 5(1) and \u00a7 7(l)(c) apply in a given case. I do not agree with the majority that, through \u00a7 5(1), the Legislature clearly intended to \u201coffer[] <em>greater </em>protection [than is required by the constitution] to the fundamental parenting rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>natural parents, regardless of whether the natural parents are fit.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 274. Nevertheless, my observations concerning the textual dominance of 7(1) (c) are largely inapposite to my overall conclusion; I am persuaded that, if a <em>fit </em>parent\u2019s custody interests are opposed to those of a third party with an established custodial environment, the parent should benefit from a parental presumption as a matter of <em>constitutional </em>right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b350-4\"> The majority states that my approach is contrary to <em>Fletcher v Fletcher, </em>447 Mich 871, 889; 526 NW2d 889 (1994), which required the trial court on remand to consider \u201cup-to-date information\u201d and \u201c(any other changes in circumstances)\u201d when awarding custody. See <em>ante </em>at 277 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>n 61. I have no objection to the <em>Fletcher </em>Court\u2019s requirement, which applied to the trial court\u2019s consideration of the best interests factors in MCL 722.23. But I disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that <em>Fletcher </em>precludes a trial court from taking into account a past finding of unfitness when determining whether the presumption in MCL 722.25(1) must prevail over the mandate in MCL 722.27(l)(c) as a constitutional matter. <em>Fletcher </em>addressed <em>only </em>the best interests determination on remand in light of the fact that circumstances may change during the appellate process. See <em>Fletcher, 4\u00c11 </em>Mich at 888-889. Indeed, it expressly prohibited reconsideration of the threshold question whether any party had an established custodial environment for purposes of applying \u00a7 7(l)(c). <em>Id. </em>at 889 n 10 (\u201cWe do not suggest that the events which have taken place during the appellate process give rise to an \u2018established custodial environment\u2019 that... alters the burden of proof in favor of the party who has enjoyed custody during the appeal.\u201d). In no way did <em>Fletcher </em>suggest that the threshold issue of a parent\u2019s past, admitted unfitness should be reconsidered over time in order to alter the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The majority further states that I would \u201cmake the initial admission of unfitness dispositive\u201d although defendant \u201cwas fulfilling increasing duties to her children and gaining increased visitation time.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 278 n 61. First, I would note that \u2014 just as the majority asserts that the established custodial environment may be given weight when the court considers the best interests factors, <em>ante </em>at 279 n 65 \u2014 defendant\u2019s current, apparently increasing ability to care for her children should certainly be given weight during this process. Second, to the extent that the majority suggests that a past admission of unfitness should not be dispositive because defendant\u2019s lack of fitness here diminished and should be reconsidered over time, I note that defendant admitted her unfitness in 2002, had no contact with her children at all for approximately two years during 2003-2005, was released from prison in July 2005, and had been back in contact with her children for only about six months when plaintiffs filed their complaint for custody in May 2006. By this time, the children had been living with plaintiffs in Michigan for about four years. Accordingly, I emphasize my conclusion that a past admission of unfitness is not dispositive <em>in itself. </em>Rather, by its terms the mandate in \u00a7 7(l)(c) \u2014 which circumscribes the court\u2019s power to \u201c[mjodify or amend its previous judgments or orders\u201d and specifically to \u201cmodify or amend its previous judgments or orders or issue a new order so as to change the established custodial environment\u201d \u2014 controls <em>only </em>when a prior admission of unfitness led to additional circumstances and court orders creating an established custodial environment with a third party. Indeed, by definition, the prohibition on changing the established custo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>dial environment in \u00a7 7(l)(c) applies only when a parent\u2019s lack of fitness continues over time so that third parties take on the parental role and establish a custodial environment \u2014 such an environment is established only if <em>\u201cover an appreciable time </em>the child naturally looks to the custodian in that environment for guidance, discipline, the necessities of life, and parental comfort.\u201d MCL 722.27(l)(e) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b352-6\"> Plaintiffs aptly observe that defendant\u2019s lack of fitness was the direct cause of their appointment as guardians \u2014 a status that bestows rights akin to parental rights. MCL 700.5215. They further note that defendant\u2019s absence from her children\u2019s lives thus created the very established custodial environment with plaintiffs that defendant now seeks to delegitimize by applying the constitutional presumption in favor of <em>fit </em>parents.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
