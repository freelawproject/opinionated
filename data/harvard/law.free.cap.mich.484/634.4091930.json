Because we conclude that the only appropriate forum to determine whether respondent vacated his judicial office is a quo warranto action filed by the Attorney General in the Court of Appeals, we reject the JTC\u2019s recommendation as to the vacation of office claim. Respondent\u2019s conduct concerning the comment and two drawings was unquestionably inappropriate; however, a majority of this Court concludes that respondent\u2019s conduct did not rise to the level of blatant judicial misconduct requiring the most severe sanction: removal from office. In this respect, we view respondent\u2019s actions as an aberration given his 35 years of apparently unblemished service as judge of the 63rd District Court. Accordingly we impose public censure only.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Respondent is a judge of the 63rd District Court, 1st Division, in Rockford, Michigan. On February 14, 2008, the JTC filed Formal Complaint No. 84,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging that respondent had committed judicial misconduct in violation of Const 1963, art 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>\u00a7 20;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MCR 9.104<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and MCR 9.205;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct (MCJC), Canons l,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>2(A) through (C),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 3A(3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Specifically, the first count of the complaint alleged that respondent vacated his judicial office in violation of Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 20<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> when he changed his primary residence from Cannon Township, which is located in the 1st Division of the 63rd District Court, to Ada Township, which is located in the 2nd Division of the same judicial district.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The second count of the corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>plaint alleged that respondent failed to comply with statutory notification requirements when he failed to change his driver\u2019s license information and voter registration to reflect his move to Ada Township.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The third count of the complaint alleged that respondent engaged in sexually inappropriate conduct directed toward female court employees, citing three specific examples. In the first instance, it was alleged that respondent drew female breasts on a note that was attached to a court file. The drawing was made after a female clerk commented on the revealing dress of a woman who appeared in court. The second event concerned the drawing of a penis that appeared on a note attached to a court file. The third instance occurred during a retirement party for an employee at the 2nd Division courthouse. While at the party, respondent commented on a university sweatshirt worn by a female <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>clerk employed in the 2nd Division. Respondent stated that the woman had \u201can awfully small chest\u201d for the college indicated on the sweatshirt and \u201cshould have gone to a smaller school like Alma,\u201d which would have fit her \u201csmall chest better.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">On March 5, 2008, this Court appointed the Honorable Casper O. Grathwohl as master to hear the case. The master\u2019s report, issued on May 12, 2008, concluded that respondent vacated his judicial office in violation of Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 20 when he changed his principal residence from the 1st Division to the 2nd Division of the 63rd District Court in August 2005. The master recommended that the second count of the complaint be dismissed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The master further concluded that respondent\u2019s \u201csexual doodles and sexual communication\u201d constituted judicial misconduct and compromised the integrity of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Respondent filed objections to the master\u2019s report. The JTC issued its decision and recommendation for an order of discipline on October 17, 2008. The JTC adopted the master\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, with the exception of finding that respondent had moved to the 2nd Division \u201cas early\u201d as 2000. In making this factual finding, the JTC relied on documentary evidence that was offered solely for impeachment purposes in the proceedings before the master, but was not substantively admitted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On the basis of the findings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>fact and conclusions of law, the JTC recommended that respondent be removed from office. The JTC further recommended that respondent be assessed fees and costs in the amount of $8,364.38 because respondent \u201cengaged in deceit and intentional misrepresentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">This Court reviews the recommendations and findings of the JTC de novo.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The standard of proof in judicial disciplinary proceedings is a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">A. VACATION OF OFFICE</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 20, provides that \u201c[wjhenever a justice or judge removes his domicile beyond the limits of the territory from which he was elected or appointed, he shall have vacated his office.\u201d The parties agree that the term \u201cdomicile\u201d refers to respondent\u2019s primary residence. Furthermore, respondent <em>admits </em>that he changed his primary residence to the second election division from 2005 to 2008.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The dispute centers on the meaning of the word \u201cterritory.\u201d Respondent argues that \u201cterritory\u201d refers to the entire 63rd Judicial District, while the JTC argues that the term is limited to the election division within the district. Thus, when respondent moved his primary residence from the first election division to the second election division of the 63rd District Court, the JTC maintains that respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>vacated his office, possessed no authority to continue to serve as a judge, and functioned as a \u201cnonjudge masquerading as a judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">However, this Court need not address which argument is correct, nor reach a conclusion regarding whether respondent vacated his office because our statutes, caselaw, and court rules provide that a quo warranto action brought by the Attorney General in the Court of Appeals <em>is the only appropriate and exclusive proceeding to make the preliminary determination regarding whether respondent vacated or unlawfully held his judicial office.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">MCL 600.4501 provides that the Attorney General shall bring an action for quo warranto \u201cwhen the facts clearly warrant the bringing of the action.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> MCR 3.306(A)(1) provides that the quo warranto action <em>must </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>be brought in the Court of Appeals when a person \u201cusurps, intrudes into, or unlawfully holds or exercises a state office\u201d or if a state officer \u201cdoes or suffers an act that by law works a forfeiture of the office.\u201d If a quo warranto action claims usurpation of office, the judgment \u201cmay determine the right of the defendant to hold the office.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, if a defendant in a quo warranto proceeding is found to unlawfully hold or exercise the office at issue, the defendant may be assessed fines<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and damages<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> in addition to being ousted from office. Significantly, our caselaw has held for more than a century that \u201c[t]he <em>only way </em>to try titles to office finally and conclusively is by <em>quo warranto. </em>\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Notwithstanding, the JTC asks this Court to make the prefatory determination that respondent vacated his office under Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 20, and that he consequently \u201cwas no longer a judge\u201d and acted \u201cwithout judicial authority,\u201d as a basis of removing respondent from office for judicial misconduct. However, this determination is <em>precisely </em>the issue to be resolved in a quo warranto action. While this Court could certainly review on appeal the decision made by the Court of Appeals in a quo warranto action,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and could determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>whether the conduct surrounding respondent\u2019s forfeiture of office rose to the level of judicial misconduct warranting judicial discipline,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> an original proceeding in the Supreme Court<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> is not the appropriate place to determine in the first instance <em>whether </em>respondent vacated his office. Rather, the law requires that this question be initiated by the Attorney General and resolved as an initial matter by the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Consequently, all evidence and testimony obtained during the proceeding by the JTC regarding whether respondent had vacated his office was obtained through an unconstitutional process because the JTC has no authority to proceed on the quo warranto issue or to determine whether respondent vacated his office. That determination can only be made by the Court of Appeals in a quo warranto proceeding, which could then be appealed to this Court. If a quo warranto action has been successfully brought in the Court of Appeals, and that decision is affirmed by this Court, only then may the JTC act on the appellate court decision and determine whether there has been any judicial misconduct associated with the determination of the Court of Appeals that a judge has vacated his or her office.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Moreover, had the Michigan Supreme Court decided in a quo warranto appeal that respondent <em>had </em>vacated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>his office, the Supreme Court would have had the power to remove respondent from office, and, had that happened, any JTC proceeding regarding judicial misconduct involving the vacation of office would have been moot because the Supreme Court had already exercised the most severe punishment. Simply put, the JTC had the cart before the horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Just as the JTC has neither the authority nor the power to decide whether a judge vacated his or her office, this Supreme Court does not have any constitutional authority to grant that authority and power to the JTC. The JTC only has the authority to let the quo warranto process lawfully proceed to a legal determination of whether or not a judge has vacated his or her office.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">With regard to our conclusion in this regard, we reject Justice MARKMAN\u2019s attempt to characterize the JTC as having made a \u201cdetermination\u201d to which this Court must defer. The JTC only has the authority to \u201crecommend\u201d disciplinary action. Justice MARKMAN\u2019s attempt to couch our \u201crejection\u201d as unbelievable is improper. Indeed, Justice MARKMAN asserts that a majority of this Court errs in its review of the JTC decision by \u201caffording] <em>no deference whatsoever </em>to the commission\u2019s factual findings.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 655 (emphasis added). To be precise, while this Court has a <em>duty to review </em>a recommendation, as to the deference afforded the JTC after this Court reads the recommendation, there is no <em>duty to accept, </em>or to defer, to any part of the JTC\u2019s recommendation. This Court has no duty to accept, even in part, any JTC \u201cdecision\u201d because the JTC does not have the power to decide how and whether to discipline a judge; the JTC can only make <em>recommendations </em>to this Court and, in this regard, our review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>JTC recommendations is de novo.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>In re Somers, </em>384 Mich 320, 323; 182 NW2d 341 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">As established in Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">On recommendation of the judicial tenure commission, the supreme court may censure, suspend with or without salary, retire or remove a judge for conviction of a felony, physical or mental disability which prevents the performance of judicial duties, misconduct in office, persistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>failure to perform his duties, habitual intemperance or conduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">For comparison purposes, consider this scenario: if the JTC believes a judge has committed armed robbery, it has no authority to proceed to determine whether or not the judge did commit armed robbery. Only the criminal judicial system guided by statutes and court rules has the authority to make that determination. If the court process legally determines a judge is guilty of armed robbery, only then can the JTC recognize the legally determined fact that the judge committed the crime and only then can the JTC bring a proceeding for judicial misconduct on the basis of the court\u2019s ruling that a judge committed the crime of armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">B. CONDUCT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE JTC</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">On January 16, 2008, the executive director of the JTC personally served respondent with a 28-day notice pursuant to MCR 9.207(D)(1).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The executive director arrived unannounced at respondent\u2019s chambers accompanied by an armed Michigan State Police lieutenant. Apparently, unbeknownst to either respondent or the director, the police officer recorded the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The director presented respondent with the 28-day notice, and asserted that respondent\u2019s office was \u201cvacant\u201d because respondent had moved outside his district, as evidenced by his homestead tax exemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>affidavit.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In addition to the notice, respondent was also presented with a petition for interim suspension without pay, which the director indicated would be immediately filed and mostly likely granted because respondent was \u201cnot in office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The director then offered respondent the \u201copportunity to resolve\u201d the matter quickly without any \u201cshame, proceedings, [or] accusations of perjury\u201d by resigning \u201cimmediately,\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> presenting respondent with a prepared resignation letter on respondent\u2019s court letterhead. The director stated that, although the JTC indicated that respondent had until 9:00 a.m. the next morning to sign the resignation letter, the director would \u201cprefer\u201d to have the resignation letter signed \u201cright now\u201d so that he could \u201ctake the letter with\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">When the respondent protested, seeking \u201ctime to talk to somebody,\u201d the director replied that respondent would be \u201csuspended in a matter of days\u201d and that it would all \u201cbecome public\u201d at a time when respondent was \u201cup for election.\u201d The director reiterated the 9:00 a.m. deadline, adding that respondent also faced allegations involving the sexually inappropriate behavior, and the director would get respondent \u201cthrown off [the bench] just for that.\u201d When respondent asked questions regarding the basis of the allegations of sexually inappropriate behavior, the director replied that he was not there \u201cto do any type of interview\u201d and would not \u201cexplain anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The director told the respondent that he could \u201ctake the easy way out\u201d and sign the resignation letter; otherwise, the director \u201cwelcome[d] the opportunity\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>and would \u201cengage to the fullest\u201d if respondent chose to \u201cfight it.\u201d When respondent observed that criminal defendants were given \u201cmore consideration\u201d than was being afforded to him, the director responded that immediately signing the resignation letter would \u201cavoid having to drag [respondent\u2019s] name through the mud,\u201d \u201cavoid any embarrassing situations,\u201d and avoid the \u201cstain to the state judiciary\u201d of having a judge who \u201cviolates the law, commits perjury, [and] sexually harasses staff.\u201d After respondent refused to sign the resignation letter on the spot, the meeting concluded. A moment later, the director was heard saying that \u201cit\u2019s like shooting ducks in a barrel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">When these proceedings commenced, the director\u2019s threats to humiliate respondent and drag his name through the mud were soon realized. The details of the present allegations were widely disseminated in the local newspapers, on television, and on the Internet over the course of several months. The controversy, including the facts surrounding the meeting between respondent and director, were the subject of numerous newspaper articles, editorials, and letters to the editor.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> While the actions of the JTC director have been called into question, this Court need not address whether he violated any ethical rules because the proper forum for the review of the JTC director\u2019s actions is the Attorney Grievance Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>c. inappropriate drawings and comment</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">The remaining allegation of judicial misconduct concerns respondent\u2019s sexually inappropriate conduct directed toward female court employees. The testimony indicates that on two separate occasions respondent made lewd drawings \u2014 one of female breasts and one of a penis \u2014 on notes that were attached to two court files. The testimony further indicates that respondent commented on the small chest size of a 2nd Division female employee during a retirement party at the 2nd Division courthouse. Notably, even respondent realized he had made a mistake because he called the employee the following day to apologize personally to her. Unfortunately, she would not return his calls, so he finally left a message on her voice mail apologizing for the gaffe.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Respondent\u2019s counsel acknowledged that respondent\u2019s conduct was \u201cinappropriate,\u201d but contended that it was spontaneous and represented \u201cisolated\u201d incidents from respondent\u2019s nearly 37-year career. Respondent\u2019s counsel argues that respondent\u2019s conduct warrants, at most, a public reprimand. This argument is consistent with the recommendations of the JTC, which indicated that with respect to count 3, respondent\u2019s sexually inappropriate conduct merited a public censure.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">We agree with the JTC that respondent\u2019s sexual conduct was crass and inappropriate; however, we do not agree that respondent\u2019s conduct rises to the level of judicial misconduct beyond requiring public censure.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">D. VERACITY OF RESPONDENT\u2019S TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">While Justice Markman appears to assert that whether or not the JTC had the authority to proceed, sanctions against respondent are appropriate given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Justice MARKMAN\u2019s conclusion that respondent lied under oath. Having reviewed the entire record closely, we do not agree with Justice MARKMAN\u2019s conclusion that respondent lied under oath.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> On the contrary, we agree with respondent\u2019s counsel that this is not a case of arrogance. Instead, it appears that respondent believed that he was still properly in his district and that there was no problem with living outside of the 1st Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">At the time these proceedings occurred, respondent had seven residences. He owned homes in both the 1st and 2nd divisions of the 63rd District Court. He rented a home in the 1st Division, and he also owned homes in Whitefish Lake, Michigan; Ludington, Michigan; North Carolina; and Florida. Respondent testified that he renovates houses as a hobby, and that from 2000 to 2005, he often spent the night at one of the two houses he was renovating in the 2nd Division when he was too tired to drive back to his 1st Division residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Thus, during this five-year period, respondent testified that he went back and forth between the houses as necessary for the remodeling projects. Certainly he cannot be expected to have to subsequently provide facts establishing that he was residing in one house or two houses after so much time had passed and without being prompted by any particular reason to so do. Again, respondent\u2019s actions in this regard support his perception that it didn\u2019t matter whether he spent the night at the 1st Division house or the 2nd Division house, because he was still residing in the 63rd District.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Respondent admitted that from 2005 on, he resided in the 2nd Division home, and the record reflects that he did nothing to hide this fact. Indeed, respondent\u2019s name, address, and telephone number for the 2nd Division home were listed in the local phone book.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Specifically during a meeting in approximately late March 2006 between respondent, the State Court Administrator, and the JTC executive director, the State Court Administrator, said to respondent, \u201cYou\u2019re not living in your district.\u201d In response, respondent said \u201cI am too.\u201d Importantly, we note that even though respondent was first accused of vacating his judicial office in early 2006, it appears that no assertion was made again until respondent was ambushed on January 16, 2008. Again, respondent did not try to deny the fact that he was living in the 2nd Division at that time, because he thought he could live in that division as long as he was not running for reelection.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Consequently, we do not conclude that respondent lied under oath. At times he seemed confused and could not remember a series of different telephone numbers (until he later refreshed his recollection), specific dates and times, and events that occurred nearly 10 years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>before he testified. In fairness, we cannot conclude that respondent intentionally lied under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Because we conclude that the only appropriate forum to determine whether respondent vacated his judicial office was a quo warranto action filed by the Attorney General in the Court of Appeals, we reject the JTC\u2019s recommendation with respect to the vacation of office claim. Because the JTC lacked legal authority to bypass submission of the quo warranto action by the Attorney General, the finding that respondent vacated his office is null and void. The powers held by the JTC simply do not include the power by the JTC to determine the existence of a vacancy in judicial office.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Finally, with respect to the claim against respondent for judicial misconduct involving a comment and two drawings of a sexual manner, while respondent\u2019s conduct was unquestionably inappropriate, we believe, under the unique circumstances of this case that only public censure is required. Accordingly, this opinion stands as our public censure.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Pursuant to MCR 7.317(C)(3), we direct the Clerk of the Court to issue the judgment order immediately.</p>\n<judges id=\"b708-9\">CAVANAGH and HATHAWAY, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\"> On both January 17, 2008, and February 14, 2008, the JTC filed petitions for interim suspension without pay pending final resolution of this matter.

In doing so, he asserts that it is perfectly appropriate for the JTC to bring an action asserting vacation of office, along with any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>assertions concerning disciplinary conduct. A study of Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30(2), and MCR 9.205(B) contradicts this argument. Specifically, the JTC\u2019s authority is limited to bringing actions against a judge</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">for conviction of a felony, physical or mental disability which prevents the performance of judicial duties, misconduct in office, persistent failure to perform his duties, habitual intemperance or conduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice.

Further, Justice Markman asserts, without citing any authority, that it is perfectly appropriate for a quo warranto complaint to be combined with complaints for <em>judicial misconduct. </em>To the contrary, pursuant to MCR 3.306(A)(1), an action for quo warranto \u201cmust be brought in the Court of Appeals.\u201d MCR 3.306 says nothing about whether the JTC has <em>any </em>legal authority to bring a complaint of quo warranto and a complaint of judicial misconduct in a JTC proceeding. An allegation of quo warranto is not magically converted into another kind of judicial misconduct simply by linking the allegation to actual judicial misconduct complaints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\"> The examiner did not file any objections to the master\u2019s report, as required by MCR 9.215.

There is no support for this argument in MCL 600.4505, and <em>In re Kapcia, </em>389 Mich 306; 205 NW2d 436 (1973), does not support this assertion. Rather, the Court in <em>Kapcia </em>declared that its opinion did not consider whether a quo warranto action by the Court of Appeals was required for a judge who had lost his license to thereafter determine whether the judge had vacated his office. Wisely, that Court recognized the Court of Appeals initial exclusive jurisdiction with respect to quo warranto proceedings. Justice Markman, <em>post </em>at 670 n 16, asserts that <em>Kapcia </em>establishes that the JTC cannot use any other entity\u2019s findings, including those of the Court of Appeals. Again, with respect to a quo warranto proceeding, the JTC <em>has no authority to make a finding </em>that a judge improperly vacated his office. The JTC only has the authority to recommend what disciplinary measure should be exercised by this Court based on the exclusive right of the Court of Appeals to make the determination in a quo warranto proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\"> If the Attorney General refuses to act, a private party may bring the action upon leave of the court.

As Justice Markman accepts, we review the JTC\u2019s recommendations de novo. <em>In re </em>Somers, 384 Mich 320, 323; 182 NW2d 341 (1971). And we are aware of no mandate that this Court give deference to the JTC\u2019s \u201cdecisions.\u201d The Michigan Constitution does not require that we give any deference to the JTC\u2019s \u201cdecisions.\u201d Moreover, we have held that any deference given to the JTC\u2019s \u201crecommendations\u201d is contingent upon us finding that the JTC\u2019s analysis was \u201creasonably done.\u201d <em>In re Chrzanowski, </em>465 Mich 468, 488; 636 NW2d 758 (2001). In this case, for the reasons noted in this opinion, we conclude that the JTC\u2019s analysis fell below the \u201creasonably done\u201d threshold. We have also limited any deference regarding factual findings to the <em>master\u2019s </em>credibility determinations. <em>Loyd, supra </em>at 535-536. That deference was further limited to when the credibility determination was supported by the whole record. <em>Id. </em>We have never articulated a deference requirement toward the JTC\u2019s credibility determinations. This is an important distinction in this case because the JTC did not accept the master\u2019s credibility determinations; instead, it went beyond the master\u2019s conclusions and, as Justice Markman rightly states, \u201cdecided\u201d that respondent had moved out of his division at a date earlier than when the master had determined. Notably, it was this \u201cdecision\u201d on which the JTC hinged its removal recommendation. Thus, any deference to a credibility determination would apply to the master\u2019s findings, assuming that they were supported by the entire record; it would not apply to the JTC\u2019s contrary \u201cdecision.\u201d This is yet another reason for us to conclude that the JTC\u2019s \u201crecommendation,\u201d much less its \u201cdecision,\u201d granted no deference in this case. It is unclear why Justice Markman believes we are required to give the JTC\u2019s \u201cdecisions\u201d deference. Further, assuming Justice Markman is correct that this Court is bound to give some modicum of deference to the JTC\u2019s recommendations, that rule does not apply here because the JTC\u2019s analysis was not reasonably done, and its credibility conclusions are contrary to those of the master.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b702-9\"> The notice must be given 28 days before filing a complaint.

Further, respondent\u2019s failure to change the address on his concealed weapons permit does not establish that he intended to deceive anyone. In the first instance, respondent was <em>renewing </em>his permit. Since November 13, 2001, the date the respondent first applied for the permit, his address remained the same. In fact, as demonstrated by succeeding safety inspection certificates and by his own testimony for succeeding years, respondent did not even pay attention to the address line as it had already been completed for him by the Rockford Chief of Police. All he had to do was sign the permit. Again, rather than a deliberate attempt to deceive officials about his change of address, respondent\u2019s explanation was very credible. Specifically, the failure to change his address was simply an oversight: respondent did not think to read the form and make any corrections, as he admitted that he did not read the form \u2014 he just put the gun and the renewed certificate under the bench.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b708-10\">WEAVER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ack\"><em>{concurring separately). </em>I authored and join the lead opinion; however, I write separately to request that this Court open an administrative file to investigate how this matter unfolded, including the events and actions of the Judicial Tenure Commission (JTC) and/or others responsible leading up to the JTC\u2019s recommendation of this case to this Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b708-11\">Hathaway, J., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>KELLY, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtY\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in </em>part).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> I concur in Justice WEAVER\u2019S lead opinion except for part 11(A) and the portions of the introduction and conclusion discussing quo warranto.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">I agree with Justice MARKMAN that the existence of an action for quo warranto does not prevent the Judicial Tenure Commission from assessing respondent\u2019s misconduct, regardless of whether that conduct happens to in volve the improper exercise of a title to office.

The Court today rejects the unanimous recommendation of the nine-member Judicial Tenure Commission (JTC) to sanction respondent, Judge Steven Servaas, for misconduct that involves moving outside of the district from which he was elected in direct violation of Article 6, \u00a7 20 of the Michigan Constitution, and MCL 600.8201, and thereby fundamentally breaching faith with his constituents; and by then engaging in a pattern and practice of actions to conceal this misconduct, including providing false testimony under oath. Based on the Commission\u2019s findings and on the record below, I agree with the JTC, and disagree with the majority in its refusal to sanction respondent for conduct directly impheating the integrity of the judiciary. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Moreover, in rejecting the JTC\u2019s unanimous determination that respondent bed under oath, the majority affords no deference whatsoever to the Commission\u2019s factual findings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead, the majority engages in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>superficial analysis that does not accurately reflect the record established in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Perhaps most remarkably, in asserting that the JTC lacks jurisdiction to sanction respondent, Justice WEAVER in her lead opinion (albeit not a majority opinion in this regard) concludes that the JTC lacks even the <em>authority </em>to investigate a judge for breaching his or her constitutional obligations, on the grounds that the JTC is forbidden even to undertake actions regarding judicial misconduct if such misconduct could \u201cin the first instance\u201d have been addressed by an alternative legal proceeding, in this case by an action for quo warranto. Justice WEAVER\u2019S assertion is a profoundly distorted interpretation of the JTC\u2019s authority and would significantly circumscribe the commission\u2019s ability to effectively investigate and address instances of judicial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">In January 2008, the JTC initiated proceedings against respondent, asserting that he had moved outside the 1st Division of the 63rd District Court located in Kent County, and from which he had been elected, in violation of the constitution and statutes of this state.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>This belief was premised on respondent having moved his residence to 201 Honey Creek Avenue, a property located in the 63rd District\u2019s 2nd Division. On January 16,2008, the JTC\u2019s examiner, accompanied by an officer from the Michigan State Police, went to respondent\u2019s office to deliver charging papers. The examiner communicated the JTC\u2019s belief that respondent had moved outside his division and, therefore, had vacated his office. The examiner told respondent he could resign by the next day or else be subject to disciplinary proceedings, including an immediate petition for interim suspension without pay. Respondent did not resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">On January 17, 2008, the JTC filed a petition for interim suspension with this Court on the ground that respondent\u2019s residence was outside the 1st Division. The next day, the JTC filed a supplemental petition, arguing that respondent had created a \u201cdangerous situation\u201d by keeping a loaded pistol behind his bench.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This Court unanimously denied this petition on February 1, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">On February 14, 2008, the JTC filed a second petition for interim suspension, setting forth the additional argument that respondent had removed himself from his elected division and also engaged in inappropriate behavior. The JTC also filed a complaint against respondent on the same day. The complaint alleged that respondent had vacated his judicial office by moving his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>residence from the 1st Division to the 2nd Division, and that he was not a registered elector of the division from which he was an elected judge. The complaint also alleged that respondent engaged in misconduct directed toward female court employees. This Court unanimously denied the second petition on April 9, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Pursuant to MCR 9.210(B)(1) we appointed a master to hold hearings and make findings of fact and law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The master held a hearing between March 28, 2008, and April 3, 2008, to determine the merit of the allegations contained in the JTC\u2019s complaint. The master found that respondent had moved to 201 Honey Creek in 2005 in violation of article 6, \u00a7 20 of the Michigan Constitution. By doing so, he was also no longer a \u201cregistered elector\u201d of the 1st Division as required by MCL 600.8201. Thus, the master concluded that respondent had failed to comply with the constitutional and statutory requirements necessary to hold a judicial position, in violation of Canon 2(B) of the Code of Judicial Conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The master also concluded that certain inappropriate drawings and comments on respondent\u2019s part constituted judicial misconduct and compromised the integrity of the court. Respondent then filed objections with the master\u2019s findings to the JTC in accordance with MCR 9.215.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>On October 17, 2008, the JTC unanimously agreed with, and adopted, the master\u2019s findings, except that the commission found that respondent had, in fact, moved to 201 Honey Creek in Ada Township in 2000 rather than 2005.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This finding was based primarily on telephone logs that the examiner had introduced during the master\u2019s hearing. These logs contained telephone numbers that respondent had provided to the district court indicating where he could be located after hours,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and showed that respondent provided his 201 Honey Creek telephone number almost exclusively as his after-hours contact location from 2000 until 2008. From these logs, the JTC concluded that respondent\u2019s consistent listing of 201 Honey Creek as his after-hours location for an eight-year period indicated that he, in fact, had lived at 201 Honey Creek during that time. Moreover, the JTC found that respondent\u2019s assertion that he had not moved outside of his division prior to 2005 demonstrated a \u201clack of candor and honesty,\u201d which amounted to \u201cfalse testimony\u201d as to his residence from 2000 to 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Based on these findings, the JTC recommended that respondent be removed from office. He now challenges that recommendation and argues that this Court lacks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>the authority to sanction him for judicial misconduct because an action for quo warranto constitutes the exclusive legal proceeding to evaluate his title to office before his November 2008 reelection.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">II. QUO WARRANTO</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Justice WEAVER agrees with respondent and asserts that this Court need not decide whether the allegations set forth in the complaint are true \u201cbecause our statutes, caselaw, and court rules provide that a quo warranto action brought by the Attorney General in the Court of Appeals <em>is the only appropriate and exclusive proceeding to make the preliminary determination regarding whether respondent vacated or unlawfully held his judicial office.\u201d Ante </em>at 643 (emphasis in original). In my view, Justice WEAVER misapprehends the nature of the action now before this Court, which is a <em>disciplinary </em>proceeding that the JTC and this Court are constitutionally empowered to pursue, Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30(2), not an action directly concerned with respondent\u2019s current claim to his office.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Most importantly, this Court\u2019s authority to sanction judicial misconduct is not restricted, or otherwise affected in any way, by the existence of an action for quo warranto, which is only available for the purposes of removing from public office an official who fails currently to hold valid title to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>that office. Finally, Justice WEAVER\u2019S assertion that the JTC, in the context of a disciplinary proceeding which involves the validity of a judge\u2019s title to office, <em>must </em>rely on the factual findings of the Court of Appeals in a quo warranto action is directly contrary to this Court\u2019s own guidance in <em>In re Kapcia, </em>389 Mich 306; 205 NW2d 436 (1973), and would undermine the JTC\u2019s duty to make individualized and independent factual findings with regard to whether judicial misconduct has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The JTC is a constitutionally established entity, Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30(1), that was created to assist the people of Michigan, and this Court, in evaluating the conduct and behavior of judges currently holding office throughout this state. Article 6, \u00a7 30(2) of the Michigan Constitution describes the relationship between the JTC and this Court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">On recommendation of the judicial tenure commission, the supreme court may censure, suspend with or without salary, retire or remove a judge for conviction of a felony, physical or mental disability which prevents the performance of judicial duties, <em>misconduct in </em>office, persistent failure to perform his duties, habitual intemperance or conduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice. The supreme court shall make rules implementing this section and providing for confidentiality and privilege of proceedings. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In MCR 9.205(B), this Court has provided guidance to the JTC for determining what constitutes judicial \u201cmisconduct in office\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">A judge is subject to censure, suspension with or without pay, retirement, or removal for conviction of a felony, physical or mental disability that prevents the performance of judicial duties, misconduct in office, persistent failure to perform judicial duties, habitual intemperance, or conduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice. In addition to any other sanction imposed, a judge may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>ordered to pay the costs, fees, and expenses incurred by the commission in prosecuting the complaint only if the judge engaged in conduct involving fraud, deceit, or intentional misrepresentation, or if the judge made misleading statements to the commission, the commission\u2019s investigators, the master or the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">(2) Conduct in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct or the Rules of Professional Conduct may constitute a ground for action with regard to a judge, whether the conduct occurred before or after the respondent became a judge or was related to judicial office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">(3) In deciding whether action with regard to a judge is warranted, the commission shall consider all the circumstances, including the age of the allegations and the possibility of unfair prejudice to the judge because of the staleness of the allegations or unreasonable delay in pursuing the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">In addition, MCR 9.220(B) expressly authorizes the JTC to make both factual and legal determinations regarding whether a judge has committed misconduct that warrants an official sanction, which may range from a private censure to removal from office, and, as noted at note 7 <em>supra, </em>it allows the JTC to adopt the master\u2019s findings in whole or in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Although the JTC and this Court are constitutionally vested with the authority to address <em>all </em>matters of judicial misconduct, Justice WEAVER concludes that this authority is implicitly limited by the existence of an action for quo warranto. Quoting <em>Frey v Michie, </em>68 Mich 323, 327; 36 NW 184 (1888), she notes that the \u201cdetermination can only be made ... in a quo warranto proceeding. . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">As an initial matter, Justice Weaver\u2019s discussion of quo warranto fails to acknowledge that an action for quo warranto is an entirely distinct legal proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>from a disciplinary action initiated by the JTC.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As provided in MCR 3.306(A)(1),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\">[a]n action for quo warranto against a person who usurps, intrudes into, or unlawfully holds or exercises a state office, or against a state officer who does or suffers an act that by law works a forfeiture of the office, must be brought [by the Attorney General] in the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Because an action for quo warranto can be pursued against \u201ca person\u201d who unlawfully holds <em>any </em>\u201cstate office,\u201d including a judgeship, this action, in one sense, has a much broader application than a JTC disciplinary action, which can only be initiated against a judge. However, unlike a JTC proceeding, an action for quo warranto is only available to address a narrowly circumscribed range of judicial misconduct, which is restricted to that calling into question a judge\u2019s title to office. To that extent, an action for quo warranto has a more limited application than a JTC disciplinary action. Perhaps most importantly, the fact that these two actions may sometimes be applicable to the same set of facts, does not alter the distinctive nature of each, and certainly does not indicate that the viability of one is somehow restricted by the existence of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Although respondent\u2019s conduct did call into question his title to office between 2000 and 2008, there is no statutory or constitutional restriction on the JTC\u2019s authority to proceed with an action based upon the misconduct that was represented by his actions. In fact, despite the fact that an action for quo warranto and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>JTC disciplinary action may overlap in their applicability to some instances of judicial misconduct, as they did here prior to the date respondent began serving his new term of office in 2009, Justice WEAVER has supplied no rationale as to why an action for quo warranto, which was created by the Legislature and this Court, should constitute the exclusive means to address such misconduct, especially in view of the fact that the JTC is the only entity that is constitutionally empowered to address <em>all </em>matters of judicial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">In addition to the fact that an action for quo warranto is altogether distinct from a JTC disciplinary proceeding, there are three supportive arguments for why an action for quo warranto has no application in the instant context. First, an action for quo warranto is only applicable to claims that a public official is <em>currently </em>exercising an invalid title to office.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This observation is supported by MCL 600.4505, which describes the nature of a quo warranto action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">(1) In actions brought against persons for usurpation of office, the judgment may determine the right of the defendant to hold the office. If a party plaintiff alleges that he is entitled to the office, the court may decide which of the parties is entitled to hold the office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">(2) If judgment is rendered in favor of a party who is averred to be entitled to the office, he is entitled, after taking the oath of office, and executing any official bond which is required by law, to take the office. Such party shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>be given all the books and papers in the custody of the defendant, or within his power, belonging to the office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Significantly, MCL 600.4505 uses language written exclusively in the active voice, which suggests that the Legislature did not intend for this action to be initiated against a public official who is not currently holding office or who has previously exercised title to his or her office improperly. Indeed, as indicated in MCL 600.4505, and further supported by MCL 600.4511 and MCL 600.4515, an action for quo warranto is most frequently the procedure employed to resolve <em>conflicting </em>claims to office.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> MCL 600.4511 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">When an action is brought against a person for usurping an office and the person rightfully entitled to the office is a party and avers his right to it, and judgment is rendered in his favor, he is entitled to any damages sustained because of the usurpation by the defendant of the office from which the defendant has been evicted. The claim for damages may be joined with the claim for quo warranto, or brought separately within 1 year after the judgment in the action for quo warranto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">MCL 600.4515 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">Whenever any defendant in a quo warranto proceeding is found or adjudged guilty of usurping or intruding into or unlawfully holding or exercising any office, franchise, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>privilege, judgment shall be rendered that the defendant be ousted and altogether excluded from that office, franchise, or privilege. In addition to awarding costs against the defendant, the court may, in its discretion, impose a fine upon the defendant found guilty, not exceeding $2,000.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Thus, MCL 600.4511, again using the active voice, suggests that an action for quo warranto constitutes a procedure intended to resolve conflicting claims to an office, regardless of whether misconduct was involved, by determining which party has the superior current claim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because there is no dispute as to respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number><em>current </em>claim to office, an action for quo warranto has no application to the present facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">Second, MCL 600.4515 provides that the sole remedy for a quo warranto action is that a \u201cjudgment shall be rendered that defendant be <em>ousted... </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> By contrast, a disciplinary action initiated by the JTC can result in a range of sanctions spanning from a simple censure to removal from office, see Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30(2), and the JTC and this Court must ultimately determine what constitutes a \u201creasonable relationship,\u201d or \u201cproportionality,\u201d between particular misconduct and these available sanctions. <em>In re Brown, </em>461 Mich 1291, 1292 (2000). Thus, the inflexible \u201cone size fits all\u201d remedial aspect of a quo warranto action also demonstrates why the disciplinary action being pursued by the JTC is the proper proceeding in which to address respondent\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Third, as this Court concluded in <em>Kapcia, </em>389 Mich at 314, the JTC is prohibited from relying on, or adopting, another entity\u2019s factual findings and conclusions as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>basis for recommending that this Court impose a sanction for judicial misconduct; rather, the JTC must make independent factual findings in this regard. In <em>Kapcia, </em>the Attorney Grievance Commission revoked the respondent\u2019s license to practice law. However, shortly thereafter, the respondent was elected as a probate judge. The JTC, citing the revocation of the respondent\u2019s law license, argued that the respondent had violated article 6, \u00a7 19 of the Michigan Constitution, which requires all judges in this state to have a valid law license.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, the JTC concluded that the respondent had vacated his office and had therefore committed judicial misconduct. This Court rejected that argument, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-4\">Manifestly, this contention begs the question; it presupposes that the removal from office which the [JTC] seeks by these proceedings to accomplish has already occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">The [JTC]\u2019s presentation proceeds on the erroneous assumption that the [JTC] had no choice once it was established that Judge Kapcia had been suspended from the practice of law but to recommend his removal and that this Court, likewise, has no choice but to remove him; that, indeed there truly is nothing before us to consider because the consideration of whether the professional misconduct charged against Judge Kapcia was proven and what to do about it ended when the order of the Grievance Board became final.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">The discipline of judges is confided to the discretion of the [JTC] and this Court under \u00a7 30 of art 6. It is left to [a] case-by-case exercise of discretion to decide whether a justice or judge \u2014 presumably duly licensed to practice law when he qualified as a justice or a judge \u2014 whose conduct results in [the] loss of his right to practice law should be disciplined by removing him from office. [Kapcia, 389 Mich at 314.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Ultimately, <em>Kapcia </em>concluded that the JTC must investigate the facts underlying the Attorney Grievance Commission\u2019s decision to suspend the respondent\u2019s license in order to determine if judicial misconduct had occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\">Thus, had the Commission commenced a proceeding against Judge Kapcia charging him with misconduct based on the acts which gave rise to the State Bar grievance proceedings, the Commission would have been obliged to consider all the circumstances in deciding whether to recommend disciplinary action. The Commission\u2019s responsibility in that regard cannot be avoided by viewing the matter as a <em>fait accompli. </em>Nor can we, by total reliance on the decision reached in the grievance proceedings, escape our responsibility to exercise an individualized judgment. <em>[Id. </em>at 312.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In holding that the JTC cannot escape its responsibility to \u201cexercise an individualized judgment\u201d based on \u201call circumstances,\u201d to determine what disciplinary action is appropriate, <em>Kapcia </em>indirectly observed that the JTC and this Court must possess the authority to examine a judge\u2019s misconduct for actions that may also serve as the basis for a quo warranto action. Specifically, <em>Kapcia </em>distinguished cases on which the JTC had relied, in which judges had been ousted from office for losing their license to practice law, thereby amounting to a vacation of office, because those cases all involved actions for quo warranto. <em>Id. </em>at 313-314. There is simply no reason for this Court to have discussed the proper procedure for pursuing disciplinary actions against the judge in <em>Kapcia, </em>while expressly recognizing that other cases for quo warranto have resulted in ousting a judge from office for losing his or her license, if the JTC is not empowered to make recommendations for disciplinary actions, which this Court is then free to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>accept or reject, based on conduct that could also form the basis of a quo warranto action.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">In contrast to this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Kapcia, </em>the majority states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">While this Court could certainly review on appeal the decision made by the Court of Appeals in a quo warranto action, and could determine whether the conduct surrounding respondent\u2019s forfeiture of office rose to the level of judicial misconduct warranting judicial discipline, an original proceeding in the Supreme Court is not the appropriate place to determine in the first instance <em>whether </em>respondent vacated his office. Rather, the law requires that this question be initiated by the Attorney General and resolved as an initial matter by the Court of Appeals. <em>[Ante </em>at 644-645.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Justice Weaver\u2019s assertion that a quo warranto action is a prerequisite to the JTC\u2019s, and this Court\u2019s, ability to make determinations that respondent committed misconduct, including specifically the vacation of office, by stating that \u201can original proceeding in the Supreme Court is not the appropriate place to determine <em>in the first </em>instance\u201d that misconduct occurred, is exactly counter to Kapcia\u2019s counsel that the JTC\u2019s \u201cresponsibility in that regard cannot be avoided by viewing the matter as a <em>fait accompli.\u201d </em>Rather, the JTC must make independent findings of fact that misconduct occurred, irrespective of another entity\u2019s findings and conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>regarding the same issue. Therefore, even if the Attorney General had successfully pursued a quo warranto action against respondent during his prior term in office, the JTC would <em>still </em>have had to make its own factual findings that respondent vacated his office in a current disciplinary proceeding as a precondition to the conclusion that such a vacation of office constituted judicial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">Justice WEAVER demonstrates her confusion in this regard by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">By analogy, Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30(2) provides that this Court may discipline, retire, or remove a judge for conviction of a felony. It could hardly be argued, however, that this Court rather than the circuit court should adjudicate and convict the judge of the felony simply because the unresolved predicate issue arose during the course of a judicial disciplinary proceeding. <em>[Ante </em>at 645 n 24.].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">This Court does not \u201cconvict a judge of [a] felony\u201d simply because the same facts that support the felony are presented \u201cduring the course of a judicial disciplinary proceeding.\u201d Rather, a disciplinary proceeding against a judge may properly lead to a finding of facts by a preponderance of the evidence that judicial misconduct has occurred, <em>In re Noecker, </em>472 Mich 1, 8; 691 NW2d 440 (2005) (holding that the examiner has \u201cthe burden of proving the allegations by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d), which might otherwise constitute a felony if found by the circuit court beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Justice WEAVER\u2019S example of the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>having to find that a felony actually occurred before the JTC can recommend that the judge be removed for committing a felony does not address the issue now before this Court. Article 6, \u00a7 30(2) of the Michigan Constitution explicitly allows a sitting judge to be removed from office if he is found guilty of a felony. This is one of several specifically enumerated situations in the constitution that effectively establish a substituted process, i.e., a process allowing the JTC and this Court, to view something as a <em>\u201cfait accompli\u201d </em>without requiring an individualized fact-finding process to determine that a judge has engaged in misconduct.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Kapcia, </em>389 Mich at 313. Notably, however, an action for quo warranto is not one of the specifically enumerated situations that would allow the JTC to bypass its responsibility to make an \u201cindividualized judgment\u201d based on \u201call the circumstances,\u201d which is required before the JTC can recommend that this Court sanction a judge for misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In sum, Justice WEAVER\u2019S failure to recognize the distinction between a quo warranto action and a disciplinary action is of critical importance. She is correct that an action for quo warranto constitutes the \u201cexclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>sive method for trying title to office,\u201d <em>Gildemeister v Lindsay, </em>212 Mich 299, 303; 180 NW 633 (1920), but the exclusive nature of such an action would exist in regard to a judge only if no judicial misconduct was involved. Where a judge\u2019s actions constitute misconduct <em>and </em>a vacation of office, <em>both </em>an action for quo warranto, initiated by the Attorney General, and a disciplinary proceeding, initiated by the JTC, may be pursued. Here, the JTC has initiated a disciplinary action based on respondent\u2019s misconduct which, as a result of his intervening reelection in November 2008, now pertains to respondent\u2019s <em>previous </em>term in office, which in turn means an action for quo warranto is no longer apposite. Further, unlike an action for quo warranto, a disciplinary action initiated by the JTC can address a judge\u2019s misconduct that occurred before his current term in office, MCR 9.205(B)(2), and may result in an appropriate sanction short of removal from office, MCR 9.205(B). Because an action for quo warranto cannot lie where the term of office for which the title being contested has expired, <em>Layle, </em>384 Mich at 642,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>as Justice WEAVER correctly notes is exactly the situation now before this Court because of respondent\u2019s reelection in 2008, the <em>only </em>avenue available to address his past conduct is the very type of disciplinary proceeding that the JTC has initiated here. As a consequence, this Court <em>does </em>possess the authority, derived from the constitution, to sanction respondent for his misconduct, based on the JTC\u2019s findings of misconduct and recommendation for discipline.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Finally, Justice Weaver\u2019s misunderstanding of quo warranto would generate several notable consequences. As an initial matter, Justice WEAVER concludes that the JTC is precluded from bringing a disciplinary action against respondent in the absence of an action for quo warranto. That is, this Court would not be entitled to accept the JTC\u2019s recommendation for disciplinary action based on a judge\u2019s misconduct that also called into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>question even his <em>current </em>title for office if the Attorney General, an independent executive-branch officer, was unwilling for any reason to pursue an action for quo warranto. This, in my judgment, is a significant limitation upon the JTC\u2019s, and this Court\u2019s, constitutional prerogatives that is nowhere found within article 6, \u00a7 30(2). Equally important, such a result would undermine the very purpose of this constitutional provision, i.e., to foster public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Additionally, Justice WEAVER would apparently extend her novel quo warranto analysis to judicial misconduct that alternatively gives rise to a potential felony charge. By doing this, she would prohibit the JTC from recommending disciplinary action against a judge based on the underlying actions for such a charge unless there was a formal felony conviction. This remarkable proposition would allow judges in this state to commit criminal behavior for which the JTC would have no authority to address. Under Justice Weaver\u2019s misapprehension of the JTC\u2019s constitutional authority, the underlying conduct forming a felony charge, whether assault, theft, arson, or fraud, could not then form the basis for a finding of judicial \u201cmisconduct in office,\u201d because it is only \u201cwhen [a trial] court process legally determines a judge is guilty of [a felony]\u201d that the JTC can then \u201cbring a proceeding for judicial misconduct,\u201d based on the facts necessary to support that conviction. <em>Ante </em>at 648.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>WEAVER\u2019S arguments find absolutely no support in the law or constitution of this state.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">In sum, the existence of an action for quo warranto does not prevent the JTC from assessing respondent\u2019s misconduct, regardless of whether that conduct happens to involve the improper exercise of a title to office. Once that assessment has taken place and a recommendation made, as here, this Court is fully authorized to consider that recommendation, and I would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">III. EXAMINER\u2019S CONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">As previously noted, the JTC\u2019s examiner visited respondent\u2019s chambers and demanded that he resign from his position. I concur with the facts in this regard as set forth by the majority, and agree that, at present, \u201cthe proper forum for the review of the JTC director\u2019s actions is the Attorney Grievance Commission.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">I do disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s implication that the tactics engaged in by the examiner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>even if they eventually prove to have been wrongful or inappropriate, have any particular relevance to the matter now before us. This Court cannot, as a function of the examiner\u2019s behavior, avoid its responsibility to address respondent\u2019s misconduct. To do so would be tantamount to adopting, in the context of judicial discipline, some variant of the \u201cexclusionary rule,\u201d which requires \u201cthe exclusion of reliable evidence when the constable blunders.\u201d <em>Stone v Powell, </em>428 US 465, 496; 96 S Ct 3037; 49 L Ed 2d 1067 (1976). Here, there is no claim that the examiner obtained any evidence in this case by unlawful means. Moreover, if we were to allow the examiner\u2019s troubling behavior to influence our evaluation of respondent\u2019s misconduct by failing to impose a sanction based solely on respondent\u2019s misconduct, our decision would be contrary to MCR 9.200, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\">An independent and honorable judiciary being indispensable to justice in our society, subchapter 9.200 shall be construed to preserve the integrity of the judicial system, to enhance public confidence in that system, and to protect the public, the courts, and the rights of the judges who are governed by these rules in the most expeditious manner that is practicable and fair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In sum, disregarding a judge\u2019s misconduct out of disdain for the examiner\u2019s behavior is not a rational response designed to \u201cpreserve the integrity of the judicial system,\u201d nor does it \u201cenhance public confidence in that system.\u201d Thus, in keeping with this Court\u2019s responsibility to uphold the integrity of the judiciary, the Court should determine an appropriate sanction based solely on respondent\u2019s misconduct, irrespective of the examiner\u2019s conduct, which remains the subject of administrative consideration at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>IV STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">This Court reviews the JTC\u2019s factual findings and disciplinary recommendations de novo. <em>Noecker, </em>472 Mich at 8.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u201cThe JTC\u2019s finding of misconduct must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>In re Haley, </em>476 Mich 180, 189; 720 NW2d 246 (2006). However, \u201c[although we review the JTC\u2019s recommendations de novo, this Court generally will defer to the JTC\u2019s recommendations when they are adequately supported.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See also <em>In re Chrzanowski, </em>465 Mich 468, 488; 636 NW2d 785 (2001); <em>Brown, </em>461 Mich at 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">V RESPONDENT\u2019S CONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"AUv\">A. VIOLATING LAW AND CONSTITUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The JTC has issued a decision and recommendation for discipline in this case concluding, among other things, that respondent moved outside the division from which he was elected in violation of article 6, \u00a7 20 of the constitution and that he was not a registered elector of the division from which he was elected, as required by MCL 600.8201. According to the JTC, these are violations of the law and constitution that also constitute judicial misconduct sanctionable under Canons 1 and 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct and article 6, \u00a7\u00a7 20 and 30(2) of the constitution.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>1 agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Article 6, \u00a7 20 of the Michigan Constitution states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Whenever a justice or judge removes his domicile beyond the limits of the territory from which he was elected or appointed, he shall have vacated his office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The \u201cterritory from which he was elected\u201d necessarily means the geographic location from which respondent received the requisite number of votes to obtain his judicial office, i.e., the 1st Division of the 63rd District Court.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Additionally, \u201cdomicile\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]hat place where a man has his true, fixed, and permanent home and principal establishment and to which, whenever he is absent, he has the intention of returning.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed). A domicile is \u201cthat place where a person has voluntarily fixed his abode not for a mere special or temporary purpose, but with a present intention of making it his home, either permanently or for an indefinite or unlimited length of time.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number><em>Henry v Henry, </em>362 Mich 85, 101-102; 106 NW2d 570 (1960) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \u201cOne cannot be permanently located in more than one place; one cannot be domiciled in more than 1 place; one cannot intend to remain for an extended period of time in more than 1 place.\u201d <em>In re Scheyer\u2019s Estate, </em>336 Mich 645, 651-652; 59 NW2d 33 (1953). \u201cGenerally, the determination of domicile is a question of fact. However, where, as here, the underlying facts are not in dispute, domicile is a question of law for the court.\u201d <em>Fowler v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>254 Mich App 362, 364; 656 NW2d 856 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Further, MCL 600.8201 requires that \u201ca candidate for and a judge of the district court shall be licensed to practice law in this state and shall be a registered elector of the district and election division in which he seeks to hold office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">During the master\u2019s hearing, respondent testified to the following facts regarding his domicile between 2000 and 2008, which the JTC used in rendering its decision. Respondent stated that from 1984 until 2000 he owned a house on South Monroe Street, within the 1st Division, where he purportedly lived until 1999. In 1998, he purchased a home on 201 Honey Creek Avenue in Ada Township, an area outside the 1st Division from which he was elected. He claimed that he was not domiciled there until 2005. Respondent testified that the year after he bought the property at 201 Honey Creek, he sold the Monroe Property because he \u201cneeded the money,\u201d and then moved to his sister\u2019s house at 260 Oak Street, within the 1st Division, \u201cwhere I was basically a tenant, and that was in 2000.\u201d More specifically, respondent stated, \u201c[Wjhen I bought 201 Honey Creek, that was a lot of money for me, and that\u2019s why I sold the [Monroe Property] and moved to my sister\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>house [at 260 Oak Street], who was kind enough not to charge me any rent[.]\u201d Respondent changed his license and voter registration to reflect this move. He claimed that he maintained this living arrangement until 2002, when he began renting an apartment located on Thirteen Mile, which was also in the 1st Division. Respondent again changed both his driver\u2019s license and voting address to his Thirteen Mile property. However, during this time, respondent admits that he spent a \u201csignificant\u201d amount of time at 201 Honey Creek and slept there \u201ca lot.\u201d In other words, respondent testified that he sold his primary residence in 1999 so he could fix up 201 Honey Creek and live with his sister at no cost until 2002, when he began living at Thirteen Mile.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">In 2002, respondent purchased another property, 109 Honey Creek, and then purchased yet another property on Belding Road, which is within the 1st Division, and as to which he testified, \u201cI bought that in June of, I think 2003, and I didn\u2019t move there until early 2004. And I lived at [Thirteen Mile] until I moved in, but it wasn\u2019t when I bought it.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Respondent changed his voter registration on March 11, 2004, and his driver\u2019s license on March 23, 2004, to the Belding Road address. However, he registered his mailing address with the Secretary of State as being the address of the 1st Division courthouse. In regard to the period immediately following respondent\u2019s purchase of 109 Honey Creek, he testified to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">That house [109 Honey Creek] I had to get done because there was a person that wanted to buy it, and so I was down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>there a lot and I worked late into the night, and a number of times I just went up and slept at 201 [Honey Creek]. If I didn\u2019t work that late, I went back to the Bostwick Lake, Belding Road address.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Respondent stated that Belding Road continued to be his domicile until December, 5 2005, when he moved to 201 Honey Creek, which was further confirmed by his filing of a homestead exemption for 201 Honey Creek in 2006. However, despite admitting that he was domiciled at 201 Honey Creek after 2005, respondent testified that, in 2007, he (a) voted within the 1st Division using his Belding Road address,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> (b) applied for a concealed weapons permit on February 7, 2007, using his Belding Road address,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> (c) never changed his voter registration to 201 Honey Creek,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and (d) never changed his driver\u2019s license to the 201 Honey Creek address.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> He also admitted knowing that he had to change his voter registration and driver\u2019s license, and, despite consistently doing so during every move from 2000 to 2005, he failed to do so once he moved to 201 Honey Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">From this testimony, respondent expressly admits to moving outside the 1st Division to 201 Honey Creek as of 2005. He also admits that he intended for that location to be his domicile. Both of these admissions are reflected in the master\u2019s and the JTC\u2019s findings of fact. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>These admissions <em>alone </em>are sufficient to demonstrate that respondent moved outside of \u201cthe territory from which he was elected,\u201d which is a violation of article 6, \u00a7 20 of the constitution. Similarly, the fact that respondent moved outside of the 1st Division made him ineligible to be \u201ca registered elector\u201d of that division, regardless of the fact that respondent improperly voted in that division after 2005 in violation of MCL 600.8201. Thus, respondent failed to comply with article 6, \u00a7 20 of the constitution and MCL 600.8201, which is also violative of Canon 2(B) of the Code of Judicial Conduct\u2019s requirement that a judge \u201cobserve the law,\u201d and as a result Canon l\u2019s requirement that a judge maintain the \u201cintegrity\u201d of the judiciary.\u201d Additionally, respondent\u2019s conduct runs afoul of MCR 9.104:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-4\">(A) The following acts or omissions by an attorney,[<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>] individually or in concert with another person, sire misconduct and grounds for discipline, whether or not occurring in the course of an attorney-client relationship:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">(2) conduct that exposes the legal profession or the courts to obloquy, contempt, censure, or reproach[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">There can be no question that a judge\u2019s failure to obey the law, which he has taken an oath to uphold, \u201cexposes the legal profession [and] the courts to obloquy, contempt, censure, or reproach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">B. BREACHING FAITH</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Beyond acting in dereliction of the law, respondent in a very fundamental sense has broken the bonds with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>the people of his district. By his own acknowledgement, he has knowingly departed from their political community to become part of another political community. While there may well be some artificiality to these political communities, and while the economic, social and cultural circumstances of the 2nd Division may not be markedly different from those of the 1st Division, our system of republican government nonetheless is predicated upon the idea that the \u201cwe the people\u201d are entitled, and are obligated, to assert their control over the actions of government through the selection of local representatives. By this process, the people communicate their views concerning the kind of leadership they desire from their public institutions. Particularly in the case of the selection of judges \u2014 persons who do not ordinarily make public policy, and who cannot be considered \u201crepresentative\u201d officers in the same sense as persons elected to the legislative and executive branches of government<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> \u2014 there must be some further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>rationale for why all judges of our state, with the exception of Supreme Court justices, are elected by \u201cdistricts\u201d or \u201ccircuits.\u201d See Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 11, and 16.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">At least part of this explanation must certainly be that the people are entitled to select as their judges persons whose sense of values, whose judgment, whose life experiences, are in some sense a function of their roots within that community, persons who have shared in some tangible way the day-to-day trials and tribulations, and influences, of citizens within that community. Although the shared experiences of persons within the 1st and 2nd divisions may not be as dissimilar as those between more geographically far-flung communities, it is nevertheless an outgrowth of our respect for the integrity of local government, and specifically the people\u2019s right and obligation to engage in local self-government, that we must take seriously the matter of a public official who has breached the faith with his community that is required by our constitution by departing from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>In sum, respondent\u2019s acknowledgement that he moved outside of the 1st Division after 2005 effectively acknowledged both a violation of the law and constitution, and a breach of faith with the people of his community, both of which threaten \u201cpublic confidence in the . . . integrity of the judiciary,\u201d Canon 2(B), and risk \u201cexposing] the courts to obloquy, contempt, censure, or reproach,\u201d MCR 9.104(A)(2). Thus, I agree with the JTC that respondent\u2019s vacation of his electoral district constitutes judicial misconduct and warrants an imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">C. FALSE TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In addition to the period <em>after </em>2005, during which respondent acknowledged moving from, and living outside, the 1st Division, the JTC determined, on the basis of telephone logs produced during the master\u2019s hearing, that respondent had, in fact, moved outside of his electoral district in 2000, rather than 2005. Specifically, these logs indicated that from 2000 to 2004, respondent provided his 201 Honey Creek telephone number as his exclusive after-hours contact for where he could be reached when police officers needed him to make \u201cprobable cause\u201d determinations and issue warrants. Because of a medical situation, respondent was not required to be on call from June 2004 until sometime in 2005 and, thus, he did not provide an after-hours contact number during that period. Once respondent resumed this responsibility in 2005, he briefly provided the telephone number for the Belding Road property in the 1st Division. However, calls to the Belding Road address were forwarded to 201 Honey Creek.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> From the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>beginning of 2006 until June of that year, he again provided only his 201 Honey Creek telephone number, and from June 2006 until the beginning of 2007, respondent provided his Belding Road telephone number with calls again forwarded to 201 Honey Creek. In 2007, respondent resumed providing only his 201 Honey Creek telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">From these logs, the JTC concluded that respondent\u2019s consistent listing of 201 Honey Creek as his contact information from 2000 to 2008 showed that he, in fact, lived at 201 Honey Creek beginning in 2000 rather than 2005. On that basis, the JTC concluded that respondent\u2019s assertion that he had not moved outside his district before 2005 evidenced a \u201clack of candor and honesty,\u201d which amounted to \u201cfalse testimony\u201d regarding his residence during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Although \u201cthis Court will generally defer to the JTC\u2019s recommendations when they are adequately supported,\u201d <em>In re Haley, </em>476 Mich at 189, the JTC\u2019s use of these telephone logs is not without its difficulties. Of particular concern is the examiner\u2019s failure to produce these logs in accordance with the master\u2019s discovery order. More specifically, the examiner did not make respondent aware that he was in possession of, and intended to use, these logs until respondent was actually testifying during the master\u2019s hearing. Once the examiner began questioning respondent about these documents, respondent\u2019s counsel objected that the examiner had not produced these logs and that the master should not allow them to be used for substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>purposes. Agreeing with respondent, the master ruled that these documents could only be used to impeach respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">However, during these hearings, the examiner called Donna Gillson \u2014 an employee of the 63rd District Court and an acquaintance of respondent \u2014 to testify, and, on the basis of her personal knowledge, she independently established that respondent had provided her with all the numbers contained in the telephone logs. She also testified that the only reason respondent changed his after-hours telephone contact information to the Belding Road address in 2006 was because the State Court Administrative Office (SCAO) had threatened to notify the JTC that he was living outside of the 1st Division.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Ms. Gillson then stated that respondent had his calls forwarded from the Belding Road property to 201 Honey Creek. Significantly, she explained that the reason respondent changed his telephone number back to 201 Honey Creek in 2006 was because his call-forwarding made it impossible for him to receive faxes at his home at 201 Honey Creek. This testimony also lends credence to the JTC\u2019s finding that respondent provided false testimony because the examiner asked respondent if he \u201cever had [his] calls forwarded from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>one home address to another[.]\u201d In contrast to Ms. Gillson\u2019s testimony, respondent replied, \u201cNo, not that I know of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">The following day, respondent was again called to testify. During this testimony, respondent stated that he had reviewed the logs. The examiner then went through each number contained in the logs and respondent verified that all the telephone numbers contained therein belonged to him during the listed times. Further, after the JTC rendered its decision, which was based substantially on the logs, respondent challenged the use of those documents in this Court. However, in doing so, respondent made the following statement in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">Assuming, arguendo, that the duty logs presented were accurate copies of the ones that were created in the ordinary course of business, it should come as no surprise that [respondent] listed a phone number at 201 Honey Creek a place where he could be found when not on the bench. As [respondent] testified, he spent a significant amount of his free time renovating two homes on Honey Creek.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Thus, although respondent\u2019s challenge to the JTC\u2019s use of the telephone logs is framed in \u201carguendo\u201d terms, he notably does not contest the <em>validity </em>of these logs, and indeed admits that it should \u201ccome as no surprise\u201d that he listed the 201 Honey Creek number for where he could be contacted after hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Because Ms. Gillson testified from her own personal knowledge about the after-hours telephone numbers that respondent had provided, and because respondent later verified all these numbers, respondent can hardly question in good faith the information in the logs that contributed to the JTC\u2019s conclusion that respondent had provided false testimony when claiming that he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>not move outside of his district before 2005. Thus, despite the examiner\u2019s failure to properly produce the telephone logs before the hearing, the information contained in those records nonetheless affords an altogether proper basis from which the JTC could conclude that respondent\u2019s testimony was not truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Further, as the examiner initially stated, the logs were intended to impeach respondent in regard to his testimony that he had not moved outside the 1st division before 2005. Although respondent\u2019s relocation constituted part of the substantive claim levied against him during the disciplinary proceeding, this same information is also relevant to ascertaining his credibility and, in service of the latter purpose, suggests strongly that respondent was not being truthful, the primary purpose for which the logs were employed. Accordingly, the JTC properly evaluated these documents in determining that respondent had provided false testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The JTC\u2019s conclusion that respondent moved outside the 1st division before 2005 is further supported by Ms. Gillson\u2019s testimony that she delivered campaign materials to 201 Honey Creek, where respondent was apparently planning his 2002 reelection campaign.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Ms. Gillson stated that she had dropped respondent off at 201 Honey Creek on a number of occasions before 2005, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>and that she thought it was \u201cfairly well known to everyone where he lives.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Because \u201cone cannot be domiciled in more than 1 place, one cannot intend to remain for an extended period of time in more than 1 place,\u201d <em>Scheyer\u2019s Estate, </em>336 Mich at 651-652, respondent\u2019s actions, especially in light of the information he provided to the district court concerning his exclusive after-hours contact number at 201 Honey Creek from 2000 to 2004, indicate that for an \u201cextended period of time\u201d (2000-2004), he intended to remain at 201 Honey Creek. Thus, respondent was domiciled outside of the 1st division before 2005, and his testimony to the contrary was not truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Given this evidence, both circumstantial and direct, it is puzzling how the majority, after \u201c[hjaving reviewed the entire record closely,\u201d can now assert that it does \u201cnot conclude that respondent lied under oath,\u201d and that it \u201cagree[sj with respondent\u2019s counsel that this is not a case of arrogance,\u201d but one of confusion.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> <em>Ante </em>at 652-654. Specifically, the majority asserts that respondent once more was \u201cconfused and could not remember a series of different telephone numbers (un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>til he later refreshed his recollection), specific dates and times, and events that occurred nearly 10 years before he testified.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 653-654. By suggesting that respondent was \u201cconfused\u201d when the examiner initially confronted him with the telephone logs, the majority leaves unanswered why this initial confusion had any impact on respondent\u2019s <em>second </em>day of testimony, i.e., the day <em>after </em>he was presented with the telephone logs, especially after respondent admitted that he had reviewed those logs by that time and had confirmed that the numbers contained therein belonged to him. Indeed, the majority seems to recognize that respondent was <em>not </em>confused regarding the telephone logs at that point by stating that he was only confused \u201cuntil he later refreshed his recollection ... .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 653. Nor does the majority so much as attempt to explain how Ms. Gillson\u2019s testimony, which directly refutes respondent\u2019s claim that he did not live outside of his division prior to 2005, bears any relation to respondent\u2019s alleged \u201cconfusion\u201d concerning pertinent facts as to the telephone logs. Specifically, the majority overlooks completely Ms. Gillson\u2019s testimony that respondent began forwarding his calls to 201 Honey Creek in the first place as part of a deliberate effort to avoid detection by the JTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Additionally, by stating that \u201crespondent did not try to deny the fact that he was living in the 2nd Division at that time, because he thought he could live in that division as long as he was not running for reelection,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 653, the majority implies that respondent was also confused as to whether he could live outside his district. By suggesting that respondent was \u201cconfused\u201d in this regard, the majority misunderstands what is at issue. Respondent\u2019s false testimony pertains to his assertions that he did not live outside the district from which he was elected before 2005 when, in fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>the evidence shows that he did. That is, respondent\u2019s lack of candor has little to do with what the law did or did not require of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Perhaps most troubling is the majority\u2019s willingness to overlook respondent\u2019s lack of candor as being due to his alleged \u201cconfusion,\u201d when the very nature of his judicial responsibilities include properly ascertaining facts, ensuring accuracy in testimony, and correcting inaccuracies that may arise during fact-finding proceedings. Significantly, respondent had the opportunity to do exactly that when he appealed to this Court, but, instead, he stated that \u201cit should come as no surprise that [he] listed a telephone number at 201 Honey Creek, a place where he could be found when not on the bench,\u201d since \u201che spent a significant amount of his free time\u201d there. Thus, rather than supporting the majority\u2019s assertion that respondent was confused, his own statements to this Court suggest strongly to the contrary that he was <em>not </em>confused. Indeed, it is unbelievable that a judge of respondent\u2019s experience would allow any initial confusion that may have caused the JTC to conclude that he lied under oath to persist and to go uncorrected in his appeal to this Court. Finally, regardless of the majority\u2019s claim that respondent was \u201cconfused\u201d regarding telephone numbers, dates and times, and prior events, <em>ante </em>at 653-654, Ms. Gillson was not, and the substance of her testimony was clear, powerful, and damaging to respondent\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Therefore, apparently on the sole grounds of respondent\u2019s alleged \u201cconfusion,\u201d and with almost no explanation of how it reaches its result, the majority summarily concludes that respondent has neither violated the Michigan Constitution nor provided false testimony under oath. In this process, the majority gives no credence to the following evidence, and thereby utters not a hint of disapproval, and avoids any sanction, for behavior that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>calls into question the fundamental integrity of our judiciary: (a) respondent\u2019s nearly 10 years of continuously spending \u201csignificant\u201d periods of his after-hours time at 201 Honey Creek; (b) respondent\u2019s admission that before 2002 he \u201cintended to five at 201 Honey Creek,\u201d which is why he was \u201cworking on [the property]\u201d; (c) Ms. Gillson\u2019s unequivocal statement that it is \u201cfairly well known to everyone where [respondent] lived\u201d; (d) the fact that respondent\u2019s pet cat was living at 201 Honey Creek before 2005, as noted in a police report stemming from a 2004 incident; (e) the telephone logs directing police officers to reach respondent at 201 Honey Creek as his <em>sole </em>after-hours contact <em>before </em>2005; (f) Ms. Gillson\u2019s testimony verifying the information in the telephone logs that respondent\u2019s sole after-hours contact before 2005 was 201 Honey Creek; (g) the fact that respondent actually ran his 2002 reelection campaign from 201 Honey Creek; (h) Ms. Gillson\u2019s testimony that, shortly after respondent was confronted by SCAO and accused of vacating his office by living outside his district, he purposefully misled SCAO regarding his true residency by manipulating his telephone lines through call forwarding; (i) the telephone logs that support Ms. Gillson\u2019s testimony that respondent attempted to avoid having his true residence being detected by forwarding his telephone calls; (j) respondent\u2019s untruthful answer in response to whether these telephone logs were ever forwarded from his home in the 1st division to 201 Honey Creek of \u201c[n]o, not that I know of,\u201d as if he were unaware of how his own telephone calls were being directed; (k) respondent\u2019s initial false statement that \u201cI am too [living in the proper district]\u201d in 2006, despite afterwards admitting that he lived outside his district as of 2005 and thereafter when he was confronted by two SCAO officials who alleged that he had moved outside of his district; (1) respondent\u2019s false address that was provided when applying for a gun permit that he stated was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>true \u201cunder oath\u201d and \u201cunder penalty of law;\u201d and (m) the master\u2019s finding, after personally taking respondent\u2019s testimony, that he was \u201cless than truthful\u201d in this testimony, and the JTC\u2019s unanimous conclusion that respondent was \u201clacking in candor\u201d in this same testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In sum, because respondent\u2019s testimony and actions demonstrate that he was domiciled at 201 Honey Creek before 2005,1 agree with the JTC that respondent was not being truthful when giving his sworn testimony. Thus, respondent\u2019s constitutional and statutory violations were of longer duration than he admitted\u2014 effectively constituting a \u201cpattern and practice\u201d of misconduct \u2014 which necessarily means, as the JTC concluded, that he showed \u201ca lack of candor and honesty,\u201d which amounted to providing \u201cfalse testimony\u201d before the master. In addition to vacating his electoral district before and after 2005, this lack of candor independently justifies the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">D. OTHER MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">The remaining allegation of judicial misconduct concerns respondent\u2019s inappropriate conduct directed toward female court employees. The JTC found that respondent engaged in three distinct acts of misconduct. In the first instance, he drew female breasts on a note that was attached to a court file. The drawing was made after a female clerk commented on the revealing dress of a woman who appeared in court. The second event concerned the drawing of a penis on a note that was attached to a court file. The third instance occurred during a retirement party for an employee at the 2nd Division courthouse. While at the party, respondent commented on a university sweatshirt worn by a female clerk employed in the 2nd Division. Respondent stated that the woman had \u201can awfully small chest\u201d for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>college indicated on the sweatshirt, and \u201cshould have gone to a smaller school like Alma,\u201d which would have fit her \u201csmall chest better.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Respondent\u2019s counsel acknowledged that respondent\u2019s conduct was \u201cinappropriate,\u201d but contended that it was spontaneous and represented \u201cisolated\u201d incidents from respondent\u2019s 36-year career. I agree with counsel, and believe that respondent\u2019s conduct warrants, at most, a public censure, consistent with the recommendations of the JTC, and the conclusions of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">VI. <em>BROWN </em>FACTORS</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">In <em>In re Haley, </em>476 Mich at 195, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">When determining the appropriate sanction, this Court seeks not to punish the judge, but to maintain the integrity of the judicial process and protect the citizenry from corruption and abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Based on respondent\u2019s conduct, the JTC has recommended that respondent be removed from office, a recommendation to which this Court will ordinarily defer if the JTC has \u201cadequately articulate[d] the bases for its findings and demonstrate[d] there is a reasonable relationship between such findings and the recommended discipline.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>461 Mich at 1292.1 believe the JTC\u2019s findings and recommendations are supported by the record, and agree that respondent\u2019s misconduct warrants removal from office. This is confirmed by my review of the <em>Brown </em>factors, see <em>Brown, </em>461 Mich at 1292-1293, as follows:<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>(1) Misconduct that is part of a pattern or practice is more serious than an isolated instance of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The JTC found that this factor \u201cweighs heavily in favor of a severe sanction,\u201d because respondent had engaged in \u201ca long pattern of deceit\u201d to hide that he was living outside the 1st Division from 2000 to 2008. I am in agreement with this finding. Respondent moved outside his district in 2000 and continually changed his driver\u2019s license and voter\u2019s registration to other addresses within the 1st Division, and engaged in other actions that served no purpose other than to prevent detection. Further, during a visit from SCAO, respondent was accused of not living within the division from which he was elected. In response, he falsely stated, \u201cI am too.\u201d Respondent then changed his telephone number on two separate occasions to his Belding Road property, with calls forwarded to 201 Honey Creek, again to prevent his relocation outside his electoral district from coming to light. It was only after respondent was confronted with a homestead exemption form, which clearly showed that he was living at 201 Honey Creek after 2005, that he finally admitted he was living outside his division after 2005. These actions demonstrate a pattern and practice of conduct designed to conceal. I believe that the JTC correctly concluded that this factor weighs in favor of a more severe sanction. I also conclude that respondent\u2019s inappropriate drawings and comments, which consisted of three incidents over a 36-year period, cannot be viewed as a part of the same pattern or practice. Therefore, this conduct does not increase the severity of the first <em>Brown </em>factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>(2) Misconduct on the bench is usually more serious than the same misconduct off the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The JTC correctly found that respondent\u2019s conduct occurred off the bench, which suggests that a less severe sanction is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">(3) Misconduct that is prejudicial to the actual administration of justice is more serious than misconduct that is prejudicial only to the appearance of propriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The JTC concluded that respondent\u2019s conduct, which calls into question his title to office before 2008, jeopardized every judgment that he has imposed from the bench. This is so, it argues, because, without lawful authority to render judgments, those judgments are at risk of being invalidated.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> I respectfully disagree with this legal conclusion for the reasons stated in <em>People v Russell, </em>347 Mich 193, 196-197; 79 NW2d 603, 605 (1956). I nonetheless agree with the JTC that this factor militates in favor of a more severe sanction. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>respondent\u2019s decisions may remain valid and binding legal decisions, I do believe that the <em>propriety </em>of these decisions raises legitimate concerns. In particular, I believe that the losing parties in these decisions \u2014 who above all participants in the legal process must be genuinely persuaded of the legitimacy and integrity of this process \u2014 may understandably feel embittered or resentful concerning the decisions in their own cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">(4) Misconduct that does not implicate the actual administration of justice, or its appearance of impropriety, is less serious than misconduct that does.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">For the reasons set forth in the previous factor, I believe that respondent\u2019s conduct, at least in retrospect, did create an appearance of impropriety that weighs in favor of a more severe sanction. Because it views this factor as largely duplicative of the considerations set out in the previous factor, the JTC concludes, and I agree, that this factor does not assist significantly in determining an appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">(5) Misconduct that occurs spontaneously is less serious than misconduct that is premeditated or deliberated.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Although I acknowledge that respondent\u2019s initial false statements in response to the unannounced visit from SCAO officials were made spontaneously, his conduct thereafter, including his continuing efforts to keep his actual residence prior to 2005 from being discovered, demonstrates that he engaged in a prolonged effort to mislead SCAO, the master, the JTC, and this Court about his living arrangements. Therefore, I agree with the JTC\u2019s conclusion that respondent\u2019s actions to avoid detection were deliberate and ongoing, and warrant the imposition of a more severe sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">(6) Misconduct that undermines the ability of the justice system to discover the truth of what occurred in a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>controversy, or to reach the most just result in such a case, is more serious than misconduct that merely delays such discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The JTC concluded that respondent\u2019s lack of authority to hold office impaired the judicial system\u2019s ability reach a just result. I respectfully disagree with the JTC with regard to this factor and do not believe that respondent\u2019s conduct undermined the ability of the justice system to discover the truth in legal disputes coming before this Court. Indeed, I do not believe his conduct affected the substantive determination of any case or controversy, assuming, as I do, that respondent continued during the period in controversy to act as a responsible judicial decision maker as his record suggests he has done for the past 36 years. That his conduct may have undermined the ability of the public, and the administrative systems of this Court, to identify his misconduct in moving his domicile is a factor that is more appropriately taken into account in the first and fifth factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">(7) Misconduct that involves the unequal application of justice on the basis of such considerations as race, color, ethnic background, gender, or religion are more serious than breaches of justice that do not disparage the integrity of the system on the basis of a class of citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">As concluded by the JTC, this factor does not apply to respondent\u2019s conduct, and thus suggests that a more severe sanction should not be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">VII. SANCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">This Court having promulgated the <em>Brown </em>factors, and the JTC having evaluated them in this case, \u201cproper deference\u201d is now required on our part. <em>Noecker, </em>472 Mich at 20 (2005) (MARKMAN, J., concurring). Of foremost significance in determining an appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>sanction for respondent\u2019s particular misconduct are the first and fifth factors. Because respondent engaged in a prolonged and deliberate effort to mislead SCAO, the master, the JTC, and this Court, as described in this opinion, including and especially testifying falsely under oath, I believe the JTC has reasonably concluded that respondent should be removed from office.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Although respondent\u2019s 36 years of honorable service on the bench, and his excellent reputation, as evidenced both by statements contained within the record and by his reelection in 2008 after the people of his judicial district had been made at least partially aware of the circumstances of the JTC investigation, constitute substantial factors in respondent\u2019s favor in determining a proportionate sanction, in the final analysis these factors do not, in my judgment, outweigh his serious misconduct in this case. See also <em>Noecker, supra. </em>As Justice YOUNG offered in his dissent, \u201c \u2018[s]ome misconduct, such as lying under oath, goes to the very core of judicial duty[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Post </em>at 717 (citation omitted). So too, I believe, does respondent\u2019s conduct in knowingly vacating his district <em>\u201cgo </em>to the very core of the representative duty\u201d in our system of self-government. Accordingly, I agree with Justice Young\u2019s dissent in this regard, as well as with the JTC\u2019s unanimous recommendation, that respondent be removed from office.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">VIII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Pursuant to the JTC\u2019s unanimous recommendation, I believe that respondent\u2019s misconduct in this case warrants that he be removed from office. In moving outside the district from which he was elected, respondent violated the law and constitution, he violated the fundamental bond with the people of his district established by our system of republican self-government, and he testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>falsely with regard to these actions. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, I would hold that respondent should now be removed from office.</p>\n<judges id=\"b757-4\">Corrigan, J., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\"> Justice Weaver asserts that this Court has \u201cno duty to ... defer ... to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>the JTC\u2019s recommendationfs]... or... decisionfs]... .\u201d <em>ante </em>at 646 (emphasis omitted).

Because, in my judgment, this theory would preclude this Court from considering facts that are necessary to fully address respondent\u2019s misconduct and to determine a proportionate sanction, I believe it is necessary to refute this theory.

If the claimant could not answer the writ successfully by showing the proper exercise of title, the franchise could be confiscated by the Crown. <em>Id. </em>at 819.

Thus, both historically and currently, quo warranto actions have never been used to ascertain whether an officer or franchise-holder <em>previously </em>exercised proper title to office, and never has the writ been invoked to discern whether the one who claims valid title has engaged in misconduct, much less <em>previous </em>misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b721-7\"> See <em>Attorney General, ex rel Cook v Burhans, </em>304 Mich 108; 7 NW2d 370 (1942) (\u201cThe attorney general,... by information in the nature of quo warranto, seeks ouster of defendant from the office of regent of the University of Michigan on the ground that he has no legal right to the office and is a mere usurper therein....

However, I do not cite <em>Kapcia </em>for such a proposition. Rather, I cite <em>Kapcia </em>only for the proposition that the JTC is prohibited from using the findings of another entity as a substitute for engaging in its own factual inquiries. Thus, <em>Kapcia </em>is pertinent here by establishing that the JTC cannot simply adopt the Court of Appeals\u2019 findings of fact in a quo warranto action as a substitute for making its own independent factual findings regarding judicial misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b725-7\"> This observation also seems to have led to confusion on Justice Weaver\u2019s part, whereby she notes that \u201c[i]t could hardly he argued, however, that this Court rather than the circuit court should adjudicate and convict the judge of the felony simply because the unresolved predicate issue arose during the course of a judicial disciplinary proceeding.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 645 n 24. Once again, despite an express statement to the contrary, in this instance that \u201cthis Court does not convict a judge of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>felony,\u201d but rather finds \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that judicial misconduct has occurred,\u201d Justice WEAVER directly misrepresents the proposition being asserted. See also note 8, <em>supra. </em>Neither this Court nor the JTC can convict a judge of a felony. However, the JTC can consider, as a basis for recommending that a judge be sanctioned, the underlying actions that constitute judicial misconduct. For example, a judge who assaults another person, but who is not ultimately convicted for one of any number of reasons unrelated to his culpability, may still be subject to a JTC disciplinary action on the basis of such conduct. Does Justice Weaver truly disagree with this same proposition? Does she believe that a judge under these circumstances would be immune from a JTC disciplinary action?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\"> See <em>Kapcia, </em>389 Mich at 313, for a listing of these specifically enumerated situations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b727-4\"> Indeed, if the Attorney General pursues a proper action for quo warranto, but, before that claim is resolved, the judge wins a subsequent reelection, the action becomes moot and must be dismissed.

The writ generally will not lie to try the abstract title to an office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Although such a result initially may seem anomalous, the fact that a quo warranto action cannot survive without an ongoing dispute regarding an individual\u2019s title to office simply emphasizes the point that an action for quo warranto is of a fundamentally different nature than a disciplinary action initiated by the JTC. Whereas an action for quo warranto is only viable so long as there remains a current dispute regarding a judge\u2019s title to office, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>disciplinary action arising from misconduct that undermined one\u2019s title to office remains available after the title dispute has been resolved or rendered moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b728-8\"> Justice Weaver claims that my argument \u201cconflates the complaint of vacation of office with the other complaints concerning inappropriate sexual conduct.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 639 n 9. As with several of her other arguments, see notes 9 and 16 of this opinion, this has utterly no basis in the actual language of this opinion. As should be quite clear to the ordinary reader, the discussion of quo warranto in this opinion is only relevant to whether respondent can be sanctioned for his \u201cmisconduct\u201d of vacating the district from which he was elected. By its very terms, the discussion of quo warranto has no relevance to any other alleged incident of misconduct in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">The lack of regard for precision in language is further reflected in Justice Weaver\u2019s characterization that I describe her rejection of the JTC\u2019s recommendations as \u201cunbelievable,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 646, a word I use only in an entirely different context with reference to certain actions of the <em>respondent. Infra </em>at 694. My <em>actual </em>analysis of Justice Weaver\u2019s opinion is that it is legally and constitutionally unsound, confused in its understanding of the record, and unconcerned by logical consequences, not that it is \u201cunbelievable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b729-5\"> The extent to which Justice Weaver would apply her analysis to other contexts such as when a judge engages in acts that could form the basis of a misdemeanor conviction, or even a civil penalty, imposed by a trial court or administrative agency, is unclear. That such circumstances may not be involved in the instant case does not, of course, make it any less irresponsible to propose a new constraint upon the JTC and leave open to question the extent to which this constraint will be carried out to its logical ends. Almost certainly, if Justice Weaver\u2019s unprecedented understanding of the JTC\u2019s authority was to prevail, it would ensure that judges subject to JTC discipline routinely raise the \u201cWeaver-defense,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>i.e., that their conduct fell beyond the scope of the JTC\u2019s authority, at least until a trial court or administrative body had \u201cin the first instance\u201d rendered a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">For what it is worth, Justice Weaver\u2019s theory also contradicts her own dissenting opinion in <em>In re Gilbert, </em>469 Mich 1224, 1234 (2003), cf. note 2 of this opinion, in which she opined that \u201cjudicial disciplinary proceedings are neither criminal nor quasi-criminal in nature.\u201d In <em>Gilbert, </em>Justice Weaver criticized the majority for not imposing a more severe sanction on Judge Thomas Gilbert for smoking marijuana, <em>id. </em>\u2014 an action for which Judge Gilbert could have been, but was not, criminally convicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b730-12\"> Also of concern is whether, under Justice Weaver\u2019s theories, the JTC and this Court would be <em>bound </em>by the factual and legal findings of trial courts and administrative agencies in cases of judicial misconduct.

Judges differ from all other public servants in having no representative duties. The judicial department of eveiy civilized government is one of the three co-ordinate parts of the sovereignty which acts for the state in expounding the laws and enactments in which the other departments have acted for the people as legislators and the approvers of legislation. It represents only the law by which the people have, by their proper agents, bound themselves. It cannot, therefore, in any of its duties, be said to serve any counfy, or circuit, or district. Its services are all performed on behalf of the state, as the sovereignty from which all the law emanates____[T]he only object of having local courts is to bring justice home to the people, but not to have cases decided as the desire of the people might shape the decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">That is, judges are presumed to speak, not on behalf of their constituencies, or on behalf of particular concerns within their constituencies, but only to represent the interests of the law, to speak for the rule of law. This is one reason why the Framers of the United States Constitution did not see the need to provide for the popular election of judges as they did for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>members of Congress and the President. The people of Michigan have made a different judgment in their constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b739-6\"> In addition to the constitutional provisions applicable to this analysis, the Legislature has enacted MCL 168.467f(l), which makes clear that district court judges must also be elected from their respective divisions or districts. MCL 168.467f(l) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">Except as otherwise provided in this section, judges of the district court shall be elected in each judicial district and election division of a judicial district at the general election to fill vacancies in office!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Thus, regardless of the rationale for <em>why </em>the people have chosen to require that district court judges be elected from the district and division in which they will serve, the people have unmistakably decided that such a requirement should exist, and that decision must be respected by the JTC and this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b740-6\"> It appears that respondent provided his Belding Road telephone number in response to a visit from the State Court Administrative Office. During this visit, respondent was informed that he was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>violation of his responsibility to remain domiciled within the division from which he was elected. It was immediately after this visit that respondent temporarily changed his after-hours contact information to the Belding Road property, with calls forwarded to his home at 201 Honey Creek.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b742-5\"> It is also worth noting that, although respondent now admits that he moved outside the 1st Division <em>after 2005, </em>it seems likely that he only made this admission based on fihng a homestead exemption form in 2006 that fisted 201 Honey Creek as his primary residence as of 2005, which made it impossible for him to continue denying that this was his home once he discovered that the JTC was aware of this filing. More specifically, when respondent was confronted by SCAO officials in 2006 about living outside his district, he initially denied living at 201 Honey Creek. When these officials asserted he was not living inside his district, respondent replied, \u201cI am too.\u201d Shortly thereafter, respondent began having his calls directed to the Belding Road property with calls forwarded to 201 Honey Creek. He also voted in a countywide election in 2007 using his <em>Belding Road </em>address. The inference that respondent originally attempted to continue misleading SCAO about where he lived <em>after </em>2005 is further supported by the fact that on February 1, 2007, respondent filled out an application to renew his concealed weapon permit and, in that application, also fisted the Belding Road property as his actual residence. The majority, rather than viewing this as additional evidence that respondent was engaging in \u201ca deliberate attempt to deceive officials about his change of address,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 652 n 30, claims that \u201cthe failure to change his address was simply an oversight: respondent did not think to read the form and make any corrections, as he admitted that he did not read the form ... .\u201d The majority\u2019s willingness to ignore this \u201coversight\u201d is especially troubling in view of the fact that the form, which respondent was required to read during his testimony, specifically stated, \u201cI understand that this application is executed under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>oath and swear or affirm under penalty of law the above answers are true and correct to the best of my knowledge. I understand that intentionally making a false statement on the application is a felony punishable by imprisonment of not more than four years or a fine of not more than $2,500 or both.\u201d Given that respondent\u2019s signature verifies that he signed this form \u201cunder oath\u201d and subject to \u201cpenalty of law,\u201d the majority\u2019s attempt to make light of this falsehood simply because \u201c [a]ll he had to do was sign the permit,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 652 n 30, is entirely unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">The majority\u2019s minimization of respondent\u2019s responsibility for reading a sworn document that he signed seems inconsistent with <em>Rowady v K Mart Corp, </em>170 Mich App 54, 60; 428 NW2d 22 (1988), in which then-Judge Weaver joined an opinion stating, \u201cNor is plaintiffs failure to read the entire agreement before signing it relevant. <em>It is well established that a person cannot avoid a written contract on the ground that he did not attend to its terms, did not read it, supposed it was different in its terms, or that he believed it to be a matter of mere form.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) This basic proposition has been settled in our caselaw for over a century. See, e.g., <em>Rory v Continental Ins Co, </em>473 Mich 457, 489 n 82; 703 NW2d 23 (2005). For reasons she does not explain, Justice Weaver requires less personal responsibility of an experienced judge to read, understand, and take seriously a legal document to which he swears under oath than she requires of all other citizens of this state with regard to their own written contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">That respondent provided a false address two years after he allegedly moved to 201 Honey Creek, strongly suggests that respondent would have continued with his \u201cdeliberate effort to deceive officials\u201d about his true address. Yet, rather than sanctioning respondent for his conduct, the majority repeatedly makes excuses on his behalf. I look forward to the majority being similarly empathetic when criminal and civil appellants who are not judges raise the \u201call I had to do was sign the permit\u201d defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b745-6\"> Respondent also admitted that before 2002 he \u201cintended to live [at 201 Honey Creek]. And, frankly, that\u2019s why I was working on that. I wasn\u2019t working on that to resell it.\u201d Although, this statement could be viewed as evidencing respondent\u2019s intent to live at 201 Honey Creek at some later date, such an interpretation is substantially undermined by the \u201csignificant\u201d amount of time he spent there from 2000 until 2008. It would be disingenuous for respondent, despite admitting to being present at 201 Honey Creek on so frequent a basis, while simultaneously providing an exclusive after-hours contact number at that same address during this time, to now claim that his intention to be domiciled there was directed toward some future date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b746-7\"> During a 2004 incident in which police were summoned to 201 Honey-Creek, the officers observed that respondent\u2019s pet cat was present at the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\"> To the extent that Justice WEAVER believes respondent was \u201cconfused\u201d about what the law required of him, i.e., respondent \u201cthought he could live [outside his] division as long as he was not running for reelection,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 653, this argument is belied by the record. First, there is no statute or caselaw that even hints at such a proposition, and neither Justice Weaver nor respondent has called anything relevant in this regard to the attention of this Court. Second, and more importantly, respondent\u2019s prolonged efforts to hide his living arrangement pre- and post-2005 undermine the credibility of any claim that respondent genuinely believed he could live outside his district so long as he was not currently \u201crunning\u201d for reelection. If respondent genuinely believed this, there would have been little need to engage in such an extensive effort to avoid having his residency detected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b751-9\"> The JTC stated that \u201c[w]hile [its] conclusion is based on the totality of the circumstances, [it is] primarily motivated by the conduct alleged in Count I [moving outside the division from which he was elected] of the Complaint and by Respondent\u2019s lack of candor and honesty with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>master and the Commission.\u201d Accordingly, the JTC did not analyze the misconduct set forth in part V(D) in the context of the <em>Brown </em>factors.

The point is ruled adversely to defendant in <em>Gildemeister v Lindsay, </em>212 Mich 299; 180 NW 633 [(1920)]....

I join Justice MARKMAN\u2019s dissenting opinion in all respects. I also join parts A and B of Justice Young\u2019s dissenting opinion, including the discussion of respondent\u2019s untruthful testimony and the conclusion that removal from office is the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s lying under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">I write separately only to observe that respondent advances a far more compelling argument for a due process violation than I have seen in any prior Judicial Tenure Commission (JTC) case. The JTC executive director engaged in unnecessarily harsh tactics when he confronted respondent by surprise and attempted to obtain his resignation by 9:00 a.m. the next day. Although the executive director purported to speak for the JTC during his meeting with respondent, the record does not establish that the JTC approved all of the executive director\u2019s tactics. Moreover, an impartial master appointed by this Court conducted a hearing and found the facts in this matter, the JTC\u2019s decision is merely a recommendation to this Court, and the ultimate disciplinary decision is rendered by this Court after a de novo review. Thus, I conclude that respondent has not demonstrated an intolerably high risk of unfairness that is required to establish a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">In <em>Withrow v Larkin, </em>421 US 35, 47; 95 S Ct 1456; 43 L Ed 2d 712 (1975), the United States Supreme Court held that the combination of investigative and adjudicative functions in a single entity does not necessarily violate due process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The contention that the combination of investigative and adjudicative functions necessarily creates an unconstitutional risk of bias in administrative adjudication has a much more difficult burden of persuasion to carry. It must overcome a presumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators; and it must convince that, under a realistic appraisal of psychological tendencies and human weakness, conferring investigative and adjudicative powers on the same individuals poses such a risk of actual bias or prejudgment that the practice must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">The Supreme Court explained that it is \u201cvery typical for the members of administrative agencies to receive the results of investigations, to approve the filing of charges or formal complaints instituting enforcement proceedings, and then to participate in the ensuing hearings. This mode of procedure does not violate the Administrate Procedure Act, and it does not violate due process of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56. Although the combination of investigative and adjudicative functions does not by itself establish a due process violation, a court may nonetheless determine \u201cfrom the special facts and circumstances present in the case before it that the risk of unfairness is intolerably high.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">In <em>In re Del Rio, </em>400 Mich 665; 256 NW2d 727 (1977), this Court followed <em>Withrow </em>in holding that the combination of investigative, adjudicative, and disciplinary roles of the JTC did not render it incapable of ensuring due process. This Court emphasized that the JTC\u2019s role is limited to submitting its recommendations to this Court, and that this Court alone decides what, if any, disciplinary action should be taken.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">This Court has made a conscious effort to segregate within the Commission the investigative and adjudicative functions. We specifically require under GCR 1963, 932.10, that an independent master be appointed by this Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>preside over the adjudicative process once the Commission files a formal complaint. It is this master who also makes the findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which the Commission makes its recommendation and this Court ultimately bases its decision. Therefore, this Court, like the United States Supreme Court in <em>Withrow, supra, </em>58, does not believe that the combination of the investigative and adjudicative roles in the Judicial Tenure Commission creates even a risk that due process guarantees could be violated. <em>[Id. </em>at 691.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">In <em>In re Chrzanowski, </em>465 Mich 468, 486-487; 636 NW2d 758 (2001), we followed <em>Withrow, Del Rio, </em>and other Michigan authorities to hold that the JTC\u2019s procedures afforded sufficient due process protections, and we found no special facts or circumstances to suggest an intolerably high risk of unfairness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">As to the procedures, first, pursuant to MCR 9.207(B)(3), the JTC conducted a preliminary investigation to determine whether respondent\u2019s alleged conduct warranted further action. Second, after determining that sufficient evidence of misconduct existed, the JTC filed a formal complaint pursuant to MCR 9.208. Third, a master was appointed, notice was given, and a hearing was then afforded respondent under MCR 9.210(A) and MCR 9.211, with the JTC\u2019s executive director serving as prosecutor-examiner under MCR 9.201(6).. .. Finally, the JTC\u2019s conclusion that Judge Chrzanowski should be disciplined was ultimately just a recommendation to this Court that we are charged to review de novo pursuant to deciding what discipline, if any, is appropriate. As in <em>Withrow, </em>the JTC\u2019s investigative and adjudicative procedures are functionally separate; additionally, as distinct from <em>Withrow, </em>in which the investigation and the decision were undertaken by the same Medical Examining Board, here the master, the examiner, and the JTC panel are separate entities. If the board in <em>Withrow </em>did not violate due process rights by investigating, and then adjudicating claims, it can hardly be argued that the JTC\u2019s procedures violated due process. Further, a majority of the members of the JTC are judges, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>and all the members who ultimately recommend discipline are assumed to be fair and impartial. We conclude then that there was no actual bias in the JTC\u2019s decision. It had authority to review the master\u2019s findings de novo, and reasonably determined, by a preponderance of the evidence, that respondent had in fact made false statements. We find these procedures adequately separated the JTC\u2019s investigative and adjudicative functions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">On the basis of these authorities, I do not find a due process violation in this case. The JTC followed the very same procedures that we concluded in <em>Del Rio </em>and <em>Chrzanowski </em>were sufficient to ensure due process. That is, a master was appointed to find the facts that formed the basis for the JTC\u2019s decision, the JTC\u2019s decision was only a recommendation to this Court, and this Court bears the ultimate responsibility on its de novo review to decide what, if any, discipline is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Nonetheless, a close question is presented regarding whether special facts and circumstances created an intolerably high risk of unfairness. The JTC\u2019s executive director confronted respondent without warning in his chambers, accompanied by an armed police escort who surreptitiously recorded the meeting. The executive director provided respondent with documents alleging misconduct and indicated that he would obtain respondent\u2019s interim suspension if he did not resign by 9:00 a.m. the next day. The executive director also presented a resignation letter that had already been prepared <em>on respondent\u2019s own office stationery. </em>The executive director represented that he was speaking on behalf of the JTC, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">The Commission is offering you this opportunity to resolve this matter as quickly as possible and not bring any shame, proceedings, accusations of peijury against you. You can resign immediately. And immediately means im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>mediately. I have a letter right here you can sign. The Commission has said that I can give you until tomorrow morning. I prefer to take the letter with me right now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">When respondent stated that he would like to talk to someone \u201cwho knows this area much better that [sic] I do,\u201d the executive director responded, \u201cYeah. So here\u2019s a letter already prepared for you. If I have that letter faxed to me \u2014 my fax number is on that card that I just gave to you. If I have that letter faxed to my office by 9 a.m., and I mean by 9 a.m.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Respondent stated that he could not make a decision by then, to which the executive director replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">Then I\u2019ll be filing the petition for interim suspension tomorrow and you will be suspended in a matter of days. And a formal complaint will issue with this. So, this will all ... . You\u2019re up for election this year. So, this is all going to become public no later than March. You\u2019ll be off the bench before then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">You have until tomorrow morning at 9. And I haven\u2019t even touched \u2014 I haven\u2019t even touched the sexual harassment \u2014 the little notes that you draw, the comments you make to the staff. I mean, we haven\u2019t even gotten .... Oh yeah. We haven\u2019t even gotten there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-10\">You may think that because you were born in 19 whatever it was \u2014 forty something or other, that you\u2019re from an old enough generation that can get away with saying certain things, but it\u2019s just not true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">The executive director later repeated that \u201c [i]f the Commission has your letter of resignation by tomorrow by 9 a.m., this matter will be gone. Nobody will hear about it. You\u2019ll have a retirement party. Everybody will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>go home happy.\u201d But, the executive director stated, if respondent fought the allegations, \u201cI almost welcome the opportunity. Or you can take the easy way out and take a resignation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">When respondent asked to see a file referred to in one of the alleged sexual drawings that the executive director provided, the executive director stated, \u201cI\u2019m not here now to do any type of interview with you. I\u2019m not here to explain anything else.\u201d When respondent asked what other evidence formed the basis for the allegations, the executive director stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">Sir, I\u2019ve followed the court rules. The rules are provided in 9.200 and following. We\u2019ve complied with the court rules. I\u2019ve come here to personally to [sic] give you this to perhaps avoid any embarrassing situations. I\u2019ve come here to perhaps avoid having to drag your name through the mud with what is going to come out at a formal hearing and to give you an opportunity to obviate all that and retire quietly. I\u2019m not here to discuss the matter with you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The executive director later stated, \u201cIf we push this all the way, everybody\u2019s going to know why you left because you got thrown off the bench.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">As the above excerpts reflect, the executive director\u2019s tactics were unnecessarily harsh. The executive director essentially ambushed respondent in his chambers with the allegations, demanded his immediate resignation by 9:00 a.m. the next day, and refused to answer respondent\u2019s questions regarding the bases for the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">The record does not, however, reflect that the JTC itself approved all these tactics. Although the executive director represented that \u201cthe Commission\u201d was giving respondent until 9:00 a.m. the next morning to resign, the record does not indicate whether the JTC approved the surprise nature of the confrontation, the refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>answer respondent\u2019s questions, or the abrasive disregard of respondent\u2019s request for more time to talk to someone.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">I am extremely concerned about the grounds for the JTC\u2019s decision to exclude from the record the audio recording of the executive director\u2019s confrontation with respondent, because it gives rise to a possible inference of collaboration. Respondent submitted the recording as one of several attachments to his brief in support of his objections to the master\u2019s report. The JTC granted the examiner\u2019s motion to strike the attachments. The JTC chairperson explained the basis for that decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">The presentation of additional evidence after the conclusion of a public hearing as [sic] governed by MCR 9.218. That rule provides that the Commission may order a hearing with at least 14 days\u2019 notice. That process was not found [sic] in this case. Accordingly, the motion to strike was hereby granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The court rule cited by the chairperson, MCR 9.218, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\">The commission may order a hearing before itself or the master for the taking of additional evidence at any time while the complaint is pending before it. The order must set the time and place of hearing and indicate the matters about which evidence is to be taken. A copy of the order must be sent to the respondent at least 14 days before the hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Regardless of whether the striking of the audio recording was a correct decision under MCR 9.218, I have no real evidentiary basis to question the conclusion that the JTC decided the motion on the basis of its stated rationale rather than because of any effort to conceal the audio recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">Therefore, I conclude that the executive director\u2019s punitive tactics alone do not rise to the level of special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>facts or circumstances that would create an intolerably high risk of unfairness. The record does not show that the JTC members exhibited any bias or prejudgment, and respondent has not overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators. <em>Withrow, supra </em>at 47. Moreover, an impartial master appointed by this Court conducted the hearing and found the relevant facts, the JTC\u2019s decision was merely a recommendation to this Court, and it is this Court, after the de novo review, that now renders a decision regarding the appropriate discipline, if any, that should be imposed. <em>Del Rio, supra; Chrzanowski, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Accordingly, despite my serious concerns regarding the executive director\u2019s behavior during his confrontation with respondent, I am not convinced that respondent has established a violation of his due process rights.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b764-6\">YOUNG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdjE\"><em>(dissenting). </em>I join in parts V(A) and (C) of Justice MARKMAN\u2019s opinion. Like Justice MARKMAN and the Judicial Tenure Commission (JTC), I conclude that respondent lied during the JTC proceedings and that this misconduct alone provides sufficient basis for removing him from office.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I write separately because I decline to address whether the JTC has the authority to determine if respondent vacated his office in violation of Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 20 during the course of judicial disciplinary proceedings because respondent <em>admitted </em>that he changed his primary residence from the first to the second election division from August 2005 to February 2008. Given respondent\u2019s admission that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>moved outside his election division,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I believe that a formal determination of the JTC\u2019s power to decide such a question independent of respondent\u2019s admission is unnecessary in this case and do not reach a conclusion in the question debated by Justices MARKMAN and WEAVER in their respective opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">A. RESPONDENT LIED UNDER OATH</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">I fully agree with Justice MARKMAN\u2019s analysis of the record in parts V(A) and (C) regarding respondent\u2019s untruthful testimony. What is startling is that the majority accepts without question respondent\u2019s proffered justification for vacating his office \u2014 that respondent \u201cthought he could live in [the second election] division as long as he was not running for reelection.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Were this justification true, one would have expected respondent to live openly and notoriously at his legal residence, wherever that residence happened to he located within the 63rd District. However, review of the record reveals quite the opposite \u2014 respondent\u2019s actions during the relevant period were completely inconsistent with one who <em>honestly </em>believed that he could freely live outside his election territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Respondent acknowledged that he moved his legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>residence out of the 1st election division in 2005. Significantly, respondent acknowledged that he knew that he was required by law to change his address after he moved. However, respondent never changed the address on his driver\u2019s license to reflect his move to the second election division.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, despite acknowledging that he was legally required to do so, respondent never changed his voter registration information from the first to the second election division. In fact, respondent fraudulently continued to vote <em>as though he still lived </em>in the 1st election division.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Moreover, respondent continued to list his 1st election division address as his \u201cresidential address\u201d on his 2007 application to carry a concealed weapon (CCW).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This latter act is particularly egregious because the CCW application is an affidavit that states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">Read the following statements and, if you agree, sign below at the time of submission with the clerk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>I understand that this application is executed under oath and swear or affirm under penalty of law that the above answers are true and correct to the best of my knowledge. I understand that intentionally making a false statement is a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 4 years or a fine of not more than $2500, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Consequently, by signing this application with the incorrect address of residence, respondent <em>again </em>lied under oath. Despite this, respondent\u2019s defense is that he did not read the application before signing it. This has <em>never </em>been a valid defense to false swearing on a document requiring an attestation of truthfulness.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s acceptance of respondent\u2019s excuse is as shameful as respondent\u2019s attempt to minimize the consequence of his dishonesty. We judges demand more of ordinary citizens who appear before us in court. Thus, it is hard to understand the \u201cfree pass\u201d the majority has given a fellow member of the judiciary who ought to be held to <em>at least </em>the standard of honesty we require of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Respondent\u2019s intentional violation of the laws governing voting, driver\u2019s licenses, and CCW licensing are independently troubling, not inadvertent, and form a pattern of intentional misdirection. If respondent <em>truly </em>believed that he was free to live in the second election division, then why would he take such great pains to make it appear as though his legal residence was still in the 1st election division? I think the answer is clear. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Respondent took pains to conceal his true residence because he had reason to know that he was <em>not </em>living in the proper election division. After respondent filed a homestead exemption for his second election division home in 2005, it became increasingly impossible for respondent to maintain the lie regarding his legal residence being outside his election division.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Additionally, the testimony indicated that between 2000 and the end of 2004 respondent provided court staff with a telephone number to his property in the second election division for the court\u2019s after-hours duty log.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, beginning in January 2005, respondent provided a telephone number to his property in the 1st election division, but the testimony indicated that calls placed to this number were <em>forwarded </em>to his address in the second election division. Beginning in January 2006, testimony indicated that the after-hours telephone number was changed to a telephone number in the second election division because respondent \u201cwas having problems with his fax machine and he thought that the call forwarding from the other phone was the problem with the fax machine.\u201d However, in July 2006, respondent again reverted to providing court staff with a 1st election division telephone number that was again forwarded to his telephone in the 2nd election division. While the testimony indicated that respondent provided the telephone numbers to the court administrator, at the hearing respondent claimed that the telephone numbers \u201cdidn\u2019t come from [him]\u201d and claimed to be unable to recognize his own telephone number, despite the fact that the telephone number was provided to the court administrator <em>a mere eighteen months </em>before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>hearing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When asked if he had ever had calls forwarded from one address to another, respondent evasively answered \u201cno, not that I know of.\u201d I reject the ridiculous notion that respondent could not recognize his own telephone number and did not \u201cknow\u201d whether he had forwarded telephone calls from one property to the other. More fundamentally, if respondent <em>truly </em>believed that he was free to live legally in the second election division and maintain his judicial office, there would have been no need to forward his telephone calls <em>at all. </em>Thus, I completely agree with Justice Markman that the record establishes that respondent repeatedly lied under oath. The majority incredulously claims that \u201crespondent did <em>nothing </em>to hide the fact\u201d that respondent resided in his second election division home from 2005; however, the plain facts contained in the record indicate otherwise.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aaz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>b. SANCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Having determined that the record fully supports that respondent lied under oath, I believe that the only appropriate sanction is removal from office.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As I noted in <em>In re Noecker:</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">The purpose of Judicial Tenure Commission proceedings is not the punishment of the judge, but to maintain the integrity of the judicial process and to protect the citizenry from corruption and abuse. As such, this Court\u2019s primary concern in determining the appropriate sanction is to restore and maintain the dignity and impartiality of the judiciary and to protect the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\">Our judicial system has long recognized the sanctity and importance of the oath. An oath is a significant act, establishing that the oath taker promises to be truthful. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>the \u201cfocal point of the administration of justice,\u201d a judge is entrusted by the public and has the responsibility to seek truth and justice by evaluating the testimony given under oath. When a judge lies under oath, he or she has failed to internalize one of the central standards of justice and <em>becomes unfit to sit in judgment of others. .. . </em>[S]ome misconduct, such as lying under oath, goes to the very core of judicial duty and <em>demonstrates the lack of character of such a person to be entrusted with judicial privilege [</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">For these reasons, I would adopt the recommendation of the JTC and remove respondent from office.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-7\"> I am aware of the behavior exhibited by the executive director of the Judicial Tenure Commission in January 2008. However, the propriety of his actions is best addressed by the Attorney Grievance Commission, and is not before the Court today. Rather, the sole issue before the Court is whether respondent\u2019s actions constitute judicial misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b765-8\"> I believe that respondent\u2019s admission establishes that he violated Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 20. Because the law forbids abandonment of office while the office holder continues to function in that office, it is sanction-able judicial misconduct for any judge to continue serving in an office that he has vacated. However, in light of my conclusion that respondent lied under oath, and that this misconduct alone warrants his removal, I do not believe it necessary to address the appropriate sanction for either the abandonment of office violation or the sexually inappropriate misconduct that the JTC also concluded respondent committed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b765-9\"> <em>Ante </em>at 653. However, respondent asserted in his brief yet a different justification in his brief, claiming that he was \u201conly required to live within the <em>district </em>in which the court sits\u201d and could \u201cmake his principal residence in any <em>division </em>within that <em>district.\" </em>(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\"> The law requires a person to <em>\u201cimmediately </em>notify the secretary of state of his or her new residence address,\u201d and the failure to do so is punishable by a civil infraction.

Nevertheless, respondent claimed that he was entitled to vote in a district where he did not reside because he owned a house in the first election division and \u201cpaid the taxes.\u201d However, as our constitution provides, and any voting citizen in this state well knows, an elector is qualified by meeting the \u201crequirements of local residence,\u201d not simply by paying taxes. Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 1. Moreover, \u201cresidence\u201d is defined at MCL 168.11 as the \u201cplace at which a person habitually sleeps, keeps his or her personal effects and has a regular place of lodging. \u201d At the time respondent fraudulently voted in the first election division, respondent testified that his property in the first election division was occupied and leased to a \u201cguy who wants to buy it.\u201d I find that respondent\u2019s continued voting in his former electoral district after admitting that he had changed his legal residence <em>entirely </em>undermines his credibility and defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b766-10\"> In addition to being a falsehood, this act is prohibited by law.

He was extraordinarily evasive in his testimony before the JTC. I offer the following example of respondent\u2019s evasive testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-7\"><em>Q: </em>So it\u2019s July, August, September 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-8\">A: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\"><em>Q: </em>With a phone number that\u2019s listed there that ends in a 30 that you\u2019ve read.

However, a listing in the telephone book merely indicates that respondent had <em>an </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>address and telephone number in the second election division. A listing in the telephone book does not indicate one\u2019s legal residence. One\u2019s voter registration and driver\u2019s license <em>are </em>indicative of legal residence and, as stated, these indicia do not support respondent\u2019s or the majority\u2019s position. Let us not forget that respondent affirmatively <em>attested </em>to the incorrect residence address on his 2007 CCW license application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b770-9\"> This Court has generally removed a judge from office when it has been determined, in whole or in part, that a judge has provided false testimony or evidence in JTC proceedings.
