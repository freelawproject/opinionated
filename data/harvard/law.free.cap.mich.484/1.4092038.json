This Court issued an opinion reversing the Court of Appeals and remanding for further proceedings, while holding that \u201cwhen a member insurer\u2019s policy only provides coverage for \u2018reasonable charges,\u2019 the MCCA has authority to refuse to indemnify unreasonable charges.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, plaintiffs United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company and Hartford Insurance Company of the Midwest filed mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>tions for rehearing. We granted plaintiffs\u2019 motions for rehearing, and these cases were resubmitted for decision without further briefing or oral argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">We now hold that the indemnification obligation set forth in MCL 500.3104(2) does not incorporate the reasonableness standard that MCL 500.3107 requires between claimants and member insurers. Furthermore, the powers granted to the MCCA in \u00a7 3104(7) are limited to adjusting the \u201cpractices and procedures\u201d of the member insurers and do not encompass adjustment to the payment amount agreed to between claimants and member insurers. Moreover, we hold that the power granted to the MCCA under MCL 500.3104(8)(g) is limited to furthering the purposes of the MCCA and that determining reasonableness is not one of its purposes. Finally, although the MCCA has no right to directly challenge the reasonableness of a claim, the no-fault statute does provide the MCCA with safeguards against negligent actions of member insurers. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"APH\">\n<em>UNITED STATES FIDELITY &amp; GUARANTY CO v MCCA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">In the first case in these consolidated appeals, Daniel Migdal was injured in a 1981 car accident in which he sustained catastrophic injuries. His injuries included a traumatic brain injury with cerebral spastic quadriplegia, severe oral motor apraxia, and dysphasia. Because of the extent of the injuries, Daniel was prescribed, and received, 24-hour-a-day nursing care. In 1988, Michael Migdal (Mr. Migdal), Daniel\u2019s father and the conservator of Daniel\u2019s estate, sued the no-fault insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>provider, United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company (USF&amp;G), to recover expenses paid for Daniel\u2019s care. In 1990, the parties entered into a consent judgment. Pursuant to the judgment, USF&amp;G paid Mr. Migdal $35,000 in exchange for a release from all contractual liability for nursing care provided before May 10, 1989. Additionally, USF&amp;G agreed to pay $17.50 an hour for Daniel\u2019s home nursing care for the following year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The payments would be made regardless of whether Daniel\u2019s parents provided the nursing care or a third party was brought in to provide the care. The hourly rate, fixed for the first year after the judgment, was subject to an annual increase of 8.5 percent. The increased rate would be compounded based on the previous year\u2019s rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Pursuant to the consent judgment, USF&amp;G paid Mr. Migdal the consented-to hourly wage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *6Once the amount paid to Mr. Migdal had reached the statutory threshold amount of $250,000,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the MCCA began to reimburse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>USF&amp;G for payments made to Mr. Migdal that exceeded the threshold. However, after the hourly rate had increased significantly with the passage of time, the MCCA eventually refused to reimburse USF&amp;G for amounts that USF&amp;G paid Mr. Migdal under the consent judgment, on the ground that the amounts were unreasonable. In 2003, USF&amp;G filed a complaint in the Oakland Circuit Court for a declaratory judgment that the MCCA must reimburse USF&amp;G for the total amount that USF&amp;G paid to Mr. Migdal under the consent judgment, regardless of the reasonableness of the amount. At the time, USF&amp;G was paying $54.84 an hour to Mr. Migdal for Daniel\u2019s nursing care.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The MCCA sought to only be required to reimburse USF&amp;G at a rate of $22.05 an hour, arguing that the agreed-upon rate of $54.84 an hour was unreasonable and, therefore, the MCCA should not have to reimburse USF&amp;G for the total amount. Meanwhile, USF&amp;G sought to have the consent judgment with Mr. Migdal revised, arguing that circumstances had changed when Mr. Migdal hired a third party to c.are for Daniel instead of providing the nursing care himself. Mr. Migdal filed a motion for summary disposition for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court granted Mr. Migdal\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Likewise, the MCCA moved for summary disposition. It contended that there was no question of material fact that the payments made by USF&amp;G to Mr. Migdal were unreasonable. Moreover, the MCCA argued that the no-fault act only required reimbursement of payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>that are reasonable. In a countermotion for summary disposition, USF&amp;G argued that the no-fault act required the MCCA to reimburse it for the full amount paid to Mr. Migdal, despite any unreasonableness regarding the amount paid. Alternatively, USF&amp;G argued that there was a question of material fact concerning the \u201cunreasonableness\u201d of the consent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The trial court granted USF&amp;G\u2019s motion for summary disposition, ruling that the MCCA must reimburse USF&amp;G for its \u201cultimate loss,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> including the entire amount that USF&amp;G had to pay Mr. Migdal, regardless of whether the amount paid was reasonable. The trial court denied the MCCA\u2019s motion for summary disposition. The trial court entered a judgment requiring the MCCA to reimburse USF&amp;G in the amount of $1,725,072 under the no-fault act and holding the MCCA liable for future payments consistent with the consent judgment. The parties agreed to stay the enforcement of the order while the MCCA appealed by right in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\n<em>HARTFORD INS CO v MCCA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">In the second case of these consolidated appeals, Robert Allen was injured in a 2001 car accident in which he sustained catastrophic injuries. His injuries included right-sided pleuritic effusion, brain injuries, quadriparesis, bilateral frozen shoulder, and cardiopathy. Because of the extent of the injuries, Allen was prescribed, and received, 24-hour-a-day care by a licensed nurse. Hartford Insurance Company of the Midwest (Hartford), Allen\u2019s no-fault insurer, initially paid $20 an hour for the nurse. In 2003, Hartford agreed to pay an increased rate of $30 an hour for Allen\u2019s care. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Soon thereafter, Hartford\u2019s payments for Allen\u2019s care exceeded the $250,000 statutory threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The MCCA refused to reimburse Hartford for any payments above $20 an hour for the services rendered. Hartford filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment that would require the MCCA to pay Hartford $571,847.21 as reimbursement for payments exceeding the no-fault threshold. Additionally, Hartford sought a declaration that the MCCA must reimburse Hartford for the total payments above the $250,000 threshold, regardless of the reasonableness of the payments. After the initial filing, Hartford moved for summary disposition, arguing that the no-fault act required the MCCA to reimburse Hartford for the entire amount paid to Allen that exceeded the threshold, regardless of the reasonableness of that amount. The MCCA argued that it only had to reimburse Hartford for reasonable payments and that there was insufficient discovery concerning the reasonableness of the amount of the payments. The circuit court ruled that reasonableness was an element in determining how much the MCCA must reimburse Hartford and that there was insufficient discovery to determine if the payments were reasonable. Hartford immediately appealed the trial court\u2019s holding requiring the element of reasonableness to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">THE COURT OF APPEALS\u2019 DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The Court of Appeals consolidated the USF&amp;G and Hartford cases and held that \u201cMCL 500.3104 does not incorporate a \u2018reasonableness\u2019 requirement and requires the MCCA to reimburse insurers for the <em>actual </em>amount of PIP benefits paid in excess of the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>threshold.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Emphasis in the original.) The MCCA sought leave to appeal in this Court, and this Court granted leave.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This Court issued an opinion reversing the Court of Appeals and remanding for further proceedings, while holding that \u201cwhen a member insurer\u2019s policy only provides coverage for \u2018reasonable charges,\u2019 the MCCA has authority to refuse to indemnify unreasonable charges.\u201d* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Subsequently, plaintiffs United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company and Hartford Insurance Company of the Midwest filed motions for rehearing. We granted plaintiffs\u2019 motions for rehearing and this case was resubmitted for decision without further briefing or oral argument. 483 Mich 918 (2009).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Statutory interpretation is a question of law, which this Court reviews de novo. <em>In re Investigation of March 1999 Riots in East Lansing (People v Pastor), </em>463 Mich 378, 383; 617 NW2d 310 (2000). This Court reviews de novo a trial court\u2019s decision regarding a motion for summary disposition. <em>Herald Co v Bay City, </em>463 Mich 111, 117; 614 NW2d 873 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The issue before this Court involves how much of a member insurer\u2019s coverages the MCCA must indemnify in the event of a catastrophic injury. Specifically, is the MCCA liable for reimbursement of PIP payments based on potentially unreasonable claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The outcome of these cases depends on this Court\u2019s interpretation of the language in MCL 500.3104. An overarching rule of statutory construction is \u201cthat this Court must enforce clear and unambiguous statutory provisions as written.\u201d <em>In re Certified Question (Preferred Risk Mut Ins Co v Michigan Catastrophic Claims Ass\u2019n), </em>433 Mich 710, 721; 449 NW2d 660 (1989) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>(quotation marks omitted). \u201cIf the language of [a] statute is unambiguous, the Legislature must have intended the meaning clearly expressed, and the statute must be enforced as written.\u201d <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 236; 596 NW2d 119 (1999). However, \u201cwhat is \u2018plain and unambiguous\u2019 often depends on one\u2019s frame of reference.\u201d <em>Shiffer v Gibraltar School Dist Bd of Ed, </em>393 Mich 190, 194; 224 NW2d 255 (1974). In order to ascertain this frame of reference, the contested provisions must be read in relation to the statute as a whole and work in mutual agreement. <em>In re Certified Question, </em>433 Mich at 722. See also <em>State Treasurer v Wilson, </em>423 Mich 138, 144; 377 NW2d 703 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Additionally, the frame of reference shares a deep nexus with the intent of the Legislature. \u201cThe primary goal of statutory interpretation is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Title Office, Inc v Van Buren Co Treasurer, </em>469 Mich 516, 519; 676 NW2d 207 (2004), quoting <em>In re MCI Telecom Complaint, </em>460 Mich 396, 411; 596 NW2d 164 (1999). Fundamentally, \u201c[t]his task begins by examining the language of the statute itself. The words of a statute provide the most reliable evidence of [the Legislature\u2019s] intent.. . .\u201d <em>Sun Valley, </em>460 Mich at 236 (citation and quotation marks omitted). This Court must \u201cconsider both the plain meaning of the critical word or phrase as well as \u2018its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237, quoting <em>Bailey v United States, </em>516 US 137, 145; 116 S Ct 501; 133 L Ed 2d 472 (1995). \u201cAs far as possible, effect should be given to every phrase, clause, and word in the statute. The statutory language must be read and understood in its grammatical context, unless it is clear that something different was intended.\u201d <em>Sun Valley, </em>460 Mich at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>In interpreting \u00a7 3104, this Court first must determine how \u00a7 3104(2) corresponds with \u00a7 3107 and how these two provisions correspond within the entire statutory scheme. Section 3104(2) requires that the MCCA \u201cshall provide and each member shall accept indemnification for 100% of the amount of ultimate loss sustained under personal protection insurance coverages in excess of the following amounts in each loss occurrence .... \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Section 3107(l)(a) defines \u201cpersonal protection insurance <em>benefits\u201d </em>as \u201c[allowable expenses consisting of all reasonable charges incurred for reasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery or rehabilitation.\u201d This provision requires that all PIP benefits claimed and paid between the insurer and the insured must be reasonable. The MCCA argues that this Court should incorporate the \u00a7 3107 definition of \u201cbenefits\u201d into \u00a7 3104(2) where \u00a7 3104(2) refers to \u201ccoverages.\u201d However, we decline to do so because the phrase \u201cpersonal protection insurance <em>benefits\u201d </em>has a distinct meaning from the phrase \u201cpersonal protection insurance <em>coverages\u201d </em>that is found in \u00a7 3104(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">When the Legislature uses different words, the words are generally intended to connote different meanings. Simply put, \u201cthe use of different terms within similar statutes generally implies that different meanings were intended.\u201d 2A Singer &amp; Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction (7th ed), \u00a7 46:6, p 252. If the Legislature had intended the same meaning in both statutory provisions, it would have used the same word. Therefore, we disagree with the MCCA and hold that the definition of personal protection insurance <em>benefits </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>found in \u00a7 3107(l)(a) (including the reasonableness standard) is not equivalent to the definition of personal protection insurance <em>coverages </em>in \u00a7 3104(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The distinctive use of the term \u201ccoverages\u201d is important. <em>LeBlanc v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, </em>410 Mich 173, 204; 301 NW2d 775 (1981) (\u201c \u2018Coverage\u2019, a word of precise meaning in the insurance industry, refers to protection afforded by an insurance policy, or the sum of the risks assumed by a policy of insurance.\u201d). Although the terms \u201cbenefits\u201d and \u201ccoverages\u201d are related because of their close proximity in the statute,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the proximity of these two terms does not mean that they are synonymous.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Section 3107 excludes from the definition of \u201callowable expenses\u201d within PIP \u201ccoverage\u201d hospital charges in excess of reasonable and customary semi-private room charges and funeral and burial expenses in amounts specified in the policy (subject to a range specified in that section). This leaves all other charges open to PIP \u201ccoverage.\u201d The fact that the Legislature limited the exceptions to \u201ccoverage\u201d so narrowly indicates that the term \u201ccoverage\u201d is a broader term than \u201cbenefits.\u201d Moreover, because \u201ccoverages\u201d is never given a more restrictive definition elsewhere in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>statutes, the word must be afforded its ordinary, everyday meaning. <em>Sun Valley, </em>460 Mich at 237 (\u201cThe statutory language must be read and understood in its grammatical context, unless it is clear that something different was intended.\u201d). In the grammatical context, the meaning of \u201ccoverages\u201d is its common meaning, limited only by the specific statutory exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u201cCoverage\u201d is defined in dictionaries as the \u201c[e]xtent of protection afforded by an insurance policy [or the] amount of funds reserved to meet liabilities,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> as \u201cprotection against a risk or risks specified in an insurance policy,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> as \u201cthe risks within the scope of an insurance policy,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and as the \u201camount, and extent of risk covered by insurer.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Under the common meaning of \u201ccoverage,\u201d the contractual liability amount that an insurer agrees to pay an insured is considered a part of the insurer\u2019s coverage. USF&amp;G and Hartford paid funds pursuant to a consent judgment and a settlement agreement with the respective insureds. This contractual liability, or coverage, owed by each insurer is the total amount agreed to between the original contracting parties. The reasonableness of the agreed payment amount is not a factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The meaning of \u201ccoverages\u201d in MCL 500.3104 becomes clearer after considering \u201c \u2018its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sun Valley, </em>460 Mich at 236, quoting <em>Bailey, </em>516 US at 145. In the statute, \u201ccoverages\u201d is positioned just after \u201cultimate loss.\u201d \u201cUltimate loss\u201d is statutorily defined as the \u201cactual loss amounts that a member is <em>obligated </em>to pay and that are paid or payable by the member . .. .\u201d MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>500.3104(25)(c) (emphasis added). The obligation of the insurer is to fulfill its duty by honoring its contractual coverages. The duty to perform the contract relates back to the ultimate loss insofar as the ultimate loss includes payment of the obligation, i.e., the total contracted amount. Consequently, the MCCA must reimburse the insurers for 100 percent of the ultimate loss, which reflects the amount to which the insurer and the insured agreed, and subject to PIP coverage. The ultimate loss specifically refers to coverage, which is broader than benefits and is not statutorily limited to reasonable payments.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Moreover, the MCCA is not a no-fault insurer of its member companies, and the member companies are not injured persons entitled to no-fault indemnification. Thus, the relationship between the MCCA and its members is not subject to the reasonableness requirements found in MCL 500.3107. Rather, the Legislature provided in \u00a7 3104(2) that the MCCA would \u201cindemnify\u201d the insuring members for PIP payments. The Legislature did not state that the MCCA would \u201cinsure\u201d or \u201creinsure\u201d the members for amounts greater than the threshold. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed) defines \u201cindemnify\u201d as \u201c[t]o restore the victim of a loss, in whole or in part, by payment... ; to secure against loss or damage. .. .\u201d Indemnification is not a contingent plan like an insurance plan. Instead, it is a set security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>meant to assist against certain circumstances. Here, those circumstances arise when the PIP amount contracted by the insurer exceeds the statutory threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Section 3401(1) states that the MCCA is \u201cnot subject to any laws .. . with respect to insurers.\u201d Thus, the MCCA is not a no-fault insurer, and consequently it is also not a reinsurer. Because the MCCA is not a no-fault insurer, but, rather, an indemnitor of no-fault insurers for benefits in excess of the statutory threshold, \u00a7 3107 does not directly bind the MCCA; it only binds the insurer members and the insured. Section 3107 \u201cmakes both reasonableness and necessity explicit and necessary elements of a <em>claimant\u2019s </em>[insured\u2019s] recovery . . ..\u201d <em>Nasser v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>435 Mich 33, 49; 457 NW2d 637 (1990) (emphasis added). Specifically, it is the insurance company that has the right to deny a claim (or part of a claim) for unreasonableness under \u00a7 3107. The <em>insured </em>then has the burden to prove that the charges are in fact reasonable. See, generally, <em>Nasser, </em>435 Mich at 49, <em>Manley v Detroit Automobile Inter-Ins Exch, </em>425 Mich 140; 388 NW2d 216 (1986), and <em>LaMothe v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>214 Mich App 577; 543 NW2d 42 (1995). Given that the established burden of proof is on the insured, it is counterintuitive to conclude that the member insurance company would benefit from not having the burden of proof in one instance against an insured, but having the burden in another instance against the MCCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The MCCA maintains that the foregoing statutory constructions will lead to higher costs to insureds and will be a disincentive for member insurers to keep payments reasonable. These fears are unfounded. The MCCA is an unincorporated nonprofit association, whose purpose is to provide insurers with indemnification for PIP policies that exceed a certain threshold. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>MCL 500.3104(1). The Legislature created the MCCA \u201cin response to concerns that Michigan\u2019s no-fault law provision for unlimited [PIP] benefits placed too great a burden on insurers, particularly small insurers, in the event of \u2018catastrophic\u2019 injury claims.\u201d <em>In re Certified Question, </em>433 Mich at 714. The MCCA maintains that it should have the ability to unilaterally stop making indemnification payments to a member when it determines that the claim payments are unreasonable. Yet, the MCCA acknowledges that a member can take the MCCA to court over a reasonableness dispute, which would leave a finder of fact as the ultimate authority over whether the payments are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In essence, under the MCCA\u2019s preferred outcome, when a member insurer makes an agreement with an insured (often in a litigation setting, whether it be an arbitration hearing, consent judgment, or declaratory judgment), the member must then sue the MCCA if the MCCA finds that the payment is unreasonable. If this Court were to accept the MCCA\u2019s argument, the logical consequence would be that member insurers would be reluctant to settle with the claimant. Member insurers might then force a jury trial with every catastrophically injured claimant in order to secure a verdict with a \u201creasonable\u201d stamp on the result. This outcome goes against the legislative purpose of ensuring efficient and quick recovery for claimants in the no-fault system. <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 578-579; 267 NW2d 72 (1978) (\u201cThe goal of the no-fault insurance system was to provide victims of motor vehicle accidents assured, adequate, and prompt reparation for certain economic losses.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In response to the MCCA\u2019s concerns, it should be pointed out that the MCCA is not without a safeguard to protect against unreasonable payments. The Legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>lature specifically laid out powers that the MCCA can exercise to guard against unreasonable settlements of catastrophic claims. MCL 500.3104(7)(b) states that the MCCA shall</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">[establish procedures by which members shall promptly report to the association each claim that, on the basis of the injuries or damages sustained, may reasonably be anticipated to involve the association if the member is ultimately held legally liable for the injuries or damages. Solely for the purpose of reporting claims, <em>the member shall in all instances consider itself legally liable for the injuries or damages. </em>The member shall also advise the association of subsequent developments likely to materially affect the interest of the association in the claim. [Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">This statutory language requires and empowers the MCCA to establish procedures to protect itself from unreasonable settlements in all cases involving claims that may exceed the threshold and consequently affect the MCCA. The MCCA\u2019s plan of operation likewise echoes these statutory requirements.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This language enables the MCCA to establish procedures that will enable it to exercise appropriate control over settlements whenever the member reasonably anticipates that the claim will involve the MCCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Only then, not after the claimant and member insurer have reached a settlement, can the MCCA exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>cise control over the settlement process. Under MCL 500.3104(7)(g), the MCCA must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">[establish procedures for reviewing claims procedures and practices of members of the association. <em>If the claims procedures or practices of a member are considered inadequate to properly service the liabilities of the association, the association may undertake </em>or may contract with another person, including another member, <em>to adjust or assist in the adjustment of claims </em>for the member on claims that create a potential liability to the association and may charge the cost of the adjustment to the member. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Thus, when \u00a7 3104(7)(g) is read in conjunction with \u00a7 3104(7)(b), the outcome is that the MCCA is required to review those reports by members that anticipate needing indemnification and to assess the adequacy of the <em>procedures or practices </em>of the member.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Upon a finding of inadequacy, the MCCA can adjust the <em>practices or procedures </em>of the member.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> One of the key protections here is that the MCCA has the power and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>duty to adjust <em>only </em>\u201cprocedures and practices\u201d of the member that produce an unreasonable payment amount; the power does not include the power to adjust the amount after a settlement has been reached.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The MCCA has the power to step in before a settlement has been reached and adjust situations that it anticipates might otherwise expose it to unreasonable indemnification costs. By requiring submission of proposed settlement agreements for approval, the MCCA can protect itself against later having to pay unreasonable claims from member insurers. The exercise of these powers is the MCCA\u2019s protection against a member\u2019s neglect of its duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Finally, the MCCA argues that \u00a7 3104(8) (g) gives it the power to question reasonableness regardless of the statute\u2019s other provisions. Specifically, \u00a7 3104(8)(g) allows the MCCA to \u201c[p]erform other acts not specifically enumerated in this section that are necessary or proper to accomplish the purposes of the association and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>are not inconsistent with this section or the plan of operation.\u201d However, this section does not give the MCCA carte blanche to simply avoid a member insurer\u2019s agreement that it finds unreasonable. The power granted under \u00a7 3104(8)(g) is limited to accomplishing the \u201cpurposes of the association.\u201d More importantly, the exercise of this power cannot be \u201cinconsistent with this section or the plan of operation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plan of operation created pursuant to \u00a7 3104(17) must be <em>\u201cconsistent </em>with the objectives and provisions of this section, which shall provide for the economical, fair, and nondiscriminatory administration of the association <em>and for the prompt and efficient provision of indemnity.\u201d </em>MCL 500.3104(17) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Section 3104(8)(g) allows the MCCA to fulfill the specific requirements of the statute. Accordingly, we interpret \u00a7 3104(8) (g) as granting the MCCA the limited power to further its purpose of prompt and efficient indemnification of its members. To interpret that section as granting any further power, such as the power to decline indemnification on the basis of the reasonableness of the indemnification amount, would be inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">IV RESPONSE TO THE DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The dissent raises the concern that a decision in favor of plaintiffs in this case will result in substantially increased insurance costs. Certainly, insurance costs are a critical concern, but they are a policy concern that belongs to the Legislature. Nonetheless, we observe that the concern appears highly speculative and, indeed, unfounded. There is no evidence that insurers have engaged or will engage in slack negotiations. It bears mentioning here that there is no indication that the settlements in these cases were unreasonable when made.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The dissent bases its concern on an affidavit from defendant\u2019s executive director in which she refers to an estimate provided by consultants to defendant. No basis is given in the affidavit for the estimated increase in costs. And there is reason to wonder about this estimate, at least inasmuch as it might be based on an anticipated decision from this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">First, there is no evidence that defendant has routinely or even occasionally challenged the reasonableness of insurers\u2019 settlements with their insureds until very recently. It is difficult to understand how it will cost defendant extravagant sums to give up a practice it has only recently begun. Second, it is unknown whether the actuarial assessment factored in the effect of defendant\u2019s potential use of the cost-containment procedure actually provided by the Legislature in MCL 500.3104(7) (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">As mentioned, the Legislature has provided that \u201c[i]f the claims procedures or practices of a member are considered inadequate to properly service the liabilities of the association, the association may undertake ... to adjust or assist in the adjustment of claims for the member on claims that create a potential liability to the association . . . .\u201d MCL 500.3104(7)(g). There is no evidence that the actuarial assessment considered the effect of defendant\u2019s implementation of this legislatively provided cost-savings mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The dissent additionally fails to recognize that there is a compelling policy reason to reject defendant\u2019s claim that it may review settlements for reasonableness: namely, to limit litigation and promote settlements. This Court has long recognized that \u201c[t]he goal of the no-fault insurance system was to provide victims of motor vehicle accidents assured, adequate, and prompt reparation for certain eco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>nomic losses.\u201d <em>Nelson v Transamerica Ins Services, </em>441 Mich 508, 514; 495 NW2d 370 (1992) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Additionally, this Court has stated that \u201c[t]he act is designed to minimize administrative delays and factual disputes that would interfere with achievement of the goal of expeditious compensation of damages suffered in motor vehicle accidents.\u201d <em>Miller v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 410 </em>Mich 538, 568; 302 NW2d 537 (1981). The ability of insurers to settle claims is essential to meeting these goals. Yet, if defendant can reexamine settlements of reasonableness long after they are made, then insurers will be very reluctant to make settlements. Further, a new layer of litigation for after-the-fact reasonableness assessments, such as this one, would be inevitable. There is no evidence that the actuarial assessment on which the dissent relies has accounted for the substantial increase in litigation costs that would result if this Court allows defendant the extrastatutory power to question settlements for reasonableness after they are made.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">But, again, these are policy concerns best addressed by the Legislature. It appears that the Legislature has indeed balanced these concerns in the provisions of MCL 500.3104, and there is no reason for this Court to apply a strained construction to the statutes to achieve a goal contrary to the purposes of the no-fault act. In the unlikely event that insurers become milquetoast negotiators, defendant has the statutorily provided protection to remedy the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">v CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">We hold that the indemnification obligation set forth in \u00a7 3104(2) does not incorporate the reasonableness standard that \u00a7 3107 requires between claimants and member insurers. Furthermore, the powers granted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the MCCA in \u00a7 3104(7) are limited to adjusting the \u201cpractices and procedures\u201d of the member insurers and do not encompass adjustment to the payment amount agreed to between claimants and member insurers. Finally, we hold that the power granted to the MCCA under \u00a7 3104(8)(g) is limited to furthering the purposes of the MCCA, and that determining reasonableness is not one of its purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals holding that the MCCA must reimburse its member insurers 100 percent of the ultimate loss exceeding the statutory threshold for claims without a reduction based on its unilateral assessment of the reasonableness of the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b80-8\">Kelly, C.J., and Cavanagh and Hathaway, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-11\"> <em>United States Fidelity Ins &amp; Guaranty Co v Michigan Catastrophic Claims Ass\u2019n, </em>482 Mich 414, 417; 759 NW2d 154 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b60-8\"> <em>United States Fidelity Ins &amp; Guaranty Co v Michigan Catastrophic Claims Ass\u2019n, </em>483 Mich 918 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b61-6\"> Mr. Migdal created a company to manage Daniel\u2019s care.

However, Justice Young, in his dissent joined by Justice Corrigan, now takes the opportunity well after the motions for rehearing have been decided to attack the remaining justices who did not vote to retain this Court\u2019s earlier decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">The dissent erroneously asserts that the justices voting to grant rehearing erred because <em>Peoples v Evening News Ass\u2019n, </em>51 Mich 11, 21; 16 NW 185 (1883), held that this Court is precluded from granting rehearing when the composition of the Court has changed, absent any new arguments from the parties in the cases. However, contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertions, this Court merely stated in <em>Peoples </em>that a change in the composition of this Court cannot be the <em>basis </em>for granting rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">Accordingly, if the composition of the Court changes, and the composition becomes such that a majority of the Court sees a reason to grant rehearing, the majority is not precluded under <em>Peoples </em>from granting rehearing. If, for instance, four justices on the newly composed Court concluded that the challenged opinion was erroneous, those justices can vote to grant rehearing. The same holds true whether the deciding vote is a new justice who joined the Court after the challenged opinion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>released or whether the deciding vote comes from a justice who signed the challenged opinion and changed his or her mind after further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj\">This practice is consistent with MCR 2.119(F)(3), which creates a \u201cpalpable error\u201d standard for rehearing cases. It is up to the moving party to show palpable error that would lead to a different disposition in the case. If a majority of the Court is convinced by the moving party, the Court has the discretion to grant rehearing. Furthermore, while MCR 2.119(F)(3) states that a motion for rehearing will generally not be granted if the motion only presents the same arguments decided in the original disposition of the case, MCR 2.119(F)(3) explicitly refrains from \u201crestricting the discretion of the court\u201d to grant rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab2\">Accordingly, we are not persuaded by the dissent\u2019s attempts to discredit this Court\u2019s order that granted rehearing in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b68-5\"> The amounts are statutorily set to increase over time.

However, one incentive comes from higher premiums paid to the MCCA. See MCL 500.3104(7)(d) (requiring that the MCCA assess its member companies an annual premium on each of their no-fault policies written in Michigan). If all the individual members act in a manner that does not regard the reasonableness of their settlements, then insurance premiums will increase greatly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b74-8\"> Section 3104 includes numerous other rules for the MCCA, such as membership requirements, liability, and creation of a \u201cplan of operation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b74-9\"> Art X, \u00a7 10.01 of the plan of operation provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">Members shall report to the Association such information as the Board may require on forms prescribed by the Board: (a) As soon as practicable after the loss occurrence, Members shall report each claim which, on the basis of the injuries or damages sustained, may reasonably be anticipated to result in a Reimbursable Ultimate Loss, and for purposes of reporting the Member shall consider itself legally liable for the injuries and damages.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\"> The MCCA argued that because part of \u00a7 3104(7)(g) uses the term \u201cmay\u201d instead of \u201cmust\u201d in describing some of its potential powers, the MCCA has greater power than what directly follows in the statute to limit or control the individual member insurers. The MCCA wishes to conclude that since the section does not set forth a duty to act in a specific way (e.g., review claims), it allows the MCCA to act how <em>it </em>wants regarding member claims, including questioning their reasonableness. This is erroneous. The premise and purpose of the MCCA is to indemnify insurers for payments beyond the threshold amount, so that insurance firms of all sizes can compete in Michigan\u2019s no-fault market without fear of sustaining disproportionate catastrophic loss claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b75-8\"> The plan of operation also echoes the statute in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">If a Member or 3103 Member refuses to timely submit the reports or information required of it pursuant to Section 10.01 or otherwise, or if the Board should determine that the reports and information submitted by a Member or 3103 Member are unreliable or incomplete, the Board may, at the member\u2019s expense, direct that an authorized representative of the Association (which may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>be another member) shall audit and inspect such member\u2019s records and compile the required information and data. [Art X, \u00a7 10.02.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b76-9\"> Although \u00a7 3104(7)(g) states that the MCCA may \u201cadjust or assist in the adjustment of claims,\u201d the practical effect of \u00a7 3104(7)(g) is that only the MCCA is able to prescribe procedures and practices by which to ensure the reasonableness of the amounts that members agree to pay to claimants. When the MCCA asserts its power to adjust or assist in the adjustment of a claim, the MCCA effectively steps into the shoes of the member insurer. The claim that the MCCA reviews for adjustment purposes is the insured\u2019s claim with the member insurer, not the member insurer\u2019s reimbursement claim with the MCCA. Accordingly, the MCCA, standing in the shoes of the member insurer, is limited to the member insurer\u2019s power to review the insured\u2019s claim for reasonableness as spelled out in the member insurer\u2019s policy, a settlement agreement, or a consent judgment. Thus, even when the MCCA assists in or assumes control over the claims adjustment process, the amount payable is still dictated by the amount that the member insurer is \u201cobligated\u201d to pay to the insured when a settlement already has been reached.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b80-9\">YOUNG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKp\">(dissenting).

WHAT CHANGED?</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The facts have not changed. The text of the statute at issue has not changed. The parties\u2019 arguments have not changed. And the rationale advanced in the opinions of this Court has not changed. Yet, within a matter of months, a decision of this Court, thoughtfully briefed, argued, and considered by seven justices, is no longer worth the paper it was written on. Even the casual observer, however, does not really need to ask why. The reason is obvious: On January 1, 2009, the composition of this Court changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">II. WHY IS THIS CASE BEING REHEARD?</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">This case was argued on October 1, 2008. On November 4,2008, Justice HATHAWAY defeated then-Chief Justice TAYLOR in the election for his seat on this Court. This case was decided on December 29, 2008, with former Chief Justice TAYLOR casting his vote with the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>The new majority\u2019s opinion today offers no new rationale or argument. In fact, it is merely an extended quotation of Justice WEAVER\u2019S former dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"AP\">For over a century this Court has adhered to the principle that a motion for rehearing should be denied <em>unless </em>a party has raised an issue of fact or law that was not previously considered but which may affect the outcome.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, this Court codified that principle in our court rules.5 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">As Justice Weaver\u2019s former dissent in these cases and the majority\u2019s new opinion make obvious, the parties have not raised a new issue of fact or law to merit rehearing. The only difference is in the membership of this Court. As early as 1883, this Court had the wisdom to realize that such a change is not a proper ground for rehearing. In <em>Peoples v Evening News Ass\u2019n,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court\u2019s opinion on a motion for rehearing stated in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>This case having been heard and decided when three judges only were sitting, and a change in the Court having taken place and a further change being [about] to occur on the first of January, a motion is now made for a rehearing at the next January term before the full Court as it will then be constituted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\"><em>Held, </em>unanimously, that a rehearing will not be ordered on the ground merely that a change of members of the bench has either taken place or is about to occur.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">By ordering rehearing simply because a change in the Court has taken place, the new majority has overruled the longstanding and clear principle of <em>Peoples.8 </em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Will any change in an assigned judge now justify the reopening of a predecessor\u2019s ruling?</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">It is apparent that the new majority feels unencumbered by such principles \u2014 even one that has endured for more than 100 years. And, perhaps, its members no longer feel a need to be cosseted by the concerns and beliefs that they professed to have for the past decade when they were members of the philosophical minority of this Court. Indeed, Chief Justice KELLY once exclaimed that a recent decision of the Court being reconsidered \u201chas hardly had time to become outmoded.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Justice CAVANAGH similarly protested that \u201c [i]f a majority of the Court believes that reconsideration should be granted, then I believe that the <em>proper </em>course would be to receive briefs and hear arguments on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the defendant\u2019s constitutional argument before remanding the case to the trial court.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Because nothing in the facts, arguments, or legal rationale has changed, I continue to support this Court\u2019s original decision and do not feel the need to restate it in its entirety here.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">III. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The facts and procedural history of these consolidated appeals are simple, uncontested, and have been set out by this Court in detail three times.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The central question here is whether an insurance company that strikes a bad bargain with its insured may fob off on the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (MCCA), a nonprofit entity created by the Legislature to spread the costs associated with catastrophic automobile injuries, these \u201cunreasonable\u201d expenses. In our earlier decision, we held that the MCCA had explicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>statutory authority to resist assuming responsibility for an insurance company\u2019s <em>unreasonable </em>payouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Plaintiff United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company (USF&amp;G) entered into a consent judgment with its insured, Daniel Migdal, which resulted in USF&amp;G paying $54.84 an hour for attendant care services.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Plaintiff Hartford Insurance Company of the Midwest (Hartford) entered into a settlement agreement with its insured, Robert Allen, which required that Hartford pay $30 an hour for attendant care services.

Rather, this Court, consistent with the definitions advanced by the majority, interpreted \u201ccoverages\u201d as the \u201cprotection afforded by an insurance <em>policy\u201d </em>and explained that \u201cthe member insurer\u2019s <em>policy </em>will ultimately control the standard for the MCCA\u2019s review because the <em>policy </em>establishes the \u2018personal protection insurance coverages.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Referring to the consent judgment and settlement agreement at issue, the new majority contends that \u201c [tjhis contractual liability, <em>or coverage, </em>owed by each insurer is the total amount agreed to between the original contracting parties.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The fallacy in this assertion is that the consent judgment or settlement agreement is \u201ccoverage.\u201d As amply demonstrated by the definitions that the majority cites, \u201ccoverage\u201d refers to the underlying <em>policy </em>purchased by the insured. That <em>policy </em>is the only relevant contract. The consent judgment and settlement agreement are separate contractual, albeit judicially sanctioned, agreements. They are distinctly <em>not </em>\u201cthe no-fault personal protection insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>anee coverages that are generally the subject of the act, i.e., those which were written in this state to provide the compulsory security requirements of \u00a7 3101(1) of the no-fault act for the \u2018owner or registrant of a motor vehicle required to be registered in this state\u2019. .. .\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Because the majority offers no principled rationale for departing from the definitions that it cites or this Court\u2019s prior interpretation of \u201cpersonal protection insurance coverages,\u201d I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The majority makes additional erroneous assertions. First, the majority asserts that member insurers will have an incentive to make reasonable settlements of catastrophic claims because, if they do not, the MCCA premiums will increase.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The majority appears unaware of how incentives, or the MCCA, work. The premium that the MCCA charges to cover the liabilities it must statutorily assume is evenly distributed among the member insurers<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and then passed on to those who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>buy no-fault insurance.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Indeed, this Court has been informed that in <em>response to the order granting rehearing in this case, </em>the MCCA raised its rates by 19 percent per policy (or $693.8 million more for MCCA assessments in the aggregate for this year) to create the reserves necessary to pay the more expansive claims for unreasonable charges that the new majority\u2019s opinion permits. Contrary to the new majority\u2019s belief that an insurer will have an economic incentive to bargain for \u201creasonable\u201d payments to its insureds, the majority opinion will have the perverse effect of eliminating an insurer\u2019s incentive to negotiate reasonable settlements. Indeed, instead of providing insurers a protective shield against unreasonable catastrophic claims, the majority opinion provides no-fault plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys a lethal sword against an insurer that insists on a reasonable settlement. MCL 500.3148(1) provides that a claimant\u2019s attorney fee is charged to the insurer \u201cif the court finds that the insurer unreasonably refused to pay the claim or unreasonably delayed in making proper payment.\u201d Under the majority\u2019s decision, an insurer has no reason to refuse any claim; thus, a claimant\u2019s attorney can use the threat of attorney fees to force an insurer into an unreasonable settlement.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Under the majority\u2019s decision, insurers will be encouraged to negotiate wrereason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>able settlements and pass these off onto the MCCA. As stated, any liability that the MCCA must assume is eventually passed on to anyone in Michigan who must buy auto insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Perhaps the majority can explain why the legislative method for containing costs for Michigan\u2019s no-fault insurance customers is an inferior purpose to their preferred policy objective. In particular, why is it an inferior purpose at a time when the Governor has requested an auto insurance rate freeze<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and unemployment in Michigan has exceeded 14 percent?<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">My point is not that our decision should be premised on keeping no-fault insurance affordable. Indeed, I maintain that such \u201c \u2018[p]olicy decisions are properly left for the people\u2019s elected representatives in the Legislature\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and that the Legislature <em>has </em>made the policy decision in this case. Rather, I raise this issue because elections matter. The majority has seen fit to engage in its own policy-making while relying on erroneous assumptions. This is a lethal combination that will result in harmful, unintended consequences. While it may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>politically expedient to position oneself as \u201clooking out for the little guy,\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> this case is an excellent example of how acting on such an altruistic impulse rather than applying the law results in a negative consequence for the vast majority of our citizens. In this context, each of us who must purchase this mandatory no-fault coverage is a \u201clittle guy.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Second, the majority emphasizes that the MCCA may <em>only </em>adjust a member insurer\u2019s \u201cpractices and procedures.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The majority then immediately (and inconsistently but accurately) concedes that MCL 500.3104(7)(g) permits the MCCA to \u201cadjust or assist in the adjustment of claims\u201d and \u201c[wjhen the MCCA asserts its power to adjust or assist in the adjustment of a claim, the MCCA effectively steps into the shoes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>member insurer.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> I previously agreed with these propositions.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Thus, I struggle to comprehend for what purpose the majority resists the simple proposition that the MCCA is statutorily authorized to adjust claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Third, \u201c[p]laintiffs argue[d] that if the MCCA may reject member insurer claims on the basis of the reasonableness of the charges, member insurers will need to seek assurances that the MCCA will reimburse certain payments before making them, thus delaying payment.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The prospect of delayed payment seems to be a primary concern that drives the new majority\u2019s analysis. In support of its construction, it contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">If this Court were to accept the MCCA\u2019s argument, the logical consequence would be that member insurers would be reluctant to settle with the claimant. Member insurers might then force a jury trial with every catastrophically injured claimant in order to secure a verdict with a \u201creasonable\u201d stamp on the result.[<footnotemark>38</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The majority employs this policy-based rationale to depart from its own definitions of \u201ccoverages\u201d because otherwise \u201c[t]his outcome goes against the legislative purpose of ensuring efficient and quick recovery for claimants in the no-fault system.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The majority fails to explain, however, how its alternative construction actually resolves the issue. In fact, it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">The majority concedes that the MCCA <em>has authority to </em>\u201crequir[e] submission of proposed settlement agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ments for approval. .. .\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> This is the very outcome that the plaintiff insurance companies here sought to avoid. Indeed, I believe that \u201crequiring submission of proposed settlement agreements\u201d or \u201cseeking assurances that the MCCA will reimburse certain payments\u201d would have been a natural consequence of <em>USF&amp;G I, </em>because it actually gave meaning to the plain language of this statute. The MCCA is likely to act on the majority\u2019s advice (indeed, it <em>should) </em>and mandate that member insurers afford it the opportunity to object to proposed settlements or other agreements <em>before </em>they become binding. Ironically, it appears that even the majority does not deny that the MCCA has this statutory power.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Thus, the issue of delay is not resolved by the majority\u2019s opinion. Moreover, the majority\u2019s opinion does not address circumstances, like the present cases, where the MCCA was <em>not </em>afforded an opportunity to reject the agreements, which likely explains the $693.8 million bill that will be passed onto and shared by every Michigan automobile owner because of the increased and uncontrolled liability that the new majority\u2019s opinion will create for the MCCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">We, as jurists, are ill-prepared to make complicated policy-based judgments unrelated to the policy choices that the Legislature has enacted. We do the least damage when we merely follow the Legislature\u2019s lead by giving the words of a statute a plain reading and enforc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>ing the statute as written. \u201cThe Legislature, unlike the judiciary, is institutionally equipped to assess the numerous trade-offs associated with a particular policy choice.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The Legislature has made difficult choices, and it used particular words with particular meanings to convey those choices. Our prior opinion respected our role as jurists, and the Legislature\u2019s role as policy-maker, by interpreting the relevant statutory language in a manner consistent with the plain meaning of the words chosen by the Legislature. In an effort to avoid the meaning of the words chosen by the Legislature, the new majority has engaged in a wandering, policy-based analysis that is as flawed as it is misguided. It is an expensive mistake for which every policyholder in Michigan will pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Undeterred and aiming to quell the likely negative response to its policy-based decision, the new majority asserts that my concerns \u201cappear[] highly speculative and, indeed, unfounded.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> My concerns will cease to be \u201chighly speculative\u201d and \u201cunfounded\u201d when they are reflected in the MCCA\u2019s annual assessments. Michigan drivers will soon receive their no-fault insurance bills (I have received mine) with the updated higher MCCA assessment for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009. At that point, Michigan drivers will be free to determine for themselves whether my concerns are sound and based in reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-7\">Corrigan, J., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b96-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"Al\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-11\"> <em>United States Fidelity Ins &amp; Guaranty Co v Michigan Catastrophic Claims Ass\u2019n, </em>482 Mich 414; 759 NW2d 154 (2008) (hereinafter <em>USF&amp;G I).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b80-12\"> I note that the majority in this case is the new philosophically aligned majority: Justices Weaver, Cavanagh, and Hathaway and Chief Justice Kelly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b80-13\"> See <em>USF&amp;G I, supra </em>at 432 n 32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b81-9\"> In response to the motions for rehearing, the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (MCCA) has conducted an actuarial assessment to detail the expected increase in auto insurance premiums that reversal of our original decision will produce \u2014 19 percent more in catastrophic claims premiums to be precise.

In reviewing whether there was a due process violation in the refusal of Justice Benjamin<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to disqualify himself, the United States Supreme Court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">We conclude that there is a serious risk of actual bias\u2014 based on objective and reasonable perceptions \u2014 when a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>case by raising funds or directing the judge\u2019s election campaign when the case was pending or imminent....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">Our decision today addresses an <em>extraordinary </em>situation where the Constitution requires recusal. Massey and its <em>amici </em>predict that various adverse consequences will follow from recognizing a constitutional violation <em>here </em>\u2014 ranging from a flood of recusal motions to unnecessary interference with judicial elections. We disagree. <em>The facts now before us are extreme by any measure. </em>The parties point to no other instance involving judicial campaign contributions that presents a potential for bias comparable to the circumstances in this case. <em>[Id., </em>slip op at 14, 16-17 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Given this test, I find no arguable due process violation in the cases before me. There is nothing alleged by the MCCA that would cause any reasonable person to believe that there is a significant and disproportionate influence being asserted upon me under any objective analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Despite the theories proffered by the MCCA, my husband has no connection to or financial interest in this matter. He is not an attorney for or employee of any party, nor is he a litigant in either of these cases. He has no relationship with either the attorneys or the litigants in these cases. The MCCA asserts that, because my spouse has handled cases in the field of no-fault insurance law, I must recuse myself. However, this assertion suggests a basis for recusal that is so attenuated from the facts of these cases that it strains reasoned logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">This is not to say that parties should be impeded from bringing such motions. However, not every hypothetical theory proffered by a litigant must be accepted as accurate or controlling. The issue to be decided is one of due process. Any alleged due process claim must be evaluated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>by an objective standard. Due process does not require that a justice recuse himself or herself merely because the justice\u2019s spouse or child is an attorney practicing in the field of law that is involved in the disputed case, just as due process would not require a justice\u2019s recusal in all medical malpractice cases merely because the justice\u2019s spouse is a physician or require a justice\u2019s recusal in all cases involving school systems merely because the justice\u2019s spouse is a teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In conclusion, I have no personal bias or prejudice for or against any party in this matter. Moreover, neither I nor any member of my immediate family has any real or arguable financial interest in this case. The allegations made by the MCCA are not a basis for recusal because there is no appearance of impropriety and no due process violation. Accordingly, there is no reason to recuse myself.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Having carefully considered this motion for recusal, I deny it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b101-6\">KELLY, C.J., and CAVANAGH, J.

Rather, I would order supplemental briefing of the application of <em>Caperton v A T Massey Coal Co, Inc, </em>556 US _; 129 S Ct 2252; 173 L Ed 2d 1208 (2009) <em>(Caperton), </em>to these cases. <em>Caperton </em>addressed the disqualification of a judge when a party alleges that the judge\u2019s interest in a case requires recusal under the Due Process Clause of the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>constitution. To weigh whether recusal is required, <em>Caperton </em>requires an assessment of whether a serious, objective risk of actual bias exists that requires the judge to recuse himself or herself. Because the MCCA argues that Justice Hathaway\u2019s participation in these cases violates its federal due process rights, <em>Caperton </em>is relevant and could prove controlling. Indeed, the MCCA has submitted <em>Caperton </em>to this Court as supplemental authority in support of its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The scope of <em>Caperton </em>and how courts will implement it present significant unanswered questions, particularly for our Court. <em>Caperton </em>held that a state supreme court justice was disqualified from hearing a case involving a corporate party whose chairman and CEO had expended $3 million to support the justice\u2019s campaign, although the individual expended this money independently and through donations to an independent political group. <em>Caperton, </em>129 S Ct at 2257. The Court concluded that the justice was disqualified although he professed that the funds were solicited and expended without his knowledge, direction, or control under state election laws very similar to our own. See <em>Caperton v A T Massey Coal Co, Inc, </em>223 W Va 624, 703-705; 679 SE2d 223 (2008) <em>(W Va Caperton.) </em>(Benjamin, acting C.J., concurring). Indeed, Michigan allows independent political groups to expend unlimited money during elections, often without being required even to reveal their funding sources.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For example, during the 2008 election cycle, independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>expenditures aimed at the race for Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s current seat on this Court topped $3.75 million.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">For these reasons, in my view, deciding the MCCA\u2019s recusal motion within days of <em>Caperton </em>is precipitous. <em>Caperton </em>was released on June 8, 2009. We have hardly had time to digest the opinion, much less its ramifications, particularly given that the opinion is positively Delphic in explaining the standards for courts attempting to implement it. Four justices of this Court now vote, without any explanation or the benefit of fact-finding, to support Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s decision to participate in these cases. Thus, although we have had little time to study <em>Caperton </em>and do not have the benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>of briefing on it, the Court proceeds essentially to hold that such a vote is a mandatory procedure for all recusal motions raising due process concerns.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">THE MCCA\u2019S MOTION FOR RECUSAL</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The most relevant aspects of the MCCA\u2019s motion follow. After this Court issued its March 2009 decision to grant reconsideration<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of its December 2008 decision,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> occasioned by newly elected Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s partici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>pation in these cases, the MCCA moved for her recusal. Specifically, the MCCA argues that Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s husband, Michael Kingsley, has an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceedings because he is a practicing plaintiffs\u2019 no-fault attorney in Michigan. As such, he has a direct interest that is more than <em>de minimis </em>in the MCCA\u2019s unlimited obligations to reimburse insurers for personal protection insurance benefits paid to insureds who have been catastrophically injured in automobile accidents.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The MCCA further asserts that it reimburses insurers for payments made to Kingsley\u2019s clients, having made such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>a reimbursement as recently as April 9, 2009.* <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The MCCA\u2019s obligation to reimburse insurers \u2014 and the potential resulting benefits to plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys \u2014 is directly at issue in these cases. Indeed, the MCCA asserts that it has raised the amounts needed to pay expected claims and its reserves by almost $694 million in anticipation of this Court\u2019s likely reversal on rehearing of its prior decision, stemming from the participation of newly elected Justice HATHAWAY in the decision after rehearing. The MCCA further states that this increase is the primary cause of the 19 percent increase in its assessments for catastrophic coverage this year, which affects all no-fault insurance policy holders\u2019 rates. The MCCA claims that if, on rehearing, this Court prohibits the MCCA from engaging in a \u201creasonableness\u201d inquiry, see n 6 of this statement, attorneys will reap the rewards at the expense of Michigan drivers, whose insurance rates will rise to support the resulting increased systemic costs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>THE <em>CAPERTON </em>DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">In <em>Caperton, </em>the United States Supreme Court \u201cunderscore[d] the need for objective rules\u201d and asserted that the Due Process Clause requires recusal motions to be decided \u201cby objective standards that do not require proof of actual bias.\u201d <em>Caperton, </em>129 S Ct at 2263. In concluding that recently elected West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals Justice Brent Benjamin was disqualified from hearing the underlying case as a result of substantial campaign expenditures by the chairman, CEO, and president of the respondent company, A.

Significantly, the Court thus considered the purported facts underlying the motion for recusal, see <em>Caperton, </em>129 S Ct at 2264,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and concluded, on the basis <em>of its </em>assessment of those facts, that \u201cthere was... a serious, objective risk of actual bias,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2265.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">QUESTIONS RAISED BY <em>CAPERTON</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">In light of the <em>Caperton </em>opinion, I do not think that we can resolve the MCCA\u2019s recusal motion \u2014 which squarely raises due process concerns \u2014 without first addressing the following questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">\u2022 Does this Court\u2019s historical recusal practice\u2014 which permits each justice to decide motions for his or her recusal and which Justice HATHAWAY follows here\u2014 comport with the <em>Caperton </em>Court\u2019s requirement for objective standards? Justice HATHAWAY states: \u201c[N]either I nor any member of my immediate family has any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>real or arguable financial interest in this case. The allegations made by the MCCA are not a basis for recusal because there is no appearance of impropriety and no due process violation.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 47. She adds: \u201cGiven [the Caperton] test, I find no arguable due process violation in the cases before me. There is nothing alleged by the MCCA that would cause any reasonable person to believe that there is a significant and disproportionate influence being asserted upon me under any objective analysis.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 46. But the challenged justice in <em>Caperton </em>issued similar statements in which he declined to recuse himself, explaining that the moving party had provided no objective evidence of actual bias and expressing his subjective opinion that none of his motives were improper. <em>Caperton, </em>129 S Ct at 2262-2263. Indeed, West Virginia\u2019s recusal rules are strikingly similar to the practice followed by this Court. See <em>W Va Caperton, supra </em>at 702. Like Justice HATHAWAY \u2014 albeit while providing extensive factual detail concerning the allegations against him and legal precedent on the subject of recusal\u2014 Justice Benjamin asserted: \u201cI have no pecuniary interest in the outcome of this matter. ... I have no personal involvement with nor harbor any personal antipathy toward any party or counsel herein.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697. He added: \u201c[N]o improper act or conduct, and no appearance of an improper act or conduct with respect to this case, or any other case, has occurred on my part[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 701. \u201cSimply put, I do not have, nor was there any evidence to show that I had a \u2018direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest\u2019 in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702. Yet the United States Supreme Court concluded that his subjective assertions that he lacked actual bias were insufficient for constitutional purposes. <em>Caperton, </em>129 S Ct at 2263. Particularly in light of the similarities between Michigan\u2019s and West Virginia\u2019s recusal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>practices \u2014 indeed, in both states recusal decisions have been left to the discretion of the individual justice whose recusal is sought, <em>W Va Caperton, supra </em>at 702 \u2014 I simply cannot conclude without further study that the historic practice followed by Justice HATHAWAY today complies with <em>Caperton. </em>Nor can I conclude that Justice HATHAWAY may conclusively disavow any similarity to the facts of <em>Caperton </em>by simply offering her own opinion that \u201c[t]here is nothing alleged by the MCCA that would cause any reasonable person to believe that there is a significant and disproportionate influence being asserted upon me under any objective analysis.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u2022 Is it sufficient under <em>Caperton </em>that four justices of this Court have voted to support Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s decision here? Although <em>Caperton </em>expressly failed to address a proper method for fact-finding, the Court reached its decision by carefully considering the facts surrounding Justice Benjamin\u2019s election. Here the MCCA alleges that Justice HATHAWAY must recuse herself because her husband has more than a <em>de minimis </em>financial interest in the subject matter of these cases. The MCCA points to very recent payments it has just made to one of Mr. Kingsley\u2019s clients. It also alleges that it has raised the amounts needed to pay expected claims and its reserves by $693.8 million in anticipation of this Court\u2019s potential reversal on rehearing of its earlier ruling in these cases; it states that the rate hike will be necessary because, if we reverse, claimants such as Mr. Kingsley\u2019s clients will receive substantially higher <em>payments </em>\u2014 which <em>result in higher attorney contingency fees </em>\u2014 because insurers will have no legal basis for resisting unreasonable settlement demands made by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys. Can we possibly decide whether these alleged facts establish that \u201c \u2018the probability of actual bias on the part of [Justice HATHAWAY] is too high to be constitutionally tolerable\u2019 \u201d without first engaging in some kind of independent inquiry to test the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>and Justice Hathaway\u2019s summary denial of it?<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Caperton, </em>129 S Ct at 2257, quoting <em>Withrow v Larkin, </em>421 US 35, 47 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">I raise these concerns in part in light of the dissent filed by Chief Justice Roberts in <em>Caperton. </em>He asks, among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>40 questions, whether \u2014 although a justice does not have an actual financial interest in the case \u2014 a litigant may challenge the justice\u2019s refusal to recuse himself or herself in federal district court under 42 USC 1983,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>which permits a person deprived of a federal right by a state official to sue for damages. <em>Caperton, </em>129 S Ct at 2271 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). He also reasonably asks whether the parties are \u201centitled to discovery with respect to the judge\u2019s recusal decision\u201d and, \u201c [i]f a judge erroneously fails to recuse, do we apply harmless-error review?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2271-2272. As he suggests, the ramifications of <em>Caperton </em>are broad. This Court should seriously consider how to properly dispose of a <em>\u201cCaperton </em>claim\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> alleging that the probability of a justice\u2019s bias disqualifies that justice under the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">I would thus invite thorough supplemental briefing on these significant issues before disposing of the MCCA\u2019s recusal motion. Because the majority has chosen to precipitously resolve this disqualification motion, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-6\"> The Michigan Campaign Finance Act, MCL 169.201 <em>et seg., </em>does not regulate certain expenditures, including those \u201cfor communication on a subject or issue if the communication does not support or oppose a ballot question or candidate by name or clear inference.\u201d MCL 169.206(2)(b).

MCL 500.3104(2)(i) and (7)(a). As is further explained by Justice YOUNG, <em>post </em>at 62, the MCCA asserts that reversal of this Court\u2019s prior opinion on rehearing will require the MCCA to reimburse all benefits paid by insurers to their catastrophically injured insureds, without regard to the reasonableness of the insured\u2019s underlying expenditures. Accordingly, the MCCA states that its insurer members will have little incentive to defend unreasonable claims by their insureds; no matter how unreasonable the expenditure \u2014 at issue in one of these cases, for example, are an insured\u2019s expenditures of $54.84 an hour for attendant care services \u2014 if the insurer accepts its insured\u2019s claim, the MCCA will be obligated to reimburse the insurer in full. The MCCA asserts: \u2018With a guarantee of MCCA reimbursement, coupled with the lure of saving legal defense costs, members will have a strong motive to settle [personal protection insurance] claims early and with little or no resistance.\u201d It concludes: \u201cThis directly benefits lawyers like Mr. Kingsley who represent plaintiffs in no-fault automobile insurance cases, and who typically receive their fees out of the proceeds of settlements.\u201d To illustrate, the MCCA has provided a hypothetical conversation between a future plaintiff\u2019s attorney and an insurer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">[Attorney]: \u201cI know that amount is a bit high for attendant care, but that is what we want.

As it bears on this case, at her January 8, 2009, investiture ceremony, Justice Hathaway attributed her election to various organizations that supported her campaign. Investiture Ceremony for the Honorable Diane M. Hathaway, 483 Mich cliii, clxviii (2009). Of particular note is her acknowledgment of the Michigan Association for Justice (MAJ); the MAJ has explicitly supported the defendants in these cases and filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the motion for rehearing. Organizations that supported Justice Hathaway\u2019s campaign, including the AFL-CIO, whose president, Mark Gaffney, acted as master of ceremonies at the investiture proceeding, are also members of the Coalition Protecting Auto No-Fault, which filed an amicus curiae brief in these cases opposing Justice Hathaway\u2019s recusal. Further, these cases involve insurance companies as parties. During her campaign, Justice Hathaway regularly spoke out against insurance companies and suggested that she would not \u201c \u2018sid[e] with big insurance companies\u2019 \u201d if she were elected to this Court. <em>Hathaway sworn in as MSC\u2019s 104th justice, </em>Michigan Lawyers Weekly, January 12, 2009, p 2.

Indeed, anonymous and independent expenditures during the 2008 election season included $1.4 million garnered by the Democratic Party from undisclosed donors to underwrite a TV ad campaign impugning Justice Hathaway\u2019s opponent, former Chief Justice Taylor. <em>In Michigan courts, it\u2019s the public that\u2019s blindfolded, </em>Detroit Free Press, June 14, 2009. At this time, it is totally unclear how a court attempting to comply with <em>Caperton </em>would take such donations into account. As Justice Benjamin presaged in his <em>W Va Caperton </em>concurrence,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">every judicial officer in this state is subject to having to decide the merits of a case that involves a party or attorney who contributed to or supported, or, conversely, opposed his or her campaign for office.

Conversely, such a standard would likely require a judge also to recuse himself or herself when an independent expenditure group operated against the judge or supported the judge\u2019s opponent.

Such questions, however, are a traditional part of the debate and discussion inherent in the judicial process. It is, for example, why this Court holds oral arguments, and why it welcomes briefs, responses to briefs, and even replies to responses to briefs. By this process we educate ourselves and hopefully arrive at better decisions. Justice HATHAWAY either fails to appreciate the nature of the judicial process or simply seeks to avoid the hard questions about the inadequacies of her own extraordinarily limited response to the disqualification motion. <em>This is particularly evident because one of the central themes of Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s late Michigan Supreme Court campaign was her assertion that she subscribed to an \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d disqualification standard and was, therefore, \u201cmore ethical\u201d than the members of the previous philosophical majority </em>\u2014 former Chief Justice TAYLOR and Justices Corrigan and Markman and I.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST JUSTICE HATHAWAY</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Defendant Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (MCCA) has asserted that Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s husband is a no-fault plaintiffs\u2019 attorney who stands to profit in his no-fault practice if Justice HATHAWAY participates in these cases to overturn a decision made by this Court just months ago. The thrust of this claim is that a reversal of our earlier opinion will remove the legal basis, and thus the incentive, for insurance companies to resist unreasonable no-fault settlements demanded by claimants and their attorneys. Consequently, because insurance companies will be free to pass on these unreasonable settlements to the MCCA (which will eventually be paid for by the public, who must buy no-fault insurance), no-fault practitioners will increase their contingency fee yields by obtaining higher settlements than warranted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A reversal will cost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>purchasers of Michigan no-fault insurance an aggregate of $693.8 million more this year alone, accounting, in large part, for a more than 19 percent increase in the catastrophic claims premium every automobile no-fault insurance policy issued in this state will bear, which increase the MCCA\u2019s board of directors has already approved in anticipation of Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s critical vote to reverse the Court\u2019s prior decision. See the affidavit filed by the MCCA in Docket No. 133466, which is one of the documents referred to in n 2 of Justice Hathaway\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Despite this, and without bothering to explain why, Justice HATHAWAY simply denies that she should be disqualified, adding that there is no appearance of impropriety in her participation. Justice HATHAWAY does not even deign to deny that her husband is a no-fault plaintiffs\u2019 practitioner or to assert that his practice will not benefit from her participation in a decision to overturn this Court\u2019s prior decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s refusal to live up to her own expressed standard of conduct is worthy of note in its own right: The people of this state deserve to know whether candidates promise one thing when running for office but deliver another when elected. But the far more important issue is the horror that would be visited on this Court if Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s preferred \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d disqualification standard were actually adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">HOW MAY A JUSTICE REBUT AN \u201cAPPEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Justice HATHAWAY has provided <em>no </em>information in response to defendant\u2019s allegations of her family\u2019s fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>nancial interest in a reversal of the Court\u2019s prior decision; surely her terse and conclusory statement is not what the people envisioned when they elected a candidate vowing to adhere to a \u201chigher\u201d \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d disqualification standard. <em>Ought not such a standard require that the target of the disqualification motion provide financial </em>statements<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>or that an evidentiary hearing be conducted to determine the merit of the allegations of </em>disqualification?<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">WHAT SUFFICES TO ESTABLISH AN \u201cAPPEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">According to Justice HATHAWAY, allegations of a spouse\u2019s \u201ceconomic interest in the subject matter in controversy\u201d or \u201cmore than de minimis interest that could be substantially affected by the proceeding\u201d\u2014 grounds requiring recusal under MCR 2.003(B)(5) and (6)(c) \u2014 are so irrelevant as to not even merit a discussion in her statement. <em>If these allegations of increased </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>family profit as a result of her participation in these cases do not establish an appearance of impropriety, what would.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">WHO WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THERE IS AN \u201cAPPEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">For the first time to my knowledge, members of the Court have participated in the merits of a disqualification decision on a motion addressed to another justice. Although Justices CAVANAGH and WEAVER and Chief Justice KELLY have joined <em>and endorsed </em>Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s decision, they have done so <em>solely </em>on the basis of Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s statement without any additional inquiry into the merits of her participation or the allegations raised. In this, their participation is merely a rote ratification of Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s cursory denial of the motion to disqualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The new majority\u2019s approval of and participation in the merits of the determination whether Justice HATHAWAY should be disqualified, while an alteration of our traditions, <em>is </em>consistent with several of the Court\u2019s pending disqualification proposals that require full Court participation or that of the Chief Justice.7 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> With <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>out question, lodging such a determination with other justices of this Court will, at best, lead to gamesmanship to change the philosophical composition of the Court to alter the result in each such case. I ask: Would a 4-3 decision by the members of the Court favoring participation of a challenged justice cause the public to have greater or lesser faith that the targeted justice should ethically participate?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">HOW WOULD SUCH A PROCEDURE BETTER SERVE THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE THAN THE NEARLY 200-YEAR-OLD CURRENT DISQUALIFICATION PRACTICE?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">These are but a <em>few </em>of the questions raised by Justice HATHAWAY\u2019S disposition of the pending motion to disqualify her. Given Justice HATHAWAY\u2019S campaign promises and our colleagues\u2019 published statements on disqualification over the years, not only the parties, but the public deserve more.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-9\"> <em>Caperton v A T Massey Coal Co, Inc, </em>556 US _; 129 S Ct 2252; 173 <em>L </em>Ed 2d 1208 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b115-5\"> See, e.g., <em>Adair v Michigan, </em>474 Mich 1027, 1038-1039 (2006) (statement of Taylor, C.J., and Markman, J.); <em>Grievance Administrator v Fieger, </em>476 Mich 231, 266-281 (2006) (opinion by Taylor, C.J., and Corrigan, Young, and Markman, JJ.); <em>Scalise v Boy Scouts of America, </em>473 Mich 853 (2005); <em>In re JK, </em>468 Mich 202, 219 (2003) (statement by Weaver, J.); <em>Gilbert v DaimlerChrysler Corp, </em>469 Mich 883 (2003), reconsideration denied 469 Mich 889 (2003).

It was never alleged that former Chief Justice Taylor\u2019s wife stood to benefit financially from her husband\u2019s role on this Court, as defendant here suggests that Justice Hathaway\u2019s husband will. See <em>Adair, supra </em>at 1028 n 1.

Indeed, several member organizations of the Coalition Protecting Auto No-Fault, which has filed an amicus curiae brief in these cases supporting Justice Hathaway\u2019s continued participation, supported Justice Hathaway\u2019s campaign. The Michigan Trial Lawyers Association and the United Automobile Workers each gave $34,000 to Justice Hathaway\u2019s campaign, the maximum allowed by law. During her campaign, Justice Hathaway stated that \u201ca judge should consider!] disqualifying herself in any instance where a party has made a substantial campaign contribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In Justice Hathaway\u2019s calculus of disqualification ethics, do such contributions not raise \u201ceven the <em>mere appearance </em>of impropriety\u201d? <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b118-9\"> And why, having promised a \"higher standard of conduct\u201d if elected, is it defensible for Justice Hathaway to shelter under the Court\u2019s historical disqualification practice that she disparaged on the campaign trail?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b119-8\"> Moreover, do the fact that the motion for rehearing in these cases was prompted <em>solely </em>because of Justice Hathaway\u2019s replacement of Chief Justice TAYLOR and the fact that utterly no new substantive or legal arguments were raised in the motion, as generally required by MCR 2.119(F)(3), give rise to an appearance of impropriety with respect to her participation? See, e.g., <em>Peoples v Evening News Ass\u2019n, </em>51 Mich 11, 21 (1883), in which this Court opined that \u201ca rehearing will not be ordered on the ground merely that a change of members of the bench has either taken place or is about to occur.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b119-9\"> It is unclear why Justice Hathaway and the new majority chose to adopt some aspects of the new proposals while claiming to adhere to our current disqualification practice. As stated, Justices CAVANAGH and Weaver and Chief Justice Kelly have <em>never, </em>to my knowledge, publicly endorsed the decision of another justice targeted with a disqualification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>motion, as they have done here. However, because they considered nothing beyond Justice Hathaway\u2019s statement, it is hard to understand what their endorsement adds, other than being a statement of solidarity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-7\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b120-8\">MARKMAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcF\">Defendant has moved for Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s disqualification, arguing that \u201cher spouse has an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d Justice HATHAWAY now denies this motion, concluding that she has \u201cno personal bias or prejudice,\u201d that there is \u201cno appearance of impropriety,\u201d and that there is \u201cnothing alleged . . . that would cause any reasonable person to believe that there is a significant and disproportionate influence being asserted upon me,\u201d with little to no explanation. This decision must be viewed against a backdrop in which Justice HATHAWAY has been free in her criticism of other justices for their disqualification decisions. (For example, assert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>ing that the former Chief Justice of this Court was a \u201cwalking conflict of interest\u201d because his wife worked for the Governor\u2019s office; stating that \u201cour Supreme Court is not being fair and impartial...[;] they are not recusing themselves and that is the problem; we need judges who are going to be fair and impartial in rendering their decisions and that is not happening\u201d; and proclaiming that, \u201cI have, and I will continue to disqualify myself whenever there is the appearance of impropriety.\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Justice Hathaway has also supported this Court\u2019s decision to propose new procedures that would require disqualification whenever there is an \u201cappearance of impropriety.\u201d ADM File No. 2009-4; see 483 Mich 1205 (2009). Finally, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision a few weeks ago in <em>Caperton v A T Massey Coal Co, Inc, </em>556 US _ ; 129 S Ct 2252; 173 L Ed 2d 1208 (2009), held that disqualification must now be determined on the basis of \u201cobjective standards.\u201d Given this backdrop, it is difficult to understand why Justice HATHAWAY believes that her conclusory response to defendant\u2019s motion is sufficient. Contrary to her justification for her unwillingness to explain her position (\u201cI will not participate in this Court\u2019s practice of engaging in responses to comments of others that are inappropriate and unnecessary. This Court should discontinue devoting the state\u2019s limited resources to unproductive colloquy.\u201d), it is hardly to take the high ground for a justice to decline to address questions that have been raised by the parties and by other justices, and that are a direct outgrowth of that justice\u2019s own reform proposals, her own past criticisms of other justices, and a recent decision of the United States Supreme Court. Given that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>Caperton </em>was decided just a few weeks ago, and in fairness to the parties, I would direct the filing of supplemental briefs. Among the questions I would direct the parties to address are whether all justices must now participate in deciding another justice\u2019s disqualification and whether the justice who is the object of disqualification may even participate. Absent such briefing, I am not yet prepared to deviate from this Court\u2019s practice of 172 years to the contrary. Therefore, I neither participate in nor address the merits of Justice Hathaway\u2019s decision not to grant defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-5\"> &lt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7woWJI)klQg&gt; (accessed June 18, 2009); Interview with Lansing State Journal, October 17, 2008; and League of Woman Voters of Michigan Voter Guide 2008 &lt;http://www.lwvmi.org/documents/LWV08SupremeCourt.pdf&gt; (accessed June 18, 2009), respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
