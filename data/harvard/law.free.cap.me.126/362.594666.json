Plaintiff had declared in the writ that her Star automobile was of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>model of 1926. Defendants claimed that the automobile demanded of them was a Star of 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">There was evidence both ways. For the plaintiff, not to speak of other evidence tending to establish her contention, there was testimony by a witness who had dealt in and with the especial make of automobile, that the particular automobile was known to the trade as a 1926 model. For the defendant, testimony that on the block of the engine was the inscription: \u201cModel F 1925.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">And there was testimony that the engine model and the automotive model were different things; that though the engine and the automobile both might have been made in the same calendar year, yet the year of the automobile maker, in reference to the model of the vehicle, regularly ended on July 31st.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The judge found for the plaintiff, and the finding was abundantly justified on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The finding of the'judge settled the facts. In brief, simple terms, then, no question of law being involved, the exception which the defendants have argued is unavailing. <em>Treat </em>v. <em>Gilmore </em>49, Maine 34; <em>Ayer </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>125 Maine 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
