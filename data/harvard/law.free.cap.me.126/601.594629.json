Not that there may not have been some testimony offered tending to establish dependency but, in the judgment of the commission, insufficient for that purpose. Meticulous nicety of language, although desirable, is not always found nor to be expected in legal decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">It is not uncommon to speak of insufficient evidence as \u201cno evidence\u201d. The expression may be found, so used, in very many opinions of this and other courts.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aeo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>C. S. Roberts, </em>for petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ALA\"><em>Robinson &amp; Richardson, </em>for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The finding is, in intention and obvious meaning, similar to that in <em>Henry\u2019s Case, </em>124 Me. 106. In the decree in that case the court said, \"From all the evidence in the case it cannot be found that the claimant was actually dependent upon his son for support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">\u201cThis ruling\u201d, said Cornish, C. J., \"which invokes a question of fact, should not be disturbed. \u2019 The commission\u2019s finding is final under the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\u201cThe trier of fact is not bound to accept certain testimony as conclusive.\u201d <em>Orff\u2019s Case, </em>122 Maine, 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">He may reject as utterly false, testimony offered to establish any certain fact. He may regard such evidence as so unsubstantial as not to be entitled to any weight. Assuming such a situation, he is quite correct in saying that there .was no evidence to sustain the given contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">It is a mere play on words to distinguish the language, used in this decree from, that used in <em>Henry\u2019s Case, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">The ruling involved a question of fact and there being sufficient in the record to give it basis, is not reviewable by this court. Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
