Action by husband alleging criminal conversation and alienation of affections. Verdict for plaintiff. Damages $1916.66.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The issues raised are of f^ct only. The evidence is voluminous and contradictory. Sufficient appears in the record, if believed, to warrant the verdict. A different result might be reached by this court were we acting as triers of fact but we cannot say that the jury manifestly erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The findings of a jury, on questions of fact, based on a reasonable construction of credible evidence, will not be disturbed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Assuming the verdict justified, damages are not excessive.
