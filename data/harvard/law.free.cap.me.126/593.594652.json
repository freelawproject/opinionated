Morey, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AYyX\"><em>M. L. Lizotte, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">This is merely to say that the officer making the service took some goods not described in his writ. As to such chattels, if any, his writ does not protect him. But this is not a ground of demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">(3) \u201cThat it does not appear that the sureties on the bond were approved by the sheriff as provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The statute providing for replevin of goods does not require that the replevin bond be formally approved. R. S. Ch. 101, Sec. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The statute provides that the bond shall have \u201csufficient sureties,\u201d \u201cin double the value of the goods to be replevied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The return shows that this requirement was complied with. Moreover a demurrer by a defendant challenges the legal sufficiency of the writ and declaration, not of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">The defendant does not point out any other specific fault in the writ or declaration. Nor do we discover any. Exceptions overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
