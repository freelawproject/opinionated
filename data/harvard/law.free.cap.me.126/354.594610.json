In June of 1926, in connection with certain sewer construction which the defendant as a contractor was doing between Cash\u2019s corner and Rigby, in and for the city of South Portland, a trench was being dug beyond the shoulder of gravel, six or seven feet in width, bordering the macadam on the south side of Main street. On the opposite side of the street there was a similar shoulder of gravel.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">Blue clay had been struck, and as dug from the trench it was being carted to a vacant lot upstreet. All the clay was wet, part of it clam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>my, part watery. Some of it seeped from the cart bottoms, some flowed over tailboards, and some slid from the loaded carts onto and became imbedded on the macadamized roadway, whereon travellers in vehicles were being guided.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">From time to time the contractor washed and swept and scraped the ooze, but nevertheless more or less mire was always on the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The plaintiff had travelled that road, in an automobile, morning and afternoon, going to and returning from his employment, all his days at the Portland Terminal, and for ten days at least had been accustomed to the slime and the slipperiness on the macadam.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">On the day of the accident the plaintiff was coming from work, as he had gone to his work, on a motorcycle. He considered the vehicle safe and himself an experienced operator, having driven first and last more than ten thousand miles. The light rainstorm of the morning had made passing on the pavement dangerous, and this the plaintiff knew.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">It was mid-afternoon, and traffic was at the peak. When approaching the place in the road opposite the sewer construction, plaintiff saw the mechanical apparatus in operation, and saw the carts each in its turn being loaded and drawn away. If his memory of conditions was not with him, a single glance was enough to give him a full understanding of the indications of danger. And the road on which he was, as he testified, was not the only convenient way to his home.</p>\n<p id=\"AWG\">There were automobiles in front of him, automobiles behind him, and he swore that he did not want, to break the fine. Plaintiff had been in heavy traffic on busy streets in Portland and kept his position' by \u201cstraddling,\u201d \u2014 by slowing his machine to a rate of speed comparable to that at which a. man might walk, and the cycler touch one foot and then the other on the ground, in harmony with the forward movement of the machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">Yet at this time plaintiff never slackened speed below six miles an hour; whether he might have driven on the gravel on the north side of the macadam was a disputed question; he alone testified that traffic made the shoulder inaccessible to him. But, regardless of the fact about that, he did not straddle, he did not dismount and walk, but continued straight ahead under the circumstances known to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">Let words that fell from his own lips when he witnessed describe again what in the appreciated situation his acts and their tendency were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u201cI was coming down from Rigby, the road was all clay and nasty, slippery and greasy, I knew what I was going to run into; there was enough mucky substance on that mucky road to cause a motorcycle to skid at six miles an hour. I went down there about six miles an hour. I could have slowed down to three; but I would have had to walk, half walking and half riding, and I didn\u2019t put my feet out for want of time. You can keep your machine steady until you get down to about four miles an hour, and then you have to put one foot down. I could have walked by there with my motorcycle (but I didn\u2019t). I kept her head on and let her take it; there wasn\u2019t much choice of road. I kept within a foot and a half of the north line of that state road.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The motorcycle skidded, and the plaintiff was thrown and injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s language suggests no touch of the reflective analysis of forethought and intelligence \u2014 that light in the mode of action of prudent men in general which is perhaps indescribable, but none the less unmistakable..</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">No; the suggestion is that of push and brawn, of the resolve to defy physical laws and overcome them, or at least have disobedience know impunity; the determination to drive the motorcycle through the viscid ooze, no matter what the cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">If there were negligence on the defendant\u2019s part, which point it is not now necessary to decide, but if there were negligence, then it is only too plain that as plaintiff took upon himself the responsibility for going forward, so he must bear the resultant injury. Had he been using ordinary care at the time, had he not been at fault, he would have escaped injury entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">The verdict is. wrong; it is obviously wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">\n<em>Motion sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">\n<em>New trial granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
