Cummings the appellant is the divorced wife of Ralph G. Cummings and the mother of Evelina F. Cummings, a minor child. Nellie F. Cummings, Evelina\u2019s grandmother, petitioned under the Statute (R. S. Ch. 72, Sec. 35 as amended) for leave to adopt the child. The father consented in writing. The child\u2019s mother (the appellant) was- given legal notice. (R. S. Chap. 72, Sec. 36). The Probate Court, finding \u201cthat the mother is unfit to have the custody of said child\u2019\u2019 granted the petition for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The question before this Court is whether the mother has a legal right to appeal from the decree. Upon this issue the single justice hearing the case decided against her, dismissing the appeal. Thereupon she brings the case forward on exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Revised Statutes Chap. 67, Sec. 31 provides that \u201cany person aggrieved 'by any order, sentence, decree or denial of such (probate) judges \u2014 may appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court.\u201d . Is the child\u2019s mother \u201caggrieved?\u201d The point has not been settled. <em>Moore vs. Phillips, </em>94 Me., 422, cited by the appellee is not decisive. There the mother lost her right of appeal through failure to give bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The law does not base -the right of appeal upon sentimental grounds. Aggrieved does not mean grief stricken. A fortiori it does not mean merely dissatisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">In legal acceptance a party is aggrieved by a probate decree that operates on his property or \u201cbears upon his-interest directly.\u201d <em>Deering </em>vs. <em>Adams </em>34 Me., 41; <em>Lunt </em>vs. <em>Aubens </em>39 Me., 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">The decree in the present case does not operate upon property of the appellant. But there are interests, tangible, valuable, enforceable interests \u2014 which are not property.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">(1) Because the decree bears directly upon her interest the statute makes the mother a necessary party in the Probate Court proceeding. If she does not consent to the adoption, notice must be given to her. R. S. Chap. 72, Sec. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">(2) The mother is one of the child\u2019s heirs presumptive. By depriving her of this status a decree of adoption bears upon her interest though it does not operate upon her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">(3) The Probate Decree finds and declares that the appellant \u201cis unfit to have the custody of said child.\u201d If this is an erroneous finding the mother has a direct interest in having it corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">(4) The mother has (jointly with the father) the right to the child\u2019s care and custody. R. S. Chap. 64, Sec. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>This is a right enforceable against all the world, except the father. The decree of adoption absolutely takes away from her this legal right.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">By the decree the mother is \u201cdivested of all legal rights in respect to such child and he is freed from all legal obligations of obedience and maintenance in respect to (her).\u201d R. S. Chap. 72, Sec. 38. Such a decree bears directly upon th\u00e9 mother\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">But assuming that the mother is aggrieved by the decree the appellee still denies her right of appeal. It is argued that R. S. Chap. 67, Sec. 31 giving \u201cany person aggrieved\u201d an appeal from a probate decree, is so far as relates to decrees of adoption, repealed or, at all events, superseded by the later statute specifically authorizing appeals from such decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The earlier general statute, (omitting irrelevant words) is as follows: \u201cAny person aggrieved by any decree of such (probate) judge may appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court\u201d R. S. Chap. 67, Sec. 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The later specific act reads thus: \u201cAny petitioner, or any such child by his next friend, may appeal from such decree to the supreme court of probate, in the same manner and with the same effect, as in other cases, but no bond to prosecute his appeal shall be required of such child or next friend, nor costs be awarded against either.\u201d R. S., Chap. 72, Sec. 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">It is argued that this act impliedly repeals or supersedes the general statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">This would be true if the later act were repugnant to the former; <em>(U. S. </em>vs. <em>Tynen, </em>11 Wall, 92), if it were \u201cabsolutely conflicting\u201d; <em>(Collins </em>vs. <em>Chase, </em>71 Me., 436) or were \u201cso clearly repugnant and inconsistent that they cannot stand together\u201d; <em>(Newport </em>vs. <em>R. R. Co. </em>123 Me. 387,) or if it clearly appear that a repeal or substitution is intended. 25 R. C. L. 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">But \u201ca critical comparison of these two statutes under consideration dissipates any apparent repugnancy.\u201d <em>Eden </em>vs. <em>Southwest Harbor, </em>108 Maine, 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">It is apparent that the later statute is not designed as a substitute for the former, nor to limit it, but rather is intended to supplement and extend it.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">Under the former statute the child being aggrieved may appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>upon giving bond. The later statute relieves the child or next friend from the bond requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The petitioner is not as such, aggrieved by a refusal to grant the petition. Such a decree or denial does not operate upon his property not affect his legal rights. But the later statute gives the petitioner, merely as such, the right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The theory of the appellee is that the Legislature intended to take away the right of appeal from persons aggrieved and grant such right to persons not aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u25a0 To ascribe such\u2019 an intent to any legislature is, to say the least, uncomplimentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">For its genesis, Chap. 67, Sec. 31 (giving appeal to all persons aggrieved) harks back to the statute of 1821. The first act authorizing adoption of children was passed many years later. The appellee stresses this circumstance urging that \u201cthe words of a statute must be taken in the sense in which they were understood at the time when the statute was enacted.\u201d This rule is supported by authority. It has its place. It is useful and may be decisive in construing ambiguous statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">But the present case is governed by a larger principle well stated by R. C. L. thus: \u201cStatutes framed in general terms apply to new cases that arise and to new subjects that are created, from time to time, and which come within their general scope and policy. It is a rule of statutory construction that legislative enactments in general and comprehensive terms, prospective in operation, apply alike to all persons, subjects and business within their general purview and scope coming into existence subsequent to their passage.\u201d 25 R. C. L., 778. and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">This principle applies clearly to the general and comprehensive language: \u201cAny person aggrieved by any (probate) decree may appeal\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">Certain language used in <em>Gray </em>vs. <em>Gardner, </em>81 Me. 558 is relied upon as supporting the position of the appellee. The language is the merest dictum.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">Upon principles which we regard as well settled and decisive we hold that any person aggrieved by a probate decree may still appeal, and that by a decree severing every tie between her minor child and herself a mother may justly claim to be \u201caggrieved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
