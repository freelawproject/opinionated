Maguire in the home of the plaintiff in Shanghai, China. The plaintiff is the husband of the grand daughter of Mrs. Maguire who at the time of the alleged services was almost eighty. She had made her home with the plaintiff for some years in this country and went with him and his family to Shanghai when he moved there. The jury found for the plaintiff for the period claimed at $75 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>month. The case comes before this Court on a motion for new trial on the usual grounds. The law of this State in cases of this kind is definitely settled, <em>Bryant </em>vs. <em>Fogg, </em>125 Me. 420, and cases cited. The issue here was one of fact, whether under the circumstances the services were rendered on the basis of contract or not. The determination of that issue in cases like this is \u201cpeculiarly the province of the jury.\u201d There was evidence to support the verdict. It cannot be said that the record discloses any sound reason to disturb it. Motion overruled.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A_Q\"><em>Harry A. Nickerson and Frank H.
