Zimmerman on the 5th January 1859, for $115.29 with interest from the 15th January 1859, and costs paid, amounting to $7.74 ;r on which judgment the present attachment was sued out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-7\">The issue was between the plaintiff in the judgment and the garnishee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-8\">After the evidence was closed on both sides, John B. Zimmerman, the defendant in the judgment, co-executor with William Zimmerman, the garnishee, and named also as garnishee in the attachment, appeared and claimed the sum of $300 out of the fund under the Exemption Law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-9\">The learned judge of the Common Pleas instructed the jury that there was evidence of the existence of a legacy in the hands of William Zimmerman, more than sufficient to pay the debt, interest, and costs due on the judgment on which the attachment issued. That the amount due and payable to the legatees at the death of testator\u2019s widow, that is, the proceeds of the house and lot set apart for the widow during her life, was at her death payable to testator\u2019s children (of whom John B. Zimmerman was one) and not to the rvife of John B. Zimmerman, and that the claim under the Exemption Law was not in time. He therefore directed a verdict for plaintiff for the full amount of his claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-10\">This writ was then sued out by the garnishee, for whom the following errors were assigned:\u2014 \u2018</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-11\">1. The court erred in saying that the legacy of money out of the estate of John Zimmerman, deceased, payable at the death of Elizabeth Zimmerman, was payable to John B. Zimmerman and not to his wife Elizabeth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-12\">\u2022 2. The court erred in denying John B. Zimmerman the right to claim $300, saying he had made his claim too late.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-13\">3. The court erred in taking the case from the jury and directing a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b536-14\"><em>William H. Miller </em>for William Zimmerman and Mrs. Elizabeth Zimmerman, and <em>A. S. Anderson </em>for John B. Zimmerman,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6_I\">argued \u2014 1. That by the word \u201c heirs\u201d the testator meant his children, of whom there were ten. That after giving $100 to Plenry, $80 to Mai\u2019y Ann, and $45 each to Sarah and Matilda, he divided the balance of the proceeds of his real and personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>estate into ten shares, and then gave one equal share to each child by name, except John B. Zimmerman, whom he omitted altogether and substituted his wife, giving her an equal share (a tenth) by name. And yet the court below decided that this tenth share went to John B. Zimmerman and not to his wife, because the word \u201c heirs\u201d was used in the first part of the will. Language could not designate in clearer terms whom he meant by \u201c his heirs for after saying that the proceeds of each part of the real estate shall be distributed in equal shares among his heirs, he then proceeds to distribute to them, or to those whom he meant as his heirs, by name, and among them he named the wife of John B. instead of John B. Zimmerman himself. The whole will is thus reconciled. But if the terms were clearly contradictory, by the rule of law the last clause would be taken as designating the testator\u2019s intention. \u201c A beneficiary may provide for a friend the means of subsistence for himself and family, without exposing his bounty to the debts or improvidence of the beneficiary:\u201d Holdship <em>v. </em>Patterson, 7 Watts 547 ; Ashhurst <em>v. </em>Given, 5 W. &amp; S. 323 ; Brown <em>v. </em>Williamson, 12 Casey 341. That the word \u201c heirs\u201d will be construed to mean children, &amp;c., to carry out the intention of a testator, is a familiar principle: Stille <em>v. </em>Spear, 9 Wright 168.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-6\">2. If the fund was really payable to John B. Zimmerman, why was he not entitled to claim under the provisions of the Act of Assembly allowing insolvent debtors $300 ? Because, says the court, he did not claim it in time. We think this is straining the point to the last degree. Nobody made this objection on the trial. Mr. Anderson, who sat at the counsel-table as the attorney of John B. Zimmerman, simply said he claimed the fund for John B. Zimmerman under the Three Hundred Dollar Law ; and then the plaintiff went on, with evidence in waiting on -the spot, anticipated and prepared to show that John B. Zimmerman was not entitled to make this claim, because he had a house furnished in Harrisburg. In this they failed, but it was not because they were taken by surprise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-7\">To whom should John B. Zimmerman have given notice, and who was injured or objected because John B. Zimmerman gave him no notice ? His co-executor, William Zimmerman, did not object. He did not say that he had no notice, and has never denied that John B. Zimmerman claimed the benefit of the $300 from the beginning, and this money under it, if it is coming to him. Mr. Anderson was associated in the defence of the attachment from the beginning, for the very purpose of claiming it. He appeared for no person but John B- Zimmerman. Then to whom was John B. Zimmerman to give notice ? He was a' co-executor, having as much control over the funds as William Zimmerman. He was also a garnishee, as appears by in the <em>prceoipe </em>for the attachment. Was he to give notice to himself, or his co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>executor ? This was superfluous, and his co-executor admits notice. When could an executor hare been prejudiced for want of notice, even if John B. Zimmerman had not been a co-executor, and also a garnishee in the same attachment ? Clearly he could not receive notice until after the attachment, and nothing has been done since the attachment by which he could be prejudiced. He was simply prevented from paying over the money to the legatee, at most, until it shall be determined who is entitled to it. The issue was formed simply to try that question, and all persons claiming it then came into court together, and each one made known the ground on which he claimed it. When John B. Zimmerman made known the ground on which he claimed it, the plaintiff proceeded to call his witnesses to show that he was not entitled to claim it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-6\">But as William Zimmerman was the person to whom notice was to be given, if any notice was required, and as William Zimmerman does not object to the want of notice, but admits having received notice, can anybody else object <em>to </em>the want of notice ? It is the person who holds the property who must have the notice. Parties claiming the benefit of the act out of a decedent\u2019s estate must give notice to the administrator. An insolvent whose property is in the hands of the sheriff must give notice to the sheriff; and by analogy we think here the only person entitled to object to the want of notice is the garnishee, and he does not, and did not, object to the want of notice. The whole fund in the hands of the garnishee is $186, arising out of the sale of the real estate, and payable at the death of the widow. As plaintiff did not succeed in proving that John B. Zimmerman has three hundred dollars\u2019 worth of property in addition to this, he is, we hold, entitled to this whole fund, unless it goes to his wife, Elizabeth Zimmerman.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-7\"><em>J. R. </em>McClintock, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b538-9\">Strong, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnMu\">The testator by his will set apart a portion of his property for his widow, to be enjoyed by her during her life. The portion thus set apart was the house and lot described in the will, and a fund of $1000. In this he created for her an estate for life, and he disposed of the remainder by directing that after her death, the house and lot should be sold, and that the proceeds of the sale, together with the $1000 fund, should be equally divided among his heirs. In regard to the residue of his property, probably the bulk of it, he gave no such directions. That he ordered to be divided equally, after the deduction of a few small legacies, among ten persons named, nine of whom were his children, and the tenth was the wife of another child. There is a clear differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>ence between his intentions respecting the part of his property devoted temporarily for the use of his widow, and the proceeds of sale of his farm and woodland and of his personal property. The former he gave to his heirs generally, subject to the particular estate of the widow. The latter he gave not to his heirs generally, but to the ten persons named, and excluded his son John. The will can be construed in no other way, without denying effect to some of its provisions. There is no sufficient reason found in the language of the testator, to warrant a belief that he intended to use the word heirs in any other than its legal sense. He did not attempt to define it. The court below was therefore right in holding that John Zimmerman, as one of the heirs of the testator, is entitled to a proportionate part of the $1000 fund, and of the proceeds of sale of the house and lot devised to the widow for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The other point raised, on behalf of the plaintiff in error, is put at rest by Strouse\u2019s Executor <em>v. </em>Becker, 8 Wright 206, if, indeed, it can be raised at all, in a writ of error sued out by the garnishee.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
