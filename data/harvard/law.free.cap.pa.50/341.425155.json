The Union troops on the western side of the river, after some skirmishing and musketry firing, and some twenty or thirty or more shots or shell had been fired by the rebels into and over Wrightsville, and at a time when the rebels were making an effort to cut off their retreat, retired across the said bridge, and as the rebels approached the bridge and when near Wrightsville, fire on said day was communicated to said bridge, which had been previously authorized or ordered by Major-General Couch, commanding the United'States Department of the Susquehanna, duly appointed by the President of the United States or the Secretary of War, in which said bridge and York county were included, and the flames from said bridge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>so set fire to as aforesaid extended to and communicated with the property mentioned in the declaration of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-6\">That Colonel Erick, under orders of said Major-General Couch, had taken military possession of said bridge for six or ten days before the same was fired, and during said Sunday and for a day or two previous, no person was allowed to cross said bridge without a pass from the military authorities. That the military authorities had, about one week before said bridge was on fire, made arrangements to cut down two spans of said bridge, one near the York county shore, the other near the middle of the river, and had taken up the plank and laid them down loosely, and on said Sunday about the middle of the day cut the cords and bored holes and loaded them with powder in order to blow up the arches to let or throw down said two spans of said bridge into the river in case the Union soldiers were driven or compelled to retreat across said bridge by the rebels. The said effort to let down said spans of said bridge failed, and then said bridge was fired as aforesaid, on said Sunday, June 28th 1863.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-7\">This evidence was objected to by the plaintiff \u2014 1st.

But the court admitted the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-8\">It was agreed that the history of the times, as far as applicable, relevant and affecting this case, should be considered in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-9\">Defendant then offered to prove that the terms upon which defendant insured property from December 31st 1859, until the time this insurance was effected, were not increased, and that this insurance was effected on the same terms it would have been at any time after December 31st 1859, and without any increase of rates.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-10\">This evidence was also objected to by the plaintiff \u2014 1st.

That the terms made by the defendant are immaterial, and it is also immaterial whether they were or were not changed within the time mentioned in the offer, or whether any increase of rates would or would not have been made after December 31st 1859. But the evidence was admitted by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-11\">The defendant also gave in evidence, under exception by the plaintiff, the act of the legislature incorporating the York County Mutual Insurance Company, and the by-laws adopted by the board of managers of said company, the following parts of which were deemed material by the defendants in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-12\">Act of March 29th 1840: \u201c Sec. 7.

That under the evidence admitted in this case, if believed by the jury, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount insured in the policy, to wit, the sum of f900, with interest from the 28th day of December 1863.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-10\">2. That there being no condition or exception in the policy, except as to losses by fire occasioned by mobs and riots, the facts admitted in evidence on behalf of the defendant do not cover cases excepted by such condition, and do not constitute a defence against the claim of the plaintiff in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-11\">The defendant submitted the following points:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-12\">1. That as there is no question about the truth of the evidence of the defendant, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-13\">2.

That as this is a peace policy, issued upon the same terms it would have been issued at any time after December 31st 1869, and without any increase of rates, it cannot be supposed it was the intention of the insurers to insure against a loss occasioned in the manner the evidence shows this loss occurred, and this view is further made evident by the provision endorsed on the policy, that \u201c no insurance is made against loss by fire occasioned by mobs and riots,\u201d therefore plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-9\">7.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AD6\">The first question upon the record is, .whether Harris had an insurable interest in the real estate described in the policy. The facts out of which this question grew are few.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In December 1860, his wife, Rebecca Harris, then and now living, and to whom issue has been born, purchased the property from the executors of her deceased father, and, with her husband, took possession on the 1st day of April 1861, but did not get her deed until July'1861. The premium-note for $207 was given April 23d 1861 by George Harris, and the policy issued to him on the 27th of that month, reciting that he had become a member of the company and deposited his premium-notes, in consideration whereof the company insured $900 upon two buildings, described as his houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">We attach no importance to the circumstance that the policy issued before the legal title was conveyed to the wife ; for though she had merely an equitable title and estate at the date of the policy, the husband would in equity be entitled to curtesy therein; and the subsequent perfection of her title enured to the benefit of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">And it is not to be doubted that a tenant by the curtesy has in general an insurable interest; but it is supposed that under our Acts of 1848 and 1850, relating to the estates of married women, Purd. 700, the husband\u2019s interest in his wife\u2019s real estate is a mere expectancy as a distributee in the event of his surviving her, and not a vested interest. We do not so understand that legislation. The proviso to the 1st section of the Act of 1848 declares that nothing \u201c contained in this act shall be taken or deemed to deprive the husband of his right as tenant by the curtesy.\u201d These words relate not merely to the distribution of her estate after her decease, but are a limitation of all the operative clauses of the act. The whole truth is that the legislature meant to exempt the wife\u2019s estate from liability to her husband\u2019s creditors, but not to impair his common-law interest in her real estate. After we had declared this in several cases, and treated the husband\u2019s curtesy as a vested interest, and still liable to the executions of his creditors, the legislature declared, by the Act of 22d April 1850, that the wife\u2019s estate shall not be subject to execution by reason of the husband\u2019s interest therein, but the same shall be exempt from levy and sale during her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">As the wife\u2019s estate has never been, since 1848, subject to executions issued against her husband, the meaning of the Act of 1850 must be that his curtesy shall not be levied and sold during her life. For her convenience and benefit, his creditors shall be stayed from proceedings against his estate while she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>lives. The upshot is a mere stay of execution, not an annihilation of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">But inasmuch as under the act of incorporation of 29th March 1840, this insurance company are entitled to file the premium-note in the prothonotary\u2019s office, and acquire a lien upon the property insured, and take execution against said property, it is argued that the Act of 1850, though it be a mere stay law, has destroyed the insurable interest in the husband. The Act of 1850 undoubtedly abridged the right of execution conferred upon the underwriters by the Act of 1840 ; but that does not impair the husband\u2019s estate. His interest exists still, and is none the less vital because protected during his wife\u2019s life. If the company did not want a member so hedged around by statutory exemptions, they should not have admitted him, or if they were ignorant of his position, they should have inquired into it. They have entered no lien and taken no execution, and have therefore lost nothing as yet by reason of the statutory exemption he enjoys; but, on the contrary, they have derived all the benefit from the contract of insurance which they have sought, and only set up a possible inconvenience, to excuse themselves from performance of their undertaking. ' If there were more doubt than there is about the insurableness of the husband\u2019s interest, we think his purchase of the policy could be supported on the ground of agency for his wife. In Lucan <em>v. </em>Crawford, Lord Eldon held that it was not necessary that the assured should have a beneficial interest in the property insured, but that it is sufficient if he be clothed with the character of trustee, agent, or consignee. \u2022 And in respect to the insurable interest of an agent or trustee, see Miltenberger <em>v. </em>Beacom, 9 Barr 199; Siter <em>v. </em>Moore, 1 Harris 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Now, husband and wife are for many purposes agents of each other, she in respect to the conduct of his domestic affairs, and he in respect to the custody and management of her separate estate. When he has effected an insurance on houses in their joint possession, but which belong to her, the law will presume her ratification of his act, if not her precedent authority to perform it, and will support the insurance for her benefit. It is indeed doubtful if-this be not the proper way of insuring the wife\u2019s separate estate, for we avoid in this manner all question about her power to contract; and whilst equity would enforce the contract of the husband for her benefit, it would enforce (also the rights of the company against her separate estate for the premium. Undoubtedly her assent to such an insurance would be implied from the absence of objection, and if the policy were enforced for her benefit, she would be liable also by virtue of the premium-note.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">On both grounds, that of the husband\u2019s interest as tenant by the curtesy, and that of agency for his wife, this insurance, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>was obtained without any fraudulent concealment or misrepresentation, was well taken, and ought to be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The only remaining question arises upon the exception clause, \u201c no insurance is made against loss by fire occasioned by mobs and riot.\u201d The question here is, whether, under the facts and circumstances set forth in the defendant\u2019s offers, as recited in the assignment of errors, the fire that destroyed the property was occasioned by a mob or riot, and we are all clearly of the opinion that it was not. The Columbia Bridge was set on fire by orders of General Couch, commanding the United States department of the Susquehanna, as a necessary measure to prevent the advance of an armed force that was invading Pennsylvania, not as a mob, or as rioters, but as a regularly organized public enemy, and the buildings in question were fired as a consequence of burning the bridge. It was an act of sovereignty on the part of our own duly constituted civil and military authorities, and therefore not within the saving clause of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Mr. Angel\u00ed, who defines the words \u201c civil commotions,\u201d \u201c riots,\u201d \u201cmobs,\u201d and \u201cmilitary or usurped power,\u201d which have found their way into the saving clauses of policies, says, the difference between a rebellious mob and a common mob is, that the first is high treason, the latter a riot; the mob wants a universality of purpose to make it a rebellious mob, or treason. He thinks, also, the word \u201c riot\u201d would restrict the operation of the policy within narrower limits than the phrase \u201c civil commotionAngel\u00ed on Insurance, \u00a7 136. By restricting the operation of the policy, I understand him to mean the operation of the saving clause of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The policy, in this instance, insured against fire from all causes not excepted. The fire was occasioned, approximately by lawful orders of the military authorities, and remotely by an invading army, which was much more than either a mob or a riot in the ordinary acceptation of these terms. The loss, therefore, was within the terms of the policy, but not within the saving clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">And now, to wit, June 29th 1865, the judgment of the court below is reversed, and. judgment entered for plaintiff for the amount of the verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
