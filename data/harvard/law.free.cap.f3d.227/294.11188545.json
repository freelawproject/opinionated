Perez contends that Section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), as amended (pertaining to eligibility for waiver of inadmissibility), is unconstitutional because it distinguishes without a rational basis between aggravated felons who are lawful permanent residents of the United States and those who are not. We dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The Government contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction. Because the deportation proceedings against Perez were commenced after April 1, 1997, the so-called \u201cpermanent rules\u201d of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) are applicable. <em>Max-George v. Reno, </em>205 F.3d 194, 197 n. 3 (5th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Requena-Rodriguez v. Pasquarell, </em>190 F.3d 299, 302-03 (5th Cir.1999) (applying the temporary rules)).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">In <em>Max-George, </em>the court held that the \u201cIIRIRA\u2019s permanent provisions eliminate \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus jurisdiction for those eases that fall within [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).\u201d 205 F.3d at 199. Section 1252(a)(2)(C) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3A\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to review any <em>final order of removal </em>against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 1182(a)(2) or 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) of this title, or any offense covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) of this title for which both predicate offenses are, without regard to their date of commission, otherwise covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00a9 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Perez does not dispute that he is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense. Instead, Perez contends that <em>Max-George </em>should be distinguished because he is not seeking review of a \u201cfinal order of removal\u201d but has challenged instead \u201cthe unconstitutional unavailability of a waiver which would allow him to return <em>after </em>his removal order\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 1182(h). This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">Section 1252(a)(2)(B) provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to review \u2014 (i) any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section 1182(h).... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). In <em>Max-George </em>the court held that the phrase in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), \u201c[njotwithstanding any other provisions of law, no court shall have jurisdiction,\u201d constituted an explicit repeal of \u00a7 2241 habeas jurisdiction. 205 F.3d at 198-99. Section 1252(a)(2)(B) begins with the same phrase. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). Because \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) both contain the jurisdiction-repealing language, the fact that this case concerns the unavailability of a waiver instead of an order of removal does not provide a basis for distinguishing <em>Max-George.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
