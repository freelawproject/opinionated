The case was tried by a jury. Appellant Borne contends that the statutory presumption <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *embodied in 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 176a violates his constitutional rights. Appellant Walker contends that his conviction is invalid by reason of entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-19\"> After a careful consideration, of the entire record, we find to the contrary. The constitutionality of the presumption contained in 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 176a, relating specifically to the importation,, possession and sale of narcotic drugs, has-been consistently upheld. Manning v. United States, 5 Cir., 1960, 274 F.2d 926. A legislative presumption of one fact, from evidence of another does not constitute a denial of due process of law when there is some rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate-fact presumed. Barrett v. United States,. 5 Cir., 1963, 322 F.2d 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-20\"> The undisputed testimony contained in the record disclosed that it was appellant Walker who initiated the proposal to sell marihuana to Agent Robinson on their first meeting, and it was he who was the principal figure in bringing appellant Borne into negotiations for the subsequent sale of marihuana. When the actions of government agents \u201cmerely afford opportunities or facilities for the commission of the offense\u201d there has been no entrapment. Sorrells v. United States, (1932) 287 U.S. 435, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed. 413. Such were the facts in this case. Therefore, the convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-21\">It should be observed that Judge Cameron participated in the hearing and decision of this cause but died before the opinion was filed. See 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 46.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-15\">.
