The present decision and opinion is rendered by a quorum of the court pursuant to Title 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 46, Judge Cameron having taken no part in this decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b671-14\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b671-25\">The per curiam opinion in this cause was rendered prior to the decision in United States v. Behrens, (December 9, 1963) 375 U.S. 162, 84 S.Ct. 295, 11 L.Ed. 2d 224, although not published until January 2, 1964.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We consider such per curiam opinion by this court to be in conflict with Behrens. Accordingly, it is ordered that the per curiam is herewith recalled and in lieu of that opinion th\u00e9 following opinion is substituted:</p>\n<p id=\"b671-26\">In this case there was a preliminary commitment of the defendant under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4208(b). The defendant was absent when final sentence was fixed. Under Behrens such final sentence cannot be fixed in the absence of the defendant. The judgment of the lower court is reversed and the cause is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-27\">The petition for rehearing, in all other respects, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-28\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-31\">.
