To that end, we alter the decision of the panel, 326 F.2d 117 (2 Cir. 1964), vacate the judgment of the District Court dismissing the petition, and remand the case to the District Court with instructions to take such evidence as is relevant to the contentions of the parties and to make a further determination in the light thereof and the arguments made thereon by the parties and, if the District Court deems desirable, by the United States.
