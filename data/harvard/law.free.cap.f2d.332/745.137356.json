In most instances, the practices cited were virtually conceded by the petitioners, and the Commission\u2019s conclusion that such conduct was, in fact, misleading, was well within the scope of its discretion. The choice of a remedy is also a matter for the discretion of the Commission, and may not be disturbed on review unless that discretion is abused. See Federal Trade Commission v. Mandel Bros., 359 U.S. 385, 79 S.Ct. 818, 3 L.Ed.2d 893 (1959). Such is plainly not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-13\">Only one of petitioners\u2019 arguments warrants discussion. Thus, petitioner Delaware Watch Company, Inc., contends that it merely acted to clear the watch movements in question through customs, and that it was consequently innocent of the deceptive practices charged. Accordingly, Delaware insists that the complaint must be dismissed against it, and the order modified to exempt Delaware from the prohibitions imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-14\">We find no error in the Commission\u2019s rejection of Delaware\u2019s arguments in this regard. As revealed before the Commission, petitioners Delaware and Schwarcz are New York corporations with their offices and principal places of business located at the same Manhattan address. Vogel and Shaw, the individual petitioners, are officers of both corporations, and Shaw is the president and majority stockholder of Schwarcz; Schwarcz, in turn, owns all of the stock of Delaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-15\">Under these circumstances, the Commission properly concluded that the functions of Delaware and Schwarcz were not sufficiently isolated as to warrant an exemption for Delaware. Rather, this seems a case in which the same individuals were transacting an integrated business through a maze of interrelated companies; in such a case, \u201cthe pattern and frame-work of the whole enterprise must be taken into consideration.\u201d Art National Mfrs. Dist. Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 298 F.2d 476, 477 (2d Cir. 1962). Indeed, the Commission may well have believed that Vogel and Shaw would have been pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>vided with a clear mechanism for avoiding the terms of the order if only Schwarcz \u2014 and not Delaware \u2014 were enjoined from the deceptive trade practices involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Petitioners\u2019 other contentions are without merit. The order is affirmed, and its enforcement is decreed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
