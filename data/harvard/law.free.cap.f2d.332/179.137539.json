Spires v. Bottorff, 317 F.2d 273 (7th Cir. 1963). On remand, the complaint was filed and issues joined. Plaintiff was produced for trial under a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum. Witnesses were heard, and the district court, without a jury, found adversely to plaintiff on his claims that defendant Bottorff\u2019s letter to the warden of the penitentiary, and defendant Bottorff\u2019s alleged prejudicial interference in plaintiff\u2019s coram nobis action in the Clark County Circuit Court, had violated plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights. Spires v. Bottorff, 223 F.Supp. 441 (S.D.Ind.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">We have read the district court opinion and are satisfied there was no merit in the contentions made here by plaintiff, that the district court disregarded the \u201cuncontradicted testimony\u201d of witness Kage, and that the testimony of witness Baker proved Bottorff\u2019s interference in the coram nobis proceeding. Both contentions involve questions of fact upon which the district court made findings, including considerations of credibility, which have substantial basis in the evidence and are not erroneous. We have no definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. American Glass Co. v. Michigan Mut. Liab. Co., 327 F.2d 776 (7th Cir. 1964), Footlik v. United States, 323 F.2d 635 (7th Cir., 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-16\">For the reasons given, the judgment upon the findings is not error and is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
