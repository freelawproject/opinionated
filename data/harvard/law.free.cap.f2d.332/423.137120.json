After the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff on the issues of negligence, contributory negligence and damages, the court entered judgment n. o. v. for the defendant on the grounds that the evidence showed contributory negligence as a matter of law. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>also conditionally granted the defendant\u2019s motion for \u00e1 new trial, if this court should set aside the judgment n. o. v. Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(c) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">We cannot agree on this record that the evidence supports the court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. Nor can we say that the court abused its discretion in conditionally granting a new trial. The judgment is vacated and the case remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
