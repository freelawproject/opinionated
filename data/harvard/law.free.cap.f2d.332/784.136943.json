During a search of her apartment, federal agents seized a sweater which defendant was said to have purchased with a counterfeit bill. Defendant maintains that the search was illegal but the district court found, and the evidence supports the conclusion, that defendant rendered the search legal by her consent. During a detention alleged to be illegal, defendant was forced to pose for various photographs in addition to the regular \u201cmug\u201d shots. Neither the sweater nor the photographs were introduced into evidence at her trial. Both were shown to witnesses to \u201cfirm up\u201d their identifications after they had already made a positive identification of the defendant. The articles were shown to every witness who identified and testified against defendant at her trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-17\">The reach of the \u201cfruit of the forbidden tree\u201d doctrine (Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 1920, 251 U.S. 385, 40 S.Ct. 182, 64 L.Ed. 319) is not limitless. We hold that even if the photographs were the fruits of an illegal detention, their connection with the evidence introduced at trial is too attenuated to taint it.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-18\">The defendant\u2019s motion for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
