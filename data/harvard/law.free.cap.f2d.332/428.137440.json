This decision was predicated upon a finding by the Tax Court that the taxpayer became a principal in the ill-fated partnership to help his relative and not primarily with a view to earning a profit through investing in a commercial venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-24\"> We have recently pointed out that it \u201cis the function of the Tax Court to weigh the evidence, draw the inferences of which the evidence is reasonably susceptible, and, if necessary, resolve conflicting inferences\u201d, and that the \u201cdecision of the Tax Court, based upon its findings of fact, is conclusive unless it appears from an examination of the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>ord that the findings of fact were clearly erroneous\u201d. Carpenter v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 3 Cir., 1963, 322 F.2d 733, 736. Having considered the entire record that was before the Tax Court, we are unable to say that its finding as to the primary purpose of the taxpayer Valentine Howell\u2019s venture was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"AEx\">Accordingly, the decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
