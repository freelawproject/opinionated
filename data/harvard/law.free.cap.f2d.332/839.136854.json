A herbicidal composition comprising a herbicidally effective amount of n-butyl 2-aIlyIoxy-ben-zoate, a surfactant and a carrier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"And\">The sole reference is a patent to Jones, 2,394,916, dated February 12, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"AkTC\">Jones discloses the selective killing of \u201cweeds,\u201d a term which he defines broadly as \u201ca plant which persists in growing where it is not wanted\u201d <em>by </em>applying thereto a herbicidal composition. The active ingredient in Jones\u2019 herbicidal composition includes \u201cthe phenyl, naphthy], tetralyl and anthracene mono car-boxylie aliphatic acids, their esters and salts. The ring portion of the compounds may contain one or more substituents such as halogen, hydroxy], NH2 HSO3, NO2, or an alkyl or alkylene group such as f\u00b0r instance methyl, ethyl, propyltyl, methoxy and ethoxy.\u201d Jones pro-ceeds to exemplify the acids and esters that are intended for use. It is clear that Jones broadly discloses the instant compounds, as defined m claims 1 ana 11. He ag0 suggests use of lower alkoxy sub. stituents on tbe ring.</p>\n<p id=\"ANR\">vThe compounds of claims 1 and 19 are limited\u2019 however <em>by </em>total number of carbon atoms that the ester and ether substituents may possess, namely 5 to 12 carbon atoms. Composition claims 11 to employ specific compounds which comply with the foregoing 5 to 12 carbon atom limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"ALyl\">Thus the issue is whether the limitation on the total number of carbon atoms in the substituents of those compounds is critical.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ9\">Lemin submitted an affidavit of Steinhards to establish that the 5 to 12 carbon atom limitation is critical. Steinhards tested various compounds wherein the total number of carbon atoms in the sub-stituents varied from 3 to 23. The tests were performed on crabgrass in the presence 0f ry6) fescue and bluegrass. Stein-hards found that when the carbon atoms in the substituents totaled between 5 and 12 the herbicidal compositions proved effeetive against crabgrass without injuring the desired rye, fescue and bluegrass. When the total number of carbon atoms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>fell below 5 or above 12, the compounds \u201cexhibited no significant herbicidal activity against crabgrass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">After considering the affidavit the examiner allowed all claims directed to the control of crabgrass. The rejection of the instant claims was maintained, however, because there was no showing of criticality in the number of carbon atoms limitation when the compounds were applied to all other undesired plants falling within the generic disclosure of Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The position of the Patent Office is, essentially, that Lemin has done no more than pluck a subgenus out of a generic disclosure by Jones, and has used that subgenus in precisely the manner taught by Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Generally speaking, there is nothing unobvious in choosing \u201csome\u201d among \u201cmany\u201d indiscriminately. In re Rosicky, 276 F.2d 656, 47 CCPA 859. Here, however, the choice is based on a discovery by Lemin that some compounds, falling within a prior art genus, have a special significance. In short, Lemin has found that when the total number of carbon atoms in the ester and alkoxy substituents is within the range of 5 to 12, the compounds involved will have selective and potent herbicidal action. Furthermore, in the absence of art showing that crabgrass is different from white clover, oxalis, chickweed, or any other plant, there is no basis upon which to restrict the showing of Steinhards. That is, Steinhards\u2019 affidavit establishes the criticality of the total number of carbon atom limitation with respect to crabgrass. The application and the claims affirmatively set up an equivalence between crabgrass and all other \u201cundesired vegetation\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> insofar as the herbicidal effectiveness of the instant compounds are concerned. The examiner cited no art, and the board referred to none, which would show that proof of criticality with respect to crabgrass was insufficient with respect to other undesired vegetation.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Therefore, <em>on this record, </em>we feel obliged to hold that the Steinhards\u2019 affidavit with respect to crabgrass is equally applicable to other undesired vegetation and satisfactorily establishes that the 5 to 12 carbon atom limitation is a critical factor in the herbicidal activity of the instant compounds. Since there is nothing in the cited art to suggest the criticality of that range, we do not find that limitation obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">The rejection of claims 1, 11 to 14 and 19 is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-32\">.
