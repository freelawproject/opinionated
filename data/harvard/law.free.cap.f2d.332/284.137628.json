The District Court determined that two letters written January 2, 1963 by Hy-Lan to the Referee constituted proof of claim. The issue of Hy-Lan\u2019s opportunity to furnish further proof primarily raises a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Consideration of the record, briefs and argument persuades us that the District Judge properly affirmed the order of the Referee disallowing Hy-Lan\u2019s claim in part. The District Judge did not abuse his discretion by denying Hy-Lan\u2019s motion to vacate the Referee\u2019s order and to reopen the proceedings for further proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
