Appellant points out that provision for parole of federal prisoners is to be found not only in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202, providing for automatic eligibility for parole after serving one third of a sen-tence, but also in \u00a7 4208, allowing the court to prescribe that the prisoner may become eligible for parole. She contends that while 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d) expressly provides that \u00a7 4202 shall not apply, it tacitly leaves \u00a7 4208 applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"AEP\"> We have already considered and rejected this contention in Rivera v. United States (9 Cir. 1963) 318 F.2d 606. We there noted that Congress, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>same statute which enacted \u00a7 4208, provided that it \u201cdoes not apply to any offense for which there is provided a mandatory penalty.\u201d We held, in the light of this provision, that \u00a7 4208 does not apply to those narcotics offenses for which the court must impose a minimum sentence and for which it may not, under \u00a7 7237 (d) suspend sentence or grant probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Although Rivera involved conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a, \u00a7 174 prescribes precisely the same \u201cmandatory penalty.\u201d Rivera also rejected the contention, urged by appellant here, that \u00a7 4208 should apply to the portion of the sentence exceeding the five-year statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Appellant next contends that in denying her motion for reduction of sentence, the district court acted arbitrarily and capriciously and in abuse of discretion. She reasons that since the district court originally had felt ten years to be an appropriate sentence when it had believed parole to be available, it must consistently believe a shorter sentence to be appropriate since parole is not available.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">We cannot agree. Eligibility for parole is a far different thing from reduction of sentence. The former contemplates an examination by the Board of Paroles into circumstances existing years after imposition of sentence, importantly including the probabilities of rehabilitation as then existing. It recognizes that upon release the prisoner will be under supervision. A decision to make parole available does not, then, encompass a decision in the alternative to shorten sentence. Thus, a decision to shorten or not to shorten sentence required an independent exercise of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">Appellant protests that while these facts may well have justified an independent exercise of discretion, it does not appear that the district court acted for these reasons. From the oral statement of the court denying reduction,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appellant concludes that the court simply refused to exercise its discretion at all; that it arbitrarily declined to consider the matter for reasons having nothing to do with the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">We do not so construe the court\u2019s remarks. The court in effect stated that the case presented no change in pertinent circumstances, and that in the light of that fact a reduction in sentence would indicate partiality. The propriety of using a reduction of sentence to compensate for unavailability of parole was argued to the court and we cannot assume that its failure to reject this argument expressly demonstrates that it did not even consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Aal\">. Rule 35, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A45\">\u201cThe court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.
