A sergeant, quartered therein, after finishing his duties for the day, negligently set fire to the house by smoking in bed. Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 (b) provides for government tort liability for the acts of an employee \u201cwhile acting within the scope of his office or employment * * *.\u201d This, as to a member of the military, is defined to mean \u201cacting in line of duty.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671. The district court,- finding the facts as above, dismissed the action, and plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-21\">It is settled that the phrase \u201cacting in line of duty,\u201d while having a military sound, and, apparently, a different meaning in connection with benefit claims of military personnel against the government, with respect to the Tort Claims Act merely invokes the state law of respondeat superior. Williams v. United States, 1955, 350 U.S. 857, 76 S.Ct. 100, 100 L.Ed. 761; United States v. Taylor, 6 Cir., 1956, 236 F.2d 649, 74 A.L.R.2d 860, cert. dismissed, 355 U.S. 801, 78 S.Ct. 6, 2 L.Ed.2d 19; United States v. Hainline, 10 Cir., 1963, 315 F.2d 153, cert. den. 375 U.S. 895, 84 S.Ct. 172, 11 L.Ed.2d 124. We find nothing in the Massachusetts cases suggesting that an employee smoking in bed during his off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>hours is in the course of his employment. Plaintiff concedes that there would be no government liability for the sergeant\u2019s negligence if he had been smoking, in, say, a public bar, but contends that the fact that the government supplied him with a residence meant that anything he was doing in the residence was in the scope of his employment. We would need persuasive authority to show that this was the Massachusetts law. Cf. Harrington v. Border City Mfg. Co., 1921, 240 Mass. 170, 132 N.E. 721, 18 A.L.R. 610; see also, Khoury v. Edison Elec. Illuminating Co., 1928, 265 Mass. 236, 164 N.E. 77, 60 A.L.R. 1159; Conversions &amp; Surveys, Inc. v. Roach, 1 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 499.</p>\n<p id=\"AXc\">Alternatively, the plaintiff claims that the government is liable on a theory of tort in the nature of waste. It is clear under Massachusetts law that a tenant for years may be held answerable for waste for damage to the leasehold by fire attributable to his voluntary or negligent acts, or to those of his servants in the course of their employment. See Cawley v. Northern Waste Co., 1921, 239 Mass. 540, 132 N.E. 365; Mass.Gen. Laws c. 242, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. For reasons already stated this does not advance the plaintiff. He urges, however, citing Fay v. Brewer, 1825, 3 Pick., Mass., 203, that the remedy is broader; that a tenant for years would be liable in tort to the reversioner for permissive waste on account of acts committed by a stranger, and for which the tenant is in no way at fault. It has been forcefully argued that Fay v. Brewer no longer represents the law of the Commonwealth. E. g., 5 American Law of Property \u00a7 20.13 (Casner ed. 1952); 1 Walsh, Commentary on Law of Real Property \u00a7\u00a7 9, 46, 50 (1947); 1 Tiffany, Landlord &amp; Tenant \u00a7 110 (1910). See also, 5 Powell, Real Property \u00a7 640 (Boyer ed. 1962).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But even if it should still be the law of Massaehusetts we do not construe the Tort Claims Act, which provides for a waiver of immunity only for loss \u201ccaused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee * * * while acting within the scope of his office or employment,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b), as embracing liability in the absence of fault attributable on ordinary agency principles. See, e. g., United States v. Campbell, 5 Cir., 1949, 172 F.2d 500, cert. den. 337 U.S. 957, 69 S.Ct. 1532, 93 L.Ed. 1757; United States v. Eleazer, 4 Cir., 1949, 177 F.2d 914, cert. den. 339 U.S. 903, 70 S.Ct. 517, 94 L.Ed. 1333; United States v. Taylor, supra Whether plaintiff has a con-factual claim under the lease is not before us\u2018</p>\n<p id=\"AVP2\">Judgment will be entered affirming the judgment of the District Court,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-22\">.

The broad statement that the \u201ctenant by the curtesie, tenant in dower, tenant for life, yeares, &amp;c. shall answer for the waste done by a stranger * * * \u201d (Co. Litt. *54a), once had considerable currency, but it is debatable whether it was ever applied to merely negligent acts, and when more recently re-examined the New York court, recognizing its proeedural origin, has rejected it altogether, Rogers v. Atlantic Gulf &amp; Pac. Co., 1915, 213 N.Y. 246, 107 N.E. 661, L.R.A.1916A, 787, as has the Restatement of Property, section 146 (1936).
