Both sales were made the same day, to the same purchaser, in the same location. The judge imposed the following sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2p\">\u201cFive (5) years on count one; One (1) year to Three (3) years on count two, to run consecutively to the sentenee imposed on count one; Five (5) years on count three; Five (5) years on count four; One (1) year to Three (3) years on count five; Five (5) years on count six, said sentences imposed on counts 3, 4, 5 and 6, to run concurrently with the sentences imposed on counts 1 and 2.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azz\">It that the sentences on all counts are to run concurrently, except the gentence on count 2 \u00a3 to ruPn consecutively with the sentence on count 1. Thus we have before us the issue of consecutive sentences imposed under different statutes for the same narcotic transaction. This same issue was before this court in Gore v. United States, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 315, 244 F.2d 763 (1957), <em>affirmed, </em>357 U.S. 386, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958) (Chief Justice Warren and Justices Black, Douglas and Brennan dissenting). See also Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932); Harris v. United States, 359 U.S. 19, 79 S. Ct. 560, 3 L.Ed.2d 597 (1959). I agree with the observation of Judges Bazelon and Fahy, concurring in <em>Gore, </em>that the imposition of cumulative sentences for different facets of the same transaction raises serious problems. 100 U.S.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>D.C. at 318, 244 F.2d at 766, and see cases cited therein. I agree as well with the views expressed in the dissenting \u25a0opinions in the Supreme Court in <em>Gore. </em>But \u201cUnless we are freed from the controlling effect of [the precedents], we have no choice but to countenance the sentences here imposed.\u201d 100 U.S.App. D.C. at 319, 244 F.2d at 767.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
