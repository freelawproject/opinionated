The Board further found that, the respondent violated sections 8(a) (1) and (3), 29 U.S.C.A. 158(a) (1) and (3), by discharging employees Sam Cagnina, Raymond Beiro, Leroy Jordan, and Manuel Carmona because of their activity on behalf of the Union. In reaching its conclusion as to Manuel Carmona,, the Board found that he was not a supervisor within the meaning of section-2(11) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. 152(11)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s order requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the unfair-labor practices found is in the usual' form. Affirmatively, the Board\u2019s order requires respondent to reinstate Cagnina, Beiro, Jordan, and Carmona with back pay, and to post appropriate notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-17\"> The questions presented are-whether substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s findings. See section 10(e) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. 160(e). We are convinced that, all of the Board\u2019s findings are so supported, except for its finding that Manuel Carmona was not a supervisor. <em>As-</em>to the last-mentioned finding, Carmona, admitted that he had effectively recommended an employee\u2019s raise of pay, had selected truck drivers to work overtime, and had given \u201cfriendly advice\u201d to truck drivers as to the work they should do when not driving, which advice was always heeded. There was also strong evidence that Carmona responsibly directed employees how to perform their duties. Carmona\u2019s immediate predecessor and successor testified to the supervisory nature of the job. On the record as a whole we find no substantial evidence that Carmona was not a super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>visor. No useful purpose would be served by a more detailed statement of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">The Board\u2019s order will be enforced except as to that part of the order directing the reinstatement of Manuel Carmona, as to which enforcement is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Enforced in part and denied in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-14\">.
