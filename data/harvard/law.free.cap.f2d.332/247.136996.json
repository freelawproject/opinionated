Defendant was found guilty on both counts and he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-19\">The court charged the jury that conviction on the conspiracy count required an \u201cagreement\u201d between the defendant and Massahos to transport the guns in question from New Hampshire to Massachusetts, and thereby perhaps implicitly required the jury to find that the defendant had knowledge that the transportation involved the crossing of a state line. With respect to the substantive count the charge contained not even that much reference to knowledge. Yet under this statute, whatever else may be required,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it must be that \u201ccausing\u201d interstate transportation requires knowledge on the part of the defendant, or, at least, reasonable grounds to know, that his conduct involves, or will result in, such commerce. Cf. Pereira v. United States, 1954, 347 U.S. 1, 9, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L.Ed. 435; United States v. Sheridan, 1946, 329 U.S. 379, 391, 67 S.Ct. 332, 91 L.Ed. 359. In an extended record we find no basis for a finding that the defendant had even reason to know that the two guns in question either had been or were to be so transported.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-20\">The defendant lived in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, as did Massahos. Massahos operated a gasoline filling station in Salem, New Hampshire. \u201cOn the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>late afternoon or early evening\u201d of October 13, 1959, Massahos telephoned defendant\u2019s home and spoke to defendant. So far as appears nothing was said as to where he was calling from. The indefinite specification of the hour would not, without more, warrant a finding that defendant knew he was still at work. In fact Massahos was calling from Salem, where he had the guns.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Massahos told defendant that one Bonyman \u201chad come in with these weapons;\u201d that they were stolen;, that Massahos had bought them, but had no use for them. \u201cI told him how much I had paid for them and-he told me to bring them down to his house\u201d and he would pay the same amount. Bonyman was known to defendant as a resident of Lowell, Massachusetts. His identification as the source, accordingly, did nothing to reveal to defendant that the guns were in New Hampshire. The statement that he \u201chad come in with these weapons\u201d did not mean that Bony-man had come in to Massahos\u2019 filling station, as opposed to his home; much less did it disclose that the guns were still at the former location. Nor did \u201cbring them down to [defendant\u2019s] * * * house\u201d recognize an out-of-state origin, or direct, in the absence of such recognition, an interstate trip.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The government\u2019s burden does not require the inescapable resolution of possible ambiguities, but here there was no indication whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Finally, the testimony of a witness that subsequent to the event defendant told him the guns had been stolen in Troy, New Hampshire (passing the fact that, admittedly, they were stolen in Hudson, New Hampshire) is not evidence that defendant knew this fact at the time he agreed to buy them and thereby, allegedly, \u201ccaused\u201d their transportation in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Judgment will be entered vacating the judgment of the District Court and ordering the defendant\u2019s acquittal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-14\">. \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to transport or ship or cause to be transported or shipped in interstate or foreign commerce any stolen firearm or ammunition, knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, same to have been stolen.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b300-21\">. We do not reach defendant\u2019s further argument that, even if it were shown that he knew of the required interstate transportation, he was not a \u201ccauser\u201d within the meaning of the section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AWq\">. If we might take judicial notice that in 1959 one could not dial directly from New Hampshire to Massachusetts, no testimony indicated that defendant\u2019s attention was called to the fact that this was an operator-placed call.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"A-M\">. Whatever transgression was requested <em>by </em>that famous invitation, \u201cCome up and see me, sometime,\u201d it was not one of the state line,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
