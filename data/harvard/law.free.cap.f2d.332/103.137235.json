At the conclusion of the trial without a jury, Judge Mishler determined that Remmers was not an employee \u201cengaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce,\u201d within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206 and 207, and hence was not included within the coverage of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\"> Although recognizing that the Fair Labor Standards Act \u201chas been construed liberally to apply to the furthest reaches consistent with congressional direction,\u201d Mitchell v. Lublin, McGaughy &amp; Assocs., 358 U.S. 207, 211, 79 S.Ct. 260, 264, 3 L.Ed.2d 43 (1959), we find no basis in the present record for overturning Judge Mishler\u2019s determination. Thus,\" the evidence revealed that during the period in question, Remmers was employed as a tool-and-die maker for Egor, at the latter\u2019s three-man shop on Long Island. The only testimony which pertained to the interstate character of either Remmers\u2019 work or Egor\u2019s business simply established that once, in the entire two-year period, Remmers had wrapped a package or packages which were shipped to a company in Providence, Rhode Island, and that on another occasion, Egor himself had delivered a die in Massachusetts. These two isolated instances hardly constitute a showing that \u201ca substantial part\u201d of Remmers\u2019 work was related to interstate commerce. See Divins v. Hazeltine Electronics Corp., 163 F.2d 100 (2d Cir.1947). As the Supreme Court indicated in Mabee v. White Plains Pub. Co., 327 U.S. 178, 66 S.Ct. 511, 90 L.Ed. 607 (1946), \u201csporadic or occasional shipments of insubstantial amounts of goods\u201d are insufficient to bring an employee within the coverage of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
