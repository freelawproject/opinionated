It does not fall within any of the categories of interlocutory orders made appealable by 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292(a) and no effort was made to comply with 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292 (b), nor did the court direct the entry of a final judgment, under Rule 54(b), Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The appeal is dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
