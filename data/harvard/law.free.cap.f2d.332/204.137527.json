They allege this happened because some federally constructed levees broke. The trial court has held that 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 702c,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the facts here, insulates the United States from liability. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-24\">Apparently in the summer of 1955 a flood control project under way for many years, on the Feather River and its tributaries, the Yuba and the Bear, was completed. At that time an overflow escape at the place called Hamilton Bend was sealed off. Had not the Hamilton Bend escape been closed, the levees would have not broken and the plaintiffs would not have been injured, it is alleged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Apparently the water would have flooded other lands which historically had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>subject to flooding. Plaintiffs, in effect, say that what the new system actually accomplished was to protect someone else by injuring plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The Feather River and its tributaries had natural streams and natural banks. The levees were set back and away from the banks. At the time of the floods, the waters would leave the banks and were supposed to be contained by the levees.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The trial court had a trial on the applicability of \u00a7 702c.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In a pre-trial order the court ruled that 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 702c \u201capplies to all floods and flood waters which result in whole or in part from unusual or extraordinary precipitation\u201d and defined \u201cunusual or extraordinary\u201d as meaning \u201cconditions which, in the light of experience, would not be anticipated by a normal person using ordinary care.\u201d Then it went on to say \u00a7 702c \u201cdoes not apply to \u2018man-made floods\u2019 which result solely from negligent acts.\u201d Then the term \u201cman made flood\u201d was defined as \u201ca flood which is created solely by the construction or fabrication of a barrier which, but for the barrier, would not have been impounded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">In its findings of fact the court said: the waters were unusual and extraordinary. For amplification of the court\u2019s findings see the court\u2019s opinion, Stover v. United States, D.C., 204 F.Supp. 477. Evidence of negligent construction was excluded as not being within the issues of the trial on the applicability of \u00a7 702c.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">If the court adhered to its original definition, we believe it found that the rains and runoff were not foreseeable. If that be the'case, would one even reach the applicability of \u00a7 702c? Under general negligence is there ever liability for the thing that cannot reasonably be foreseen by the ordinary prudent person who plans waterways?</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\"> We hold that 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 702c is an immunity statute covering even ordinary negligent construction or maintenance of flood works and that to hold otherwise would be a repudiation of our Clark case, Clark v. United States, 218 F.2d 446. True, as appellants point out, \u00a7 702c was only one of the legs on which Clark stood, and one of the other legs was sufficient for the case. But we cannot call it pure dicta. If it was half dicta, we believe it good dicta. Also, the leading case, National Manufacturing Co. v. United States, 8 Cir., 210 F.2d 263, holds \u00a7 702c to be an immunity statute. And, it is a well reasoned case. We affirm on the ground, negligence or no negligence, \u00a7 702c precludes recovery here.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Appellants say the section applies to natural but not to man made floods. They rely heavily on the draft form of the 1928 Flood Control Bill out of which present \u00a7 702c emerged. Also, they rely strongly on Congressional colloquy at the time of the adoption of the 1928 Flood Control Bill. But all the colloquy just cannot overcome plain language. And there really <em>would </em>not be any reason to legislate on damage caused purely by nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">Appellants finally contend that if 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 702c bars a suit for damage caused by negligent federal planning of a flood control project, then the section is unconstitutional as causing a taking without just compensation, proscribed by the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">An isolated injury is not considered a taking. Prior to the Federal Tort Claims Act if one was hit by a negligently driven post office truck and even one\u2019s life was \u201ctaken,\u201d there seems to have been no authority that that was a taking requiring compensation under the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-14\">There is no pleading that the construction of the Feather River system levees has resulted in a permanent taking of any right on or over the plaintiffs\u2019 land. It is not framed at all in the terms of United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256, 66 S.Ct. 1062, 90 L.Ed. 1206, the airplane noise case. The claims so far as we have them in the record would seem to exceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>the present m\u00e1ximums for district courts under the Tucker Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The appellants would have us abolish federal governmental immunity (at least in cases like this) and rely on recent state decisions which do it. The state decisions do not yet say that a legislature cannot establish governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">It may be that morally and financially the plaintiffs have been grievously wronged by their government; that in protecting others it injured them. It is not committed to us to remake the statute. That the limitation should happen to be in the statute is understandable. Appropriations for flood control do not come automatically. Dozens of congressmen have no flood control problems. Perhaps, as a condition to their consent to flood control appropriations, they impose such limitations as \u00a7 702c.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Congress can change \u00a7 702c and the Federal Tort Claims Act if it wants to do so. We cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-13\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 702c, in pertinent part, provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-14\">\u201cNo liability of any kind shall attach to or rest upon the United States for any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any place * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-15\">The language originated in an act of Congress affecting the Mississippi River. 45 Stat. 535.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b257-16\">. Plaintiffs also contended there was negligent construction at the points of the breaks and negligent maintenance of the channel and levees. Two breaks several miles apart occurred on the right bank and one break on the left bank. Stover himself apparently suffered from the break called Gum Tree on the right bank. Other breaks were at the Western Pacific Interceptor Canal levee on the right bank and one at Nicolous on the loft bank. All breaks resulted from the runoff from the same storm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AU4\">. 24 Stat. 505, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b259-9\">On Petition for Rehearing</p>\n<author id=\"Al_F\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b259-11\">CHAMBERS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<author id=\"AS0\">(concur-</author>\n<p id=\"ArJ\">ring).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">In their petition for rehearing, appellants challenge the statement in our opinion which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-13\">\u201cAppellants finally contend that if 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 702c bars a suit for damage caused by negligent federal planning of a flood control project, then the section is unconstitutional as causing a taking without just compensation, proscribed by the Fifth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-14\">They say:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-15\">\u201cAppellants\u2019 contention with respect to the constitutional question was that Section 702c, if construed as an immunity statute, would be unconstitutional as a <em>denial of due process of law </em>as it would destroy a right without providing a reasonable substitute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-17\">Whichever way we state it, due process of law or taking without just compensation, we are in the Fifth Amendment and we end up the same place. And that is, short of a taking, historically on a tort one has had to have the consent of the federal government to sue it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
