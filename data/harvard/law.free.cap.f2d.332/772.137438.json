The patented device is described in the findings of the district court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-20\">\u201cPatent No. 2,871,592 discloses an identification bracelet which includes a band of flexible material having a row of apertures in one end and having an elongated pocket at its other end defined by a substantially rectangular window of transparent material. The end of the window is provided with a short flap and the female element of a snap fastener is secured to the flap while the male element of the snap fastener is secured to the end of the band.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3F\">Referring particularly to prior art Polzin Patent No. 2,846,796, Gross Patent No. 2,111,664, Trilling Patent No. 2,738,-561, and unpatented identification bracelets manufactured by the defendant and by Hollister, Inc., the district court concluded that \u201cthe advance, if any, defined in claim 2 over the prior art would have been obvious to a person skilled in the art.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-21\">We have examined the record and are satisfied that the district court\u2019s conclusion is correct, and that the judgment therefore should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
