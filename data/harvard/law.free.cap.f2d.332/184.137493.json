for paper bags and the mark E-Z WRAP for kraft wrapping paper.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is testimony that appellee is a closely-held family managed corporation, whose corporate image has grown in the last 75 years to the extent that it is now recognized as a dominant and outstanding corporation in the pulp and paper industries. Roughly one out of every five grocery bags used in the United States today is said to be manufactured in appellee\u2019s plant. Besides paper bags, the record shows that appellee manufactures and sells paperboard containers for a wide variety of food products, a broad line of wrapping paper and butcher\u2019s paper and bleached sulfate pulp board. The record further shows that appellee has recently begun the manufacturing and the distribution of folding paper cartons made from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>bleached sulfate board and has entered the fine paper market, i. e., mimeograph, duplicator, and bond papers. Trademarks employed in identifying appellee\u2019s additional products are E-Z DUPLICATOR, E-Z MIMEOGRAPH, E-Z FOOD-PAK, E-Z TRAYPAK, E-Z MEAT BOARD, E-Z KART-N-PAK, E-Z LOAD, SOFTWOOD E-Z PULP, HARDWOOD E-Z PULP, E-Z OPEN, WHITE GUM E-Z PULP and E-Z FREZ. In addition, appellee also has used E-Z PAK for bleached folding cartons.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Appellee filed a petition to cancel the Supplemental Registration of the mark of appellant-respondent on the basis that the registration of that mark \u201cunder the Act of 1946\u201d is specifically barred by Section 2(d) of the Act, inasmuch as said mark so resembles the registered marks of appellee-petitioner \u201cas to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In dismissing appellee\u2019s petition to cancel, from which no appeal has been filed by appellee-petitioner, a majority of the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">While petitioner has used a number of trademarks comprising the notation \u2018E-Z\u2019 in connection with its various paper and paperboard products, there is nothing in petitioner\u2019s record which would indicate that such use has created or resulted in purchaser recognition that petitioner possesses a \u2018family of marks\u2019 characterized by this term; and the third party registrations made of record by respondent appear to negate such claim. * * * Nevertheless, petitioner\u2019s record is sufficient to establish prior and continuous use of its registered trademarks, including the marks \u2018E-Z PAK\u2019 and \u2018E-Z OPENER\u2019, which are substantially similar to respondent\u2019s mark \u2018E-Z OPEN PAK\u2019. Accordingly, the question to be determined in resolving the issue of likelihood of confusion raised by the pleadings is whether or not the-goods of the parties are of such nature that their sale under the marks-\u2018E-Z PAK and \u2018E-Z OPENER\u2019 on the one hand and \u2018E-Z OPEN PAK\u2019 on the other is likely to cause confusion in trade. (7) <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">\u201cIt is apparent from respondent\u2019s' container, as urged by petitioner, that the registered mark \u2018E-Z OPEN PAK\u2019, as used thereon, serves to identify the container rather than, the luncheon meats sold by respondent. The issue involved in a proceeding of this character, however, is whether or not petitioner is damaged by the registration in question and not by the manner in which the registered mark may be used by respondent. Thus, the question of likelihood of confusion and resultant damage to petitioner must be decided on the basis of the goods as identified in the registration sought, to be canceled. In this regard, although reference is made in the registration to a cellophane tear open-package, the goods for which registration was sought and for which the registration was granted are packaged luncheon meats. These-goods and petitioner\u2019s paper bags and/or paperboard containers are vastly different products, and in the absence of any evidence that petitioner has advertised or promoted' its goods to the ultimate consumer who is the purchaser of respondent\u2019s meats or that the average consumer purchasing food products in retail outlets utilizing petitioner\u2019s products is familiar with the marks-appearing on the paper bags or containers, it is our opinion that there is no reasonable likelihood of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>fusion as to the source of these goods merely because of the substantially similar marks under which they are marketed. Petitioner cannot therefore be damaged by the registration in question.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The majority of the board, however, after dismissing appellee\u2019s petition to cancel, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">\u201cThe record, however, raises an ex parte question as to respondent\u2019s right to maintain this registration. As indicated above, there is little doubt in our minds in view of the nature of the term \u2018E \u2014 Z OPEN PAK\u2019 and the manner in which it is used on respondent\u2019s containers that the association of \u2018E-Z OPEN PAK\u2019 is with the container rather than with the meat products packaged therein. <em>Under such circumstances, respondent toas not entitled to register the mark \u2018E-Z OPEN PAK\u2019 for its meat products at the time it made application therefor. </em>Furthermore, had respondent sought to register \u2018E-Z OPEN PAK\u2019 for a cellophane tear open package, such registration would have been precluded under Section 2(d) of the Statute by petitioner\u2019s registrations \u2018E-Z PAK\u2019 and \u2018E-Z OPENER\u2019 because paper bags and/or paperboard cartons and cellophane packages are products which may well be sold through the same trade channels to the same classes of purchasers; and while respondent\u2019s mark \u2018E-Z OPEN PAK\u2019 and petitioner\u2019s marks \u2018E-Z PAK\u2019 and \u2018E-Z OPENER\u2019 are highly suggestive terms they are nevertheless substantially similar. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A719\">[Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">Relying on Section 24 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1092<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> ) of the Trademark Act of 1946, the majority of the board then concluded that since it has been found after a hearing before the board that appellant-respondent was not entitled to register its mark in issue at the time of its application for registration thereof, the Supplemental Registration No. 682,704 of such mark \u201cwill be canceled in due course.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">Appellant-respondent urges that the \u201cex parte\u201d ruling of the board, based on \u201can arbitrary interpretation of the meaning of one sentence in Section 24,\u201d was improper because there was no hearing involving the propriety of the issuance of the registration. It is urged that \u201cthere is no evidence to indicate, or even to suggest, that the term E-Z OPEN PAK is being used or has ever been used adversely or by anyone else in connection with packaged meats or related products.\u201d Appellant-respondent further argues that the board in its \u201cex parte\u201d ruling disregarded a recognized practice and custom. It is contended that in the United States it has become a common practice in business not only to employ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>and utilize a plurality of trademarks on a single label, but in addition to use suggestive or descriptive subordinate trademarks usually to indicate some attractive fact as to the product or the package.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Appellee-petitioner argues that, in view of the nature of the term E-Z OPEN PAK and the manner in which it is used on the containers of appellant-respondent, the association of E-Z OPEN PAK is with the container rather than with the meat products packaged therein. Appellee-petitioner further contends that in view of its prior use of the trademarks E-Z OPENER and E-Z PAK, the registration of \u201cE-Z OPEN PAK should never have been granted\u201d to appellant-respondent and that the board was clearly justified in canceling it and that accordingly its \u201cex parte\u201d ruling should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">These facts present two matters to this court. The first relates to the action of the majority of the board in dismissing appellee\u2019s petition to cancel the trademark, E-Z OPEN PAK within an arrow design, of appellant-respondent registered on the Supplemental Register. The second involves the board\u2019s decision, on what it designated as an \u201cex parte\u201d question, wherein it ruled that the trademark of appellant-respondent should be canceled.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">With reference to the dismissal of the petition, that phase of the controversy was not appealed by the appellee-petitioner whose petition was dismissed and thus is not before us for determination on the merits. Therefore, we will not, because we cannot, disturb the board\u2019s decision as to dismissal. However, we would agree with that dismissal if the matter had been properly presented to us since we do not think there would be any likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception as a result of the use by appelleepetitioner of its trademarks for its goods and the use by appellant-respondent of E-Z OPEN PAK within an arrow design for its packaged luncheon meat in a cellophane tear open package.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">We would not agree with the board\u2019s statement that \u201cThe issue involved in a proceeding of this character,, however, is whether or not <em>petitioner is-damaged </em>by the registration in question.\u201d' [Emphasis ours.] The standing of the appellee-petitioner to maintain a cancellation proceeding in the Patent Office stems from the language of section 24: \u201cWhenever any person believes that he is: or will be damaged by the registration * * * he may * * * apply to the Commissioner to cancel such registration.\u201d Similar language appears in sections 13 and 14 with respect to the opposition to or cancellation of registrations on the Principal Register.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">There would seem to be a very real difference between a statutory provision referring to a <em>belief </em>in damage, which is: all we have, and a provision requiring <em>proof </em>of damage, which we do not have. In sustaining an opposition in Singer Manufacturing Co., et al. v. Birginal-Bigsby Corp., 319 F.2d 273, 50 CCPA 1380, this court recently said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">\u201cSuch \u2018damage\u2019 is always speculative and not often subject to precise proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">We also said there that the provision of section 2(e) (2) should be enforced at the instigation \u201cof anyone having a real interest in its enforcement,\u201d by which we meant a personal commercial interest rather than the interest of a mere inter-meddler.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">Coming now to the second matter, we are of the opinion that the board was in error in finding that appellant-respondent was \u201cnot entitled to register the mark \u2018E-Z OPEN PAK\u2019 \u201d on the basis: \u201cthat the association of \u2018E-Z OPEN PAK\u2019 is with the container rather than with the meat products packaged therein\u201d in view of \u201cthe nature of the term-\u2018E-Z OPEN PAK\u2019 and the manner in which it is used on respondent\u2019s containers.\u201d As stated above, we do not think there is a likelihood of confusion as a result of use by appellee-petitioner of its trademarks and the use by appellant-respondent of its trademark. Furthermore, the marks of appellant-respondent have not been registered for \u201cmeat prod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>ucts\u201d but for \u201cPackaged Luncheon Meats In A Cellophane Tear Open Package.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Moreover, we are of the opinion that the board <em>exceeded </em>its statutory authority under section 24 in giving an \u201cex parte\u201d consideration to the question of cancellation of the mark of appellant-respondent. The board apparently considers, however, that section 24 of the Trademark Act provides authority for making an \u201cex parte\u201d ruling in an inter partes proceeding involving a cancellation. The board in its decision on request for reconsideration stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">\u201c * * * it is apparent that the Statute provides ample authority for the Board\u2019s action [under Section 24] ; and this is not the oply instance in which such authority has been similarly exercised by a Patent Office tribunal as evidenced by Mackie-Lovejoy Mfg. Co. v. Birnbaum, 102 USPQ 38 (Comr., 1954); Pease Woodwork Company, Inc. v. Ready Hung Door Company, Inc., 103 USPQ 240 (Comr., 1954); Feldman v. Hoenig Plywood Corporation, 109 USPQ 63 (Comr., 1956); Hans Holterbosch, Inc. v. Rheingauer Schaumweinfabrik Schierstein, 110 USPQ 543 (Comr., 1956); and Miller Shoe Co., Inc., v. Vaisey-Bristol Shoe Company Incorporated, 116 USPQ 160 (Comr., 1958).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">We do not think that the Mackie-Lovejoy case, the Feldman ease, the Holterbosch case or the Miller Shoe case offer any precedent for the board\u2019s \u201cex parte\u201d consideration as to the cancellation of the mark of appellant-respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">In the Mackie case, petitioner filed a petition to cancel two registrations on the Supplemental Register. The Examiner of Interferences sustained the petition and respondent-registrant appealed to the Commissioner. The Assistant Commissioner did <em>not </em>dismiss the petition, as the board has done here, but affirmed the decision of the Examiner of Interferences. The affirmance, however, was not on the examiner\u2019s basis that the evidence showed that the purchasing public was likely to believe that the goods involved in the proceeding emanated from a single source but rather, referring to section 24 of the Trademark Act of 1946,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> on the basis that it was clearly apparent from the record that respondent did not own the marks and was, therefore, not entitled to register the marks at the time of its application to register. The Assistant Commissioner considered that this was a \u201cmatter in issue\u201d with which the Examiner of Interferences did not deal. It is not clear from the decision just how that matter got in issue but in any event it was not treated on an \u201cex parte\u201d basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">The Feldman case dealt with a petition to cancel a registration on the <em>Principal Register </em>and concerned petitioner\u2019s failure to discharge his presumed burden to prove facts from which it could be concluded that it was, or was likely to be, damaged. Such issues are not before us here.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">The Miller Shoe case concerned a petition to cancel a respondent\u2019s mark on the Supplemental Register apparently on the basis that the Examiner of Trademarks had failed to cite an earlier registration of petitioner in respondent\u2019s registration proceedings. Petitioner moved for summary judgment and the Examiner of Interferences denied the motion. On appeal to the Commissioner, the Assistant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Commissioner, referring to section 24 of the Trademark Act, granted petitioner\u2019s motion on the basis that from a mere inspection of the registrant\u2019s mark and petitioner\u2019s earlier registration, the registrant was not entitled to register its mark. Certainly this case is no authority for the board taking an \u201cex parte\u201d action in the factual situation before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The only case cited which we find is not clearly distinguishable from the present case is the Pease case. There the Assistant Commissioner, although dismissing the petition to cancel a registration on the Supplemental Register for the reason that the petitioner \u201cfailed to establish the allegations of its petition,\u201d stated that the registration should be canceled on the basis that the record and testimony of the cancellation proceedings showed (1) that the registrant had never used the mark nor had any use of the mark by others under license inured to the registrant\u2019s benefit, (2) that information material to the question of use and ownership was withheld from the Patent Office at the time of registration, and (3) that the mark as applied to the designated goods was \u201cmerely an apt description\u201d of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">To the extent that the Assistant Commissioner in that case, and the board in the instant case, make an \u201cex parte\u201d ruling, we believe they exceeded their statutory authority under section 24. We do not think it was the intent of Congress under section 24 to give the board authority to make, in an inter partes proceeding, an \u201cex parte\u201d determination whether a registration in issue should be canceled. As indicated by its title, section 24 is directed to a cancellation proceeding, which is an inter partes proceeding. We think that section authorizes cancellation only in connection with such inter partes proceeding; and that when the record made by a petitioner for cancellation establishes facts showing the registration was granted in error, the petition to cancel should be granted inter partes and the inter partes proceeding should remain inter partes. Otherwise very confused procedural situations arise as seen here where, although the petition of appellee-petitioner to cancel was dismissed appellee-petitioner achieved its desired result by reason of the board\u2019s \u201cex parte\u201d decision to cancel. Appelleepetitioner took no appeal, apparently not concerned on what basis it prevailed in the proceeding. Appellant-respondent appealed but its appeal was necessarily from the \u201cex parte\u201d action.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">A so-called ex parte proceeding involves only one party and the Patent Office (so it is really a two-party proceeding) and in an appeal to us in such a proceeding the Patent Office normally appears by its Solicitor. It did not do so in this case, apparently because the case still bears an inter partes title and is so docketed in the Patent Office records, coming to us as an appeal in Cancellation No. 7,604, which it really is not because of the erroneous action of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">At the hearing we inquired of counsel for Gulf States Paper Corporation, the appellee-petitioner, just what he was doing here in an ex parte case. He said he was mystified; that he had inquired several times of the Patent Office what he should do and was told that this is an inter partes case. He therefore appeared here in order to represent his client\u2019s interest \u2014 which happened to coincide with the board\u2019s position in making an \u201cex parte\u201d decision to cancel.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">The position of appellant-respondent at the argument was that he resented the board going on an \u201cex parte frolic.\u201d He characterized the situation as unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">All the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board needed to do to avoid such confusion was to decide the issues raised in the cancellation proceeding and then stop, refraining also from calling any decisions made in the inter partes proceeding, as a result of the record developed therein, \u201cex parte,\u201d a practice we have previously criticized. See Gillette Co. v. Kempel, 254 F.2d 402, 45 CCPA 920; Roger &amp; Gallet v. Janmarie, Inc., 263 F.2d 350, 46 CCPA 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>When a petitioner to cancel brings forth facts which convince the Patent Office that a registration should be canceled, there would seem to be no legal necessity for doing what was done here\u2014 first dismiss the petitioner for lack of standing and then sustain his petition, in effect, in the form of an \u201cex parte\u201d decision made in the theoretical absence of the real party in interest. Legal technicalities should be pursued only in the interest of orderly procedure and applied only where they serve that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">In summary, we think that appellant-respondent is entitled to retain its registration. The appeal here is from a decision of the board reading: \u201cRegistration No. 682,704 will be canceled in due course.\u201d That decision was rendered \u201cex parte\u201d after termination of proceedings in an inter partes cancellation proceeding in which no appeal was taken. Since we hold the \u201cex parte\u201d decision was taken without authoi'ity it is hereby <em>vacated. </em>The initial decision of the board reading \u201cThe petition to cancel is therefore dismissed\u201d is left standing by failure of the appellee-petitioner to appeal from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"APo\">.

However, the opinion states there is no likelihood of confusion and predicates both of the \u201ctwo matters\u201d presented to the court on this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">It appears to me that the decision sets forth circuitous and hypertechnical reasons for the result obtained. The trademark laws should not be interpreted to establish an entangling administrative morass in which an owner of at least 18 trademarks for paper products is unable to prevail because the wrong tribunal decided in his favor for the wrong reasons. The decision of the majority interrupts the family of marks appellee has been seeking to build over nearly forty years by permitting registration of an \u201cE-Z\u201d mark for packaged goods. The reason the strong family of appellee\u2019s marks is broken is that he did not appeal a decision directing cancellation of E-Z OPEN PAK. Since cancellation is precisely what he sought, I see no reason why he should be required to bear the enormous expense of appealing. The majority of this court decrees that his petition to cancel is dismissed because the board, although agreeing that the registration should be canceled, predicated its decision on section 24 of the trademark statute instead of on section 2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">Even if appellee failed to prove ownership of a family of marks, I find a likelihood of confusion between appellant\u2019s mark \u201cE-Z OPEN PAK\u201d and appellee\u2019s marks \u201cE-Z PAK\u201d and \u201cE-Z OPENER\u201d for which the board found proof of prior and continuous use.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">All of the board members agreed that the registration should be canceled, the only difference being in the basis for it. This court, however, sustains dismissal of the petition and permits the registration to stand because appellee did not appeal and the section 24 question was not properly raised. At this point, appellee could well be in doubt as to his remedies. Should he petition to cancel again, based on section 24? His first petition to cancel, nearly four years ago, was denied. Reluctance to spend another four years in the administrative jungle to test another ground would be understandable. Any further action by appellee would involve further expense, delay, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>and inconvenience. Perhaps, in retrospect, appellee should have been \u201cdissatisfied\u201d (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 141) when he won below, albeit on other grounds, and should have filed a cross appeal. Surely Congress did not intend to set up intricacies and technicalities to deny relief to those who fail to assign the proper grounds for a petition to cancel.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The heading of the case shows that Cancellation No. 7604 is before the court. Appellee filed the petition for that cancellation, appeared below, and appeared before this court. To say, as does the majority, that this court <em>cannot </em>decide in his favor because he failed to appeal from a decision granting the full relief for which he petitioned, is to place form before substance. I am of the opinion that we <em>can </em>consider the issue of likelihood of confusion presented in Cancellation No. 7604, and should find confusion likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">My views coincide with those of the dissenting member of the board below, who said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">\u201cThe record in this case clearly shows that the products marketed by respondent under its mark are prepared meat products packaged in a cellophane tear open package, or, stated conversely, a cellophane tear open package containing prepared meat products. Further, it is readily apparent that the mark \u2018E-Z OPEN PAK\u2019 relates to a particular feature of the package which contains such meats. Petitioner, on the other hand, has established prior use of the substantially similar marks \u2018E-Z OPENER\u2019 and \u2018E-Z PAK\u2019 for bags, sacks, and/or containers, which individually bear petitioner\u2019s marks, and of which a substantial percentage are sold to the food retailers for use in the packaging of meat products. In view of the close relationship of respondent\u2019s products, as described above, to petitioner\u2019s bags, cartons or containers which are used in the packaging of meats, and which visibly bear the mark on the package and/or container when sold to the ultimate consumer, it seems quite evident that when the respective marks are applied to the aforementioned products, that persons familiar with petitioner\u2019s marks, upon seeing the mark \u2018EZ OPEN\u2019 affixed to the package or carton containing meat, would reasonably assume that such container either originates with or is in some way connected with petitioner. I would therefore grant the petition to cancel respondent\u2019s registration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">I would, therefore, reverse the decision of the board dismissing the petition to cancel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
