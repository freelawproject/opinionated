A one-count indictment charged that appellant, while on board a United Stat<em>e</em>s New York Internation<em>al \u201cimparted </em>and c ed the fa]se information that he then and there had a bomb, which information concerned an attempt to do an act which would be a crime prohibited by title 18, U.S.C. Section 82, and which may formation the defendant knew to be false/. Appellant testified that he had used the word \u201cbomb\u201d as a colloquial expression for a marine sextant that he was carrying in a case,</p>\n<p id=\"Aar\">Appellant was sentenced to serve ten days with service of the remainder of a one year sentence suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqhn\">On a trial without a jury before District Judge Mishler, the court, on con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>flicting but sufficient evidence, made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApT\">\u201c2) While walking near the rear of the said plane defendant said to Ruth Raolo [the airline stewardess], or within her hearing, T have to sit near the back because I have a bomb.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqG\">\u201c3) After someone (unidentified) made a statement containing the phrase or expressed the thought of the \u2018tail blowing off,\u2019 defendant stated that he didn\u2019t care since he had plenty of insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amp\">\u201c5) The navigational sextant is not commonly referred to by seamen or anyone else as a \u2018bomb.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8j\">\u201c6) The reference in finding No. 3, concerning insurance, was knowingly and intentionally made to impart and convey the false information that the destructive force of the bomb would destroy the plane and end his life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVPM\">\u201c7) Defendant knowingly and intentionally imparted the false information that he was carrying a destructive and explosive substance referring to the wooden case holding the navigational sextant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction is without substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">It is contended that the statute abridges freedom of speech in violation of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">Both section 32 and an earlier form of section 35(a) were parts of Public Law 709 adopted July 14, 1956, entitled \u201cAN ACT to punish the willful damaging or destroying of aircraft or motor vehicles, and their facilities, and for other purposes.\u201d In amended form it constitutes Chapter 2 of Title 18 of the United States Code. Sections 32 and 35(a) are quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Section 32 deals with damaging or destroying aircraft, damaging or destroying aircraft parts with intent to damage \u25a0or destroy the aircraft, placing destructive substances on aircraft or parts with like intent, and damaging or placing destructive substances on aircraft facilities with like intent. Section 33 deals similarly with motor vehicles except that no act is made criminal unless done with intent to endanger, or with reckless regard for, human life.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Section 35(a), under consideration in this case, makes criminal the imparting of information, knowing the information to be false, concerning an attempt or an .alleged attempt being made or to be made to do any act which would be a crime prohibited by the chapter. Thus the statute would be violated by the imparting of knowingly false information with respect to an attempt about to be made to damage an aircraft in any way, irrespective of the saboteur\u2019s intent, or to damage a motor vehicle in any way, with intent to endanger the safety of any person on board.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">If the statute so far as it applied to .aircraft were limited to making criminal the imparting of false information with respect to the existence of a bomb on a loaded aircraft, there could be little doubt that the giving of the false information would be beyond the protection of the First Amendment. It would fall within the principle of the false cry of fire in a crowded theatre, the classic illustration of unprotected speech given by Mr. Justice Holmes in Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52, 39 S.Ct. 247, 63 U.Ed. 470. Such speech is characterized as a \u201cverbal act\u201d by Mr. Justice Lamar in Gompers v. Buck\u2019s Stove &amp; Range Co., 221 U.S. 418, 439, 31 S.Ct. 492, 55 L.Ed. 797, cited in the Schenck opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">As above indicated, however, the statute .goes much farther and, on its face, would make criminal the imparting of information known to be false that someone was about to destroy the motion picture screen on an out-of-service aircraft undergoing repairs in its hangar. Nevertheless we need not consider the question whether a provision of a statute denouncing that act in those terms would offend the First Amendment. As applied to the act of which appellant was found guilty, the act is clearly constitutional. The decision of the question whether the act is unconstitutional as applied to some other set of circumstances must be left for a case which raises that question. United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the statute is unconstitutionally vague in that its words permit conviction for innocent acts is answered in the same way. There is nothing vague about its application to the facts found by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Finally we are told that the indictment is defective as it omits an essential element of the crime. It will be remembered that section 35(a) makes criminal the imparting of false information concerning an attempt \u201cto do any act which would be a crime prohibited by this chapter.\u201d The indictment charges that the defendant, while on board an aircraft, \u201cimparted and conveyed the false information that he then and there had a bomb, which information concerned an attempt to do an act which would be a crime prohibited by Title 18, U.S.C. section 32, and which information the defendant knew to be false.\u201d Section 32, therein referred to, is part of the same chapter as section 35(a) and penalizes, among others, whoever willfully places any destructive substance in an aircraft \u201cwith intent to damage, destroy, disable, or wreck any such aircraft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The alleged defect in the indictment is that, while it stated that the imparted information concerned the placing of a destructive substance on an aircraft, it failed to state that it was a placing \u201cwith intent to damage, destroy, disable, or wreck\u201d the aircraft that the information concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">An information in this form was upheld by this court in United States v. Allen, 2 Cir., 317 F.2d 777. Counsel seeks to distinguish that case on the ground that section old 35, which was there concerned, differed from the present section 35(a) in that section old 35 penalized whoever \u201cwillfully\u201d imparted the false information, while section 35(a), which is otherwise identical, omits that word.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">We fail to understand why there is more need for alleging intent of the saboteur in a case where willfulness of the informer is no part of the crime than where the informer\u2019s willfulness is a necessary element. We hold that this court\u2019s decision in the Allen case is applicable here and we adhere to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AqFm\"> \u201c\u00a7 32.
