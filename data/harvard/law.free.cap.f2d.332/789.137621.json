United States, D.C.Mass., 1962, 202 F. Supp. 297, aff'd, 1 Cir., 1963, 312 F.2d 214, aff\u2019d, 1964, 84 S.Ct. 1236, and incorporated by reference in the opinion of Judge Levet below. However, as certiorari had been granted to review the decision of the First Circuit in that case, and since we had no new ideas to contribute, we decided to postpone our disposition of this appeal until after the Supreme Court decided the Eastern Gas case.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">Now that we have had an opportunity to examine the opinion of the Supreme. Court in Eastern Gas, 1964, 84 S.Ct. 1236,. we find that each of the arguments advanced here by Eastport has been considered and disposed of by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">Accordingly, the decree below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
