Such compositions, after being spread on the surface to be coated, are heat-cured to provide what is commonly known as \u201cbaked enamel\u201d finish.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-23\">Appellant\u2019s composition consists essentially of three parts: (1) resin, (2) neutralizing agent, and (3) water. The specification describes the resinous portion of the composition as \u201cintermolecular alkyd-epoxy complexes derived from alkyd materials and epoxidized derivatives of unsaturated compounds.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Typical acids used to make appellant\u2019s alkyds are \u201csaturated and unsaturated long chain fatty acids\u201d such as phthalic or maleic acids (or their anhydrides). Typical alcohols are butanediol and diethylene glycol. The neutralizing agent is ammonia or amines, defined infra.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>The essence of the invention is stated in the specification thus (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-4\">\u201cIt is still another object of the invention to provide improved water soluble, fatty acid modified resinous material wherein residual acidity, derived as a half-ester of a dibasic acid or anhydride thereof in a partially reacted condition, <em>is blocked temporarily, </em>but is <em>available for final reaction, </em>all in a water system, and is reactively associated with an oil based epoxy material, said material containing a water, soluble <em>organic inhibitor which retards the reaction until inactivated or driven off by heating </em>the composition upon final application as a film, which composition in the form of a cured film, is non-yellowing upon excessive aging, flexible, tough and has improved adherence to metal, glass and other surfaces.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">* * * * -X- -x-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABM\">\u201cFor producing inter molecular complexes * * * herein described * * * the processing involves two procedural parts as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">\u201cPart 1: In this part of the processing there is formed an oil-modified alkyd resin containing a mono-basic acid, a poly-basic acid or anhydride, and a polyol in which a second polybasic anhydride is reacted with the previously reacted mono-basic acid-poly-basic acid-polyol complex \u25a0so as to produce oil-modified resinous half ester material. These complexes are all of high acid * * * [number], with retention of a carboxyl group or groups which are reactive with epoxy groups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">\u201cPart 2: In the second part of the processing the oil-modified resinous-half ester complex material * * * is reacted with a long chain fatty \u25a0compound having internal oxirane [epoxy] oxygen. <em>This part of the reaction is not carried to completion, but is stopped by the addition of a neutralizing inhibitor and stabilizer, such as ammonia or an amine, preferably an alkyl amine, </em>wherein the alkyl radical contains 1 to 5 carbon atoms, for example triethyl amine. Further, in this part of the reaction, care is taken to guard against allowing the reaction between the complex of Part 1 and the epoxidized compound to go to completion, and to this end, the epoxidized compound and the inhibitor-neutralizer may be added step-wise in desired proportions on adequate stirring and cooling, because the reaction is exothermic. * \u2022\u00bb -x-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">* -x- -x- * * -x-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-11\">\u201cThe residual reactive neuclei [sic] of the complex remains blocked by the inhibitor-neutralizer, during storage and even in the completed paint or enamel. However, upon application as a film, and <em>upon heating, </em>the <em>inhibitor-neutralizer is driven off and a fluid reaction takes place in situ, </em>in the film. This reaction involves interreaction between neuclei [sic] of the alkyd-half ester and the epoxy compound, with resultant formation of the desired film having the aforesaid characteristics. This all takes place without fire hazard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">Claim 76 is representative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-13\">\u201c76. A water-soluble resinous composition comprising (1) a fatty oil modified alkyd resin (a) containing between 10% and 40% long chain fatty acid chains of 6 to 26 carbon atoms and (b) further modified with a polyearboxylic acid selected from the group consisting of polycarboxylic acids, polyearboxylic acid anhydrides and mixtures of the same in a partially reacted state having residual carboxyl groups of an acid value of about 40 to 120 and chemically combined through oxygen linkages with (2) a partially reacted long chain epoxidized fatty ester containing residual oxirane oxygen groups, each oxirane group forming a three-member heterogeneous ring with two adjacent carbon atoms within carbon chains, of about 8 to 26 carbon atoms, <em>the combination </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>having (1) an acid value of between about 40 and about 120, a water miscibleorganic coupling solvent, water, and (2) <em>a volatile neutralizing agent for said residual carboxyl groups temporarily inhibiting further reaction between the unreacted portions of said alkyd and the epoxidized ester compound.\u201d </em>[Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANj\">Claim 85 is drawn to a process of making appellant\u2019s composition, claim 88 to a \u201cpigmented composition\u201d containing appellant\u2019s resin. Insofar as is relevant to this appeal, claims 73-75 and 85 differ from claim 76 in reciting \u201cneutralizing agent\u201d rather than <em>\u201cvolatile </em>neutralizing agent\u201d (emphasis ours). Claims 79-84 and 88, like claim 76, recite \u201cvolatile neutralizing agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The sole ground of rejection of all claims is failure to comply with 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 in that, as the board held, they are <em>\u201cunduly broad </em>in the recital of the <em>neutralizing agent.\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours.) No prior art is cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The examiner\u2019s position, as stated in his answer, is as follows (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">\u201cThe specification discloses only certain basic amines as acid neutralizing agents. It is not evident that all acid neutralizing means such as poly-functional alcohols, epoxidized fatty esters and polyamines when employed to inhibit further reaction between the unreaeted portions of the alkyd and the epoxidized compound will produce a water dilutable coating vehicle composition. It is well known in the art that such polyfunctional \u2018acid neutralizing agents\u2019 form complex reaction products with alkyd resins containing residual carboxyl groups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-9\">\u00ab* * * the examiner remains of the opinion that these claimed [sic, claim?] terms [\u201cneutralizing agent,\u201d \u201cvolatile neutralizing agent\u201d] are <em>too broad and indefinite </em>and thus do not comply with the provisions of 35 U.S.C. 112 * * * The specification discloses only certain basic amines as acid neutralizing agents and the claims should be so limited. In regard to applicant\u2019s contention that functional terminology is permitted by 706.03(c) M.P.E.P. and 35 U.S.C. 112 in relationship to doing something with a step or means, that per se, is known to the art, or within the ability of one skilled in the art to provide equivalents, it is noted that paragraph 3 of section 112 makes no change in the established practice of rejecting claims as functional in situations such as the instant situation wherein the claims recite only a single means and thus encompass all possible means for preforming [sic] a desired function. 706.03(e) M.P.E.P.; Ex parte Bullock, 1907 C.D. 93.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">Though the board sustained the rejection, it did not agree with the examiner\u2019s reasoning with respect to \u201cfunctional terminology.\u201d It said (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-13\">\u201cThe neutralizing of the alkyd resin acid groups until use of the composition is an essential feature of the invention. Appellant is, in our view, entitled to claim this feature in terms which are of a scope commensurate with his disclosure. The claims before us go clearly beyond that scope. <em>Even if this essential feature could properly be functionally defined, the claims do not state the whole function. </em>There is, for example, nothing in claim 76 reproduced above which requires that the neutralizing agent be one that will be removed by baking at any <em>particular temperature. </em>The limitation to \u2018a <em>volatile\u2019 </em>neutralizing agent does not point out the temperature at which it is volatile, which might be well above the usable range of baking temperatures. We note also that * * * there is clear indication that there is criticality in this respect in the choice of the neutralizing agent. <em>We note that while the third paragraph of 85 U.S.C. 112 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>permits functional language it does not take precedence over the requirement in the second paragraph that the applicant particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter he regards as his invention. </em>We can see no justification in the present case for claims which define an essential part of the invention <em>in such broad terms </em>as those before us and will sustain the rejection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">We think the board\u2019s position is eminently clear1 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the sole issue before us is whether appellant\u2019s claims comply with the second paragraph of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The propriety of using so-called \u201cfunctional\u201d language to define combinations, is not disputed<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> since, as the solicitor notes in his brief,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">\u201cThe Board * * * recognized that functional language may be permitted by the third paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112, but the decision expressly states that the rejection is based upon the second paragraph of that section. Hence, the contention that functional claiming is not per se objectionable lacks relevance to the issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">We consider then the question of whether the claims are \u201cunduly broad\u201d so as not to \u201cparticularly point out and distinctly claim\u201d the invention. Appellant\u2019s brief says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">\u201c * * * applicant lists a number of suitable neutralizing agents, including \u2018ammonia, monoethanol amine, diethanol amine, morpholine, dipropyl amine, and di-isopropyl amine\u2019 * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">\u201cAny chemist, upon reading appellant\u2019s description would be fully informed in respect of the agents which are to be used for the purpose. The same is true in respect of the temperatures at which the neutralizing agent is volatile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-15\">Our review of appellant\u2019s disclosure makes it clear that the invention is a combination of chemical materials, one of which is a \u201cneutralizing agent\u201d for temporarily tieing up residual carboxyl groups to prevent them from reacting with residual epoxy groups prior to heat-curing. The neutralizing agent must perform not only a \u201cneutralizing\u201d function but must also be a material capable of being volatilized at resin curing temperatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-16\"> In the absence of prior art, we must assume that the concept of temporarily blocking acid groups of alkyd-epoxy complexes with volatile neutralizing agents prior to heat curing is new. This is a broad invention and, as noted by the board, appellant is entitled to claims commensurate with the disclosure. In re Sus, 306 F.2d 494, 49 CCPA 1301. Accordingly, we believe that appellant\u2019s disclosure, even though of a limited class of \u201cvolatile neutralizing agents,\u201d is sufficient to justify claims-which define broadly a <em>volatile </em>neutralizing agent. Use of this term is commensurate with the breadth of the invention as disclosed. We think any chemist skilled in this art is fully apprised by appellant\u2019s disclosure of what the invention is and is taught how to use it. Appellant need not disclose every operative \u201cvolatile neutralizing agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-17\">We cannot agree with the board that the claims must recite at what temperature the neutralizing agent is volatile. Any temperature \u201ccriticality\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>to which the board alludes relates to <em>operativeness </em>of the agent and it is well settled that claims need not expressly exclude <em>possibly </em>inoperative examples. See In re Sarett, 327 F.2d 1005, 1019, 51 CCPA. Thus we reverse the rejection of those claims which specify that the neutralizing agent be \u201cvolatile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6g\">We agree with the board, however, that the claims which recite \u201cneutralizing agent\u201d broadly without saying it is volatile do not comply with 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. Volatility is of the essence and in our opinion must be recited to \u201cstate the whole function\u201d of the neutralizing agent</p>\n<p id=\"Al0\">The rejection of claims 73-75 and 85 is affirmed; the rejection of claims 76, 79-84 and 88 is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aygd\">Modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-16\">. Alkyds are synthetic resins made by reacting mono- or poly-basic acids with polyhydric alcohols. Appellant\u2019s alkyds are made by a first acid-alcohol reaction followed by subsequent reaction of the resultant product with a \u201csecond polybasic anhydride.\u201d This produces a complex of high acid number, i. e., containing a large number of unreacted carboxyl groups, which groups are reactive to epoxy groups.</p>\n<p id=\"AKbT\">Epoxy materials are made by partial oxidation of unsaturated long chain oils to</p>\n<p id=\"ASN\">/\u00b0\\ form oxirane (epoxy) groups (-C-C-). Such groups, highly reactive to carboxylic acid groups, provide the mechanism for cross-linking long chain acids with long chain oils.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b438-10\"><em>. </em>Appellant devotes a substantial portion of Ms brief to arguing (1) that functional language in claims is not <em>ipso facto </em>bad and (2) that the term \u201cneutralizing\u2019\u2019 is not \u201cindefinite\u201d in the context of his disclosure. We consider both points moot since the board apparently agrees with appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b438-18\">. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, second paragraph, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6_\">\u201cThe specification shall conclude with one or more claims <em>particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming </em>the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b438-20\">.
