Since it is our view that the-board\u2019s decision must be affirmed on the latter ground, neither the subject matter nor the rejection on prior art requires-discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-23\">Public Law 380, in pertinent part, provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-24\"><em>\u201cSec. 3. </em>Nationals of Germany and Japan may hereafter apply for and obtain patents in the United States for their inventions in accordance with the patent laws and enjoy the rights and privileges thereof: * * * And provided further, That, except for patents based on applications filed in the United States Patent Office prior to the date of enactment of this Act, patents may not be applied for or obtained, or if obtained, shall not be-valid, <em>for any invention </em>made, or upon which an application was filed by any such national, before Jan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>uary 1, 1946, in Germany or Japan or in the territory of any other of the Axis Powers or in any territory occupied by the Axis forces. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayk\">The board briefly, and we think correctly, found the facts to be as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApG5\">\u201cIt appears from the record that while living in Germany W. A. Cauer, the herein named inventor, made certain notes concerning the instant device, but did nothing more in respect to said device, prior to January 1, 1946, the critical date stated in the aforementioned proviso. There is nothing in the record to denote Cauer as anything other than a German national. The notes were carried out of Germany by another, eventually to develop into the present application. Cauer himself was killed prior to January 1, 1946.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APz\">In deciding whether Cauer s invention was \u201cmade * * *, before January 1, 1946\u201d within the meaning of the statute, ,, , , , ,, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASK\">\u201cAs we see it, the making of an invention is synonymous with the completion of such invention, and the usual meaning in patent parlance for completion of an invention embraces a conception thereof, and a reduction to practice, either actual or constructive. On such a basis, appellant argues that since there was here no reduction to practice prior to January 1, 1946, there was no invention made prior to this date, and therefore nothing to be prohibited by the Statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADK\">\u201cWe are not able to agree that the term in question, as used in the involved proviso of Section 3 of Pub-lie Law 380, would have the meaning argued for by appellant, when \u2022consideration is given to the purpose \u25a0of this proviso as evidenced by the intent of its framers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A85\">\u201cIn the Report of the Committee \u25a0on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives in connection with Public Law 380 (80th Congress, 1st</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApZD\">Session, House Report No. 1060, page 3) the following appears in ex-planation of said proviso of Section 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auy\">\u201c \u2018in addition, section 3 provides that patents may not be obtained *n the United States for invenade before January 1' 1946\u2018. Enactment of such a pro-\u201c considered necessary since Pravent the patenting here of inventions made by Germans and Japanese during the war m fact\u2019 of ab <em>m^l0Da </em>mad\u00ae before January 1, 1946 many of which were brouSbt to this country by and were made available and given freely to the American public. A similar law has been enacted in Great Britain.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC-E\">Similar language appears in the corresponding Senate Report (80th Congress, 1st Session, Senate Report 728, page 3) \u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atk\">... . .. As is well known, upon the cessa,. \u201e , . , w ,, tion of actual hostilities of World War II, much information including mere writings or inventive comcepts was collected by official per-sonnel from various repositories in Germany, for example, and made available to the American public, as through the Office of Technical Services. The above quotation from the House Report would appear to denote as a clear motivation for the proviso of concern the protection of those members of said public acting on freely given inventive con-cepts. With this as motivation, it seems clear to us that said proviso was intended to cover mere conception, and thus the notes made by Cauer would fall under the proseriptions thereof. That such notes must have been sufficient to constitute a proper conception would follow if they are to be considered as enough as the basis for the instant application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzSU\">Appellants state that the board \u201cad-mitted that if the words <em>invention mode </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>are used in the same sense that patent lawyers use them, that [sic] the statute does not bar the present application.\u201d They argue that the board erred in holding that the intent of the framers of the act was not to use those words in that sense, and contend instead that \u201cthe phrase \u2018invention made\u2019 was actually used with the <em>usual </em>meaning in patent parlance by patent lawyer framers.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under such circumstances, appellants contend, \u201cthe Board concedes that there is \u2018nothing to be prohibited by the statute.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\"> We do not regard it as significant whether \u201cpatent lawyers,\u201d who obviously would realize that the term \u201cinvention made\u201d might sometimes be used in specific situations in patent practice as indicating a reduction to practice, suggested that term in connection with the ' consideration of Public Law 380 by Congress. Our only concern is what Congress intended by enacting Section 3 of Public Law 380, i. e., what that Act sought to accomplish. We think the board correctly analyzed the Act as having as an objective the protection of those members of the public who might act on those writings or inventive concepts collected from various repositories in Germany and Japan that were made available after the cessation of actual hostilities of World War II. The term \u201cinvention made\u201d cannot be given an interpretation inconsistent with that objective, as the interpretation advanced by appellants would. Rather, it must be construed in the general and less technical sense necessary to include \u201cinventions\u201d of the type made available to the American public as described in the Committee Report quoted by the board <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> without regard to whether they were <em>reduced to practice </em>before January 1, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Appellants additionally suggest that Cauer was not a \u201cGerman national\u201d because the German Government \u201cdeclined to consider\u201d him such. However, appellants\u2019 oath in the application describes him as \u201clate a citizen of Germany and a resident of Gross-Berlin, Germany.\u201d Appellants have not established in this record that Cauer was not a German national, thus we can only regard him as one of those subject to the provisions of Section 3 of Public Law 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\">. In support of the contention that <em>\u201cpatent lawyer </em>experts of the Patent Office itself\u201d were actually the \u201cframers\u201d of the phrase \u201cinvention made,\u201d appellants refer to certain documents in a file of the Commissioner of Patents on Public Law 380. Those documents are not part of the record here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ACJ\">. It is apparent that the Act does not attempt to differentiate between \u201cinventions\u201d on the basis of whether they were actually brought into this country.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
