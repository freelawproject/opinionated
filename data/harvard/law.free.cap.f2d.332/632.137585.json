The defendant objected to the jurisdiction of the court and moved to quash the service of summons and dismiss the action on the ground that it was not \u201cdoing business\u201d within the state so as to be amenable to process by service upon the Secretary of State of Oklahoma, as provided for in 18 O.S.1961 \u00a7 1.204a. This is an appeal from an order sustaining the objection to the jurisdiction and dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"Aab\">The article upon which the alleged libel is predicated is the same as was involved in Walker v. General Features Corp., 10 Cir., 319 F.2d 583. Field Enterprises, Inc. is the publisher of the Chicago Daily News which supplied the column to the General Features Corporation, which in turn furnished it to the Oklahoma City Times. Appellee\u2019s other activities which appellant urges constitute \u201cdoing business\u201d include: sending 26 copies of daily newspapers by mail to subscribers in Oklahoma; sending syndicated material by wire or mail to nine newspapers in Oklahoma; sending a representative through Oklahoma twice a year for two or three days to contact customers and prospective purchasers mix and having a reporter m Tulsa for about a week m early 1962 to cover a seminar wholly unrelated to the article involved in this ease The annellee is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of busmess m Chicago, Illinois; it is not v icensed to do business m Oklahoma and has no registered agent for service of process there; it has no property, office, telephone, agents or reporters there, and a representative who- passes through twice a year has no control over the ma tenal sold nor the customers purchasing or using it; no accounts are collected m All. Oklahoma as all are paid by check <em>i</em>n Chicago; and no contracts are made nor is any advertising solicited m Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"AoM\"> The question of whether the activity of the defendant constitutes \u201cdoing business\u201d for j\u2019urisdictional purposes depends upon state or local law. Analagous circumstances and the applicable state law were considered in Walker v. General Features Corp., supra, in which it was held that General Features Corp. was not doing business within the state of Oklahoma that would authorize service upon the Oklahoma Secretary of State under 18 O.S.1961 \u00a7 1.204a. On the authority of that case and the Oklahoma authorities cited therein, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
