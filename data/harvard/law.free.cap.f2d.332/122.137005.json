The complaint is cast in the form of a petition for declaratory judgment under Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 and is in two counts. It challenges action of the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\u2022on Waivers and Forfeitures affirmed by the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals forfeiting pension benefits under laws administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration for fraud as provided in Title 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503(a). The first count alleges facts which it is asserted disclose an error in the application of pertinent law. In the second count the appellant seeks a \u2022declaration that she \u201cwas deprived of her \u2022constitutional and civil rights\u201d by the illegal seizure and use of evidence against her and by the intimidation and physical assault upon her by an agent of the Administrator of Veterans\u2019 Affairs and a \u2022declaration that she had been deprived of \u2022due process of law because of inade\u2022quacies of administrative hearing procedures. Wherefore as relief the plaintiff seeks a declaration that the administrative action forfeiting her pension rights for fraud is null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Regardless of its form the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s suit is in clear purpose and effect one to have reviewed and set aside an order of the Veterans\u2019 Administration termininating pension benefits theretofore paid to her. But Title 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a) provides with exceptions of no present materiality that \u201c * * decisions of the Administrator on any question of law or fact concerning a claim for benefits or payments under any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration shall be final and conclusive and no other official or any court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review any such decision.\u201d This command is categorical, and it is within the power of Congress to issue the command for when it creates rights in an individual against the United States it is \u201cunder no obligation to provide a remedy through the courts\u201d, United States v. Babcock, 250 U.S. 328, 331, 39 S.Ct. 464, 465, 63 L.Ed. 1011 (1919), but may \u201cprovide only an administrative remedy.\u201d Tutun v. United States, 270 U.S. 568, 576, 46 S.Ct. 425, 70 L.Ed. 738 (1926). See Marshall v. Crotty, 185 F.2d 622, 628 (C.A.1, 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Moreover, veterans\u2019 benefits are gratuities and establish no vested rights in the recipients so that they may be withdrawn by Congress at any time and under such conditions as Congress may impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">We affirm on Van Horne v. Hines, 74 App.D.C. 214, 122 F.2d 207, cert. denied, 314 U.S. 689, 62 S.Ct. 360, 86 L.Ed. 552 (1941); Sinlao v. United States, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 263, 271 F.2d 846 (1959) and Barefield v. Byrd, 320 F.2d 455 (C.A.5, 1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 928, 84 S.Ct. 675, 11 L.Ed.2d 624 (1964), and eases cited. Wellman v. Whittier, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 6, 259 F.2d 163 (1958), on which the appellant relies, is quite different in its facts and is readily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">Judgment will be entered affirming the order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
