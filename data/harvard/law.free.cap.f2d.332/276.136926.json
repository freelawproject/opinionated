The Pennsylvania rested its claim to priority on the alternative theories that its share of amounts collected by the motor carrier from shippers constituted trust funds, and that since the traffic balances accrued between March 1, 1962 and the filing of the petition on May 11, 1962, they deserved priority under the so-called \u201csix months rule\u201d enunciated in Fosdick v. Schall, 99 U.S. 235, 25 L.Ed. 339 (1879).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-21\">As to the trust fund theory, we have nothing to add to Judge Feinberg\u2019s excellent discussion, 222 F.Supp. at 572. Although we accept the Pennsylvania\u2019s position that Chicago Express was a connecting carrier with the Pennsylvania and not a shipper over it, this, without more, did not create a duty on the part of Chicago Express to hold amounts due to the Pennsylvania in trust or make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>relationship other than that of debtor and creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">As to the claim for priority based on the six-months rule we think it unnecessary to determine whether and, if so, under what circumstances and to what extent that rule might apply to a motor carrier in an equity receivership or a proceeding for reorganization under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act. For the rule can have no application in a proceeding under Chapter XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">To begin with, despite some statements that claims protected by the six-months rule constitute \u201cequitable liens,\u201d Larsen v. New York Dock Co., 166 F.2d 687, 689 (2 Cir. 1948) ; Southern Ry. Co. v. Flournoy, 301 F.2d 847, 854 (4 Cir. 1962), it was made clear in New York Dock Co. v. S.S. Poznan, 274 U.S. 117, 121, 47 S.Ct. 482, 484, 71 L.Ed. 955 (1927), that the preferences given such claims by courts of equity were \u201cnot to be explained in terms of equitable liens in the technical sense, as is the case with agreements that particular property shall be applied as security for the satisfaction of particular obligations or vendors\u2019 liens and the like * * but \u201cresult rather from the self-imposed duty of the court * * to require that expenses which have contributed either to the preservation or creation of the fund in its custody shall be paid before a general distribution among those entitled to receive it,\u201d even, in appropriate instances, out of the earnings or proceeds of mortgaged property. See the discussion in Cutcheon, Recent Developments in Federal Railroad Foreclosure Procedure, Ass\u2019n of the Bar of the City of New York, Some Legal Phases of Corporate Financing, Reorganization and Regulation, 1926-30, pp. 105-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Priorities under the Bankruptcy Act are a creature of statute. 3 Collier, Bankruptcy, 2061 (1961 ed.). Congress has enacted different provisions with respect to priorities for the various types of proceedings authorized by the Act. For ordinary bankruptcy the controlling provision is \u00a7 64. In \u00a7 77, relating to-railroad reorganizations, subdivision (b) provides that \u201cunsecured claims, which would have been entitled to priority if a receiver in equity of the property of the debtor had been appointed by a Federal court on the day of the approval of the petition, shall be entitled to such priority and the holders of such claims shall be treated as a separate class or classes of creditors\u201d; plainly this includes the rule-of Fosdick v. Schall. See 5 Collier, Bankruptcy, \u00b6 77.21 (1962). In Chapter X, relating to corporate reorganizations,. Congress in \u00a7 102 ruled out the application of \u00a7 64, and provided in \u00a7 115 that the court \u201cshall have and may, in addition to the jurisdiction, powers, and duties hereinabove and elsewhere in this chapter conferred and imposed upon it, exercise all the powers, not inconsistent. with the provisions of this chapter, which a court of the United States would have if it had appointed a receiver in equity of the property of the debtor on the ground of insolvency or inability to. meet its-debts as they mature.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In contrast, \u00a7\u2022 302 subjects priority questions in Chapter XI proceedings to the rules stated in \u00a7 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">The Pennsylvania may therefore prevail only if it can bring its claim within one of the classes enumerated by that section.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The only one contended to be pertinent is \u00a7 64, sub. a (5) according priority to \u201cdebts owing to any person, including the United States, who by laws of the United States is entitled to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the priority, and rent owing to a landlord who is entitled to priority by applicable State law * * subject to a limitation as to the latter therein provided; it is contended that the equitable doctrine of Fosdick v. Schall is a \u201claw of the United States\u201d within that provision. The issue, although reminiscent of the great debates over the meaning of \u201c[T]he laws of the several states\u201d in \u00a7 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. '92, see Swift v. Tyson, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.) 1, 10 L.Ed. 865 (1842); Erie R. R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); and of the \u201claws of the United States\u201d in the Act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470, see Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U.S. 354, 79 S.Ct. 468, 3 L.Ed.2d 368 (1959), is much more readily resolved. As the section stood in the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, 30 Stat. 563, it referred to \u201cdebts owing to any person who by the laws of the States or the United States is entitled to priority.\u201d It seems altogether plain that under the philosophy of Swift v. Tyson <em>then </em>prevailing, Congress thought that \u201claws\u201d meant statutes, not doctrines judicially evolved. Had the reference to the \u201claws\u201d of the United States been intended to import the six-months rule for certain industries into \u00a7 64, this would have created a strange and unexplained conflict with the general three-month priority for wages, limited to three hundred dollars per claimant, which was established by \u00a7 64, sub. b(4), now \u00a7 64, sub. a (2). Furthermore, railroad corporations, the prime instance of application of the \u201csix-months rule,\u201d have been wholly excluded from the general provisions of the Bankruptcy Act since 1910, 36 Stat. 839, and they cannot invoke Chapter XI, \u00a7 306(3). If additional support for a construction excluding federal decisional law from \u00a7 64, sub. a (5) were needed, this might be found in the contrast drawn under the 1938 amendment, 52 Stat. 874, which, generally deleting priorities under \u201cthe laws of the States\u201d, continued to give priority to \u201cdebts owing to any person, including the United States, who by the <em>laws </em>of the United States in [is] entitled to priority,\u201d and for \u201crent owing to a landlord who is entitled to priority by applicable State <em>law\u201d; </em>to twentieth century ears, the singular, \u201claw,\u201d is more apt to include judge-made law than the plural. However, in view of the lack of authoritative construction of the last quoted phrase, see 3 Collier, Bankruptcy, 2238 fn. 14, we think it best to leave that issue open.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\">. The predecessor of Chapter X, \u00a7 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, was considerably more specific with respect to priorities; it provided, in subdivision b (10), priority for \u201cunsecured claims which would have been entitled to priority over existing mortgages if a receiver in equity of the property of the debtor had been appointed by a Federal court on the day of the approval of the petition or answer under this section * * 48 Stat. 915 (1934). This substantially followed the language of \u00a7 77 sub. c as originally enacted. 47 Stat. 1477 (1933).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b330-12\">.
