Jackson, in answer to questions by the State\u2019s Attorney of Peoria County, James P. Kellstedt, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGNH\">\u201cQ.

No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQfx\">\u201cQ. And you have talked to the , people several times haven t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab0\"><em>A. </em>Yes Sir. \"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADnt\">cross-examination by petitioner\u2019s attorney&gt; Jackson answered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4sl\"><em>\u2018 </em>Q- And when you talked to the sheriff&gt; y\u00b0u say now that neither he nor the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, nor the investigator, nor the State\u2019s Attorney made any promises what-soever?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajs\">\u201cA. No, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar_c\">\u201cQ. And you don\u2019t expect any, do you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP_\">\u201cA. No, Sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AY5b\">Petitioner was found guilty and senfenced to the Illinois State Penitentiary for a term of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"ATW\">Jackson entered a plea of guilty to the same indictment, one day after petitioner was *ouna guilty, and was sentenced to the Illinois State Penitentiary for a term of not less than fifteen nor more than twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"Absm\">T ^In December, 1957, Jackson filed a pe4, , . ,. . . ,, tition for post conviction hearing alleg- .. . , . , ,. . , mg that his testimony against petitioner, as hereinabove set out, was in response to a promise from Kellstedt that he (Jackson) would receive a sentence of from five to seven years,</p>\n<p id=\"A7Z\">Accompanying Jackson\u2019s petition were three documents entitled \u201caffidavits.\u201d Fred W. Montgomery, sheriff of Peoria County, testified at Jackson\u2019s post con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>vietion hearing that he had received these three documents in the mail from Jackson, addressed to himself, Kellstedt and Edward J. Connor, the victim of the alleged robbery. These documents stated, in essence, that Kellstedt promised, in the presence of Montgomery and Jaekson, that Jackson would receive a five to seven year sentence if he would testify against petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Montgomery testified that he signed the document addressed to him and that the contents of the document were true.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Kellstedt testified that he did not recall reading or signing the document addressed to him but that it contained his signature. He stated that he did not make any promises to Jackson and that the statements in the document were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Jackson\u2019s post conviction plea was denied and his petition for relief was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">On September 22, 1959, petitioner filed a petition for post conviction hearing in the Circuit Court of Peoria County, alleging violation of his constitutional rights due to the knowing use of perjured testimony by the State of Illinois in obtaining his conviction. Petitioner was represented by court appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">This petition was denied and dismissed. On or about September 29,1960, the Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed. The United States Supreme Court denied! certiorari. Wilson v. Illinois, 3\u201966 U.S.. 912, 81 S.Ct. 1087, 6 L.Ed.2d 237 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-15\">Thereafter, petitioner filed the instant, petition for writ of habeas corpus in. the district court. He was represented by counsel of his own choice at a hearing in which Jackson, Connor and Kellstedt testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-16\">Jackson testified that Kellstedt promised him a five to seven year sentence in return for his testimony against petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-17\">Kellstedt denied promising Jackson \u201cany specific sentence.\u201d He stated that \u201cit was implicit in his [Jackson\u2019s] cooperation we would attempt to get a lesser sentence than perhaps if he had been, tried and convicted.\u201d Kellstedt said that, he signed the document without reading-it.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-18\">Connor testified that he was not aware-of any promise to Jackson for his testimony. He stated that he signed the document without reading it and that the-statements contained therein were not. true.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-19\">Petitioner was personally present at. his hearing and did not testify in support of the allegations in his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-20\">The district court refused to allow the-documents signed by Connor and Kellstedt to be admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-21\">The district court made findings of\" fact and conclusions of law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entered' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>/judgment against petitioner and dismissed the petition for writ of habeas \u25a0corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\">The issues before us on appeal are whether the finding of the district court that petitioner\u2019s conviction was not based on perjured testimony is clearly erron\u25a0eous; and, whether the district court committed reversible error in excluding from evidence the signed documents of 'Connor and Kellstedt.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">The Supreme Court in Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 1177, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959) stated, \u201cThe principle that a State may not knowingly use false evidence, including false testi.mony, to obtain a tainted conviction, implicit in any concept of ordered liberty, does not cease to apply merely because the false testimony goes only to the credibility of the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">The burden of proving that testimony was false and that it was knowingly and intentionally used by the State is on petitioner. United States ex rel. Rooney v. Ragen, 7 Cir., 158 F.2d 346, 4351 (1947), cert. denied, 331 U.S. 842, 67 S.Ct. 1532, 91 L.Ed. 1853.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">The district court found that petition\u2022er failed to sustain this burden and we \u25a0cannot set this finding aside unless we \u2022are convinced that it is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">The testimony was conflicting on this issue. The district court observed \u2022the witnesses and, giving due regard to its opportunity to judge their credibility .and weigh the evidence, we hold the district court\u2019s finding on this issue was not \u25a0clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">Petitioner alleges that the district court\u2019s ruling that the documents signed by Connor and Kellstedt were not admissible in evidence was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\">Even assuming these documents (which were not sworn to) qualified as affidavits, we have held that they would not be admissible as evidence on the merits in a habeas corpus hearing. United States ex rel. Rooney v. Ragen, 158 F.2d at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-16\">Petitioner contends, alternatively, that these documents should have been admitted for the limited purpose of impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-17\">Connor and Kellstedt, at the hearing in the district court, admitted they had signed the documents and testified concerning their contents. These admissions were evidence for impeachment purposes and the admission of the documents would have added nothing new. There was no dispute as to the contents of the documents and petitioner was not prejudiced by the ruling of the district court. No reversible error was committed by their exclusion. Ditrich v. United States, 10 Cir., 243 F.2d 729, 731 (1957); 58 Am.Jur., Witnesses, \u00a7 780, at 430 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-18\">In sum, it is clear that petitioner sought and was granted a complete hearing in the district court. He was personally present and was represented by private counsel. Witnesses were present and testified, although petitioner did not avail himself of this privilege. The trial court made appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law. There was no prejudicial error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-19\">The order of the district court dismissing petitioner\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-9\">. \u201cFINDINGS OF FACT.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-10\">\u201c1.
