The contention that no act of the appellant was proved within the statutory period of six years is not controlling since there was ample evidence of appellant\u2019s connection with the conspiracy less than a month before the critical date of February 1, 1957, and there was no evidence to show that his connection with it had ended prior to the occasion of the overt acts which occurred within the statutory period. See Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489.</p>\n<p id=\"A2yq\">There is no merit in the contention while charged with participation in a single conspiracy dealing with separate stills, the proof showed two separate conspiracies. There were several distinct threads running through the actions of the parties m connection with all of the stills and this was sufficient to warrant submission to the jury of the question whether there wag sin le conspiracy embracing all four stills.</p>\n<p id=\"AlsB\">The judgment is affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
