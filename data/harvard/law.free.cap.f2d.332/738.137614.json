Post filed his habeas corpus petition and, after a plenary hearing, he was denied relief. The District Court prepared a comprehensive opinion which is reported as Post v. Boles, 218 F.Supp. 658 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">It is of historical interest that Post applied to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals for habeas corpus relief in 1961. His application was summarily denied. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded the case for hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals then appointed counsel for Post and proceeded to a determination of his contentions on the basis of affidavits and stipulations of facts. That court concluded that Post was advised by the Circuit Court of Roane County of his right to counsel before pleading to the indictments; that he competently waived the right; that he was fully informed of the possible consequences of his guilty pleas and that he received a fair hearing in accordance with the requirements of due process of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court of the United States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The District Court first denied Post\u2019s habeas corpus petition without holding a hearing, concluding that disposition of Post\u2019s contentions had been made by the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals after full and fair consideration. Shortly thereafter, following announcement of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), the District Court recalled this case, appointed counsel for Post and held a plenary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">It is unnecessary to fully restate here certain matters mentioned and discussed by the court below. Post\u2019s early years, during which he was incorrigible and a serious disciplinary problem to his foster parents, his commitment to a West Virginia Mental Hospital and escapes therefrom, his conviction of a felony upon his plea of guilty when represented by court-appointed counsel, his confinement for that offense in the West Virginia Penitentiary for about six years, his release on parole only about three months before he \u201cembarked on the criminal spree for which he is now incarcerated,\u201d the proceedings in the state court at the time of his arraignment and sentencing are noted by the District Court in its opinion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and should be read in connection herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-15\">The principal question presented on this appeal is whether Post intelligently and deliberately waived his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel in the state court proceedings. The District Court found as facts that he was offered counsel, that he declined the offer and that his waiver of assistance of counsel was deliberately, understanding^ and intelligently made.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-16\">As stated by the District Court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-17\">\u201c * * * even prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, it was clear that Post had a constitutional right to the assistance of counsel before being called upon to answer these numerous, serious and complex charges. Uveges v. [Commonwealth of] Pennsylvania, 335 U.S. 437, 69 S.Ct. 184, 93 L.Ed. 127, and [Commonwealth of] Pennsylvania ex rel. Herman v. Claudy, 350 U.S. 116, 76 S.Ct. 223, 100 L.Ed. 126, make that plain. It is true, also, that \u2018where the right to counsel is of such critical importance as to be an element of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment, a finding of waiver is not lightly to be made.\u2019 Brennan, J., in Moore v. Michigan, 355 U.S. 155 at 161, 78 S.Ct. 191 at 195, 2 L.Ed.2d 167. It has often been stated that the constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>right to counsel may be waived only if the accused knows of the right and deliberately and intentionally abandons it. See, e. g., United States v. Lavelle, 306 F.2d 216 (2 Cir., 1962).\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">The District Court, after determining that Post had been advised by the presiding judge of his right to court-appointed counsel, correctly noted that Post had the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he did not intelligently and understandingly waive such right; <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> further, that whether a waiver of counsel is understandingly and competently made \u201cis a question of fact to be decided with reference to the particular facts of each case.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The proceedings in the state court wex\u2019e not reported and the District Judge indicated his familiarity with this unfortunate but customary practice in the state courts of West Virginia. Only the formal orders showing Post\u2019s appearance <em>without </em>counsel, his arraignment, plea and sentence in each ease were available. The presiding state court judge is deceased, the then Prosecuting Attorney is incapacitated and the Clerk of the state court, now ill, retired and living in Mississippi, was not available as a witness at Post\u2019s hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Post testified that at no time before or during the state court proceedings was he offered the assistance of counsel and that there was no mention of counsel to him. This testimony was rejected by the court below. Mr. Scott, who was called as a witness for the respondent warden, testified that he was then the Assistant Prosecuting Attorney (now the Prosecuting Attorney) of Roane County; that he assisted in the preparation of the indictments against Post; that he was present in court during the proceedings in question; that the judge followed his usual practice of advising defendants of their right to counsel; that the judge, in his preliminary remarks to Post, included statements to the effect that Post was charged with a number of serious crimes and that the rape charge <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> carried a possible death sentence; that the judge asked Post if he had counsel and if he wanted counsel and Post replied, decisively, that he did not desire an attorney but wanted to plead guilty; that each indictment was then read to Post and he was asked to plead thereto; that Post\u2019s codefendant,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> who was arraigned after Post was remanded to jail, was represented by counsel <em>appointed by the court. </em>The District Court stated: \u201c * * * It is quite clear that the late Judge of the Circuit Court of Roane County made an offer of counsel to Post in unequivocal terms, and the latter declined the offer in a similar vein.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There was introduced in evidence a detailed narrative statement, in Post\u2019s handwriting, of the events and exploits of the month preceding the arrest of Post and his companion. The statement was signed by Post and, according to the accx-edited testimony of the jailor, was prepaxmd by Post, after he requested that he be supplied with pencil and tablet, while he was confined in jail and before he was indicted. Post testified that this statement, which fully disclosed the commission of the offenses (except rape) with which he was subsequently charged, was written by him at the direction of, and as dictated by, the jailor. Post\u2019s testimony in this regard was rejected by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>the court as incredible. Indeed, it was clear that the statement could only have been prepared by one with full knowledge of the facts recited therein. Post further testified that he was informed by the jailor that he would probably be sentenced to no more than ten years if he should plead guilty. The jailor emphatically denied making any such statement or representation and the court concluded that Post\u2019s statement was untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">In connection with the finding, as fact, that Post\u2019s waiver of the assistance of counsel was competently and intelligently made, the District Court had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqL\">\u201cThe record in this case reveals an individual who was ready, willing, and even anxious to face the consequences of a wild fling at lawlessness. Post\u2019s representations that he was not aware of his right to counsel do not impress the court. And no significant factor appears in the record from which it can be inferred that Post had any hidden doubt as to whether he should interpose an attorney between himself and a prompt liquidation of his criminal liability. Further, in spite of Post's previous mental condition, the evidence showed that he was acutely sensible of his predicament. He was described by all witnesses as appearing normal and lucid. His tolerably literate confessional statement discloses no hint of abnormality. On the contrary, it shows normal feelings of remorse and a not-unnatural concern for and desire to exculpate Peggy Ann Hosey, with whom Post was emotionally attached. That concern was reiterated in open court when the Judge asked Post if there was anything he wished to say prior to the imposition of sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The court had the opportunity to closely observe Post as he testified and to form an opinion as to whether he was worthy of belief. Having found that Post\u2019s testimony with reference to the preparation of his written statement and the alleged conversation with the jailor was false, it is not surprising that the court should view Post\u2019s testimony as a whole with great suspicion. While the court made no specific findings concerning other portions of Post\u2019s testimony to the effect that he was unaware of the nature of the charges against him before being brought into court, it was shown in the evidence that Post had been visited in jail by his foster parents and by a minister, that he had read newspaper accounts of his sensational exploits, capture and arrest and that he had been taken before a Justice of the Peace for a preliminary hearing. Even Post would not say that he was not informed by the Justice of the Peace of the charges against him. When interrogated, he answered: \u201cI don\u2019t recall specifically.\u201d We have carefully examined the transcript of Post\u2019s testimony and we have been unable to find any direct and positive assertion by him that he was unaware of his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel. The principal complaint seems to be that he did not have counsel and that the court did not inquire as to whether he wanted counsel. In fact, it appears from the record below that Post was proceeding on the theory that proof of the fact that he was not represented by counsel in the state court, and that fact alone, would be sufficient to discharge his burden to prove violation of his constitutional rights. It was only after the court had indicated its disagreement with such theory that Post was then further interrogated by his own counsel and he testified that there was no inquiry by the sentencing judge with regard to representation by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">In Aiken v. United States, 296 F.2d 604 (4 Cir. 1961), a federal prisoner sought post conviction relief under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 on the ground that his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel had been violated at the time of the entry of his plea of guilty under Rule 20, F.R.Crim.P., in that his waiver of counsel was not intelligently made. The District Court before which the plea was entered failed to inform the prisoner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>of the possible sentence to which he would be exposed on a plea of guilty. In fact, the record disclosed that the court made no inquiry of the prisoner other than to ask if he had been furnished with copies of the indictments and if he was familiar with the charges therein. Notwithstanding the fact that this court, speaking through Chief Judge Sobeloif, undertook to point out instructively to the trial courts the minimum inquiry which should be made before permitting an accused to waive his right to counsel, it was held under the circumstances there present that Aiken had not sustained the burden of showing that he did not understand his constitutional rights and that his waiver of counsel was not competently and intelligently made. \u201cA failure to fully perform this duty [the duty to interrogate and advise the accused before permitting a waiver of counsel] does not, however, automatically render the proceedings unconstitutional.\u201d 296 F.2d 604, 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">We must accept the District Court\u2019s findings and conclusions unless we can say that they are clearly erroneous. Post\u2019s testimony with respect to matters material was in conflict with other testimony and it was for the court to apply the usual and accepted credibility tests and to evaluate the conflicting testimony in a search for truth. We are not prepared to reject the findings as clearly erroneous or question the determination that Post failed to carry the burden of proving his allegations by a preponderance of the evidence. The Supreme Court, in Moore v. Michigan, 355 U.S. 155, 161, 78 S.Ct. 191, 195 (1957), observed that the constitutional right to the assistance of counsel \u201cdoes not justify forcing counsel upon an accused who wants none.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The next question presented is stated in petitioner\u2019s brief as follows: \u201cWas it proper to admit testimony of the Assistant Prosecuting Attorney which served to supply the omission in the sentencing order relative to waiver of the representation of counsel?\u201d We think the question must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The formal order of sentence stated that Post appeared <em>without </em>counsel which is a true recital of undisputed fact. The testimony of Mr. Scott was offered by respondent, not to contradict the formal court order in any particular, but to supply correct details of the proceedings in the state court concerning which the formal order was silent and concerning which Post had already testified. The burden was upon Post to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the alleged violation of his constitutional right. It would indeed be unthinkable to hold that Post\u2019s self-serving testimony must be accepted as true and that, by invoking the application of this suggested novel principle, the respondent has no right or opportunity to refute it. No case has been called to our attention, and we have found none, to support Post\u2019s contention. In Moore v. Michigan, 355 U.S. 155, 78 S.Ct. 191 (1957), state court proceedings were before the Supreme Court for review. No stenographic transcript was taken of the proceedings at the time of Moore\u2019s arraignment and plea of guilty to a charge of murder. Moore, a seventeen year old Negro, was not represented by counsel. He was scared, so he testified, because the Sheriff had expressed doubt as to the ability to protect the prisoner against anticipated mob violence. Two witnesses who were present in the court room testified as to what then transpired and there is neither hint nor suggestion in the Court\u2019s opinion that such testimony was improperly admitted in an attempt to refute the prisoner\u2019s testimony. Although it was there held, upon the facts considered by the Court, that the waiver of counsel was not competently made, the Court, after citing Johnson v. Zerbst,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-9\">\u201c * * * Whatever may be the differences in the substantive right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>to counsel in federal and state cases, when the defendant in a state case has established his constitutional right to the benefit of counsel, he should carry the same burden of proving nonwaiver as is required of a defendant in a federal case.\u201d 355 U.S. 155, 161, 78 S.Ct. 191, 195.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Other points presented have been considered and we find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-8\">.

SPENCER BELL, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AYf\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">I must dissent from the opinion of the majority since in my view the district court\u2019s finding that Post \u201cintelligently, understandingly, and competently waived his right to counsel\u201d is without support in the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has held that the federal standard of waiver, as established in Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 468, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1024 (1938),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is binding on the states under the fourteenth amendment. Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U.S. 506, 82 S.Ct. 884, 8 L.Ed.2d 70 (1962). And while the constitutional right to the assistance of counsel \u201cdoes not justify forcing counsel upon an accused who wants none,\u201d Moore v. Michigan, 355 U.S. 155, 161, 78 S.Ct. 191, 195 (1957), it nonetheless remains true that a high and serious duty is imposed upon a trial judge to determine whether an accused has competently and intelligently waived this constitutional right. As Mr. Justice Black has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arg\">\u201cTo discharge this duty properly in light of the strong presumption against waiver of the constitutional right to counsel, a judge must investigate as long and as thoroughly as the circumstances of the case before him demand. The fact that an accused may tell him that he is informed of his right to counsel and desires to waive this right does not automatically end the judge\u2019s responsibility. To be valid such waiver must be made with an apprehension of the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible defenses to the charges and circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter. A judge can make certain that an accused\u2019s professed waiver of counsel is understandingly and wisely made only from a penetrating and comprehensive examination of all the circumstances under which such a plea is tendered.\u201d Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 723-24, 68 S.Ct. 316, 323, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">This duty is imposed on federal and state judges alike, and although Von <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Moltke v. Gillies, supra, involved a purported waiver of counsel in a federal court, the above cited language applies equally well to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">I think the record, even when given a reading most favorable to the contentions of the State, clearly indicates that the trial judge failed to discharge adequately this duty. With the exception of Post, the only witness to what transpired in the courtroom with respect to the appointment of counsel was the then Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, George M. Scott, who prepared the indictments. Pertinent portions of Scott\u2019s testimony at the plenary hearing are quoted below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">\u201cQ. I would like for you to tell the Court, Mr. Scott, what you recall about the question of whether he [Post] was offered counsel by the presiding judge at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-6\">\u201cA. <em>Judge Lewis H. Miller was the presiding judge, and 1 do recall, with clarity, that the judge followed his usual custom, and did ask the defendant, Burton Junior Post, if he had an attorney, and asked him if he wanted an attorney, and the defendant replied with some decision in the matter, no indecision, certainly, that he didn\u2019t want an attorney, that he wanted to plead guilty. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">\u201cQ. And <em>then </em>what procedure did the judge follow <em>after that </em>in disposing of the cases pending against him? (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>The judge read the indictments in turn to the defendant and after reading them asked for a plea and in each case he responded his plea was guilty, except that, as I recall, in the case of statutory rape, charging the defendant with having sexual relations with Peggy Hosey, being a female under the age of 16 years, he pled not guilty to that charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-9\">\u201cQ. Do you remember whether or not the judge made any explanation of the possible sentence on any of these indictments to the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-11\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: You mean before he asked him for a plea ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-12\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-13\">\u201cA. Judge Miller \u2014 again I don\u2019t recall the specific language used\u2014 but he told him that he was charged with a number of very serious offenses, and I believe that he did tell him that the rape charge carried a possible death penalty. I believe that to be true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">On cross-examination, after making the witness Scott repeat the above, Post\u2019s attorney asked him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-15\">\u201cQ. You have testified that there was an offer from Judge Miller of a right to counsel and a subsequent refusal of that right by the defendant, Burton Post, is that all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-16\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: What do you mean \u2018Is that all?\u2019 That\u2019s what I testified to, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-17\">\u201cQ. Is that all that went on as far as the refusal and the offer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-18\">\u201cA. <em>Well, Judge Miller didn\u2019t argue with him. He asked him if he wanted a lawyer and he said no, and he started the </em>arraignment\u2014 <em>started reading the indictments.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-19\">Scott was the State\u2019s chief witness at the plenary hearing, and was characterized by the district court as leaving \u201cnothing to be desired as a witness.\u201d The district court below and the majority here view Scott\u2019s testimony as establishing that the trial judge, prior to accepting Post\u2019s refusal of counsel, advised Post that he was charged with a number of serious offenses, including rape, which carried a possible death sentence. They draw the inference that Post rejected counsel only <em>after </em>the above remarks about the seriousness of the State\u2019s charges were addressed to him from the bench. Although the matter is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>not entirely unambiguous, I think the more accurate reading of Scott\u2019s testimony is that the trial judge <em>first </em>accepted Post\u2019s refusal of counsel and <em>thereafter </em>warned Post of the serious nature of the charges against him. Thus, the sequence of events, as I read Scott\u2019s testimony, is that the trial judge offered Post counsel; Post refused the offer; the trial judge then remarked on the seriousness of the charges, with emphasis on the rape charge; and lastly read down the list of indictments, accepting Post\u2019s pleas to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">But even if I am mistaken as to the import of Scott\u2019s testimony, and even if the trial judge made an offer of counsel to Post after warning him of the serious nature of the State\u2019s charges, this would by no means comply with the protective duty imposed on a trial judge in Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 68 S.Ct. 316 (1948). Here, the trial judge faced a twenty-five year old offender, whose formal education ceased after the eighth grade, and who had spent most of his adolescent and post-adolescent years in state mental institutions. Add to this Post\u2019s very obvious desire to accept all blame in an effort to exculpate his female companion and accomplice, Peggy Ann Hosey. It would be difficult to imagine a defendant more in need of legal assistance. Post was entitled to be informed of his possible defense of insanity in view of his history; of the probable effect that his self-sacrificing guilty pleas and confessions might or might not have on his accomplice\u2019s fate \u2014 after all she was only fourteen years old. Only after a thorough understanding of these matters should a man of Post\u2019s intelligence and background have been allowed to decide whether to proceed without counsel. I think the trial judge failed to make the \u201cpenetrating and comprehensive examination of all the circumstances\u201d that Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 724, 68 S.Ct. 316, 323 (1948), required. The trial judge having failed to do so, I find untenable the district court\u2019s finding that Post\u2019s waiver of counsel was competently and intelligently made.
