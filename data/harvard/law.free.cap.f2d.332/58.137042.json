BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">On the basis of a finding of violations of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) (1) and (3), the Board seeks enforcement of its cease and desist order together with the traditional reinstatement and back pay award as to two discriminatees. We deny enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">The Employer<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is engaged in the automobile service station business with five locations in the Greater Miami area. The site of the principal activities complained of was the company station in Miami Beach. Within a day or two after the Union<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.filed a representation \u2019petition,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> eight employees were transferred from the Miami Beach station, to other. locations. Within a week or so, two employees, Oliveria and Hester, were laid off. In the charge all of these actions were, claimed to have been anti-union in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) (1), if not 8(a) (3). But all that is left of the case is the charge that Oliveria and Hester were discriminatorily discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-21\">.That results because the Examiner, sustained by the Board over the General Counsel\u2019s exceptions, found in favor of the Employer and against the Union as to the transfers. This is highly significant in the tag-end 8(a) (3) cases. This is not because of any mechanical comparison of the rejected with asserted causes, a type of analysis we recently characterized as artificial, N.L.R.B. v. Plant City Steel Corp., 5 Cir., 1964, 331 F.2d 511. Rather, it is so because the Examiner, in effect, found no discriminatory purpose on the Employer\u2019s part. This was based on several things, all having unusual significance. Two of the transferees were found to be unmitigated perjurers largely because of the inescapable necessity of overcoming the Employer\u2019s asserted basis for their transfer - \u2014 the theft of a case of lubricating oil. The upshot was that the Examiner gave them a double brand of purloiners and prevaricators. A third man, son of one of these two, was transferred to spare embarrassment to him. Another was transferred to meet a sudden shortage of personnel and still another was characterized by the Board as a \u201cvery undesirable employee.\u201d And most important, on a numbers-game theory, the Board concluded that the transfer made no sense as an antiunion weapon.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Recognizing, as we do, that the shortcomings of a \u00a7 8(a) (1) case might not necessarily carry over to a \u00a7 8(a) (3) discharge, an analysis of this record reflects no basis for an inference that the antiunion motivation, lacking as to \u00a7 8(a) (1) transfers, was somehow present for the discharges. In the final analysis, the Board\u2019s finding of \u00a7 8(a) (3) violation rested on what was found to be the implausibility of the Employer\u2019s explanation of the layoffs. Of course that is an accepted technique in meeting the General Counsel\u2019s burden. See N.L.R.B. v. Plant City Steel Corp., 5 Cir., 1964, 331 F.2d 511. But there must be something more since an Employer may discharge for no cause, or an unfounded cause so long as it was not in the least precipitated by antiunion discrimination. N.L.R.B. v. McGahey, 5 Cir., 1956, 233 F.2d 406, 412-413.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">We would have considerable doubt that we would characterize, as did the Board, the Employer\u2019s action as so unfounded as to be without any plausibility. One of the dischargees, Oliveria, had some peculiar personal mannerisms, not the least of which was a penchant for a long duck-billed haircut, and wearing dark glasses long after the sun went down. Besides, he was observed to be a little tardy in running out to service customers and devoted a lot of company time to the care of his personal motorcycle. Oliveria also had a fight on company time and premises and declined to aggressively \u201cpush\u201d sales of preferred items. The Examiner\u2019s report recognized that Oliveria had been the subject of some concern and stated that on his transfer to Biscayne station, one manager said to another \u201cWe have one of those \u2018hepcats,\u2019 \u201d the term cat being defined as \u201cone of those \u2018long-haired\u2019 deals * * * more or less [referred] to * * * as the \u2018beatnik\u2019 stage today.\u201d Hester\u2019s disturbing preoccupation was with attractive young female customers of the station. Either in his own or the young lady\u2019s sportscar, he had taken one or more spins during working time. And on another occasion it had annoyed one of the higher management to see him get so interested in his work that he had to get in the front seat of the sportscar to properly clean off the inside of the windscreen.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">We think the circumstances briefly summarized \u2014 when considered in the context of a company personnel history of some 65 transfers and 96 terminations in a short space of time \u2014 at least made the layoffs an understandable, if not justifiable, action. But we need not get that close to the brink of impermissible fact finding. N.L.R.B. v. Walton Mfg. Co., N.L.R.B. v. Florida Citrus Canners Cooperative, 1962, 369 U.S. 404, 82 S.Ct. 853, 7 L.Ed.2d 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">The defect in the Board\u2019s conclusion stems directly from the basic weakness in the General Counsel\u2019s case. In the final analysis, the evidence of discriminatory discharge comes down to what a couple of employees said supervisor Bailey said he heard the station manager say as to the cause of Oliveria and Hester\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\"> We must avoid, of course, the easy temptation to brush all of this aside as hearsay. We have, on numerous occasions, taken pains to point out that when the fact to be proved is a word spoken, it is an uncritical error to protest as to hearsay. The verbal act, as any other act, may be proved by one who heard it, saw it, or felt it. N.L.R.B. v. Ferguson, 5 Cir., 1958, 257 F.2d 88, 90, 92; Hendrix Mfg. Co. v. N.L.R.B., 5 Cir., 1963, 321 F.2d 100, 105; N.L.R.B. v. Globe Prod. Corp., 5 Cir., 1963, 322 F.2d 694, 696; United States v. Gavagan, 5 Cir., 1960, 280 F.2d 319, 329; N.L.R.B. v. Tex-Tan, Inc., 5 Cir., 1963, 318 F.2d 472, 484 n. 31; Huff v. United States, 5 Cir., 1962, 301 F.2d 760; Ward v. United States, 5 Cir., 1961, 296 F.2d 898; Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Combs, 5 Cir., 1960, 273 F.2d 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>The inquiry is not the <em>truth </em>of the words said, merely whether they were said. And frequently once the trier finds them to have been said, the words themselves carry their own death wound. N.L.R.B. v. Ferguson, 5 Cir., 1958, 257 F.2d 88, 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">But that is not what we have. What we have is: witness <em>A </em>testifies he overheard <em>B </em>state that <em>C </em>said such and such. Obviously <em>A </em>can prove what <em>B </em>said. But the decisive thing is what <em>C </em>is supposed to have said. And <em>A </em>cannot prove what <em>C </em>said by stating what <em>B </em>said <em>C </em>said. And yet, for all practical purposes, that is all we had here since B \u2014 Supervisor Bailey \u2014 in this barroom after-the-event discourse did not undertake, assuming he had that knowledge or position in the Company hiearchy\u2014 to state what he, rather than the station manager <em>(C) </em>had done or said.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The Board counters with the proposition that B \u2014 Supervisor Bailey \u2014 did not specifically deny what others attributed to him. That is not the point. He, as would be true of any other witness, could have testified to the verbal act (what the station manager said). But he did not so testify. Rather, a person further removed merely repeated what he said was said.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Whatever might ultimately be the technical admissibility of proof of this kind, we have no difficulty in concluding that it lacked that substantial quality on which to rest a finding of discriminatory motive in a record as equivocal as this one. In the same vein was the one isolated comment of Bailey upon which the Board hung the \u00a7 8(a) (1) finding. The result is that on the merits we find the order unsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. This makes it unnecessary for us to consider the procedural challenges vigorously asserted by the Employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-15\">One complains of the Board\u2019s refusal to permit the Employer to prove that this was in fact not a genuine union under \u00a7 2(5), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152(5), but was a sham, a front for racketeering and extortion operated and maintained for the benefit of its officers, one of whom, Harold Gross, has since been indicted, tried and convicted for racketeering and another, Secretary-Treasurer DeRow, a witness before the Examiner, had declined to furnish information about the local\u2019s activity to representatives of the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor Management Field. The Examiner first refused to allow the Employer to make inquiry into, or proof on, the status of the Local. Reversal of the Examiner\u2019s point of view was short-lived as the Board on interlocutory appeal held the inquiry to be improper.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-16\">The other procedural matter is the strong protest against the Examiner\u2019s-permitting the Board\u2019s counsel in examining the vice president of the Employer to interrogate him as to what he had said to a Board investigator (rather than what he knew the facts to be) without displaying to the witness the memorandum or written statement obviously being used with purposeful coercive effect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But our disposition of the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>means that these matters must be post-' poned to another day in another case.</p>\n<p id=\"AHKX\">Enforcement denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-15\">.

Plainly the way in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>heavy hand of transfer fell gives no support to a theory of anti-union discriminatory intent.
