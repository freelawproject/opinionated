They deal with an ornamented paper \u201cconstituted by tissue paper which is impregnated\u201d with sequins.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">Jurisdiction below rested on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1338 and 2201. Jurisdiction here rests upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">The trial judge made the following findings, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-11\">\u201cThere is nothing novel in the subject matter of product patent No. 2,-949,398 or in the subject matter of process patent No. 3,055,797, in view of prior art referred to in Findings Nos. 14 to 19.\u201d (Findings 20 and 22, Tr. p. 483.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-12\">\u201cIf there are any differences between the subject matter of product patent No. 2,949,398 and process patent No. 3,055,797, and the prior art referred to in Findings Nos. 14 to 19, those differences would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having an ordinary skill in the paper making art.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As8A\">(Findings 21 and 23, Tr. p. 483.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An8\">Findings 14 to 19 related to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-18\">(a) Beck patent No. 322,034 (1885)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-19\">(b) McDonough patent No. 447,336 (1891)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-20\">(c) Beck patent No. 342,315 (1886)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-21\">(d) \u201cOther prior patents cumulative in effect\u201d (presumably Plee\u2019s British patent No. 2649 and Boese\u2019s patent No. 2,-620,853)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-22\">(e) Strathmore Paper Company\u2019s products \u201cSilverflake\u201d and \u201cGoldflake\u201d (1934)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-23\">(f) International Paper Company\u2019s product \u201cCoronation\u201d (1944-1945)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-24\">Based on these findings of fact, the court concluded that each patent \u201chas failed to meet the requirements of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 [prior art] and 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 [obviousness] and are invalid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-25\">We cannot, on the record before us, hold these findings of fact are clearly erroneous, having due regard for the opportunity the trial judge had to judge the credibility of witnesses, which opportunity was not afforded us. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52 (a). Monroe Auto Equipment Co. v. Superior Industries, 9 Cir. 1964, 332 F.2d 473, (No. 18998, decided May 22, 1964); Bergman v. Aluminum Lock Shingle Corp. of America, 9 Cir. 1957, 251 F.2d 801, 809; Pressteel Co. v. Halo Lighting Products, Inc., 9 Cir. 1963, 314 F.2d 695, 697, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-26\">The decision of Judge Rich, sitting with the District Court of the District of Columbia, is not conclusive on the court below, nor on us, particularly where the same evidence introduced in the court below was not necessarily introduced before Judge Rich.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-27\">Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
