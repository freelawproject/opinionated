The stevedoring contractor (P. C. Pfeiffer Co., Inc.) was impleaded as a respondent. The case was tried by the district judge without a jury, and the judge made findings of fact and reached conclusions of law. He rendered judgement for the libelant. The respondentimpleaded appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-16\">Two questions are presented:</p>\n<p id=\"b579-17\">1. Whether the findings of the district court as to the unseaworthiness of the vessel were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-18\">2. Whether the district court was in error in the findings and conclusions in which the liability for the injury was divided between the libelant, on account of a pre-existing ailment, and the respondent, on account of the accident, and the latter portion was further diminished on account of contributory negligence on the part of the libelant.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-19\">We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
