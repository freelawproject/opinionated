Evidence of knowledge was presented through testimony of Sergeant Howell (as to the entire period of the conspiracy as well as to the incidents covered by counts 5, 7 and 10), and Sergeant Wooldridge (as to the latter part of the conspiracy period and the incidents covered by counts 5, 7 and 10). It is apparent that the jury chose to believe these Government witnesses rather than appellant. With knowledge thus established there was ample evidence of guilt, not only of the substantive counts but of the conspiracy as well.</p>\n<p id=\"A2\">Appellant asserts error in the court\u2019s permitting Sergeant Howell to invoke the privilege of the Fifth Amendment and refuse to testify on cross-examination as to sales of stolen property to others than appellant. Appellant\u2019s position is that the witness had waived the privilege by testifying freely on direct examination as to the period of time involved.</p>\n<p id=\"AB\">We are satisfied that there was no waiver. The cross-examination in question was on a subject not gone into on direct.</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">Appellant asserts that he was denied a fair trial in that he was denied a severance and was subjected to a mass trial with those who had participated in the thefts. The motion for severance was made and argued more than a month before trial. It was based upon the ground that there was no relation between the substantive counts and the conspiracy counts. It was properly denied upon this ground. The indictment demonstrated that the overt acts involved in count 1 were also involved in the substantive counts.</p>\n<p id=\"AF\">Appellant\u2019s motion was not thereafter renewed. If, for any reason other than that asserted, severance should have been granted the right was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Appellant asserts that adverse publicity denied him a fair and impartial jury. There is nothing in the record to support this contention. The court individually questioned those jurors who admitted having read or heard of the case, and none of them admitted to an opinion. There is no evidence or any indication at all that any juror read or heard accounts of the trial during trial. The jury was adequately cautioned against reading newspapers or listening to radio or television.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">Appellant asserts error and denial of fair trial in the court\u2019s instructing the jury on conspiracy during trial. It is not suggested that the instruction itself was erroneous. It is argued that it came too soon and too often, with the result that the fact that the case involved an alleged conspiracy was prejudicially drummed into the jury\u2019s consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">However, out of fairness to the defendants the jury could not be permitted to forget that they were concerned with an alleged conspiracy, and that the competence of certain evidence as to certain defendants depended upon a determination that a conspiracy existed. Not only was it entirely proper to instruct the jury periodically in this fashion, it might well have been prejudicial error not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">Appellant construes Rule 30 as prohibiting the giving of any instructions to the jury until after arguments are completed. The question here is not whether the district court may, contrary to Rule 30, give its instructions to the jury before argument instead of after-wards. We have recently held such practice to be error. Babson v. United States (9 Cir. 1964) 330 F.2d 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">The question here is whether Rule 30 precludes the court from instructing the jury during trial in addition to the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>propriate giving of instructions after argument. Rule 30 cannot be construed as preventing the court from appropriately cautioning the jury as to the limited competence or relevance of evidence as such evidence is received.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\">Finding no error, judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
