He seeks review here of the order of the Attorney General denying his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-23\">When this case was originally before this court, see Foti v. I. N. S., 308 F.2d 779 (2d Cir. 1962), cert. granted, 371 U.S. 947, 83 S.Ct. 503, 9 L.Ed.2d 496 (1963); see also Foti v. I. N. S., 375 U.S. 217, 84 S.Ct. 306, 11 L.Ed.2d 281 (1963), the issue was whether or not the Attorney General had abused his discretion in refusing to grant the application for suspension of deportation. Since that time Congress has amended the applicable statute, 8 U.S.C. (Supp. IV, 1959-1962) \u00a7 1254, to provide that discretionary suspension of deportation is unavailable to aliens who, like the petitioner, entered the United States as crewmen. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(f) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-24\">There can be no doubt that the new provision of the statute is applicable to the petitioner and that he is now ineligible for suspension of deportation. See Fassilis v. Esperdy, 301 F.2d 429 (2d Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-25\">Remand of this case to the Attorney General would be a pointless formality since the Attorney General is required by the statute to deny petitioner\u2019s application. We therefore dismiss the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
