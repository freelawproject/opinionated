J.</author>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Defendant appeals judgments of conviction in two consolidated cases, A122428 and A122486. He assigns error to trial court rulings in only the first of the two cases, however. In that case, defendant challenges six of his seven convictions on the ground that, among other things, the evidence was legally insufficient. He also challenges the trial court\u2019s admission of certain hearsay testimony. The state concedes that the court erred in admitting the hearsay testimony. We conclude that defendant is correct with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence as to the first six convictions, and we accept the state\u2019s concession as it applies to the seventh. We therefore reverse six of the convictions, and reverse and remand the seventh in A122428; we affirm as to A122486.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Defendant and several codefendants were charged by indictment in A122428 with a total of 54 different offenses arising out of several incidents in which, among other crimes, defendant and his codefendants, Monk, Roger Haight, and Sarah Haight, stole a variety of personal property items\u2014 from duct tape and tools to a pickup truck \u2014 during a several-day crime spree. First, several rolls of duct tape and various tools were taken from a storage container owned by American Refrigeration Company in Newberg. Second, a pickup truck was stolen from the Nelsons in Newberg. Third, several days later, running boards and new tires were stolen from a fenced area behind the body shop at Chuck Colvin Auto Center in McMinnville. Fourth, a day or two after that, two motorcycles and two helmets were stolen from a barn located at the rear of Molash\u2019s property in Yamhill off Highway 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Defendant was charged with a number of offenses. Count 9 of the indictment alleged that defendant and his codefendant Monk committed theft in the first degree by stealing \u201ctools and/or a truck\u201d belonging to American Refrigeration. Count 10 alleged that defendant, Monk, and the Haights committed unauthorized use of a vehicle when they stole the Nelsons\u2019 truck. Count 15 alleged that defendant and Monk committed theft in the first degree when they took, and the Haights received, tires and running boards that were the property of Chuck Colvin Auto. Count 40 alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>that defendant and Monk committed second-degree burglary when they entered Molash\u2019s barn. Count 41 alleged that defendant and Monk committed first-degree theft by taking Molash\u2019s motorcycles from the barn. Count 42 alleged that defendant, Monk, and the Haights unlawfully possessed a stolen motorcycle, thereby committing the offense of possession of a stolen vehicle. Count 43 alleged that defendant, Monk, and the Haights possessed a second stolen motorcycle, again resulting in the commission of the offense of possession of a stolen vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">At trial, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal as to all counts save Count 41 on the ground that the only evidence connecting him to the commission of those crimes consisted of uncorroborated statements of two accomplices, Monk and Roger Haight. Defendant argued that, under ORS 136.440, the state was required to establish some corroboration in addition to the testimony of an accomplice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>to defendant, the state failed to offer such corroborative evidence and relied instead solely on the testimony of Monk and Roger Haight. The trial court denied the motions. A jury found defendant guilty of the seven described offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">In his first through sixth assignments of error on appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for judgments of acquittal on the two counts of theft in the first degree (Counts 9 and 15), the count of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle (Count 10), the count of burglary in the second degree (Count 40), and the two counts of possession of a stolen vehicle (Counts 42 and 43). Defendant notes that the trial court determined as a matter of law that Monk was an accomplice and so instructed the jury. Defendant argues that Haight, who was charged as a codefendant in each of the relevant counts, also was an accomplice as a matter of law. According to defendant, Haight\u2019s statements therefore could not be used to corroborate those of Monk, and there is no other corroborative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The state argues that whether a witness is an accomplice and whether there is sufficient corroborating evidence \u2014 that is, evidence tending to connect defendant with the commission of the crime \u2014 are questions of fact for the jury. According to the state, Haight was not an accomplice because he was acquitted of the relevant crimes and, in any event, there was sufficient other corroborating evidence, such as evidence of what investigating officers found at the Haights\u2019 property, namely, the stolen goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In ascertaining whether the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motions for judgments of acquittal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational trier of fact, drawing reasonable inferences and making reasonable credibility choices, could find that the state proved every element of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Lotches, </em>331 Or 455, 498, 17 P3d 1045 (2000), <em>cert den, </em>534 US 833 (2001); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>202 Or App 478, 480, 123 P3d 304 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 158 (2006). As to whether a witness is an accomplice whose testimony must be corroborated, if there is sufficient evidence to charge a witness of the crime with which a defendant is charged, then the trial court \u201cmay determine, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>matter of law, that the witness is an accomplice.\u201d <em>State v. Oatney, </em>335 Or 276, 284, 66 P3d 475 (2003), <em>cert den, </em>540 US 1151 (2004). If, however, the facts regarding whether a witness is an accomplice are in dispute, the jury decides; the burden is on the defendant to prove that the witness is an accomplice so as to require corroboration of the witness\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 284-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">As to the nature of the corroborating evidence required by ORS 136.440, it must \u201cfairly and legitimately tend[ ] to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime, so that it can in truth be said that his conviction is not based entirely upon evidence of the accomplice [s].\u201d <em>State v. Norton, </em>157 Or App 606, 609-10, 972 P2d 1198 (1998) (quoting <em>State v. Brake, </em>99 Or 310, 314, 195 P 583 (1921) (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in <em>Norton)). </em>Corroborating evidence may be circumstantial. <em>State v. Walton, </em>311 Or 223, 243, 809 P2d 81 (1991); <em>see, e.g., State v. Dickerson, </em>112 Or App 51, 57, 827 P2d 1354, <em>rev den, </em>313 Or 627 (1992) (trial court did not err in denying motions for judgments of acquittal on charges of murder, felony murder, and kidnapping; testimony of an accomplice was corroborated by, among other evidence, testimony of a nonaccomplice witness that the defendant had asked for directions to the park where the victim\u2019s body was later found and that he had then taken the victim to a car and left with her). \u201cNor is it necessary that there be independent corroborating evidence with respect to every material fact necessary to be established to sustain a conviction\u201d for a crime. <em>Walton, </em>311 Or at 243; <em>see also State v. Rose, </em>45 Or App 879, 882, 609 P2d 875 (1980) (corroborating evidence need not be adequate in itself to support conviction if it fairly tends to connect the defendant with commission of the crime). If there is some evidence, however slight or circumstantial, besides the accomplice\u2019s testimony that tends to connect the defendant to commission of the crime, then the issue of sufficient corroboration is for the jury. <em>Walton, </em>311 Or at 243; <em>see also State v. Adams, </em>91 Or App 24, 27, 754 P2d 1 (1988); <em>State v. Schoen, </em>34 Or App 105, 110-11, 578 P2d 420, <em>rev den, </em>283 Or 503 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">We first consider whether there is any direct or circumstantial evidence, other than evidence of Haight\u2019s statements, that corroborates Monk\u2019s statements pertaining to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the relevant charged counts. <em>See State v. Partee, </em>32 Or App 117, 122-23, 573 P2d 751, <em>rev den, </em>282 Or 385 (1978) (where expert witness corroborated the defendant\u2019s accomplice\u2019s testimony, court did not need to determine whether any of the defendant\u2019s other associates were or were not accomplices). At trial, Monk testified that defendant was with him when he broke a lock off a storage container at a construction site in Newberg. Monk said that he then went into a restaurant, and, when he returned to his truck, there was a box of duct tape in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Monk also testified that, on the same night, he started a white truck that was parked on the street in Newberg and then left the scene, while defendant remained. Monk later saw the white truck at the Haights\u2019 house and later saw defendant driving a white truck. Monk further testified that, in January 2002, Monk and defendant drove separately to Chuck Colvin Auto. Monk jumped the fence and threw tires over the fence. Monk and defendant then loaded tires and running boards into the white truck and defendant dropped the items at the Haights\u2019 house.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Monk also testified that he stole two motorcycles from a location outside Yamhill and that defendant transported them in the white truck; Monk sold one of the motorcycles to Haight for $300. Officer Goad testified that Monk had told him that the white truck was defendant\u2019s transportation. Officer Steele testified that Monk had told him that he and defendant had taken two motorcycles from a barn and transported them in a truck that had been stolen in Newberg. Detective Stuart testified that Monk had told him that defendant had obtained a ride to the Haight residence and then ridden one of the motorcycles off the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">With the foregoing testimony of Monk in mind, we turn to the question whether there is evidence that corroborates it as to each of the relevant charges. The state argues that the corroborating evidence was provided by testimony of three police officers \u2014 Goad, Stuart, and Steele \u2014 who executed a search warrant at Haight\u2019s property and found a number of the items of stolen property, including a white truck with \u201cswitched\u201d plates, two motorcycles identified as having been stolen in the Highway 47 burglary, tires from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Chuck Colvin Auto, and duct tape. In addition, the state relies on the testimony of a witness, Goddard, who was not named in any of the relevant counts (and who therefore was not an accomplice as to those counts). Goddard testified that, on one occasion, defendant accompanied Monk to Goddard\u2019s residence. The state also relies on testimony by a fourth police officer, Van Soolen, who saw defendant with what the officer believed was a motorcycle that was the subject of a theft report not connected to this case and, as he was attempting to arrest defendant at defendant\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house in Amity, defendant escaped and fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">We conclude that the evidence relied on by the state does not \u201cfairly and legitimately tend[ ] to connect * * * defendant with the commission of\u2019 the relevant crimes. <em>See Norton, </em>157 Or App at 609-10. Although the described testimony by the police officers details various items of stolen property that were found at the Haights\u2019 residence during execution of the search warrant, there was no testimony by those witnesses <em>connecting defendant </em>to those items, such as testimony placing him at the residence at the time of execution of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Nor is Goddard\u2019s testimony \u2014 that he observed defendant in Monk\u2019s company on one occasion \u2014 sufficient. Goddard\u2019s testimony did not demonstrate, even circumstantially, that defendant and Monk were jointly engaged in criminal conduct on that occasion, much less that they jointly engaged in the criminal conduct at issue here. <em>See State v. Carroll, </em>251 Or 197, 200, 444 P2d 1006 (1968) (fact that the defendant was seen with a person on a particular date was not sufficient to corroborate his criminal involvement in the person\u2019s conduct constituting an offense on another date; independent evidence of a defendant\u2019s association with an accomplice will furnish corroboration of the accomplice\u2019s testimony if it appears that the defendant and the accomplice were observed together at a place and under circumstances not likely to have occurred unless there was criminal concert between them).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Finally, although flight can be circumstantial evidence of guilt, <em>see, e.g., State v. Minchue, </em>173 Or App 520, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>524, 24 P3d 386 (2001), Van Soolen\u2019s testimony fails to demonstrate that defendant had engaged in any of the particular criminal conduct alleged in this case. In short, the evidence relied on by the state is insufficient to corroborate Monk\u2019s accomplice testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Because we conclude that there was insufficient corroborating evidence apart from evidence of Haight\u2019s statements, we next must consider whether Haight was an accomplice as a matter of law as to any of the charged offenses. <em>Partee, </em>32 Or App at 123. As pertinent here, the indictment demonstrates that Haight was charged as a codefendant in Counts 9, 10, 15, 42, and 43. Accordingly, he was an accomplice as a matter of law for the purpose of those counts, and his statements could not be used to corroborate those of Monk. <em>Oatney, </em>335 Or at 284. It follows that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motions for judgments of acquittal as to those counts. <em>See State v. Sagdal, </em>186 Or App 134, 135, 61 P3d 975 (2003) (where the defendant was convicted on basis of accomplice testimony and corroborative evidence that the state conceded failed to demonstrate that the defendant was connected with commission of the crime, the trial court erred in denying motion for judgment of acquittal).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Haight was not, however, charged on Count 40, for burglary in the second degree involving the entry of a building on Highway 47 with the intent to commit the crime of theft of two motorcycles and, thus, was not an accomplice as to that offense. Because evidence of his statements properly could be used to corroborate Monk\u2019s testimony as to that count, we must address the sufficiency of the evidence as to that count separately. Monk testified that he took the two motorcycles out of the barn and that defendant transported them. Detective Stuart testified that Haight had told him that the motorcycles discovered on the Haights\u2019 property had been brought there by defendant. According to defendant, Haight\u2019s statement to the officer was insufficient to corroborate Monk\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">We agree. Nothing in Haight\u2019s statement provides even circumstantial evidence that defendant entered the barn from which the motorcycles were stolen or that he somehow aided and abetted Monk in doing so. <em>See </em>ORS 164.215 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>(person commits crime of burglary in the second degree if \u201cthe person enters * * * a building with intent to commit a crime therein\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on that count as well. We therefore reverse defendant\u2019s convictions on each of the counts at issue in defendant\u2019s first through sixth assignments of error \u2014 Counts 9,10,15, 40, 42, and 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">In his seventh assignment of error, defendant asserts that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay evidence to the effect that Haight told Officer Goad that defendant had brought the white Ford pickup to the Haights\u2019 property. Defendant does not identify the convictions that are at issue in his seventh assignment of error. However, because we have concluded that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motions for judgments of acquittal on Counts 9, 10,15,40,42, and 43, we need not consider the assignment as it may relate to those convictions. In addition, the state concedes that the trial court erred in admitting the challenged evidence and that defendant\u2019s convictions on Counts 9, 10, 15, 41, 42, and 43 must be reversed and remanded for a new trial. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession, applying it to Count 41, the only count not a subject of defendant\u2019s motions for judgments of acquittal. We therefore reverse defendant\u2019s conviction on Count 41 and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Defendant raises other assignments of error. In light of our decisions with respect to the foregoing, however, we need not address any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">In case number A122428, convictions on Counts 9, 10, 15, 40, 42, and 43 reversed; conviction on Count 41 reversed and remanded for new trial.
