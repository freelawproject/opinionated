The Board further held that its General Counsel \u201cfailed to prove by a fair preponderance of the credible evidence\u201d that the discharge of the two employees had been discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">We have carefully examined the record in the case. Were we sitting as members of the Board we might well have reached a different conclusion from that of the Board but, within the limited scope of our appellate review, we are unable to say that the finding of the Board that its General Counsel had failed to sustain the burden of proving that the two employees were discriminatorily discharged was not supported by the record. The mere fact that the Board disagreed with the examiner does not require reversal; and, as the difference in conclusion between the Board and the examiner was based on the inferences drawn from the testimony, the Board had the right to make the choice giving consideration to the examiner\u2019s report.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This the Board has stated it has done and we are unable to say that its conclusion was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-15\">The petition will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-16\">Dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-10\">. 61 Stat. 136, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b300-11\">.
