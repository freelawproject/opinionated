We agree with Judge Abruzzo that the defendant has infringed the plaintiff\u2019s valid mark, and we affirm the judgment enjoining the defendant from the use of \u201cSpice Land\u201d as a trademark or designation in connection with packing, processing, advertising, distributing or marketing of spices or related products.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-28\"> We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff\u2019s mark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>is a mere description, geographical or otherwise, and therefore unregistrable. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(e). To the contrary, the mark is sufficiently fanciful to sustain the relief accorded. However, since there is also ample support in the record for Judge Abruzzo\u2019s finding that the plaintiff\u2019s mark had <em>\u201cby </em>reason of extensive advertising and use\u201d attained a secondary meaning sufficient to entitle it to protection, we place our affirmance on that alternative ground as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Finally it is self-evident that when compared with \u201cSpice Islands\u201d the use of \u201cSpice Land\u201d as a trademark for spices and similar products is \u201clikely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers as to the source of origin of the goods or services.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1114(1). The word combinations are strikingly similar in sound and meaning. Maternally Yours, Inc. v. Your Maternity Shop, Inc., 2 Cir., 1956, 234 F.2d 538, 542; Douglas Laboratories Corp. v. Copper Tan, Inc., 2 Cir., 1954, 210 F.2d 453, certiorari denied 1954, 347 U.S. 968, 74 S.Ct. 779, 98 L.Ed. 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
