The case is before this Court upon an agreed statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"AxM\">There is no question of the jurisdiction of the court below, nor of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AgG\">It appears that Mallard Pond Builders, Inc., the bankrupt herein, engaged in a construction project which included the erection of many houses. The bankrupt obtained construction loans from a predecessor of Perpetual Savings &amp; Loan Association, hereinafter Perpetual, and <em>entered </em>into a series of construction loans with the lending agency. These loan agreements provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that the proceeds of the loans would be disbursed as progress payments in accord-anee with agreed schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Bankrupt had no general contractor for the whole project, but did employ one Schmidt, the holder of a general contractor s license, to supervise all construetion. T. F. Korherr, hereinafter Appellant, a licensed flooring contractor, entered into a contract with the bankrupt to furnish the material and labor in installing flooring in certain houses to be constructed. The bankrupt entered into numerous other similar contracts with plumbing contractors, electrical contractors, sheet metal contractors, etc., in the construction project.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah5\">Appellant having been paid only in part for the flooring he furnished and installed, filed with Perpetual pursuant to Section 1190.1(h) of the Code of Civil Procedure of California a so-called \u201cstop notice\u201d requesting the withholding of further payments to bankrupt in an sufficient to cover Appelant's unpaid \u00cdaim' + Tt 18 agreed by f \u00ae par*ies +tbat,.thlS stop notice was filed within tbe ,time+ requlrf by la^ and prior to bankr?ptcy\u2019 and that it was accomfamed by 1 a bond a? re&lt;luired <em>R Re</em>tlon 1190.1(h) It is a so agreed that pursuant <em>* </em>law\u2019 Appellant duly and properly ^ed an act/on <em>mJhe </em>pr\u00b0per court tbe 8t\u00b0p fotlce; K * further a?reed that at the <em>^ </em>Appellant served hls ^ \u00b0n P5Pe*Ua \u2019 th^ C\u00b0m' pany held funds m the Bankrupt s construction loan accounts sufficient to satisfy an stop notice claims, including that 0f Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ4\">The present controversy arises out of an order to show cause based on the Trustee in Bankruptcy\u2019s petition alleging the construction loan funds constituted an asset of the bankrupt estate. Appellant claimed that to the extent necessary to satisfy hig gtop notieej the fundg in the construction loan accounts were his and not an asset of the bankrupt estate,</p>\n<p id=\"AUq\">Pertinent portions of Section 1190.1 (h) and Sections 1181 and 1184.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"a6e-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The Referee and the District Court held that Appellant \u201cis a contractor and therefore not entitled to avail himself of the stop notice remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The right to a mechanic s hen is guaranteed by the Constitution of. Califorma Article 20, Section 15. The statutes of California have long contained provisions implementing the Constitutional guaranty A stop notice, or a notice to withhold, is not identical with a mechanics lien, but is an additional or <em>cumulative. Weldon </em>v. Superior Court, 1903, <em>138 Cal. </em>427, 71 P. 502; Diamond Match Co. v. Silberstein, 1913, 165 Cal. 282 P. 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">\u2022 The effectiveness, however, of mechan-ie\u2019s liens have been impaired by amendments to the California law providing that mortgages or trust deeds, by means of which the construction funds are secured, recorded before the commencement of the construction work, are senior in priority to liens recorded by persons furnishing labor and material to a construction project. \u25a0 The law formerly pro-yided; in geetion llg4 of the Code of Civil proCedure, that stop notices might be flerved upon the 0 requesting tbat he withhold from a person in the position of a general contractor moneys sufficient to pay the Iabor and material. men. In later yearg) howeVer, lending agendes bave adopted the ractice of \u201c\u201e\u2122. rate fund and that payments be made from that fund directly to the persons entitled thereto rather than to the owner. In this case, such a loan agreement was signed by the owner and the savings and loan association.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Appellee contends that the word <em>\u201ccontractor\u201d </em>in the phrase <em>\u201cexcept the contractor\u201d </em>[emphasis added] in Section 1190.1(h) means <em>any </em>contractor supplying labor or material to the project.</p>\n<p id=\"Afg\">We cannot agree. If that were true, there would be no reason for the use of the word \u201cthe\u201d in describing the contractor. The word \u201ca\u201d would be more appropriate. If all the various contractors on a job, such as plumbing, brick, cement, electrical, and others, were to be included within the exception, the plural word <em>contractors </em>should have been used.</p>\n<p id=\"A1S\">Section 1184 of the Code of Civil Pro-cedure, which provided \u2014 until its repeal in 1951 \u2014 , for the giving of stop notices, also used the language \u201cexcept the contractor\u201d which is found in Section 1190.1 00- This latter section was enacted in 1951, the same year that Section 1184 was repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"AE8\">A reading of Section 1184 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> indicates that the words \u201cexcept the contractor\u201d referred to the general or prime contractor. By its terms it could not be contended that individual contractors doing only portions of the work would be ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>eluded from the right to file stop notices with the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"AUx\">The mere fact that in this case Appellant made his contract with the owner for the doing of the flooring in various houses, rather than with a general or prime contractor, should not deprive him of the right which he would have if he agreed to do the same work in a contract entered into with a general contractor, The owner here was acting in the same way a general contractor would act.</p>\n<p id=\"AMIl\">In discussing the difference between an original or principal contractor and a subcontractor, it is said in Nelson on Mechanic\u2019s Lien Laws, Section 183:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS0\">\u201cBut if his contract * * * is for work and materials for merely a portion of the entire improvement, he is a subcontractor. This is true even though his subcontract is made directly with the owner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANK\">Appellant in this case was in the position of a subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"A0t\">.It is conceded by the Trustee that had Korherr been a subcontractor the stop notice would have been effective.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is not reasonable to us to believe that the aceident of a modern financial arrangement should cause one such as Korherr to be denied the protection the mechanic\u2019s lien laws traditionally provide. The financing arrangement here, not an uncommon one today, resulted in an agency of the lending institution disbursing progress payments to the various contractors and materialmen working on the construction project. Absent such an arrangement, the payments would have been made by the general contractor. Thus, those materialmen and those who performed the plumbing, electrical work, flooring and the like might serve stop notices on the builder or lender, informing him that the general contractor had not paid them. Because there <em>was </em>a general contractor, these plumbers, electricians, etc., were <em>subcontractors, </em>and payments in the amounts sufficient to pay for their services would be secured upon service of the stop notices,</p>\n<p id=\"a6q-dedup-0\">In the instant case, Appellant has the same relationship to the construction project as do the subcontractors in the above described situation. The same reasons that led the legislature to provide for the stop notice for subcontractors and materialmen apply to Korherr. To hold that because there is no general contractor here Appellant does not qualify under the law is to place^ a reliance on f\u00b0rm over substance that is not in keep-?n,g with the sPirit of the law of mechan1C\u2019S liens\u2018</p>\n<p id=\"Aq-\"> It has been said that statutes relating to the enforcement of the mechanic\u2019s lien, being remedial in nature, should be liberally construed to effect their purpose. 32 Cal.Jur.2d \u00a7 7; Gallagher v. Campodonico, 1931, 121 Cal.App.Supp. 765, 5 P.2d 486; Burr v. Peppers Cotton Lumber Co., 1928, 91 Cal.App. 268, 266 P. 1025. Also, where words of exception are used, they are to be strictly construed to limit the exception. Piedmont &amp; Northern R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 1932, U.S. 299, S.Ct. 541, 76 L.Ed. 1115. See generally, Sutherland on Statutory Construction, 3d Ed. \u00a7\u00a7 4936 se&lt;P ^bis ls especially true where remedies are sought to be enforced, as in *he instant case. Fleming v. Hawkeye Pearl Button Co., 8 Cir., 1940, 113 F.2d 52; Miller Hatcheries v. Boyer, 8 Cir., 1942, 131 F.2d 283.</p>\n<p id=\"Az1\">Counsel have not been able to furnish the Court with any direct authority construing the phrase \u201cexcept the contracf\u00b0r\u201d in Section 1190.1(h), and we have found none.</p>\n<p id=\"AGA\">Pugh v. Moxley, 1912, 164 Cal. 374, 128 P. 1037, 1039, relied upon by Appellee, is inapplicable. Though containing <em>obi-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>ter dictum </em>that \u201cone may be an original contractor although he has agreed to do only part of the work required for the construction of a building,\u201d the case actually held, <em>inter alia, </em>that a hardware company that supplied and installed plumbing was a materialman and not an original contractor. Thus, the California Supreme Court held that the claimant\u2019s contract was not void because not in writing and recorded as required by the statute applicable to \u201coriginal contracts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">Considering the obvious purpose oi the section, the use of the words the contractor\u201d in the statute instead of \u201ca contractor\u201d or \u201cthe contractors,\u201d the unreasonableness of a construction that would, under the circumstances in this case, bar all individual contractors furnishing labor and materials to a project .. 4. .. , from using the stop notice procedure, we , ,, +i,\u201e4. a\u2122 n j. , , <em>, J </em>hold that Appellant was not barred from getting such benefit from Section 1190.1 (h) as he may obtain by filing a stop notice thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-27\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-13\">.
