Civil Aeronautics Board, 1956, 97 U.S.App.D.C. 358, 231 F.2d 517. In that case we stated that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-10\">\u201cGreensboro has not received a plain answer to its charge of discrimination. * * * The issue was flatly raised, and was relevant to the Board\u2019s ultimate decision as to what the public convenience and necessity required. * * * We think the Board should now make appropriate findings of fact on the issue, and state \u2018the reasons or basis\u2019 for its conclusion. In its discretion, it may do this on the present record, or permit additional testimony and argument.\u201d Id. 97 U.S.App.D.C. at pages 362-363, 231 F.2d at pages 521-522.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">We think the Board adequately complied with our order. We find no basis for saying that the findings and conclusions it has now reached as to the alleged discrimination against Greensboro-High Point Airport Authority, and as to the relevance of those findings and conclusions to the requirements of public convenience and necessity, are unwarranted in the record or without basis in law. The order, which in effect reinstates the order originally entered, is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"Adod\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
