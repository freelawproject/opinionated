Credit Corporation for damages for the conversion of her automobile and for exemplary damages on the ground that the. conversion was in willful disregard of her rights. Either or both of two conversions is claimed, the first in the taking of the automobile, the second in its disposition. Universal C.I.T. defends, claiming that it took and disposed of the automobile under the terms of a purchase money chattel mortgage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Judgment was entered upon a jury\u2019s verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $358.24 as actual damages plus $1,250 as exemplary damages, or a total of $1,608.24, together with 6% interest from February 22, 1957, the date on which the car was taken approximately one year before the rendition of judgment on February 20, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-22\">Upon this appeal, Universal insists: (1) that the undisputed evidence shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>that it did not convert the automobile but lawfully and peacefully repossessed it at a time and in a manner provided by its chattel mortgage then in default; (2) that the evidence as to the value of the automobile is not sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict; (3) that, in view of the terms of the mortgage, the district court erred in charging the jury (a) that acceptance of late payments waived Universal\u2019s right to demand future payments on time, and (b) that notice and warning to Mrs. Stewart were required before default could be declared; (4) that the district court erred in allowing interest from February 22, 1957, the date of the taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Mrs. Stewart joined in the mortgage to accommodate her son-in-law, Lewis Gooch, who was a minor at the time of the purchase. The mortgage provided for monthly payments of $109.38 on the 25th day of each month. Gooch became in arrears with the payments, and thereafter he received notice of his induction into the Armed Forces. Mrs. Stewart and Gooch then traded cars. Upon a telephone call to Universal\u2019s office, Mrs. Stewart was informed that two payments would be required to bring the account current.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Beginning on the date of such conversation, she issued the following checks dated and in the amounts shown:</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Date Amount</p>\n<p id=\"A3S\">6-13-56 ........ ........ $210.00</p>\n<p id=\"A68\">7-15-56 ........ ........ 109.00</p>\n<p id=\"adx-dedup-0\">8-22-56 ........ ........ 105.00</p>\n<p id=\"alt-dedup-0\">9-12-56 ........ ........ 9.46</p>\n<p id=\"A-Z\">9-20-56 ........ ........ 109.00</p>\n<p id=\"A6O\">10-21-56 ........ ........ 109.00</p>\n<p id=\"aut-dedup-1\">11-21-56 ........</p>\n<p id=\"AJK\">12-29-56 ........</p>\n<p id=\"aht-dedup-0\">1-19-57 ........ ......... 109.00</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">$ 978.46</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">2-20-57 (Returned because received in the mail on 2-23-57 after the car had been repossessed the previous day) $ 109.00</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">Total ... ...........$1,087.46</p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>There is no dispute as to the foregoing facts. The confusion arose from dealings between Universal and Gooch of which Mrs. Stewart was not informed. When Gooch was unable to meet one of the payments, Universal granted him an extension and changed the due date of the monthly payments from the 25th to the 12th of the month. When Mrs. Stewart telephoned Universal and assumed primary responsibility for the payments, Gooch was in arrears for the payments due, as between him and Universal, on May 12 and June 12, 1956. From that telephone conversation (see footnote 2, supra), Mrs. Stewart evidently understood that the two payments referred to were all that would be due for the months of May and June. Universal conceded that the only change in the monthly due date was made with Gooch and that no change was made with Mrs. Stewart, and Mrs. Stewart denied having had notice of any change.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Other than the telephone call referred to, no communications passed between Mrs. Stewart and Universal until her automobile was seized on February 22, 1957. Universal\u2019s employee found the car on a private parking lot off of the street adjoining the beauty shop where Mrs. Stewart worked. Mrs. Stewart was only a few feet away, as the employee knew. However, he made no demand on her for the keys to the car and gave her no notice. Instead, he wired around the ignition on the car and took possession of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Mrs. Stewart called Universal\u2019s manager to report the ear stolen, and he informed her that it had been repossessed. When she told him that a payment was in the mail, he replied that it would be refused and demanded the entire unpaid balance within a week. When Mrs. Stewart did not pay, Universal called on the dealer from whom it had purchased the note and mortgage to make good his guaranty and take over the car. This suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">It is not necessary to decide whether wiring around the ignition while the automobile was parked on private property without notifying Mrs. Stewart at work a few feet away is peaceable repossession.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As between Universal and Mrs. Stewart, the telephone conversation (footnote 2, supra) probably left her under the impression that the payments which she made kept the contract in good standing. Both Gooch and Mrs. Stewart signed the original contract calling for payments on the 25th day of the month. It would hardly seem necessary to cite authorities to the effect that Mrs. Stewart is not bound by the agreement between Universal and Gooch of which she had no notice changing that date to the 12th.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the tabulation of payments shows, Mrs. Stewart was four days late in making her December payment. All of the others were made before the 25th of the month, and each was accepted without objection except the check in transit when the car was seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">Universal\u2019s branch manager testified that the $1,271 balance paid by its dealer-assignor was all that the car was worth, and the dealer\u2019s manager gave his opinion that the car was worth $1,250 to $1,300 and testified that it was re-sold for $1,300. Mrs. Stewart testified without objection that the value of her automobile at the time it was picked up was $2,000. According to Universal\u2019s manager, the unpaid balance on the mortgage at the time the car was repossessed was $1,423.54. Adding to that balance the amount of $358.24 awarded by the jury as actual damages, it appears that the jury estimated the value of the car as $1,781.78, considerably less than the amount to which Mrs. Stewart testified. The qualification of a witness on the issue of value is largely within the discretion of the trial judge, and, in Texas, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>owner can generally testify as to the value of his own car, tools, or other personalty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"APIn\"> Universal contends that the district court erred in charging the jury that acceptance of late payments waived its right to demand future payments on time, since the mortgage expressly stated that waiver of any default should not be waiver of a future default, and that the eourt also erred in charging the jury that, after it had been habitually accepting late payments, notice and warning were required to Mrs. Stewart before it could declare a default for any future late payment. Both of these objections to the \u25a0charge are premised upon the fact of a valid novation or alteration in the terms of the written contract moving the payment date forward from the 25th to the 12th, which, as has been shown, is a false premise, as between Universal and Mrs. Stewart. Further, the Texas courts follow the general rule that parties having power to make a contract have the power to modify it regardless of self-imposed limitations<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AcVK\">In Texas, interest runs from the date of the wrongful injury or conversi\u00b0u.5 *<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ar1-dedup-0\">We find no reversible error in the record, and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AlTG\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-13\">.

Customer agrees in any such case to pay said amount or, at holder\u2019s election, to deliver the car to the holder, and holder may, <em>without notice or demand </em>for performance or legal process, <em>enter any premises where the car may be found, </em>take possession of it and custody of anything found in it, and retain all payments as compensation for the use of the car while in Customer\u2019s possossion. The car may be sold with or without notice, <em>at private </em>or public sale (at which the holder may purchase) with or without having the car at the sale; the proceeds less all expenses shall be credited on the amount payable hereunder; Customer shall pay any remaining balance forthwith as liquidated damages for the breach of this mortgage and shall receive any surplus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-24\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-25\"><em>\u201cWaiver of any default shall not be a waiver of any other default. </em>No change in this mortgage shall be binding unless in writing signed by an officer of Universal C.I.T. * * (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b813-10\">.

Corbin, Tex.Civ.App., 253 S.W.2d 688, 690, mis-cited by appellee as the sole authority for her claim that, if there was a conversion of the car, the credit company would be liable for exemplary damages, held just to the contrary. While upholding the judgment for actual damages, the court re-versed it as to the award of exemplary damages and thus stated the Texas rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axr\">, Punitive or exemplary damages af recoverable only after a showing of aggravated circumstances of mallce\u2019 fraud OT 8T0SS negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANtb\">in support it cites the leading and authoritative Supreme Court opinion in Bennett v.
