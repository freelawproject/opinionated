The trial court sentenced him to seven years. Three days later, upon learning that such sentence was less than the minimum provided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>law, the trial court had appellant brought into court and corrected the sentence to ten years. It is from this order correcting sentence that appellant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">As we have recently pointed out in Enzor v. United States, 5 Cir., 262 F.2d 172, the trial court has this power. Rule 35, F.R.Crim.P., 18 U.S.C.A. Rule 35, provides: \u201cThe court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\u201d Such correction does not violate the constitutional rights of a convicted person. Bozza v. United States, 330 U.S. 160, 67 S.Ct. 645, 91 L.Ed. 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
