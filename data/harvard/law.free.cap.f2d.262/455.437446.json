At about three o\u2019clock one morning two police officers heard shots and ran to the scene. They saw a man (later identified as \u201cLee Bong\u201d) in a yard waving a pistol and yelling, \u201cYou robbed me; you robbed me.\u201d The officers saw McQueen leaving a shed in the yard. Later they found a wallet in a trash can beside the shed. Lee Bong identified it as his. While still on the scene McQueen admitted his guilt to the offense. Lee Bong died of a heart attack shortly after this affair and so was not a witness at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Upon this appeal counsel for McQueen raises several points about the admissibility of evidence, particularly with regard to the officers\u2019 testimony concerning Lee Bong\u2019s utterances on the scene. We find no error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-34\">. Cf. Guthrie v.
