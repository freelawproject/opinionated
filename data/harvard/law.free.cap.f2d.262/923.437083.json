Appellant filed suit for a declaratory judgment in the District Court seeking to establish that \u2014 contrary to the conclusion of the Immigration and Naturalization Service \u25a0 \u2014 he was eligible to have his deportation suspended pursuant to Section 244(a) (1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 214, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1254 (a)(1). The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellant had not shown that he \u201clast entered the United States more than two years prior to June 27, 1952,\u201d as the statute requires. It appears that appellant, as a seaman on American flag vessels, made numerous voyages overseas. He last returned to the United States on October 8, 1953, after a voyage from San Francisco to Formosa and back. We are constrained to affirm, under the decisions of the Supreme Court in United States ex rel. Claussen v. Day, 1929, 279 U.S. 398, 49 S.Ct. 354, 73 L.Ed. 758, and United States ex rel. Stapf v. Corsi, 1932, 287 U.S. 129, 53 S.Ct. 40, 77 L.Ed. 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
