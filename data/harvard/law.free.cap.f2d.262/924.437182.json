We agree with the District Court that there was no genuine issue of material fact, and that on the facts adduced appellees are protected by the doctrine of official immunity against liability for damages. Summary judgment was therefore proper. Cooper v. O\u2019Connor, 69 App.D.C. 100, 99 F.2d 135, 118 A.L.R. 1440, certiorari denied 1938, 305 U.S. 643, 59 S.Ct. 146, 83 L.Ed. 414; Laughlin v.
