So insisting, they urge upon us that the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for trial anew in accordance therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">Defendant, appellee, conceding that but for the decision and opinion of this court in National Surety Corp. v. Bellah, 5 Cir., 245 F.2d 936, the complained of rulings would be erroneous, urges that case upon us as authority for what was done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">On their part, appellants insist that the Bellah case did not decide, indeed it did not deal with, the situation presented here and that, to the extent that the opinion is critical of <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and departs from the decisions in, and the stream of tendency evidenced by, the Texas cases, State and Federal, cited in Note 2 <em>supra, </em>it was not well decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">We find ourselves in complete agreement with appellants\u2019 view that, under the undisputed testimony in this case, the Bellah case is not in point and therefore not controlling here and that the court erred in the respects claimed. This being so, we will not concern ourselves with deciding or discussing appellants\u2019 secondary point, that that case was not well decided, but will content ourselves with saying that, under the undisputed facts and the settled law of the cases, the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for trial anew and for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-7\">. This judgment gave effect to the findings of the jury as to plaintiff\u2019s injuries and, based thereon, awarded plaintiff compensation payments totalling $5862.-00, and further awarded plaintiff $834.55 in payment of past medical and hospital expenses. It ordered the defendant to pay into the registry of the court $1500 to cover the full cost of any further back surgery that plaintiff might require as a result of the accidental injury; and further gave effect to the jury\u2019s finding that an operation would benefit the plaintiff, and that after such operation she would be totally disabled for another fifty-two weeks, after which time she would suffer permanent partial disability of 25 percent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-8\">.
