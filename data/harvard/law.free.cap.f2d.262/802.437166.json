The record shows that the trial court carefully cautioned appellant, not once but several times, on the number of counts against him; not once but several times, of the maximum punishment permissible under each count, and told him, not once but several times, of his right to counsel. The court had the prosecuting attorney read every one of the counts and required a separate plea to each. All to which appellant pleaded not guilty were subsequently dismissed. The court expressly asked whether appellant pleaded guilty because he knew he was guilty of the offense and not because of any other consideration and appellant at several different stages of the arraignment professed his full and complete guilt. He demurred only to the fact that he was required to \u201ctake the rap\u201d whereas others were also claimed to be guilty. Other matters complained of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>were subject to being waived, and no complaint having been made as to them before his plea of guilty, they are taken as waived. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AojH\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
