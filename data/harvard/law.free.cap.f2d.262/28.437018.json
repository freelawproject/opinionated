The applicants were intervenor radio station WBIR, Inc., Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc., and appellant Tennessee Television, Inc. After a comparative hearing in a consolidated proceeding the Commission granted the application of intervenor and denied the others. The merits of this decision are involved in the appeals of Tennessee Television, Inc., in Nos. 13168 and 13905,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we treat first. Scripps-Howard, Inc., does not pursue an appeal so the contest as to the validity of the grant of intervenor\u2019s application now lies between appellant on the one hand and intervenor and the Commission on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Both appellant and intervenor were found by the Commission to be legally, technically, and financially qualified. The \u25a0Commission accordingly entered upon a \u25a0detailed consideration of their comparative qualifications, in the course of which it gave preferences to appellant in certain areas and to intervenor in other areas. With respect to still other comparative \u25a0criteria in issue the Commission found neither applicant to be superior to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">The principal contention of appellant is that three of the four preferences accorded intervenor \u2014 prior performance as broadcast licensee, prior radio and television experience, and program implementation- \u2014 \u25a0<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stem from the fact that intervenor and its stockholders are already multiple licensees of the Commission, owning various stations in other locations, and that in permitting these preferences to outweigh those accorded appellant \u2014 local ownership, civic participation, diversification of mass media, and diversification of television interests \u2014 the Commission virtually disregarded the diversification and anti-monopoly policy of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">The contention has a certain theoretical soundness. The public interest in diversification of the media of mass communication cannot be nullified by according to an experienced applicant, around whom there is a concentration of such media, preferences attributable to the experience it possesses because of such concentration. On the other hand, a newcomer, such as appellant, holding the advantage of affording a new and independent medium for the dissemination of programs, cannot rest unduly upon this one advantage; it must still compete in other areas which are of importance to the process of final selection by the Commission. Cf. Massachusetts Bay Telecasters, Inc. v. F. C. C., - U.S.App.D.C. -, 261 F.2d 55. It is in these other areas, considered with the preferences of appellant, that we find reasonableness in the Commission\u2019s decision to award the permit to intervenor. In addition to preferring intervenor on integration of own<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>ership with management, n. 2, <em>supra, </em>the Commission, with adequate support in the evidence, also gave a preference to intervenor for more positive correlation between program planning and securing effective cooperation from local groups. There is a basis for considering this a significant weakness in appellant\u2019s case since it is a purely local group and has been accorded a preference on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The diversification of media of communication that would result were the permit granted to appellant does not on the record so clearly warrant selection of appellant in the public interest as to outweigh other public benefits of the award to intervenor, at least to a degree that requires substitution of our judgment for that of the Commission. The Commission weighed all competing considerations, stating that it was apparent appellant was superior not only with regard to diversification but also in local ownership and civic participation; however, the Commission added,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">\u201c[W]e cannot conceive that the ownership by WBIR in Knoxville of a television station can be of such grave concern as to outweigh WBIR\u2019s marked superiority in most other respects.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">This was a conclusion we must recognize as one the Commission could reasonably reach on the record. We find no such neglect of competing and relevant factors as would permit us to disturb the decision under the principles governing our review. The choice of intervenor does not rest simply upon its strength in matters that might be attributable to concentration of media of communication, but in good part upon the relative weakness of appellant in other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The appeal in No. 13507 is from an order of the Commission denying without a hearing appellant\u2019s protest and petition for reconsideration of ex parte action by the Broadcast Bureau of the Commission in granting intervenor\u2019s application for modification of the permit awarded to it in the comparative proceedings. The Commission ruled that appellant had no standing to protest or request reconsideration; that is, that appellant was not a \u201cparty in interest\u201d or a \u201cperson aggrieved or whose interests are adversely affected\u201d within the meaning of the Communications Act. We think this ruling is correct. To have standing to protest the grant of an application for modification of a permit, or to obtain reconsideration of such a grant, one must be adversely affected or aggrieved by the proposed modification itself.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The proposed modifications were (1) to change the location of the antenna supporting tower at the transmitter site 173 feet; (2) to increase the antenna height approximately 65 feet; (3) to change the main studio location within the Knoxville city limits; and (4) to change the type of transmitter, antenna, and other minor pieces of technical equipment. It does not appear how appellant is adversely affected or aggrieved by any of these proposals, since they affect no question involved in the decision favorable to in-tervenor in the comparative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">The case is different from McClatchy Broadcasting Co. v. F. C. C., 99 U.S.App.D.C. 199, 239 F.2d 19, certiorari denied Sacramento Telecasters, Inc. v. McClatchy Broadcasting Co., 353 U.S. 918, 77 S.Ct. 662, 1 L.Ed.2d 665,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because here, in contrast with the situation there, the proposed modifications do not contemplate any such changes as would make the modified permit a new \u201cgrant,\u201d or significantly affect the comparative qualifications of the applicants. The protest proceedings are not concerned with matters that have any impact adverse to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>appellant in respects pertinent to the interest which gave it standing, namely, the interest of an applicant for the permit. That interest does not attach to the protest proceedings so long as the comparative qualifications of the applicants are not affected by the modifications which are the subject of the protest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ao\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-9\">.I. The appeal in No. 13168 is from the original decision of the Commission granting intervenor\u2019s application and denying those of the other applicants. No. 13905 embraces questions concerning modification of the basic decision involved in No. 13168 and is also an appeal from denial of a petition for rehearing which had been filed by Scripps- \u25a0 Howard Radio, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b96-15\">. Intervenor was also preferred as to integration of ownership with management. Appellant contends intervenor was entitled to only a slight preference in this regard, or only to a rating of equality. In no circumstances, it contends, could this factor be decisive since both applicants proposed a relatively high degree of integration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\">. To be \u201cadversely affected or aggrieved\u201d is synonymous with being a \u201cparty in interest.\u201d Camden Radio v. F. C. C., 94 U.S.App.D.C. 312, 220 F.2d 191, 194; Granik v. F. C.

It goes without saying that if there are known to the parties or should come to their knowledge, any circumstances outside the record before us which might affect the validity of the Commission\u2019s decision, they will be brought promptly to the attention of the court.

Federal Communications Comm., 1956, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 199, 239 F.2d 19, certiorari denied Sacramento Telecasters, Inc. v. McClatchy Broadcasting Co., 1957, 353 U.S. 918, 77 S.Ct. 662, 1 L.Ed.2d 665. I read that case to hold that an unsuccessful participant in the comparative proceeding for a construction permit has no standing to protest a subsequent modification of the construction permit unless the modification is so substantial as to affect the underlying basis of the original award.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">I dissent, however, from the court\u2019s decision in No. 13168 and No. 13905, affirming the Commission\u2019s award of a construction permit to WBIR for Channel 10, Knoxville, Tennessee. The court recognizes that the source of every preference which the Commission accorded WBIR over Tennessee Television, apart from the preference accorded for integration of management and ownership, arose from the extensive ownership of communications facilities by WBIR stockholders. This genesis is equally true of the preference for \u201ccorrelation between program planning and securing effective cooperation from local groups,\u201d upon which the court so strongly relies in its support of Commission action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I think that by thus attributing to these by-products of concentration a greater degree of importance than it attributes to the traditional, and antipodal, preference for decentralization of ownership of the mass media of communication, the Commission has effectively nullified the diversification arid anti-monopoly policy long since recognized as \u201cone of the basic underlying considerations in the enactment of the Communications Act.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">There may be cases in which the Commission can properly find that experience resulting from an applicant\u2019s ownership of communications facilities offsets a competing applicant\u2019s freedom from ownership of other communication interests. But \u201cCommission expertise alone cannot support so pivotal [a divergence]\u201d from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>basic communications philosophy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A convincing explanation is required.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That explanation is not to be found in the one offered by the Commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-4\">\u201cThus, with regard to the factor of diversification, we cannot conceive that the ownership by WBIR in Knoxville of a television station can be of such grave concern as to outweigh WBIR\u2019s marked superiority in most other respects.\u201d</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-8\">. The preference for \u201ccorrelation between program planning and securing effective cooperation from local groups\u201d is, in fact, identical to the preference for \u201cprogram implementation,\u201d cited by the court as an incident of concentration. Program implementation was not in itself a category utilized by the Commission as a basis for comparison in the combined hearings below. Rather, program implementation was considered under the more general heading of \u201cprogram plans.\u201d Under the latter heading, the Commission had found that no preference existed between WBIR and Tennessee TV as to their \u201cprogram proposals,\u201d another sub-topic of \u201cprogram plans.\u201d The Commission had found, however, that WBIR had more fully attempted to implement its proposals by securing the cooperation of local groups. It therefore accorded WBIR a preference on the broad category of \u201cprogram plans.\u201d But WBIR\u2019s ability to implement effectively its program plans followed directly as a result of the contacts which WBIR previously had made in radio broadcasting operations, and therefore resulted directly from WBIR\u2019s ownership of other mass media of communication.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-13\">.
