An accident occurred when Willie Perry, an employee of Bundy Bros. Milling Company, assisted two of Pillsbury\u2019s employees in unloading corn from Bundy\u2019s truck into Pillsbury\u2019s plant. Perry filed suit against Pillsbury and the two employees to recover for serious injuries on the ground that the accident was due to the alleged negligence of Pillsbury\u2019s servants or to the negligent use by Pillsbury of defective machinery. Bundy Bros. Milling Company is covered by a policy of liability insurance issued by defendant and this action seeks a declaratory judgment holding that defendant is obligated to defend the action against Pillsbury and otherwise determining the obligations of plaintiff and defendant under their respective policies. The District Court entered judgment declaring defendant to be under no liability to defend the action against Pillsbury.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Defendant\u2019s policy contained an exclusion clause which stated: \u201cThis Policy Does Not Apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">\u201c(c) under Coverage A, to bodily injury to or sickness, disease or death of any employee of the Insured while engaged in the employment, other than domestic, of the Insured * * *\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">The omnibus clause of defendants\u2019 policy defines the term \u201cInsured\u201d to include the named insured, namely, Bundy Bros. Milling Company, the employer of the man injured, and any person or organization legally responsible for the use of a car with the permission of the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">There is no ambiguity in the exclusion clause of defendant\u2019s policy and no inconsistency is shown between this and other clauses of the instrument. It does not require construction. All that is required is enforcement according to the terms clearly expressed in the instrument. Pillsbury and its employees are not insured under defendant\u2019s policy unless they are included as additional persons insured under the omnibus clause. Neither is plaintiff a party to defendant\u2019s policy. Plaintiff is not entitled under defendant\u2019s contract with Bundy Bros. Milling Company to have its possible liability under its own contract with Pillsbury imposed upon defendant. The true construction of defendant\u2019s policy is that no employee of the named insured engaged in the named insured\u2019s business can recover against anyone included as an additional insured. Birrenkott v. McManamay, 65 S.D. 581, 276 N.W. 725. In accord is Lumber Mutual Casualty Insurance Company of New York v. Stukes, 4 Cir., 164 F.2d 571, 573, opinion by Judge John J. Parker. Speaking for the court, Judge Parker said: \u201cThere can be no question that the purpose was to apply the exclusion to employees of an additional insured as well as to those of the named assured * *</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">It would serve no useful purpose to repeat the findings and conclusions stated by the District Court in a carefully drawn memorandum which discusses in detail the applicable authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">Upon the grounds stated and reasons given in its memorandum opinion, findings of fact and conclusions of law, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-14\">. The parties will be denominated as in the court below.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
