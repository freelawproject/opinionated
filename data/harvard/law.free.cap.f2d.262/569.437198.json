But that aside, that defense, for lack of substantial evidence, was properly overruled and withheld from the jury. On the issue of proximate cause, examination of the record discloses substantial evidence that the sudden inward movement of the draft was caused by an override in the up-and-down cable. The question was one properly submitted to the jury. Finally, we hold, the plaintiff\u2019s rights under the New York Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law were irrelevant to a determination of his damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
