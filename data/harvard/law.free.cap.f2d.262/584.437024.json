Miller, for $17,772.-61, the amount of taxes overpaid by the taxpayers for the year 1947; but disallowed claims for refund of taxes to Mr. and Mrs. Miller for the years 1948, 1949 and 1950. The district judge followed the holding of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Osenbach v. Commissioner, 198 F.2d 235, holding that while ordinarily the gain of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>taxpayer from sale or exchange of a claim or chose in action is taxable as capital gain, the gain of the taxpayer resulting from the <em>collection </em>of a claim or chose in action is taxable as ordinary income. He applied that doctrine to the instant case. He held, further, that in actions of this kind the burden lies with the taxpayer. The judge cited Lewis v. Reynolds, 284 U.S. 281, 52 S.Ct. 145, 76 L.Ed. 293, holding that a taxpayer is not entitled to a refund unless he has overpaid his taxes, and then only to the extent that his taxes have been overpaid. He, therefore, disallowed claims of the taxpayers for refunds for the years 1948, 1949 and 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">For the reasons stated in the memorandum opinion of District Judge Shel-bourne, D.C., 155 F.Supp. 767, his judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
