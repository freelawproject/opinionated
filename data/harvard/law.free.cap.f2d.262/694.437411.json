The threatened withholding was alleged by appellant to arise from a claim by the Department of the Army that the sums, the return of which had been requested, had been mistakenly paid to appellant. The District Court dismissed the complaint on the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">Upon the authority of Mine Safety Appliances Co. v. Forrestal, 326 U.S. 371, 66 S.Ct. 219, 90 L.Ed. 140, we think that in effect the suit was one against the United States to which it had not consented, and that accordingly the dismissal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
