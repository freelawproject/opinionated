A car driven by the defendant injured the minor plaintiff, a somewhat handicapped 8-year old boy. The boy was crossing the street and was more than half-way across when the defendant\u2019s car struck him. The driver of a car traveling in the opposite direction had seen the boy and had stopped his car in time to avoid striking him. We think it was error to direct a verdict for the defendant at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-28\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
