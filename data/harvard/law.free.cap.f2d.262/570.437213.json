The court below granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, in an unreported memorandum decision, upon the ground that the employer\u2019s liability was governed solely by the provisions of the Connecticut Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The Connecticut legislature has provided that its Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act shall be the sole avenue for recovery for an employee sustaining a personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. Conn. Gen.Stat. of 1949, section 7419. Unless tuberculosis arises out of the employment, it is not a compensable disease. Madeo v. I. Dibner Bros., Inc., 121 Conn. 664, 186 A. 616, 105 A.L.R. 1408. However, the plaintiff\u2019s claim was based not upon the tubercular condition, concededly not traceable to the conditions of employment, but upon a nonfeasance, the negligent failure to warn. In no Connecticut case has it been expressly decided that nonfeasance may amount to an \u201caccidental injury which may be definitely located as to the time when and the place where the accident occurred * * Conn. Gen.Stat.1955 Supp., section 3037d. But the aggravation, in the course of employment, of a nonoccupational disease has been held to be compensable under the Act. Cashman v. McTernan School, 130 Conn. 401, 34 A.2d 874. And we think Judge Smith was correct in reasoning that the failure to inspect the X ray plates carefully and promptly to warn the plaintiff sufficiently located \u201cthe accidental injury as to the time when and place where the accident occurred\u201d or, in the alternative, that the continuing failure to warn constituted \u201crepetitive acts incident\u201d to the employment for which compensation is available. The judge\u2019s earlier, and contrary, decision in Wiblyi v. General Motors Corp., unreported, Civil No. 4519, D.C.Conn. (1953), was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
