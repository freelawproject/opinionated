The final paragraph in the deed reads: \u201cAll the coal and other minerals in this deed is excepted &amp; conveyed in this deed to Joel Ratliff with a right of way for all roads and tramways that is necessary for working said coal and other minerals * * *. This is by agreement with both parties.\u201d The question involved is whether Joel Ratliff acquired title by this deed to the coal and other minerals in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-23\">Appellants contend that he did not, because (1) he was not named as a grantee in the caption of the deed, and (2) the words under consideration attempted to reserve and except from the real estate conveyed the coal and other minerals, not to the grantor, but to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>stranger to the deed, which can not he done under the well settled common law in Kentucky. Flynn v. Fike, 291 Ky. 316, 321, 164 S.W.2d 470. The District Judge rejected these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">It is not necessary to the validity of a deed that the grantee be named in the caption, provided he is specifically designated in the body of the deed. Hall v. Wright, 137 Ky. 39, 46, 127 S.W. 516; Newton v. McKay, 29 Mich. 1; Berry v. Billings, 44 Me. 416, 423. See also: Perkins v. J. M. Robinson, Norton &amp; Co., Ky., 124 S.W. 310, 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">As pointed out by the District Judge, the present deed used words of conveyance in addition to the exception and must be upheld on the authority of Babb v. Dowdy, 229 Ky. 767, 17 S.W.2d 1014. Compare: Flynn v. Fike, supra, 291 Ky. 316, 322, 164 S.W.2d 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">It is ordered that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
