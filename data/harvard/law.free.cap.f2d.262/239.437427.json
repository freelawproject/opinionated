An injured person sued him and Call Carl. The present suit is between the insurers of the two defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-23\">Appellee, Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Group, was Kilmer\u2019s insurer. His cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>erage included driving a car \u201ctemporarily used as a substitute\u201d because of repairs etc., with a \u201ccondition\u201d that, \u201cthe insurance with respect to temporary substitute automobiles * * * shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Appellant, Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp., Ltd., was Call Carl\u2019s insurer. Its policy defined \u201cInsured\u201d as including not only the named Insured but also \u201cany person while using an owned automobile * * * with the permission of the named Insured * * It provided that <em>\u201cIf other valid insurance exists </em>protecting the Insured from liability * * * this policy shall be null and void with respect to such specific hazard otherwise covered, whether the Insured is specifically named in such other policy or not; provided, however, that if the applicable limit of liability of this policy exceeds the applicable limit of liability of such other valid insurance, then this policy shall apply as excess insurance against such hazard in an amount equal to the applicable limit of liability of this policy minus the applicable limit of liability of such other valid insurance.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Appellant Employers\u2019 sued appellee Fireman\u2019s for a declaratory judgment that appellee\u2019s coverage was primary and appellant\u2019s secondary. We think appellant\u2019s coverage was primary and the District Court was right in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The \u201cexcess insurance\u201d which appellee provided with respect to \u201csubstitute\u201d cars was excess insurance only. Where a substitute car is concerned, unless damage exceeds the dollar limit in appellant\u2019s policy, appellee\u2019s policy is not \u201cother valid insurance\u201d.
