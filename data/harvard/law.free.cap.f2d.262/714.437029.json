The total damage was stated at $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-15\">Judgment was entered on the District\u2019s motion for summary judgment in its favor with an affidavit of its Property Clerk that his records showed that the United States Marshal\u2019s office set plaintiff\u2019s belongings on the sidewalk space and notified the Police Department of its action, that the Police Department had the belongings removed by its contractor to the storage warehouse in question which was under the supervision of the Property Clerk. The order dismissed the complaint as to the District of Columbia on the ground that the alleged damage \u201cresulted from the performance of a governmental function by the District of Columbia\u201d for which it is not liable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-16\">On motion of the landlord and his agent, the Bank, for summary judgment in their favor, because there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and they were therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> dismissal as to them was granted. The ground \u2014 lack of any evidence of negligence by the owner and the Bank \u2014 was apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>this part of the plaintiff\u2019s answer to interrogatories :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-4\">\u201cQ. Do you have any witnesses, Mrs. Wilson, as to the negligence of the National Metropolitan Bank and its agents, [or] Captain Bittinger, in removing your property from 1519 26th Street, Northwest, May 26, 1954? <em>A. </em>No. I was away, out of town. I do not know who stored it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">That was the argument of these defendants in their Points and Authorities in Support of Motion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-6\">\u201c4. There was no negligence on the part of these Defendants in the supervision of the removal of Plaintiff\u2019s furniture and furnishings from her former home when she was evicted by the U. S. Marshal for the District of Columbia.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">The case raises narrow problems of law relating to municipal liability for acts of its agents and the responsibility of litigants for negligence of governmental enforcement officers in executing judgments. Their solution depends largely upon the facts. The record does not make clear several situations that may create or avoid liability for the respective appellees. We shall attempt to make specific our objections to deciding these issues on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">First, we consider the record as to the liability of the landlord, Captain Bittinger, and his agents. The appellant was out of town when the property was removed. She was in the apartment for 14 days, leaving three days before the eviction. She deposed that she had witnesses to the property\u2019s condition before and after removal and storage; that it was damaged by removal. Witnesses were available as to conditions and those who carried out the removal and storage. If appellees could be liable at law for such negligence, we think those facts would establish a triable issue as to negligence in removing or storing. The movants had the burden of showing quite clearly what the truth was.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-15\">Appellant charged that the landlord through the Bank and its employees was negligent in removing the articles to the sidewalk. The Property Clerk of the District deposed that his records showed the United States Marshal\u2019s Office set out the property on the sidewalk and the Police Department transported it. If the Marshal\u2019s office, acting within the Municipal Court\u2019s orders, negligently damaged the property in moving it to the sidewalk, neither the landlord nor the Bank is liable for the results of this negligence unless the landlord or the Bank participated in the wrongful act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5The eviction by order was strictly a governmental function, a carrying out of judicial administration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Marshals are themselves responsible for their negligent acts, not the sovereignty or the courts for whom these officers act in carrying out such orders as restitution of property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When municipalities act to carry out their functions of government as distinct from proprietary acts, they are not liable for the negligence of their agents. While a municipality\u2019s freedom from liability is being more narrowly construed by the courts, the rule of non-liability for negligence in the exercise of the strict functions of government is unimpaired.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As in gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>ernmental nonliability for actions of a marshal in executing the restitution, a successful litigant who takes no part either himself or by his agents in the eviction should be protected. The notice of these defendants on their motion for judgment indicates some supervision of removal by the landlord\u2019s agents. The Marshal is not the agent of the parties but a part of the judicial system. In this case the allegation is that the landlord\u2019s agents, not the Marshal, negligently placed the furnishings on the sidewalk. On a new trial it can be determined whether under the allegations the landlord or the Bank or the agents \u25a0of either are responsible for any damage, and who it was that actually managed the eviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Second. The liability of the District is predicated partly upon the allegation that the Marshal damaged the property by the negligent manner in which he had it removed by a police contractor from the sidewalk to the storage warehouse. The District Property Clerk, deposing for appellees, say the Police Department removed it from this public space after notification from the Marshal. If the District, through its agents other than the Marshal\u2019s office, removed the property from a public space, it may have been to clear the sidewalks \u2014 a proceeding that is part of the city housekeeping responsibility \u2014 and in that case the District would be liable for any damage done.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">If the damage occurred after delivery to the Property Clerk, we have a different situation. Unlike the street clearing responsibilities of the municipality, the actions of the Property Clerk are directed by statute. District Code (1952) \u00a7 4-151 to 168. Section 4-156 (c) provides that the Property Clerk \u201cshall not be liable in damages for any official action performed hereunder in good faith.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Without evidence as to control of the movement from the sidewalk to the warehouse, we should not undertake to determine the liability of the District for any resulting damage in this removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">The District is also charged with damage from negligence in storing the appellant\u2019s goods in the District\u2019s warehouse. The record does not show the conditions and purposes under which the warehouse is operated by the District. It may be that the Property Clerk merely deposits articles in a private warehouse. It may be operated by the Property Clerk as a part of his function or it may be a city facility for storage of goods, in custodia legis, with or without a charge for services.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">Under the allegations of this complaint and the facts before the court, the plaintiff-appellant was entitled to a trial to show whether her property was negligently damaged by defendants or any of them and if so to recover from any defendant who might be liable in law for its negligence or that of its servants for whom it is responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>The judgments of the District Court are vacated and the case remanded to the District Court for trial in the light of the above comments and such other evidence as the District Court shall consider pertinent to the issues.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-12\">.
