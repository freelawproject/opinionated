The court below directed a verdict in favor of Bucyrus-Erie. Jurisdiction is based on diversity and the law of Pennsylvania governs. The record demonstrates a failure of proof in two vital respects: first, there was lack of evidence to prove that the hook complained of was supplied by Bucyrus-Erie Company; second, there was no adequate evidence from which the jury would have been entitled to find that the use of the kind of hook, which the plaintiff asserts was employed, constituted negligence under the circumstances. Consequently the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
