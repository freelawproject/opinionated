By its decision reported at 119 N.L.R.B. No. 88, the Board determined that the respondent Union (Locals 1408, 1408-A and 1597, International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, Independent, and Dave Kennedy, their Agent, respondents) had violated Sections 8(b) (2) and (1) (A) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(b) (1) (A), (b) (2) by causing the Employer, Kaufman Shipping Company, to discriminate against Turner in employment as a longshoreman on the Jacksonville waterfront because he was not a member of the Union. There can be no question that Kennedy, the Business Agent, and one in a position authoritatively to bind the Union, categorically declared that Union members (\u201cmen with cards\u201d) were to be given an absolute preference in hiring. Whether the Employer\u2019s representative (Reddick) took the action he did because of the Union\u2019s declaration, or whether Turner was hired and then fired on January 10 and denied employment on January 11, were all controverted issues of fact turning primarily on credibility. On a record of substantial evidence considered as a whole these determinations were for the Board, and there it ends. N. L. R. B. v.
