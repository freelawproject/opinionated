Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7, 7422, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422. It covers the period May 1, 1951, to April 30, 1952. Appellant sold growing crops on leased land. The land had been leased for more than six months. Plaintiff sold the growing crops and the lease to the same party in one transaction and returned the profit as long term capital gain. The Commissioner accepted the taxpayer\u2019s return showing capital gain on the sale of the farm leases; accepted the taxpayer\u2019s return listing as ordinary income the proceeds of the sale of harvested crops on the leased land, but refused to accept the taxpayer\u2019s treatment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>proceeds of unharvested crops on leased land as capital gain. The Commissioner determined the deficiency; the taxpayer paid it; claimed a refund; and, when the claim was rejected, filed this action below.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Section 117(j) (3) of the Int.Rev.Code of 1939 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">\u201cIn the ease of an unharvested crop on <em>land </em>used in the trade or business and held for more than 6 months, if the crop and the <em>land </em>are sold or exchanged * * * at the same time and to the same person, the crop shall be considered as \u2018property used in the trade or business.\u2019 \u201d Int.Rev.Code of 1939 as amended by ch. 521, \u00a7 323(a) (2), 65 Stat. 500, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 117(j) (3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The word <em>\u201cland\u201d </em>above is emphasized because of its interpretation by the Government under Treasury Regulations 111, promulgated under the Int.Rev.Code of 1939, \u00a7 29.117-7, which concludes with the words: \u201cA leasehold or estate for years is not \u2018land\u2019 for the purpose of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Following the regulation interpreting the statute, the Commissioner held the proceeds of unharvested crops were taxable as ordinary income, because, while all other prerequisites of \u00a7 117(j) (3) had been met, the unharvested crops were on a \u201cleasehold\u201d and not on \u201cland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A1Mr\">The sole legal question is whether the net profit from the sale of such crops must be taxed as ordinary income or as capital gain. The subsidiary question is whether a \u201cleasehold\u201d is \u201cland,\u201d as that term is used in the statute. The district court held it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-18\">The case was tried below on a written stipulation of facts. Thus factual issues do not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-19\">The district court carefully discussed the Tax Court cases which had first met this issue,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2and how, after the 1951 amendment adding paragraph three to subsection \u201cj\u201d of section 117 of the 1939 Code, the tax cases were reviewed by the fifth, tenth and ninth circuits<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But no cases were found on the precise question here involved, <em>i. e., </em>is a leasehold \u201cland\u201d ?</p>\n<p id=\"b674-20\">A discussion of the precise language used in the statute followed in the district court\u2019s opinion, and the lack of any definition therein was considered. In view of such lack of definition in the Revenue Act itself, the district court discussed the law of California, the state in which the problem arose, and concluded that leases or estates for years do not come within the term \u201cland.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ***How-ever, the Supreme Court has held the state definition of \u201cland\u201d is \u25a0 immaterial, Watson v. Com\u2019r, 1953, 345 U.S. 544, 551, 73 S.Ct. 848, 852, 97 L.Ed. 1232, stating: \u201cWhether or not the crop be real property, the federal income tax upon the gain resulting from its sale is, in its nature, a subject of federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-21\">The district court then examined Senate and House reports, and the congressional debates, and found nothing which caused it to change its view \u00e1s to the plain meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-22\">We are in agreement with the trial court. It may be argued that when Congress enacted \u00a7 117(j) (3) in 1951, it intended to refer to \u201cunharvested crops on land or leaseholds used * * * and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>held * * * \u201d etc. But it did not say-so. It said \u201con land.\u201d Had it intended to apply to crops on land, whether fee or leasehold, it would have been an easy thing to have said so. Or it could have granted the farmer capital gain treatment on all crops; or all unharvested crops, had this been its intention. But it enacted a law, not applicable to all unharvested crops sold, but only on unharvested crops on land held more than six months, and sold or exchanged at the same time and to the same person.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Appellant earnestly urges that the lower court\u2019s decision interprets \u201cland\u201d to mean \u201cfee land\u201d; that this is adding to the statute, which courts may not do \u2014 they may interpret, but not legislate. Whether we rule that the term \u201cland\u201d <em>excludes </em>leaseholds, as the government urges, or <em>includes </em>leaseholds, as appellant urges, it seems to us we are asked to do precisely the same thing, <em>i. e., </em>interpret the word used. Each side asserts the term, as used in the statute and undefined therein, must be interpreted ; but each in its way and to its own advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Appellant likewise emphasizes the \u201chardship, injustice, confusion, contradiction, absurdity and wholly unreasonable result\u201d because of the district court\u2019s decision, putting tenant farmers in one category and fee land farmers in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">In interpreting, which we feel we must do in any event, we are constrained to keep in mind several things. The first is that capital gain tax treatment is not a matter of right, but of legislative grace. The Congress provides for it, and however little or much relief is given from taxes payable on ordinary income, the taxpayer must accept. As the district court said: \u201cIf inequities exist, such inequities must be corrected by Congress and not by judicial legislation.\u201d [157 F.Supp. 158.]</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The second factor we must remember is that the Supreme Court has told us that \u201cin order for such income (un-matured crops) to be a capital gain, an affirmative statement by Congress was needed.\u201d Watson v. Com\u2019r, supra, 345 U.S. at page 548, 73 S.Ct. at page 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">The somewhat analogous matter of whether gains from hedging transactions could be considered by the taxpayer as capital gain rather than ordinary income was before the Supreme Court in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Com\u2019r, 1955, 350 U.S. 46, 76 S.Ct. 20, 100 L.Ed. 29. That case involves commodities and not land, but does interpret \u00a7 117 of the Int.Rev.Code of 1939. The Court there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-12\">\u201c[T]he capital-asset provision of \u00a7 117 must not be so broadly applied as to defeat rather than further the purpose of Congress. Burnet v. Harmel, 287 U.S. 103, 108, 53 S.Ct. 74, 76, 77 L.Ed. 199. Congress intended that profits and losses arising from the everyday operation of a business be considered as ordinary income or loss rather than capital gain or loss. The preferential treatment provided by \u00a7 117 applies to transactions in property which are not the normal source of business income. It was intended \u2018to relieve the taxpayer from * * excessive tax burdens on gains resulting from a conversion of capital investments, and to remove the deterrent effect of those burdens on such conversions.\u2019 Burnet v. Har-mel, 287 U.S. at page 106, 53 S.Ct. at page 75. Since this section is an exception from the normal tax requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, the definition of a capital asset must be narrowly applied and its exclusions interpreted broadly. This is necessary to effectuate the basic congressional purpose. This Court has always construed narrowly the term \u2018capital assets\u2019 in \u00a7 117. See Hort v. Commissioner, 313 U.S. 28, 31, 61 S.Ct. 757, 758, 85 L.Ed. 1168; Kieselbach v. Commissioner, 317 U.S. 399, 403, 63 S.Ct. 303, 305, 87 L.Ed. 358, 350 U.S. at page 52, 76 S.Ct. at page 24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">Surely the net proceeds of the sale of a farmer\u2019s harvested crops ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>narily are ordinary income. Did Congress without question intend to permit the sale of unharvested crops growing on any leasehold, and no matter what the value of that leasehold might be as compared to the value of the crops themselves, and whether the sale occurs a day or a week or a month before harvest time to change ordinary income to capital gain? Did Congress intend to permit a farmer, if he wills, to change ordinary income into a capital gain by a simple contractual transaction? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">We recognize in this case, as the trial court also recognized, that the sale was made in good faith; the leases had several years to run; and appellants were retiring from the farming business. Furthermore, the amount received for the leases was <em>more </em>than the gain on the sale of the growing crops.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Yet (and this is the third factor we must keep in mind) we must consider the general effect of any interpretation here enunciated, as well as the consequences of the interpretation in the specific matter before us.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">As to the claimed \u201cunfairness\u201d existing in the peculiar circumstances of this case, the farmer who sells his unharvested crop when he sells his land held in fee simple, but has held it <em>less </em>than six months, is also treated \u201cunfairly\u201d in comparison to the same farmer who has held it <em>more </em>than six months. And so is the farmer who sells his unharvested crop to one person and his fee simple land to another person, even though the land has been held <em>more </em>than six months. Yet in both cases his claim of unfairness rests on his failure to bring his transaction within the provisions of the statute, which the Congress, in its wisdom, has seen fit to make the law of this land.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">There are many reasons in equity why this appellant should be entitled to receive the same tax treatment on the sale of growing crops on \u201cleased land\u201d as the taxpayer who sells growing crops on \u201cland\" he owns outright. But the Congress, in exercising its grace, has not yet clearly gotten around to accomplishing that. And we cannot do it for the Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-8\">. Watson v.
