The court found, also, that the failure of the Steamer and its operators to take any effective measures earlier than were taken to x'educe her speed, upon observance that the bridge was closed, proximately caused and contributed to the Carrollton\u2019s striking of the buoy and to her disability and consequent damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-15\">It appears from the clear and logical reasoning of United States District Judge Paul Jones in his opinion and from his findings of fact and conclusions of law that his judgment was correct, both upon the basis of the entire evidence in the case and upon the applicable Admiralty law.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-16\">The judgment of the district court is, accordingly, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
