Terris, Attorneys, Department of Justice, with whom Messrs. Harold D. Koffsky, Philip R. Monahan, and Plato C. Cacheris, Attys., Dept. of Justice, were on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b762-7\">Before Edgerton, Chief Judge, and Prettyman and Danaher, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b762-8\">EDGERTON, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">The appellant was convicted of violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 by \u201cwilfully\u201d failing to register as agent of a foreign government and \u201cwilfully\u201d acting as agent without registering. 52 Stat. 631, as amended, 22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 612, 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">In the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement he referred not only to competent evidence, which was duly introduced, but also to evidence that the appellant had \u201cdenied any knowledge of the disappearance of a Columbia University Professor named Jesus de Galindez, except that which he had read in the newspapers.\u201d Over appellant\u2019s objection the prosecutor said there would be testimony about a \u201cstrange adventure * * * that Mr. Frank engaged in on behalf of Trujillo and the Dominican Republic. You will recall that he denied to Agent Woodcock that he had ever met Murphy except on one occasion. * * * We will show that in behalf of the agency relationship, he worked with Murphy, he rented an airplane, was flown down to the Dominican Republic, contrary to the statement to the agent that he only met Murphy on one occasion, we will show that he had met Murphy on several other occasions.\u201d Over objection the prosecutor introduced evidence which implied that appellant was connected with the disappearance of the Dominican exile Galindez and the aviator Gerald Murphy. The prosecutor did not say those men were murdered, but their disappearance in circumstances that suggested murder was a matter of common knowledge. No doubt for that reason, the court admonished the jurors not to read about a scheduled press conference of Congressman Porter, and asked them whether they had heard a conversation in the courtroom during a recess between reporters and a man who was not identified to the jury, but was identified to the court, as the father of Murphy.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">In his closing argument the prosecutor referred repeatedly to testimony linking appellant with Murphy, the Linden Airport, and the Galindez affair. He referred, for example, to \u201cfixing up that plane for that strange mission\u201d and to appellant\u2019s being \u201cinvolved with * * * Murphy, and these mysterious airplane deals.\u201d He said: \u201cThe testimony that we put in relative to the incident around Linden Airport we felt <em>in </em>a sense was <em>broad beyond the case. We felt we had our case in before that </em>through Mrs. Newcomer and Mrs. Frederick and the other witnesses. But let me tell you how the Government feels that those activities up there were an example of the defendant acting at the behest of the Dominican Republic and Trujillo.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Further references to the Galindez-Murphy affair followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>The government argues that if appellant lied to an FBI agent in response to questions about Murphy, \u201cthat fact was in turn the legitimate basis for an inference of consciousness of guilt on appellant\u2019s part and a pertinent consideration for the jury to take into account in determining the willfulness <em>vel non </em>of his failure to register.\u201d But the probative value of the evidence about the Galindez-Murphy affair was too slight and its prejudicial tendency too great to justify its introduction. \u201cAlthough sensational and shocking evidence may be relevant, it has an objectionable tendency to prejudice the jury. It is, therefore, incompetent unless the exigencies of proof make it necessary or important that the case be proved that way. There was no such need here.\u201d United States v. 88 Cases, More or Less, Containing Bireley\u2019s Orange Beverage, 3 Cir., 187 F.2d 967, 975. We reverse appellant\u2019s convictions on the ground that the prosecutor\u2019s attempt to connect him in the jury\u2019s minds with the Galindez-Murphy affair deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b763-6\">PRETTYMAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A9o\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">I think Frank was not deprived of a fair trial. The issue was whether Frank was an agent of the Dominican Republic (or of Trujillo). The Government proved that Frank told an F.B.I. agent he had met a man named Murphy only once. The Government proved that Murphy, with known Dominicans, was engaged in certain enterprises in this country, and it further proved that Frank was with these people in the initial stages of the enterprises. I think the Government employed legitimate trial tactics. That the enterprises were notorious and well-publicized could not deprive the Government of its right to prove that Frank had lied about his acquaintanceship with Murphy, who was connected with or engaged in behalf of the Dominican Republic. I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
