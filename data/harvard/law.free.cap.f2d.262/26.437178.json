Kennedy, who was then about 80 years of age. They lived together until the spring of 1950, when a separation occurred. Negotiations for a financial settlement immediately began between the attorneys for the parties and culminated in an agreement dated and signed March 15, 1951. By its terms, the wife acknowledged the payment of $50,000 in satisfaction of all claims against her husband and his estate for support, maintenance, alimony or necessaries, and also in satisfaction of any claims she might have against Mary K. Nelms and Ida H. Sisson, relatives of .her husband who she \u201cinferred\u201d had been influential in breaking up the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-24\">The husband died' in August, 1953, and on October 1, 1956, Mrs. Kennedy filed this suit against his executors and beneficiaries. She sought to set aside the settlement contract as fraudulently obtained, to enjoin an immediate distribution of her husband\u2019s estate, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>obtain her distributable share as though .there had been no settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">After taking Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s deposition, in which she disclaimed reliance upon the alleged fraud, the defendants moved for and were granted summary .judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">We have carefully examined the record and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
