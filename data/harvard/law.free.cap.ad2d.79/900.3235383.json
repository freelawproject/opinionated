Motion granted, without costs, and appeal dismissed. In view of the restoring of the case to the Trial Calendar for further hearings on the issue of the degree of claimant\u2019s disability, the board\u2019s decision is clearly nonfinal and therefore not appealable <em>(Matter of Huffman v Lake City Contr. Corp., </em>74 AD2d 989). Moreover, no dispositive threshold legal issue is presented <em>(Matter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number><em>of McDowell v La Voy, </em>59 AD2d 995). In the event an award is ultimately made, appellants may appeal such final board determination and obtain review of the issue of knowledge under subdivision 8 of section 15 at that time (see <em>Matter of Huffman, supra; Matter of Harris v Carborundum Co., </em>72 AD2d 869). Mahoney, P. J., Sweeney, Kane, Main and Mikoll, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
