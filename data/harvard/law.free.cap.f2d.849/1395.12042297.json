Kelley contends that the court should have dismissed the indictment with prejudice. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-15\">In August 1987 Kelley was indicted on two counts of making false statements to the Veterans Administration in connection with the receipt of pension benefits and one count of fraudulent receipt of pension benefits. On September 16, 1987 Kelley entered a plea of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-19\">On December 3 Kelley moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the government had failed to comply with the requirements of the Speedy Trial Act. The government conceded that it had violated the Speedy Trial Act and that the indictment was due to be dismissed. It argued, however, that the indictment should be dismissed without prejudice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1490-20\">On December 8 the district court dismissed the indictment without prejudice. Kelley now appeals, arguing that the court erred by not dismissing her indictment with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-21\">The government argues that Kelley\u2019s appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. It contends that the district court\u2019s order dismissing the indictment is not a final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and that the dismissal is not otherwise ap-pealable. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-22\">In <em>Parr v. United States, </em>351 U.S. 513, 76 S.Ct. 912, 100 L.Ed. 1377 (1956), the Supreme Court faced the question of whether a criminal defendant could appeal the dismissal of his indictment. In that case the government, after having indicted the defendant in one district, obtained a superseding indictment in another district. The government then moved to dismiss the first indictment. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion over the defendant\u2019s objection, and the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-23\">The Fifth Circuit dismissed the defendant\u2019s appeal on the ground that the order dismissing the indictment was not an ap-pealable order. The Supreme Court affirmed. The Court viewed the dismissal of the indictment from two perspectives and concluded that from each perspective the order was not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-24\">The Court first found that the defendant had not been injured by the dismissal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>indictment and that he therefore lacked standing to appeal. 351 U.S. at 516-17, 76 S.Ct. at 914-15. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1491-4\">So far as petitioner\u2019s standing to appeal is concerned it makes no difference whether the dismissal still leaves him open to further prosecution.... The testing of the effect of the dismissal order must abide petitioner\u2019s trial, and only then, if convicted, will he have been aggrieved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1491-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 517, 76 S.Ct. at 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-6\">The Court next viewed the dismissed indictment and the superseding indictment together as parts of a single prosecution. The Court held that the order dismissing the first indictment, when viewed together with the government\u2019s continued prosecution, was not a final order. <em>Id. </em>at 518-19, 76 S.Ct. at 916. The Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the order dismissing the indictment was final because it terminated prosecution under that indictment. It stated: \u201cFinal judgment in a criminal case means sentence. The sentence is the judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518, 76 S.Ct. at 916 (quoting <em>Berman v. United States, </em>302 U.S. 211, 212, 58 S.Ct. 164, 166, 82 L.Ed. 204 (1937)). The Court also held that the order dismissing the indictment was not appealable as a collateral order under <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). 351 U.S. at 519, 76 S.Ct. at 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-7\">The rule that emerges from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Parr </em>is that a criminal defendant may not immediately appeal a district court\u2019s order dismissing an indictment. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Arzate, </em>545 F.2d 481 (5th Cir.1977) (order granting government\u2019s motion to dismiss indictment not appealable); <em>United States v. Day, </em>806 F.2d 1240, 1242 (5th Cir.1986) (\u201cIt is well settled that an order dismissing a criminal indictment without prejudice is not a \u2018final judgment\u2019 under section 1291.\u201d); <em>United States v. Moller-Butcher, </em>723 F.2d 189, 190-91 (1st Cir.1983) (defendant had no standing to appeal the dismissal of indictment); <em>United States v. Lanham, </em>631 F.2d 356, 358 (4th Cir.1980) (dismissal of indictment without prejudice not immediately reviewable). Only after a subsequent conviction can the defendant challenge the indictment\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Parr, </em>351 U.S. at 519, 76 S.Ct. at 916. This rule furthers \u201cthe long-standing statutory policy against piecemeal appeals.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1491-10\">In light of <em>Parr </em>we conclude that a criminal defendant may not immediately appeal when an indictment is dismissed without prejudice for a Speedy Trial Act violation. The Second and Sixth Circuits have reached the same conclusion. <em>See United States v. Reale, </em>834 F.2d 281, 283 (2d Cir.1987); <em>United States v. Bratcher, </em>833 F.2d 69, 71-72 (6th Cir.1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 108 S.Ct. 760, 98 L.Ed. 2d 772 (1988). As the Second Circuit explained in Reale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1491-13\">The right to a speedy trial is meant to protect the defendant from delay, not from the trial itself____ By further delaying the trial, allowing a speedy trial exception to the rule requiring finality of judgments as a predicate for appellate jurisdiction would disserve the very interests the act seeks to protect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1491-15\">834 F.2d at 283. Accordingly, any challenge to the dismissal of the indictment without prejudice must await the defendant\u2019s subsequent conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AjZT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>Because this court lacks jurisdiction, Kelley\u2019s appeal is</p>\n<p id=\"A8g\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1490-16\">. Under the Speedy Trial Act the district court may dismiss the indictment with or without prejudice, depending on a number of factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1491-8\">. There are two flaws in Kelley's argument that the court\u2019s order is appealable as a collateral order under <em>Cohen, </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221. First, the government has not re-indicted Kelley and therefore there is no proceeding that the order of dismissal is collateral to. Kelley simply lacks standing to appeal. <em>See Parr, </em>351 U.S. at 516-17, 76 S.Ct. at 914-15. Second, even if Kelley had been re-indicted the order of dismissal would not be appealable as a collateral order. To be appealable as a collateral order an order must meet three requirements: (1) the order must conclusively determine the disputed question; (2) the order must resolve an important issue separate from the merits; and (3) the order must be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 468, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2457, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978). Because the order dismissing the indictment without prejudice is reviewable on appeal from a subsequent conviction, <em>see Parr, </em>351 U.S. at 519, 76 S.Ct. at 916, it does not satisfy the third requirement. <em>See Reale, </em>834 F.2d at 283.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
