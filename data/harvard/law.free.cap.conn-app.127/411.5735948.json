The board denied the plaintiffs motion to open after it adopted the decision of the appeals referee, which affirmed the decision of the defendant administrator of the Unemployment Compensation Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> finding the plaintiff ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in dismissing his appeal because the board and appeals referee incorrectly determined that he was ineligible for benefits under General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (a) (2) (B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the plaintiffs appeal. The plaintiff began working for United Healthcare Services, Inc. (United), on July 30, 2007, as a senior accountant. On November 10, 2008, United named Debbie Lee its accounting supervi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>sor. When Lee introduced herself to the plaintiff, he told her that the former accounting supervisor and his coworkers did not know proper accounting methods and accused them of fraud.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 9, 2008, Lee held a coaching meeting with the plaintiff to train him in the accounting methods she expected him to employ when completing his accounting reconciliations. When the plaintiff sent Lee his work, however, the final product was different from what they had discussed. On December 11, 2008, Lee identified areas to the plaintiff in which she wanted him to improve, including understanding the reconciliation process. The plaintiff continued to send Lee work that was different from what he had been instructed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">On December 16,2008, Lee sent the plaintiff an e-mail invitation to a department meeting, but the plaintiff replied by stating that he would not attend because he thought United was \u201ctrying to set him up. \u201d On December 18, 2008, Lee sent the plaintiff another e-mail and told him that he needed to complete his reconciliations. One day later she provided the plaintiff with the instructions for completing the reconciliations. The plaintiff was unable to balance the accounts using Lee\u2019s methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">On January 6, 2009, the plaintiffs reconciliations were past due because he was unable to complete his work using the methods Lee had prescribed. Lee sent the plaintiff an e-mail and again explained the methods she wanted him to use. The plaintiff replied to Lee and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>wrote that \u201cyou do not have the technical accounting skills to be a supervisor and that will be your downfall.\u201d Lee responded that she had twenty years of accounting experience, to which the plaintiff wrote that she had twenty years of \u201cnon value added experience non contemporary.\u201d Lee forwarded this series of e-mails to her supervisor and to accounting manager Susan Pascutti. Lee stated that the plaintiff was insubordinate and requested that he be discharged for failure to follow instructions. United discharged the plaintiff for insubordination on the same day that the e-mails were exchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">After he was discharged from his employment, the plaintiff filed for unemployment compensation benefits. On February 9, 2009, the defendant ruled that the plaintiff was ineligible for benefits, pursuant to \u00a7 31-236 (a) (2) (B), because he was \u201cdischarged by United . . . for deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest.\u201d On February 19, 2009, the plaintiff appealed the defendant\u2019s decision to the employment security appeals division, and a hearing was conducted by an appeals referee. The referee dismissed the plaintiffs appeal and affirmed the determination of the defendant, concluding that \u201c[w]hether displaying apoor attitude or making objectionable remarks to the employer constitutes wilful misconduct generally depends on whether the claimant\u2019s conduct is spontaneous or deliberate. . . . The [plaintiffs] January 6, 2009 e-mail remarks were offensive. He did not send them during a heated discussion, and no mitigating circumstances excused his conduct. He merely did not want to follow Lee\u2019s directions. The [plaintiff] directed these e-mails to Lee to personally insult her and undermine her supervisory authority. . . . Thus, the referee finds [that] the [plaintiffs] January 6 e-mails rise to the level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>of wilful misconduct in the course of employment.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">On April 7, 2009, the plaintiff filed an appeal to the board, which adopted the referee\u2019s findings of fact and decision. The boar d also added that \u201c [i]n the case before us, the employer discharged the [plaintiff] immediately after he sent his supervisor two highly insulting and demeaning e-mail messages questioning her accounting and supervisory abilities. . . . [W]e find that the [plaintiff s] refusal to follow the company\u2019s format and his attempt to undermine his supervisor\u2019s authority by challenging her ability to supervise constituted wilful misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The plaintiff filed a motion to open the board\u2019s decision, claiming that he was discharged as a whistle-blower for challenging United\u2019s practices. The board denied the plaintiffs motion to open, and the plaintiff appealed the decision to the Superior Court. The defendant filed a motion for judgment dismissing the plaintiffs appeal, which the court granted on January 21, 2010. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The plaintiffs sole claim is that the court improperly dismissed his appeal of the board\u2019s decision because the board and appeals referee incorrectly concluded that he was ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-236 (a) (2) (B). \u201cIn appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>under . . . [General Statutes] \u00a7 31-249b,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Superior Court does not retry the facts or hear evidence but rather sits as an appellate court to review only the record certified and filed by the board of review. . . . The court is bound by the findings of subordinate facts and reasonable factual conclusions made by the appeals referee where . . . the board of review adopted the findings and affirmed the decision of the referee. . . . Judicial review of the conclusions of law reached administratively is also limited. The court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the board . . . has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Nonetheless, issues of law afford a reviewing court a broader standard of review when compared to a challenge to the factual findings of the referee.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Marquand </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>124 Conn. App. 75, 79, 3 A.3d 172 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">In our review of the record, we conclude that the court properly dismissed the plaintiffs appeal because the board and appeals referee did not act arbitrarily or illegally, nor did they abuse their discretion in finding that the plaintiff was ineligible for benefits under \u00a7 31-236 (a) (2) (B) for behavior constituting wilful misconduct in the course of employment. United\u2019s decision to terminate the plaintiffs employment was precipitated by the plaintiffs sending disparaging e-mails to Lee. The appeals referee concluded, and the board agreed, that the e-mails that the plaintiff sent to Lee insulted her personally and undermined her supervisory authority, and, therefore, his actions rose to the level of wilful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>misconduct in the course of employment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is sufficient evidence in the record to support this finding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-8\"> The plaintiffs former employer, United Healthcare Services, Inc., and the board were originally named as defendants. Only the named defendant is a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b440-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAn individual shall be ineligible for [unemployment compensation] benefits . . . (2) . . . (B) if, in the opinion of the administrator, the individual has been discharged or suspended for . . . wilful misconduct in the course of the individual\u2019s employment . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\"> On April 28,2008, United\u2019s previous accounting supervisor, Ann Howard, issued the plaintiff a corrective action plan because he was not performing his professional responsibilities, namely, accounting reconciliations, according to her directions. The plaintiff notified the company\u2019s management that he believed Howard used improper accounting methods, but Tim Tuohy, United\u2019s controller, and Susan Pascutt i, United\u2019s accounting manger, advised the plaintiff that he was unable to balance the reconciliations because he was not doing them correctly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\"> The referee also concluded that \u201cthe [plaintiff] engaged in ongoing improper conduct. The employer has the right to establish and enforce performance standards in order to achieve an effective operation of the business. Management has the prerogative of monitoring and criticizing the job performance of its employees. ... An employee\u2019s deliberate failure to follow an employer\u2019s reasonable request or order constitutes wilful misconduct where the employee does not have good cause to refuse. ... No evidence demonstrates [that United\u2019s previous accounting supervisor, Ann] Howard or Lee used improper accounting methods. The [plaintiffs] inability to balance the reconciliations is not a compelling reason for his refusing to follow Lee\u2019s instructions to improve his job performance or attend her meetings.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b444-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-249b provides in relevant part: \u201cAt any time before the board\u2019s decision has become final, any party, including the administrator, may appeal such decision, including any claim that the decision violates statutory or constitutional provisions, to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford or for the judicial district wherein the appellant resides. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"pAM\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (a) (16) provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018[W]ilful misconduct\u2019 means deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest, or a single knowing violation of a reasonable and uniformly enforced rule or policy of the employer, when reasonably applied, provided such violation is not a result of the employee\u2019s incompetence . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ATy\">Furthermore, \u00a7 31-236-26a of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides in relevant part: \u201c(b) To determine that misconduct is deliberate, the [administrator must find that the individual committed the act or made the omission intentionally or with reckless indifference for the probable consequences of such act or omission. . . . (c) To find that deliberate misconduct is in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest, the [a]dministrator must find that: (1) the individual knew or should have known that such act or omission was contrary to the employer\u2019s expectation or interest; and (2) at the time the individual committed the act or made the omission, he understood that the act or omission was contrary to the employer\u2019s expectation or interest and he was not motivated or seriously influenced by mitigating circumstances of a compelling nature. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"AUK\"> The plaintiff argues that he was wrongfully discharged for his effort to correct United\u2019s bad accounting practices. Specifically, he claims that he did not follow United\u2019s practices because they were improper and illegal. It is unnecessary to consider whether the plaintiffs defiance of his employer\u2019s instructions was done in good faith or whether acting in good faith permits the plaintiff to collect unemployment benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-236 (a) (2) (B) because both the board and the referee concluded that United discharged the plaintiff for wilful misconduct as a consequence of the e-mails he sent to Lee on January 6, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
