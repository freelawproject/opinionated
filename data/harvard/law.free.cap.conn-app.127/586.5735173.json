On May 20, 2010, the plaintiff filed an application for relief from abuse against the defendant, her husband. That application sought, inter alia, to protect the plaintiff, their minor son and their adult daughter from the defendant by imposing certain restraints, including an order that he not assault, threaten, abuse, harass, follow, interfere with or stalk them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>28, 2010, the court held a hearing on the application. The plaintiff testified that she believed that she and the children were in danger and repeated the allegations contained in her affidavit. See footnote 3 of this opinion. The plaintiff, during cross-examination, testified that the defendant had never struck her or the children in the past. The defendant also testified that he had never struck the plaintiff or the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">At the conclusion of the May 28, 2010 hearing, after the testimony of the parties and argument of counsel,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court granted the application for the restraining order. The court expressly found that there was a continuous threat of present and serious physical harm to the plaintiff and the children. The court ordered the defendant to stay away from the home and prohibited him from having any further contact with the plaintiff and the children for a period of six months.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court additionally ordered the defendant to attend counseling for alcohol abuse. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The defendant first claims that there was no factual basis from which the court could have found that the defendant presented a continuous threat of present physical pain or physical injury to the plaintiff or their minor son within the meaning of \u00a7 46b-15. Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>he argues that \u201c[t]here was absolutely insufficient evidence [presented at the hearing to support such a finding] absent conjecture or fear of what might happen . . . because of the defendant\u2019s alcoholism . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">We begin with the applicable standard for this court\u2019s review. \u201c[T]he standard of review in family matters is well settled. An appellate court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s orders in domestic relations cases unless the court has abused its discretion or it is found that it could not reasonably conclude as it did, based on the facts presented. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">\u201cIn determining whether a trial court has abused its broad discretion in domestic relations matters, we allow every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action. . . . Appellate review of a trial court\u2019s findings of fact is governed by the clearly erroneous standard of review. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Joni S. </em>v. <em>Ricky S., </em>124 Conn. App. 170, 172-73, 3 A.3d 1061 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The plain language of \u00a7 46b-15 clearly requires a continuous threat of present physical pain or physical injury before a court can grant a domestic violence restraining order. Immediately prior to the court\u2019s finding that such a threat had been established, the court indicated that the record reflected that the defendant had threatened to seek revenge on the children because they had hospitalized him, that he walked around the house with knives, that he had made a sharp and pointy object with a metal rod, that his threatening conduct occurred when he was intoxicated, that he did not remember his actions when sober, that he verbally abused the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>and denied that he was doing so, that he had utilized carefully planned techniques to upset them, that he prevented the family from sleeping by purposely making loud noises, that he had asked their minor son to kill him with a hammer and knife, that he had threatened to kill himself because of his family\u2019s attempts to help him get treatment for his alcoholism, that he blamed their son for his alcoholism and his disruptive behavior, that the family had lived in fear for over a year and that he had threatened to bum the house down. As the court noted: \u201cI don\u2019t know how close you can get to the statute [\u00a7 46b-15] without actually burning the house down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">We repeat what has become a tired refrain: \u201c[W]e do not retry the facts or evaluate the credibility of witnesses.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Noonan </em>v. <em>Noonan, </em>122 Conn. App. 184, 197, 998 A.2d 231, cert, denied, 298 Conn. 928, 5 A.3d 490 (2010). The trial court based its decision on its assessment of the credibility of the plaintiff. The record establishes that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the plaintiff and the children were subjected to a continuous threat of present physical pain or physical injury. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion in granting the plaintiffs application for a restraining order against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">H</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The defendant next claims that the court exceeded its statutory authority under \u00a7 46b-15 by ordering him to participate in alcohol abuse counseling. He argues that, although he may have serious alcohol related problems, the statute does not provide a remedy for such problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Section 46b-15 (b) provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he court, in its discretion, may make such orders as it deems appropriate for the protection of the applicant and such dependent children or other persons as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>the court sees fit. . . .\u201d From the plaintiffs testimony and the record, the court reasonably could have concluded that the defendant\u2019s behavior had become increasingly more violent and threatening as the direct result of his alcohol abuse. The court stated that the situation at the parties\u2019 home had spiraled out of control because of the defendant\u2019s alcohol consumption, that the entire family had been impacted by his drinking and that he blamed others for his alcoholism and disruptive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">For those reasons, the court, in the exercise of its broad discretion, did not exceed its statutory authority when it ordered the defendant to participate in alcohol abuse counseling. Because the behavior leading to the issuance of the restraining order could have been considered the direct result of the defendant\u2019s alcohol abuse, the court reasonably could have concluded that such counseling was necessary for the protection of the plaintiff and the children. Accordingly, this claim of the defendant is without merit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court exceeded its statutory authority under \u00a7 46b-15 by extending the protection of the restraining order to the adult daughter. The defendant argues that the daughter, because she was not a minor, was required to make her own application for a restraining order under the statute in order to be afforded such protection.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>As previously noted, the express language of \u00a7 46b-15 (b) provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he court, in its discretion, may make such orders as it deems appropriate for the protection of the applicant and such dependent children <em>or other persons as the court sees fit. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The daughter, then twenty years old, lived in the home with the plaintiff, the defendant and her brother. According to the plaintiffs testimony and affidavit, the daughter was attending college at that time. As discussed in part I of this opinion, the defendant\u2019s threatening behavior was directed at the plaintiff and the children. The court specifically found that his alcohol consumption had impacted the entire family. Accordingly, the court acted within the statutoiy authority of \u00a7 46b-15 when it extended the protection of the order to the adult daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-15 (a) provides: \u201cAny family or household member as defined in section 46b-38a who has been subjected to a continuous threat of present physical pain or physical injury by another family or household member or person in, or has recently been in, a dating relationship who has been subjected to a continuous threat of present physical pain or physical injury by the other person in such relationship may make an application to the Superior Court for relief under this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-6\"> The plaintiff has not responded to the defendant\u2019s claims on appeal, having failed to file a brief with this court. We, therefore, have considered the appeal on the basis of the record and the defendant\u2019s brief and oral argument. See <em>Schettino </em>v. <em>Labarba, </em>82 Conn. App. 445, 446 n.2, 844 A.2d 923 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\"> The plaintiff attached an affidavit to her application, in which she stated in relevant part: \u201cI am [a] 43 year old mother with two children ages 15 and 20. My husband is a chronic alcoholic who refuses to seek help. . . . His verbal abuse towards my children and me became unbearable. We attempted to seek help for his alcoholism. ... He was admitted to the hospital for about a week. Since his return his verbal abuse and threats became even stronger. He told us he will seek revenge on my children and me because we hospitalized him. He would keep us up all night; yelling, making loud noises, banging the furniture, and overall being very disruptive and dangerous because we did not know what to expect from him. At one point he began to walk around the house with knives. He also made a sharp and pointy object from a metal rod of some sorts that could be used for stabbing. ... As he sobered up he denied everything that [he] had said and done the day before .... From there the situation became even more threatening. . . . Our household is filled with his constant screams and his careful planned out techniques to break us down. ... At one point he came up to my son and put a large knife and hammer in front of him and told my son to murder him. He also threatens us that he will kill himself because of what \u2018we have done to him\u2019 meaning the times we tried to be supportive and helpful in order to help him stop drinking. ... We have been living in fear for over a year now. We don\u2019t know what his next move will be. He has told us he will bum the house down and that he will \u2018crush\u2019 us so we are left with nothing. . . . [T]he house is filled with constant fighting and fear. . . . Even when my son is staying away, my husband keeps harassing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>him and blaming him for the alcoholism and the disruptive behavior, . . . At this point my children and I cannot pul up with his alcoholism, constant verbal abuse, and the fact that he could snap and hurt us at any given moment. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b617-11\"> The plaintiff was self-represented at the hearing. The defendant was represented by counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b617-12\"> We note that the order of protection that the defendant challenges in this appeal expired November 28, 2010. Nevertheless, the appeal is not moot. See <em>Putman </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>279 Conn. 162,164-65, 900 A.2d 1256 (2006) (\u201cexpiration of a domestic violence restraining order does not render an appeal from that order moot because it is reasonably possible that there will be significant collateral consequences for the person subject to the order\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\"> We note that the defendant agreed to participate in alcohol abuse counseling. At the hearing, a letter from a counseling center dated May 25, 2010, was given to the court by the defendant\u2019s counsel and was accepted as part of the record. That letter confirmed that the defendant had been readmitted to a substance abuse program and that he intended to attend group therapy sessions. When his counsel asked him whether he was willing to address his drinking problem through counseling, the defendant responded in the affirmative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b620-9\"> We note that the plaintiffs application for the restraining order expressly requested that the court order the defendant to have no contact with the daughter. The defendant never argued before the trial court that the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>language of \u00a7 46b-15 would not extend to her without her own application for relief from abuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
