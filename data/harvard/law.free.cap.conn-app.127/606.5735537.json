They claim that the trial court, <em>Hon. Joseph M. ShortaU, </em>judge trial referee, improperly denied their motions for summary judgment rejecting their claim that the action is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. We agree and therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>The following procedural history is relevant to our resolution of this appeal. On June 1, 2006, Lawrence Santorso (Santorso), the now deceased spouse of the plaintiff, Patricia Santorso, administratrix of the estate of Lawrence Santorso, commenced an action against the defendants in <em>Santorso </em>v. <em>Bristol Hospital, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Britain, Docket No. CV-06-5001663-S (first action). The complaint in the first action alleged, in part, that the defendants were negligent in that, for two years, they failed to treat Santorso for a lesion in his lung that had been detected by the hospital\u2019s radiology department on three separate occasions. By the time Santorso was diagnosed with lung cancer, the cancer had metastasized, and he was not a candidate for surgical intervention. He died while the first action was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">When the complaint in the first action was served on the defendants, it contained neither an attorney\u2019s good faith certificate nor opinion letters of similar health care providers (opinion letters), both required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants filed motions to dismiss the first action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claiming that the court lacked subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>matter jurisdiction due to the absence of a good faith certificate and opinion letters. The court, <em>Prestley, J., </em>denied the motions to dismiss on January 25, 2007, concluding that the defect was curable<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and ordered Santorso, within thirty days, to file an amended complaint containing a good faith certificate and opinion letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Kevin E. Creed, Santorso\u2019s counsel, filed an amended complaint containing his good faith certificate and opinion letters purportedly from similar health care providers. The defendants again filed motions to dismiss, claiming that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the opinions were not from similar health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>care providers. The only opinion letters that conceivably could have been from similar health care providers, however, were dated after the first action had been commenced. On July 31, 2007, Judge Prestley again denied the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, concluding that the claimed insufficiencies were to be tested by means of a motion to strike.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Thereafter the defendants filed motions to strike the respective counts of the amended complaint alleged against them. The court, <em>Pittman, J., </em>granted the motions to strike the second amended complaint on April 3,2008. Judge Pittman concluded that \u201ca fair reading of the complaint together with the good faith certificate and the opinion letters yields the conclusion that [Santorso] sued first and conducted the required \u2018reasonable inquiry\u2019 later. This is the exact sequence of events that [\u00a7 52-190a (a)] was enacted to prohibit. . . . The complaint, without any appended opinion letter that demonstrates a <em>pre-suit </em>opinion from a similar health care provider, is legally insufficient.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Santorso failed to plead over, and, on June 25,2008, Judge Pittman granted the defendants\u2019 motions for judgment pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-44. The plaintiff did not appeal from the judgment rendered in the first action.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Approximately six weeks later, the plaintiff commenced the present action (present action).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the present action, the plaintiff alleged the same causes of action alleged against the defendants in the first action and sought damages for wrongful death on behalf of Santorso\u2019s estate and loss of consortium on her own behalf. The complaint in the present action contained a good faith certificate signed by Creed and the same opinion letters from a general surgeon and medical oncologist that had been attached to the second amended complaint in the first action. The present action also alleged that it was brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 <em>52-592 </em>(a), the accidental failure of suit statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The hospital and Goldberg filed motions to dismiss the present action on the ground that the opinions were not written by similar health care providers. Judge Pittman denied the motions to dismiss, reasoning that the opinions offered by a general surgeon and an oncologist were physicians with sufficient training, experience and knowledge to be qualified to offer medical opinions concerning the standard of care. At that stage of the proceedings, Judge Pittman declined \u201cthe invitation to begin a detailed and wide ranging comparison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>of the subspecialties and particularized background of each health care provider in this case.\u201d Following the filing of revisions and amendments to the complaint and certain discovery, the defendants filed their motions for summary judgment in July, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">In their motions for summary judgment, the defendants argued that the first action was not defeated for any \u201cmatter of form\u201d and that Creed\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 52-190a (a) precluded the plaintiff from taking advantage of the accidental failure of suit statute. Without the benefit of the accidental failure of suit statute, the defendants argued that the present action was not commenced within the two year statute of limitations and the three year statute of repose for medical malpractice actions, and, therefore, they were entitled to summary judgment. The defendants also claimed that the present action was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Judge Shortall denied the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment on March 17, 2010.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The defendants appealed from the denial of their motions for summary judgment, claiming that a judgment against a plaintiff on a motion to strike for failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>to comply with \u00a7 52-190a (a) is a judgment on the merits subject to the doctrine of res judicata. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Before reaching the defendants\u2019 claim on appeal, we must resolve the plaintiffs jurisdictional claim. The plaintiff claims that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider the defendants\u2019 appeal, arguing that it was not taken from a final judgment. In <em>Singhaviroj </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>124 Conn. App. 228, 232-33, 4 A.3d 851 (2010), this court held that the denial of a motion for summary judgment, predicated on the doctrine of res judicata, is a final judgment for purposes of an appeal pursuant to our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Convalescent Center of Bloomfield, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Income Maintenance, </em>208 Conn. 187, 195, 544 A.2d 604 (1988), which held that \u201c[a] judgment denying [a] claim of collateral estoppel is a final judgment.\u201d \u201c[T]he defense of collateral estoppel is a civil law analogue to the criminal law\u2019s defense of double jeopardy, because both invoke the right not to have to go to trial on the merits. Like the case of a denial of a criminal defendant\u2019s colorable double jeopardy claim, where immediate appealability is well established ... [a] judgment denying [a] claim of collateral estoppel is a final judgment. . . . That precept applies to the doctrine of res judicata with equal force.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Singhaviroj </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 232; see also <em>Cayer </em>v. <em>Komertz, </em>91 Conn. App. 202, 203 n.2, 881 A.2d 368 (2005); <em>Milford </em>v. <em>Andresakis, </em>52 Conn. App. 454, 455 n.1, 726 A.2d 1170, cert, denied, 248 Conn. 922, 733 A.2d 845 (1999). We conclude that the defendants\u2019 appeal is properly before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">On the merits of the appeal, the defendants claim that the denial of their motions for summary judgment was improper because the claims alleged in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>action are barred by the doctrine of res judicata due to the fact that the judgment rendered in the first action was on the merits. We agree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">\u201cPractice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>299 Conn. 196, 210, 9 A.3d 347 (2010). \u201cOn appeal, we must determine whether the legal conclusions reached by the trial court are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision of the trial court. . . . Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant [or to deny a party\u2019s] motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">\u201cA motion for summary judgment is properly granted if it raises at least one legally sufficient defense that would bar the plaintiffs claim and involves no triable issue of fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tiro-zzi </em>v. <em>Shelby Ins. Co., </em>50 Conn. App. 680, 684, 719 A.2d 62, cert, denied, 247 Conn. 945, 723 A.2d 323 (1998). Summary judgment is appropriate to determine whether a claim is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. See <em>Singhaviroj </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 124 Conn. App. 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">\u201c[T]he doctrine of res judicata . . . [provides that] a former judgment on a claim, if rendered on the merits, is an absolute bar to a subsequent action on the same claim. A judgment is final not only as to every matter which was offered to sustain the claim, but also as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose. . . . The rule of claim preclusion prevents reassertion of the same claim regardless of what additional or different evidence or legal theories might be advanced in support of it. . . . Furthermore, [t]he judicial doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel are based on the public policy that a party should not be able to relitigate a matter which it already has had an opportunity to litigate. . . . Stability in judgments grants to parties and others the certainty in the management of their affairs which results when a controversy is finally laid to rest.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tirozzi </em>v. <em>Shelby Ins. Co., </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 685-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">\u201cThe doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, prevents a litigant from reasserting a claim that has already been decided on the merits. . . . Under claim preclusion analysis, a claim \u2014 that is, a cause of action\u2014 includes all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose. . . . Moreover, claim preclusion prevents the pursuit of any claims relating to the cause of action which were actually made or might have been made. . . . The doctrine of res judicata [applies] ... as to the parties and their privies in all other actions in the same or any other judicial tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction . . . and promotes judicial economy by preventing relitigation of issues or claims previously resolved.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DiPietro </em>v. <em>Farmington Sports Arena, LLC, </em>123 Conn. App. 583, 590, 2 A.3d 963, cert, granted on other grounds, 299 Conn. 920, 10 A.3d 1053 (2010). In this case, the elements of res judicata are satisfied; the identity of the parties, or their privies, is the same and the complaint alleges the same causes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>action alleged in the first action. See, e.g., <em>Tirozzi </em>v. <em>Shelby Ins. Co., </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Our resolution of this appeal turns on whether the motions to strike granted in the first action went to the merits of the causes of action. Practice Book \u00a7 10-39 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhenever any party wishes to contest (1) the legal sufficiency of the allegations of any complaint ... or of any one or more counts thereof, to state a claim upon which relief can be granted . . . that party may do so by filing a motion to strike the contested pleading or part thereof.\u201d \u201cAny adverse party who objects to this motion shall, at least five days before the date the motion is to be considered on the short calendar, file and serve ... a memorandum of law.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 10-42 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">\u201cA motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading . . . and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court. As a result, our review of the [trial] court\u2019s ruling is plenary. . . . We take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint . . . and we construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency. . . . [I]f facts provable in the complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied. . . . Thus, we assume the truth of both the specific factual allegations and any fact fairly provable thereunder. In doing so, moreover, we read the allegations broadly . . . rather than narrowly.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sturm </em>v. <em>Harb Development, LLC, </em>298 Conn. 124, 130, 2 A.3d 859 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">A motion to strike a cause of action in its entirety challenges the most fundamental aspect of a plaintiffs cause of action. See <em>Southport Manor Convalescent Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>216 Conn. 11, 15, 578 A.2d 646 (1990). \u201cIf no cause of action was stated and the complaint could not be amended to correct this deficiency, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>judgment necessarily would be rendered for the defendants.\u201d Id., 15-16. That a judgment rendered pursuant to a motion to strike is a judgment on the merits has been a part of our decisional law for more than a century. \u201cSince the decision on the [motion to strike] determined that no right of action existed, the judgment [following a failure to plead over] was as final and complete as a judgment following a trial on the merits.\u201d <em>Carvette </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., </em>152 Conn. 697, 699, 204 A.2d 409 (1964). \u201cThe fact that the former judgment was upon demurrer, does not militate in the least against its being a decision on the merits, and as binding as a judgment after verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Berlin Iron Bridge Co., </em>71 Conn. 479, 487, 42 A. 625 (1899).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In this matter, the defendants filed motions to strike, and the plaintiff opposed the motions by filing objections and supporting memoranda of law. The parties appeared before Judge Pittman and argued the same. In its memorandum of decision, the court concluded that the complaint in the first action, \u201cwithout any appended opinion letter that demonstrates a <em>pre-suit </em>opinion from a similar health care provider, is legally insufficient.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The sufficiency of the allegations of the complaint, therefore, were contested, or litigated, by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">In <em>Tirozzi </em>v. <em>Shelby Ins. Co., </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 680, the same parties and the same claims were asserted in two separate causes of action; \u201cthe plaintiff sought damages under his employer\u2019s underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d Id., 686. The first action was stricken due to the state of the law of underinsured motorist coverage at the time. Subsequently, the legislature amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the law, and our Supreme Court held that the amendment had retroactive application. Id., 683-85. The plaintiff in <em>Tirozzi </em>never attempted to have the judgment in the first action set aside and brought a second action. Id., 682-83; see footnote 9 of this opinion. This court concluded that the second suit was barred by the doctrine of res judicata because \u201c[t]he judgment in the first action was rendered on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tirozzi </em>v. <em>Shelby Ins. Co., </em>supra, 686. This court reasoned that \u201c[t]he motion to strike required the trial court to decide the merits of the plaintiffs claim. The parties had the opportunity to fully litigate the matter. The motion to strike was contested, and both parties participated in oral argument. . . . After the trial court granted the motion to strike, the plaintiff neither repleaded pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-44 nor took an appeal. The plaintiff, therefore, had an adequate opportunity to litigate the matter in the first action and to seek appellate review.\u201d Id., 686-87. The trial court, therefore, \u201ccorrectly determined that the judgment in the first action was preclusive and, by failing to replead or take an appeal, the plaintiff abandoned his opportunities to avoid res judicata.\u201d Id., 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment should have been granted, as the causes of action alleged with respect to each of the defendants in the present action were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. We recognize that although the loss of a spouse is enormous and that such a loss \u201cis easily comprehensible to anyone with knowledge of the human condition, the trial judge, armed with such knowledge, nonetheless was not relieved of his obligation to apply the law reasonably applicable to the plaintiffs complaint and the state of the pleadings.\u201d <em>Votre </em>v. <em>County Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Group, P.C., </em>113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Conn. App. 569, 571, 966 A.2d 813, cert, denied (death of plaintiffs child), 292 Conn. 911, 973 A.2d 661 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to grant the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-14\"> Generally, the denial of amotion for summary judgment is not appealable, but the denial of a motion for summary judgment predicated on the doctrine of res judicata is a final judgment for purposes of appeal.

App. 810, 822, 943 A.2d 544 (2008), held that \u201cthe plain language of this new statutory subsection [\u00a7 52-190a (c)] . . . expressly provides for dismissal of an action when a plaintiff fails to attach a written opinion of a similar health care provider to the complaint, as required by \u00a7 52-190a (a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">\u201c[M]otions to dismiss are not limited to jurisdictional challenges. . . . For example, under General Statutes \u00a7 52-549t (b) a court may dismiss an action when parties have failed to appear before a fact finder. The dismissal in \u00a7 52-549t (b) is discretionary and in no way implicates the jurisdiction or the power of the court to hear the case. Similarly, Practice Book \u00a7 <em>14-3 </em>provides for dismissal due to lack of diligence in prosecution of an action. Again, the power of the court to hear the case is not implicated by virtue of a dismissal for lack of diligent prosecution under this provision.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Votre </em>v. <em>County Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Group, P.C., </em>113 Conn.

However, the legislature has provided that such a failure does render her complaint subject to dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 52-190a (c). Dismissal pursuant to this section is a statutory remedy for any defendant who is subject to a legal action in which the statutorily required written opinion is not annexed to the complaint or initial pleading.\u201d Id., 583-84; see also <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>New Milford Hospital, Inc., </em>117 Conn.

Judge Prestley concluded that a court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint for failure to attach a written opinion was discretionary. She relied on <em>LeConche </em>v. <em>Elligers, </em>215 Conn. 701, 709-10, 579 A.2d 1 (1990), superseded by No. OS-275, \u00a7 2, of the 2005 Public Acts, which was codified in \u00a7 52-190a (c), for the proposition that the certificate required by \u00a7 52-190a (a) prior to the 2005 amendment was not jurisdictional, as the Superior Court traditionally has had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate actions alleging medical negligence. Judge Prestley also concluded that the question of when the opinion letters were authored was not a jurisdictional matter, and the sufficiency of the opinions could be tested by means of a motion to strike.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b639-6\"> The plaintiff was appointed administratrix of Santorso\u2019s estate after he died in 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\"> On appeal, the plaintiff has argued that the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment were properly denied because the first action had not been decided on its merits pursuant to \u00a7 52-592 (a).

Judge Shortall stated that \u201c[i]t cannot be said that counsel\u2019s failure to file a good faith certificate and opinion letters in [the first action] was the result of \u2018mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b640-6\"> In denying the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, the court concluded, in relevant part, that the judgment in the first action was not rendered on the merits; that a plaintiff who fails to comply with \u00a7 52-190a may avail herself of the benefit of \u00a7 52-592 if the first action failed for any matter of form; that Creed\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 52-190a (a) was deliberate and not \u201cthe result of \u2018mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect\u2019 \u201d but that Creed\u2019s conduct was not sufficient to deny the plaintiff the benefit of \u00a7 52-592; the defendants were not unduly prejudiced; Creed complied with \u00a7 52-190a (a) before commencing the present action; and the \u201charsh consequences of visiting upon the client the consequences of her attorney\u2019s misconduct are mitigated by [\u00a7 52-592 (a)].\u201d Finally, the court concluded that the purpose of \u00a7 52-592 and the state\u2019s policy preference to secure a litigant\u2019s day in court and to resolve a dispute on its merits could be achieved without unfair prejudice to the defendants and without undermining the purpose of \u00a7 52-190a. The court found that the first action was defeated for a matter of form in that Creed failed to file the required good faith certificate and opinion letters and that \u00a7 52-592 (a) saved the present action from the effects of the running of the statute of limitations and the statute of repose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b642-9\"> Because we resolve the defendants\u2019 appeal on res judicata grounds, we need not consider whether the accidental failure of suit statute is applicable to the facts of this case. But see <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Charlotte Hungerford Hospital, </em>300 Conn. 33, 56, 12 A.3d 885 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b645-7\"> \u201cThe motion to strike . . . replaced the demurrer in our practice. Its function, like that which the demurrer served, is to test the legal sufficiency of a pleading.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Alarm, Applications Co. </em>v. <em>Simsbury Volunteer Fire Co., </em>179 Conn. 541, 545, 427 A.2d 822 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
