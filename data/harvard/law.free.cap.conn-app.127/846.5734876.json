On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for an intentional homicide and (2) a jury instruction that referenced the defendant\u2019s interest in the outcome of the case was improper. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On Saturday, August 27, 2005, a local church sponsored a \u201cStop the Violence\u201d block party on Vine Street in Hartford. Both the defendant and Keith Carter, the victim, attended the block party, where they argued. After the block party, several people went to an apartment building located at 46-48 Vine Street. The defendant lived in an apartment on the first floor of 46-48 Vine Street with his girlfriend, Latasha Drummond.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Shortly after 9:15 p.m. that evening, several people were gathered in the common hallway on the first floor of 46-48 Vine Street. Drummond was in the apartment she shared with the defendant. Drummond heard someone tell the victim to \u201cget out of [the defendant\u2019s] face.\u201d A neighbor, Dela Tindal, was in her apartment located across the hall from the apartment shared by the defendant and Drummond. Tindal heard the defendant and the victim arguing in the hallway. Tindal then heard the defendant say, \u201care you still talkin\u2019 shit? Don\u2019t make me go get my pistol,\u201d and then Tindal heard the defendant\u2019s apartment door open and close. Shortly thereafter, Tin-dal heard the defendant say: \u201cYou still talking shit.\u201d Tindal then looked out of her apartment and saw the two men arguing, standing face to face. Tindal then saw the defendant extend his hand and shoot the victim. Tindal could see sparks coming from the barrel of the gun, and the sound was \u201clike a . . . loud firecracker.\u201d Upon hearing the gunshot, Drummond looked out into the hallway where she saw the victim fall to the floor and the defendant with a gun in his hand. The defendant then ran out of the building. Drummond went back inside her apartment to get her keys and then ran out of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Outside of the building, Drummond encountered her neighbor, Courtney Croome. Drummond was crying and shaking and told Croome, \u201cHe killed him. He killed him.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Following the incident, Drummond visited the defendant at an abandoned apartment where he was hiding from the police. Drummond saw the defendant wrap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>the gun he had used to shoot the victim in a diaper and throw it in the trash, claiming that the police could not charge him if they did not have the murder weapon. Drummond described the weapon as a \u201cblack, old, rusty gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The defendant was located and arrested approximately one month following the incident. While in prison, the defendant wrote three letters to Tindai, asking that she not appear at his probable cause hearing, that she lie to the police and that she ask others to lie for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of all the charges against him and sentenced to serve a term of sixty years imprisonment. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the state presented insufficient evidence regarding his intent to cause death, and, therefore, the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for murder pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54a. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">\u201cThe standard of review we apply to a claim of insufficient evidence is well established. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>275 Conn. 534, 542, 881 A.2d 290 (2005), cert, denied, 547 U.S. 1082, 126 S. Ct. 1798, 164 L. Ed. 2d 537 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>\u201cWhile the jury must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. ... If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinnock, </em>220 Conn. 765, 771, 601 A.2d 521 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Moreover, \u201cit does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. . . . It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence. ... In evaluating evidence, the [finder] of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The [finder of fact] may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>257 Conn. 544, 566-67, 778 A.2d 847 (2001), cert, denied, 534 U.S. 1130,122 S. Ct. 1069, 151 L. Ed. 2d 972 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Furthermore, \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the trier, would have resulted in an acquittal.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>236 Conn. 189, 196, 672 A.2d 488 (1996). \u201cOn appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115, 134, 646 A.2d 169 (1994).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cWe do not sit as a thirteenth juror who may cast a vote against the verdict based upon our feeling that some doubt of guilt is shown by the cold printed record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Henning, </em>220 Conn. 417, 420, 599 A.2d 1065 (1991). \u201cQuestions of whether to believe or to disbelieve a competent witness are beyond our review. As a reviewing court, we may not retry the case or pass on the credibility of witnesses. . . . Our review of factual determinations is limited to whether those findings are clearly erroneous. . . . We must defer to the [finder] of fact\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses that is made on the basis of its firsthand obseivation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Osoria, </em>86 Conn. App. 507, 514-15, 861 A.2d 1207 (2004), cert, denied, 273 Conn. 910, 870 A.2d 1082 (2005). \u201cThe process of inference is peculiarly a jury function, the raison d\u2019etre of the jury system.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Little, </em>194 Conn. 665, 673, 485 A.2d 913 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">Section 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . .\u201d \u201cThe specific intent to kill is an essential element of the crime of murder.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>supra, 231 Conn. 126. \u201cTo act intentionally, the defendant must have had the conscious objective to cause the death of the victim. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Aviles, </em>107 Conn. App. 209, 217, 944 A.2d 994, cert, denied, 287 Conn. 922, 951 A.2d 570 (2008); see also General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (11). \u201cIntent is generally proven by circumstantial evidence because direct evidence of the accused\u2019s state of mind is rarely available. . . . Therefore, intent is often inferred from conduct . . . and from the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence and the rational inferences drawn therefrom. . . . This does not require that each subordinate conclusion established by or inferred from evidence, or even from other inferences, be proved beyond a reasonable doubt . . . because this court has held that a jury\u2019s factual inferences that support a guilty verdict need only be reasonable.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>supra, 126. \u201cNevertheless, because intent to cause the death of a person is an element of the crime . . . that intent must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>238 Conn. 253, 258, 681 A.2d 922 (1996). \u201cAn intent to cause death may be inferred from circumstantial evidence such as the type of weapon used, the manner in which it was used, the type of wound inflicted and the events leading to and immediately following the death.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Zdanis, </em>182 Conn. 388, 396, 438 A.2d 696 (1980), cert, denied, 450 U.S. 1003, 101 S. Ct. 1715, 68 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The defendant\u2019s contention on appeal is that, on the basis of the evidence presented, it is equally likely that the victim\u2019s death resulted from an accidental shooting when the defendant attempted to \u201cpistol-whip\u201d the victim. We conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to have found beyond a reasonable doubt that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>the defendant had the specific intent to cause the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">To support the theory of an accidental discharge, the defendant first cites the testimony of Drummond, who stated that (1) the defendant told her the shooting was an accident and that he was going to strike the victim with the gun when it accidentally discharged,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) the gun was \u201crusty.\u201d The defendant argues that a rusty firearm may not shoot properly and cites newspaper articles and case law from other jurisdictions to support the theory that pistol-whipping incidents are notorious for accidental discharges. The defendant also argues that the testimony of the medical examiner who performed the autopsy of the victim supports an accidental discharge theory,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> noting that the victim died of a single bullet wound and that there was stippling on the victim\u2019s left shoulder. The defendant argues that the presence of stippling suggests that that the gunshot was fired from close range. The victim also had a laceration on the inner lip and a missing tooth, which the defendant hypothesizes could have been caused by a punch.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">We conclude that there was sufficient evidence presented to the jury that the defendant had the specific intent necessary to support a conviction for murder pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54a. There was testimony, which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>jury could have credited, to support the conclusion that the defendant intended to cause the victim\u2019s death. The jury could have inferred from the evidence that, because the defendant and the victim were arguing during most of the day prior to the shooting, the defendant had the requisite intent to cause the victim\u2019s death. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>247 Conn. 318, 322, 721 A.2d 519 (1998) (arguments between a defendant and a victim can be evidence that defendant intended to cause victim\u2019s death). Furthermore, during the continuing argument, and shortly before the shooting, the defendant stated that he was going to get his gun. The defendant went to his apartment, obtained the gun, returned to the hallway and confronted the victim with his gun. The jury also could have inferred from this evidence that the defendant intended to cause the victim\u2019s death. See <em>State v. Raguseo, </em>225 Conn. 114, 120, 622 A.2d 519 (1993) (defendant carrying deadly weapon prior to homicide can be evidence that defendant intended to cause victim\u2019s death). There was testimony that the defendant remarked, \u201cYou still talking shit,\u201d then extended his hand and shot the victim in the neck from close range. One who \u201cuses a deadly weapon upon a vital part of another will be deemed to have intended the probable result of that act, and from such a circumstance a proper inference may be drawn in some cases that there was an intent to kill.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The jury also was free to infer that the defendant\u2019s flight from the scene after the shooting<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and subsequent evasion of the police demonstrated consciousness of guilt and supported the conclusion that he intended to cause the death of the victim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>250 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Conn. 611, 653, 737 A.2d 404 (1999) (\u201cwhen a person flees the crime scene with other participants in a crime, it is reasonable to infer that that person had the intent to murder\u201d), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>529 U.S. 1060, 120 S. Ct. 1568, 146 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2000). Additionally, the jury could reasonably have found from the evidence that the defendant disposed of the murder weapon and sought to influence the testimony of witnesses in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Mindful of our standard of review, which requires us to view the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim and conclude that the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">The defendant also claims that the court erred in instructing the jury on the credibility of witnesses by indicating that the defendant\u2019s interest in the outcome of the case could be considered in evaluating his testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the instruction undermined the presumption of innocence and his rights under the federal and state constitutions to a fair trial and to testify in his own defense. The defendant seeks review of his unpreserved claim pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>The defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable under <em>Golding </em>because the record is adequate for review and the claim is of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Polanco, </em>126 Conn. App. 323, 331, 11 A.3d 188 (2011).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">\u201c[A] charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury . . . we will not view the instructions as improper.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>292 Conn. 558, 566, 973 A.2d 1254 (2009), cert, denied, 559 U.S. 911, 130 S. Ct. 1296, 175 L. Ed. 2d 1086 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">In the present case, the court\u2019s charge to the jury was as follows: \u201cNow, the accused, [the defendant], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>took the [witness] stand in this case and testified. In weighing the testimony of an accused person, you should apply the same principles by which the testimony of other witnesses is tested. And that necessarily involves a consideration of [the defendant\u2019s] interest in the outcome of the case. You will consider the importance to him of the outcome of the trial. An accused person, having taken the witness stand, stands before you, then, just like any other witness and is entitled [to] the same consideration and must have his testimony measured in the same way as any other witness, including his interest in the verdict, which you\u2019re about to render.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The instruction in the present case substantively is identical to the instruction in <em>State </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>119 Conn. App. 626, 634, 988 A.2d 918, cert, denied, 297 Conn. 922, 998 A.2d 168 (2010).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Mann, </em>this court relied on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>precedent in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>220 Conn. 385, 397, 599 A.2d 1053 (1991), as it was required to do under our law, and concluded that the challenged portion of the court\u2019s instruction was not improper for mentioning the defendant\u2019s interest in the outcome of the case and that the instruction was \u201cin harmony with those that consistently have been held proper by our courts. \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>supra, 637;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>123 Conn.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>107 Conn.

[I]t is not within our province to reevaluate or replace those decisions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Because the challenged instruction in this case virtually is the same as the challenged instruction in <em>Mann, </em>we conclude that it was not improper for the court to mention in its charge the defendant\u2019s interest in the outcome of the case. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-8\"> When Croome encountered Drummond running away from 46-48 Vine Street, Drummond was crying and screaming.

We note that the present case was briefed and argued prior to our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitchens, </em>299 Conn. 447, 10 A.3d 942 (2011), in which it reversed in part <em>State </em>v. <em>Ebron, </em>292 Conn. 656, 681-82, 975 A.2d 17 (2009), and concluded that claims of instructional error impliedly are waived \u201cwhen the trial court provides counsel with a copy of the proposed jury instructions, allows a meaningful opportunity for their review, solicits comments from counsel regarding changes or modifications and counsel affirmatively accepts the instructions proposed or given . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitchens, </em>supra, 482-83. In the present case, we assume without deciding that waiver does not apply because there were no written instructions provided to counsel by the court as required by <em>Kitchens. </em>We note, however, that the court did state to counsel that the instruction that it intended to use was set forth in D. Borden &amp; L. Orland, 5 Connecticut Practice Series: Criminal Jury Instructions (4th Ed. 2007) \u00a7 3.8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\"> This court\u2019s opinion in <em>Mann </em>was released on March 2, 2010, after the filing of the defendant\u2019s brief but prior to the filing of the state\u2019s brief. The instruction in <em>Mann </em>was as follows: \u201cAnd in this case, the defendant testified. An accused person, having taken the [witness] stand, stands before you just like any other witness. He is entitled to the same considerations and must have his testimony tested and measured by you by the same factors and standards as you would judge the testimony of any other witness. That necessarily involves a consideration of his interest in the verdict that you will render. You have no right to disregard his testimony or to disbelieve his testimony merely because he is accused of a crime. You will consider my earlier instructions on the general subject matter of creditability that obviously pertain to the defendant\u2019s testimony as well as the testimony of any other witness. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Mann, supra, 119 Conn. App. 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">At oral argument, appellate counsel for the defendant, who was also appellate counsel for the defendant in <em>Mann, </em>attempted to distinguish the present case from <em>Mann </em>in that the court also gave an accomplice witness instruction as to Drummond. Counsel argues that the purpose of an \u201caccomplice witness\u201d instruction is to signal to the jury that such testimony is potentially untrustworthy and that coupling an \u201caccomplice witness\u201d instruction with a \u201ctestimony of the defendant\u201d instruction invites the jury to view the testimony of the defendant with the same suspicion. We are not persuaded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b886-9\"> \u201cWe note that this court\u2019s policy dictates that one panel should not, on its own, [overrule] the ruling of a previous panel.
