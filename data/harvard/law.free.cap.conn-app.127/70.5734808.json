On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) his sixth amendment right to confrontation was violated when the prosecutor disclosed an extrajudicial testimonial statement made by an individual absent from trial and (2) the prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial impropriety that deprived the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>defendant of a fair trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant\u2019s second claim that he was deprived of a fair trial because of prosecutorial impropriety and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court. The case is remanded to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. A.F.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is a certified nursing assistant who was employed as a home health care aide. She was assigned to work for an elderly woman with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (patient) at the patient\u2019s home in Bridgeport. The patient lived wdth her granddaughter (E), her two great-granddaughters (B and Y) and one of the great-granddaughters\u2019 boyfriends. The defendant, E\u2019s boyfriend, visited regularly and spent nights at the residence a few days a week, such that A.F. believed him to be a resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The incident in question occurred after A.F. had been caring for the patient for approximately two and one-half weeks. On June 6, 2007, the defendant was present in the house when A.F. arrived to begin her shift. She testified that while she was tending to the patient, the defendant \u201crubbed up against\u201d her and said that \u201ceverybody is at court, and we\u2019re gonna have sex today . . . .\u201d A.F. also testified that at one point, the defendant requested that she look at his computer, which depicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>inappropriately explicit pictures of women\u2019s anatomy. Throughout the morning, the defendant continued to unnecessarily bump into A.F.\u2019s \u201cback side . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">During the early afternoon, A.F. put the patient to bed for her scheduled nap. A.F. was sitting on the patient\u2019s bed when the defendant approached and began touching her arm, leg and inner thigh. A.F. repeatedly told the defendant to stop, but he lifted her shirt and bra, and touched and kissed her chest, on her bare skin. He also attempted to unbuckle her belt. She testified that at this point, the defendant forcibly restrained her. A.F. was able to flee to the bathroom, but when she emerged again to check on the patient, the defendant once more approached and touched her inappropriately. This prompted A.F. to reach for the telephone. When the defendant prevented her from using the telephone, A.F. went to the back porch to avoid him.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Before A.F. left the patient\u2019s home, E and B returned to the residence. A.F. did not report the defendant\u2019s behavior to either of them. She had reported the behavior, however, to a friend by way of three or four telephone calls throughout the morning. She also placed a call to her supervisor after the first episode of inappropriate behavior, and they agreed that A.F. would visit the office immediately after her assignment. Upon completing her shift, A.F. went to the office to discuss the incident with her supervisor. Based on their conversation, A.F.\u2019s supervisor called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Officer John Burke of the Bridgeport police department responded to the call. After speaking with A.F., Burke went to the patient\u2019s residence and spoke to the defendant, who denied any wrongdoing. Burke also spoke to B\u2019s boyfriend, Winston Wright. Burke did not take a sworn statement from any party but arrested the defendant as a result of A.F.\u2019s account of the incident and Wright\u2019s statement. The defendant was charged by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>way of a substitute information with sexual assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (1) (A), sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (2) and unlawful restraint in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-96 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Prior to trial, it was revealed to the parties that the police report of the incident indicated that Wright told Burke that the defendant had stated: \u201cI am going to tell you something. Tell me if I am a fool or it is funny .... The nurse . . . was here today and I sucked her tits on the bed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The defendant filed a motion in limine to preclude the admission into evidence of the \u201cdouble hearsay\u201d statement, even by reference. The court granted the motion, the only caveat being that \u201cshould [the defendant] testify and open the door to any of the [motions in limine topics] then I will hear the state on whatever motions it has.\u201d There was no further discussion on the motion dining any of the multiple days of trial, and the state never made any motions in relation to Wright\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Wright\u2019s statement was not mentioned during trial until the state called Burke to testify, after four witnesses, including A.F., had been examined. Burke stated that (1) he spoke to Wright, (2) Wright told him \u201csomething that the defendant told him,\u201d and (3) this information from Wright weighed in favor of Burke\u2019s decision to arrest the defendant. Subsequently, the defendant testified. On direct examination, the only mention of Wright was that he was a member of the household. When the defendant was cross-examined, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Isn\u2019t it true . . . that on June 6, 2007, you picked [Wright] up from the train station?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u201c[The Defendant]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: You didn\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">\u201c[The Defendant]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: And isn\u2019t it true . . . that when you picked \u2014 [Wright] up\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I didn\u2019t pick him up, so I\u2019m \u2014 I don\u2019t know where this question is coming from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Isn\u2019t it true that you saw him on that day on June 6, 2007?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">\u201c[The Defendant]: He was at the house when the\u2014 the police arrived. That\u2019s all that I remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-12\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: And isn\u2019t it true that you told him that you quote, unquote\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-13\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I never told\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-14\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: sucked on the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-15\">\u201c[The Defendant]: \u2014him\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-16\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: \u2014nurse\u2019s tits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-17\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Never told him nothing like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-18\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: You never told him that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-19\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Nope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-20\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: So, the police report\u2019s lying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-21\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-22\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-23\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Objection, Your Honor. That\u2019s assuming facts not in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-24\">\u201cThe Court: All right, sustained. Ladies and gentlemen, you should disregard the last question by the prosecutor. I\u2019ve sustained the objection. Go ahead. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u201c[The Prosecutor]: So, you\u2019re maintaining that you know . . . Wright, but you did not say that \u2014 make that comment to him on that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">\u201c[The Defendant]: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: You\u2019re denying all of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I didn\u2019t say it, so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: So, you\u2019re denying it; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I didn\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">\u201c[The Defendant]: \u2014say this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-13\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: \u2014I\u2019m going to object; this is argumentative, at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-14\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I already answered the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-15\">\u201cThe Court: All right. I\u2019ll let him finish answering the question, and then you can move on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-16\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-17\">\u201c[The Defendant]: The answer is, no. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-18\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: You did not say it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-19\">\u201c[The Defendant]: No, I didn\u2019t say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-20\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: I have no further questions, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-21\">Wright\u2019s alleged statement then went unmentioned until the state\u2019s closing rebuttal argument to the jury, when the prosecution referenced it again: \u201cNow, you also heard mention of a man by the name of Winston Wright. Police Officer Burke testified that ... he met with . . . Wright, who told him something that the defendant told him that helped him in his case. Now, when the defendant got up on the [witness] stand, he was asked about . . . Wright, and he was asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>whether or not he told . . . Wright a certain something. The defendant, of course, denied it. But you heard testimony from Officer Burke that there was a statement made to him and to the other officer that helped him in this case.\u201d The prosecutor also argued: \u201cYou have to ask yourself, what was [AF.\u2019s] motive in . . . coming in here in open court with people she doesn\u2019t even know and telling her story? You have to ask yourself; what was her motive for calling her job, calling her friend, for going to her job and telling them what happened; for calling the police, what was her motive? She was subjecting herself to criminal prosecution for making a false police report. You have to ask yourself that. Was she willing to risk that to come in here to tell her story?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">During deliberations, pursuant to a jury request, the court replayed the testimony \u201crelating to [Wright]\u201d from Burke and the defendant. Subsequently, the jury found the defendant guilty only on the count of sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (2). The defendant was acquitted on the counts of sexual assault in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (1) (A) and unlawful restraint in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-96 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The defendant filed timely motions for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Both motions were denied, and the defendant was sentenced to a total effective term of 360 days imprisonment, suspended after six months, with two years probation. Further, he was required to register as a sex offender for ten years. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Because our decision as to the defendant\u2019s second claim is dispositive of this appeal, this court first addresses whether prosecutorial impropriety deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to due process. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>The defendant alleged, inter alia, five instances of impropriety that occurred, when the prosecutor (1) asked the jury what motive A.F. would have to he, (2) asked during cross-examination that the defendant, a native of Jamaica, explain his testimony that he has been in the United States permanently since 2001, (3) cross-examined the defendant using verbatim language from Wright\u2019s statement, (4) asked the defendant whether \u201cthe police report\u2019s lying,\u201d and (5) argued facts not in evidence by addressing Wright\u2019s statement again during her closing argument. The state disputed the first three allegations but conceded that it was improper for the prosecutor to ask the defendant if the police report was \u201clying\u201d and to employ Wright\u2019s statement in her closing argument because it invited the jury to infer that the content of Wright\u2019s statement was to be considered in determining the defendant\u2019s guilt. We agree with the defendant that prosecutorial impropriety deprived him of a fair trial and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The record reveals that the defendant failed to preserve the claim of prosecutorial impropriety at trial by way of an objection or a motion for a mistrial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cNonetheless, a defendant who fails to preserve claims of prosecutorial [impropriety] need not seek to prevail under the specific requirements of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-10, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and, similarly, it is unnecessary for a reviewing court to apply the four-pronged <em>Golding </em>test. . . . The reason for this is that the defendant in a claim of prosecutorial [impropriety] must establish that the prosecutorial [impropriety] was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>.... In evaluating whether the [impropriety] rose to this level, we consider the factors enumerated by [the] court in <em>State </em>v. Williams, 204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). . . . The consideration of the fairness of the entire trial through the <em>Williams </em>factors duplicates, and, thus makes superfluous, a separate application of the <em>Golding </em>test.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Felix, </em>111 Conn. App. 801, 805-806, 961 A.2d 458 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u201c[I]n analyzing claims of prosecutorial [impropriety], we engage in a two step analytical process. The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether [impropriety] occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that [impropriety] deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. Put differently, [impropriety] is [impropriety], regardless of its ultimate effect on the fairness of the trial; whether that [impropriety] caused or contributed to a due process violation is a separate and distinct question . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coney, </em>266 Conn. 787, 808, 835 A.2d 977 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">We begin by determining whether the challenged remarks were improper. The first two instances claimed by the defendant are disposed of easily. The prosecutor\u2019s comment on A.F.\u2019s motive was proper. Our Supreme Court has held that similar comments in closing argument were not improper because the state may argue that the witness has little motive to lie. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 381, 832 A.2d 14 (2003). We likewise agree with the state that the second argument did not rise to the level of impropriety because after the defendant objected to the inquiry on the ground that it violated the court\u2019s prior ruling granting his motion in limine to preclude evidence about his immigration status, the trial court deemed the question regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the defendant\u2019s \u201cpermanency\u201d proper in light of the direct examination, and because the prosecutor withdrew the question and moved on. See, e.g., <em>Deas </em>v. Diaz, 121 Conn. App. 826, 843-44, 998 A.2d 200 (great deference is given to trial court\u2019s evidentiary decisions), cert, denied, 298 Conn. 905, 3 A.3d 69 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Each of the prosecutor\u2019s references to both the police report and Wright\u2019s statement therein, however, amounted to prosecutorial impropriety. The state concedes that it was improper to ask if the police report was \u201clying,\u201d and we agree. The prosecutor was, in essence, asking the defendant to comment on Burke\u2019s veracity because Burke had produced the report. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>259 Conn. 693, 712, 793 A.2d 226 (2002) (holding that \u201ca witness may not be asked to characterize another witness\u2019 testimony as a he, mistaken or wrong\u201d). Furthermore, the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the report amounts to an inappropriate comment on facts that were not in evidence because the report was never admitted as an exhibit. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Collazo, </em>113 Conn. App. 651, 673, 967 A.2d 597 (\u201c[argument is improper if the prosecutor draws conclusions for which there is no evidentiary support\u201d), cert, denied, 293 Conn. 904, 976 A.2d 705 (2009). We also agree with the state\u2019s concession that it was improper to refer to Wright\u2019s statement during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument because such argument, likewise, called on the jury to base its verdict on facts that were not in evidence. The only remaining issue is whether any impropriety occurred with respect to the prosecutor\u2019s articulation of the content of Wright\u2019s statement during cross-examination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Prosecutorial impropriety may occur during the cross-examination of witnesses. <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>116 Conn. App. 818, 838, 977 A.2d 750, cert, denied, 294 Conn. 902, 982 A.2d 646 (2009). \u201cIt is well settled that prosecutorial disobedience of a trial court order, even one that the prosecutor considers legally incorrect, constitutes improper conduct.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>280 Conn. 686, 704, 911 A.2d 1055 (2006).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Referring to the substance of Wright\u2019s statement was improper. The court granted the motion in limine, which sought \u201cto prohibit entry of the double hearsay statement of . . . Wright, an individual not present at the scene of the alleged offense and whom the police did not take a statement from. . . . The admission, even by reference, of such irrelevant, prejudicial material would deprive the [djelendant of a fair trial.\u201d In granting the motion, the court stated that the prosecutor would be allowed to <em>make further motions </em>to the court if the defendant took the witness stand and \u201copen[ed] the door . . . .\u201d Thus, because the prosecutor introduced the language in Wright\u2019s statement without seeking supplementary permission from the court, her actions were improper and in violation of the court\u2019s order in granting the motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Not only was the prosecutor\u2019s use of Wright\u2019s statement a violation of the motion in limine, but also, \u201c[i]t is well established that a prosecutor, in fulfilling his duties, must confine himself to the evidence in the record. ... [A] lawyer shall not . . . [ajssert his personal knowledge of the facts in issue, except when testifying as a witness. . . . Statements as to facts that have not been proven amount to unsworn testimony . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>97 Conn. App. 169, 179, 903 A.2d 253, cert, denied, 280 Conn. 925, 908 A.2d 1088 (2006). \u201cA prosecutor may invite the jury to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence; however, he or she may not invite sheer speculation unconnected to evidence. . . . The rationale for the rule prohibiting the state from making such a reference is to avoid giving the jury the impression that the state has private information, not introduced into evidence, bearing on the case.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fields, </em>265 Conn. 184, 208, 827 A.2d 690 (2003). It was improper for the prosecutor to ask about a specific inculpatory comment found in the police report and again refer to that comment during closing rebuttal argument because the police report was not in evidence, it was never offered as an exhibit, Wright did not testify, and there was nothing in the record that substantiated the content of Wright\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">In light of our reasoning that the cross-examination conducted by the prosecutor was in violation of the motion in limine and referenced facts that were not in evidence, in addition to the other instances of impropriety conceded by the state, the record demonstrates that the prosecutor acted improperly in three instances: (1) introducing the content of Wright\u2019s statement during cross-examination, (2) asking the defendant if the police report was \u201clying\u201d and (3) revisiting Wright\u2019s statement during her rebuttal closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Having identified prosecutorial impropriety, we proceed to determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s violations deprived the defendant of a fair trial. This court has recognized that \u201c[t]o determine whether the defendant was deprived of his due process right to a fair trial, we must determine whether the sum total of [the prosecutor\u2019s] improprieties rendered the defendant\u2019s [trial] fundamentally unfair, in violation of his right to due process. . . . The question of whether the defendant has been prejudiced by prosecutorial [impropriety], therefore, depends on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury\u2019s verdict would have been different absent the sum total of the improprieties. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u201cThe . . . determination of whether the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial . . . involve [s] the application of the factors set forth by [our Supreme Court] in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>[supra, 204 Conn. 540]. As [the court] stated in that case: In determining whether prosecutorial [impropriety] was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process, this court, in conformity with courts in other jurisdictions, has focused on several factors. Among them are the extent to which the [impropriety] was invited by defense conduct or argument . . . the severity of the [impropriety] . . . the frequency of the [impropriety] . . . the centrality of the [impropriety] to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>118 Conn. App. 278, 291-92, 983 A.2d 874 (2009), cert, denied, 294 Conn. 933, 987 A.2d 1029 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Applying the first <em>Williams </em>factor, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s impropriety was not invited by defense conduct or argument. As to the question whether the police report was \u201clying\u201d and the reference to Wright\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>statement during closing rebuttal argument, the state conceded that the defendant did not invite either impropriety, and we agree. With respect to the prosecutor\u2019s use of Wright\u2019s statement dining cross-examination, defense counsel specifically argued in his motion in limine that Wright\u2019s statement was inadmissible. Wright\u2019s statement was never introduced in any fashion during direct examination of the defendant. We conclude, therefore, that defense counsel did not invite any of the instances of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Next, we consider the frequency of the improprieties pursuant to the second <em>Williams </em>factor. First, during cross-examination, the prosecutor engaged in a repetitive line of questioning, thus magnifying the impropriety. Within a brief period, she asked: (1) \u201c[i]sn\u2019t it true that you told him that you, quote, unquote . . . sucked on the . . . nurse\u2019s tits?\u201d (2) \u201c[y]ou never told him that?\u201d (3) \u201cyou did not say that \u2014 make that comment to him,\u201d (4) \u201c[yjou\u2019re denying all of that?\u201d (5) \u201c[s]o, you\u2019re denying it; is that right?\u201d and (6) \u201c[y]ou did not say it?\u201d The prosecution therefore asked, in rapid succession, <em>six times, </em>whether the defendant had admitted to a third party that he had assaulted A.F. The defendant\u2019s repeated denial of Wright\u2019s statement was met by the prosecutor\u2019s improper question as to whether his denial meant that the police report was \u201clying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Again, during her closing rebuttal argument, the prosecutor called attention to Wright\u2019s statement and the defendant\u2019s denial. Then, during jury deliberations, the improper line of questioning from cross-examination was replayed. We characterize the improprieties as frequent because the jury was exposed to the statement, either directly or by reference, during three significant phases of the trial: the presentation of evidence, the closing argument and during jury deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Of major import to our analysis is the severity of this impropriety. The state classifies the improper questioning and argument as \u201cmoderately severe.\u201d We disagree. Upon review of the identified improprieties, we classify them as grossly egregious. The prosecutor revealed inadmissible evidence to the jury, which was, in essence, a confession by the defendant. As our Supreme Court has observed, confessions represent \u201cthe most damaging evidence of guilt . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruth, </em>181 Conn. 187, 199, 435 A.2d 3 (1980); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>276 Conn. 452, 473, 886 A.2d 777 (2005) (\u201cevidence regarding an accused\u2019s admission of guilt generally is extremely important to the state and damaging to the accused\u201d). In the present case, the content of Wright\u2019s statement was not only an admission, but its language was inflammatory and likely to have left a lasting impression in the minds of the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The severity of impropriety on cross-examination was compounded when the prosecutor again directed the jury\u2019s attention to this issue during her closing rebuttal argument, in referencing the \u201ccertain something\u201d that was said to Wright. The state acknowledges that this \u201cinvited the jury to infer that the content of . . . [Wright\u2019s] statement was the \u2018certain something\u2019 that was referred to in her question on cross-examination, that Wright conveyed this comment to Burke, and that the jury [could] consider it in determining the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d During deliberations, while making its final determination of guilt, the jury\u2019s attention was brought to the illicit inculpatory statement <em>again, </em>when that portion of cross-examination was replayed at the jury\u2019s request. It is difficult to contemplate a situation that would be more severe than for the jury to hear, through a prosecutor\u2019s questioning, the functional equivalent of a confession from the defendant and then be repeatedly told of the significance of this statement in the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>officer\u2019s decision to arrest. In a case like this, where credibility is crucial and there is no other physical evidence to substantiate the allegations, \u201cthe significance of the [prosecutor\u2019s] improper conduct increase[d] considerably.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Ttrrning to the fourth <em>Williams </em>factor, the subject of the impropriety, the defendant\u2019s alleged admission in Wright\u2019s statement was central to the critical issue in the case of whether the victim, in fact, had been sexually assaulted. There were no witnesses to the incident except for the defendant and the alleged victim. The state had no physical evidence. The defendant denied any culpability. Wright\u2019s statement was not cumulative of any witness testimony except for that of the complaining individual and was the only corroboration of her complaint. Therefore, the impropriety by the prosecutor was relevant to the central issue in the case, which was the comparative credibility of A.F. and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">For these same reasons, we are not convinced as to the strength of the state\u2019s case. Although \u201c[t]he state\u2019s evidence does not need to be overwhelming to support a conclusion that prosecutorial impropriety did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>123 Conn. App. 479, 506, 1 A.3d 1254 (2010); the state\u2019s case rested only upon the credibility of A.F. and upon the limited circumstantial evidence of her repeated complaints throughout the day. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Finally, the question regarding whether the police report was \u201clying\u201d was objected to, and, in response, the court told the jury to disregard that question. This was the only curative measure directly applied to any of the Wright statement improprieties. We acknowledge that there were general instructions given by the court that the jury was the sole finder of fact and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>arguments and statements of counsel were not evidence to be considered. Nonetheless, we conclude that such instructions were not sufficient under the circumstances of this case because the prosecutor\u2019s use of Wright\u2019s damaging statement was never directly addressed in the curative measures, the jury was repeatedly exposed to the inculpatory statement, and the jury again heard the explicit language of the statement without limiting instructions during an imperative phase of the trial, jury deliberations, as it arrived at its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">To summarize, our review of the <em>Williams </em>factors leads us to conclude that the defendant\u2019s conviction was a denial of due process. The defendant did not invite the improprieties and, in fact, attempted to preempt them by filing a motion in limine. The improprieties were repeated and severe. The state\u2019s case was not particularly strong, and the uninvited improprieties concerned a critical issue in the case. The only curative measure employed did not adequately address the likelihood that the improprieties caused the defendant prejudice in the minds of the jurors. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant was deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial on the count of sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\"> The defendant uses the term \u201cprosecutorial misconduct,\u201d but our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[t]he use of the term \u2018prosecutorial impropriety,\u2019 when reviewing allegedly improper statements by a prosecutor at trial, is more appropriate than the traditional term of \u2018prosecutorial misconduct\u2019 . . . (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fauci, </em>282 Conn. 23, 26 n.2, 917 A.2d 978 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Additionally, the defendant claims that his right to a fair trial was violated both under the federal constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the state constitution, but our decision is confined to the federal constitution because the defendant has failed to provide an independent analysis of the state constitutional issue. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 367 n.4, 832 A.2d 14 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-10\"> In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of sexual abuse, we decline to identify the victim or others through whom the victim\u2019s identity may be ascertained. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-86e.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b106-7\"> The defendant\u2019s two posttrial motions, for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial, both rested on the inconsistency of the verdict and argued that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Neither motion raised issues of prosecutorial impropriety or a confrontation clause violation, the claims raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\"> The state argued that the defendant waived any challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s disclosure of Wright\u2019s statement during cross-examination by not objecting at the appropriate time. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>111 Conn. App. 84, 88-89, 957 A.2d 557, cert, denied, 289 Conn. 958, 961 A.2d 423 (2008). Having reviewed the relevant transcripts from the trial, we do not agree that the defendant explicitly or implicitly waived any objection to the use of the exact language in Wright\u2019s statement during the motion in limine argument.</p>\n<p id=\"Aln\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Similarly, we reject the state\u2019s argument that this was a proper subject of inquiry pursuant to Connecticut Code of Evidence \u00a7 6-10, which allows for prior inconsistent statements to be used for impeachment purposes. Because the cross-examination was improper in light of the court\u2019s ruling on the motion in limine, the impeachment argument is unavailing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b109-8\"> The defendant does not argue that Wright\u2019s statement was commented upon in bad faith or that the prosecutor\u2019s questioning amounted to a <em>deliberate </em>disobedience of a court order, which might warrant that this court exercise its supervisory authority to deter such conduct, even when it does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 570-73, 462 A.2d 1001, cert, denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983). We decline to review the issue under this standard because we conclude that the defendant was denied his due process rights; hence, there is no need to exercise our supervisory powers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
