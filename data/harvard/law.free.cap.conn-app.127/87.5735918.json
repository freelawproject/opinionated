Wick and Glenn LaFreniere, appeal from the judgment of the trial court dismissing their challenge to the defendant Watertown planning and zoning commission\u2019s (commission) adoption of a text amendment to the Watertown zoning regulations (text amendment) to create a B-PCD262 zone permitting retail and office development in an existing industrial zone. The text amendment created what the trial court termed an \u201coverlay zone,\u201d which, under specific circumstances and subject to specific preconditions detailed in the text amendment, affected the land bounded by Route 262, Turkey Brook, Echo Lake Road, Connecticut Route 8, and Frost Bridge Road, in Watertown. Andrew (landed plaintiff) appeals as an owner of land located within the newly created zoning district pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (a) (l),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the other seven plaintiffs (intervening plaintiffs) each filed verified petitions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>to intervene in the administrative proceedings before the commission pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a). On appeal to this court, the landed plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in holding that he did not have standing to challenge the adoption of the text amendment establishing the new zoning district. The intervening plaintiffs contend, inter alia, that the trial court erred in holding that they did not have standing to appeal to the Superior Court from the decision of the commission adopting the new zoning district. We conclude that the trial court improperly dismissed the landed plaintiffs case and reverse the judgment in part with direction to restore the landed plaintiffs case to the docket. As to the intervening plaintiffs, we affirm the judgment of the trial court dismissing their intervening complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The following facts are relevant to our analysis. The landed plaintiff owns land that abuts or is within a radius of 100 feet of the new zoning district, and the intervening plaintiffs own land elsewhere in the town of Watertown. The commission proposed a text amendment to article III \u2014 business districts of the Watertown zoning regulations to add a new Section 36 entitled \u201cDraft November 8, 2008, Route 262 Planned Commercial District (B-PCD262).\u201d See Watertown Zoning Regs., \u00a7 36. The text amendment added to the previously permitted industrial uses certain commercial uses for the development of \u201chigh quality retail and office development.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 36.2 of the Watertown zoning regulations provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he outermost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>boundaries of the overlay District are Route 262, Turkey Brook, Echo Lake Road, Route 8, and Frost Bridge Road,\u201d consisting of only approximately 150 acres.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After hearings, the commission enacted the text amendment on November 10, 2008, and published notice on November 13, 2008, in the newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The intervening plaintiffs and the landed plaintiff filed the original action, by verified complaint, on January 2, 2009. The intervening plaintiffs were all recognized by the trial court as intervening petitioners during the zoning hearing pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19 (a). In their response to the motion to dismiss, the intervening plaintiffs claimed inadequacies in the special permit process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>and that traffic volume will have a severe environmental impact and thus were aggrieved. The landed plaintiff claimed aggrievement because he is the owner of property that is within, abuts or is within a radius of 100 feet of the 150 acre area identified by the defendant for the overlay zone. All plaintiffs claimed aggrievement because the approval of the amendment was illegal, arbitrary, capricious, in abuse of the commission\u2019s discretion and in violation of its own regulations and applicable statutes. In response, the commission argued that the plaintiffs were not aggrieved and, thus, lacked standing to bring the case. The commission filed a motion to dismiss on February 6, 2009. The commission filed a reply to the plaintiffs\u2019 objection on March 26, 2009. The trial court, <em>Brunetti, J., </em>granted the commission\u2019s motion to dismiss on July 21,2009, by written memorandum of decision. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">We begin by setting forth the legal principles that govern our review. \u201cIf a party is found to lack standing, the court is without subject matter jurisdiction to determine the cause. ... A determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. When . . . the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. . . . [A] court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction .... The objection of want of jurisdiction may be made at any time . . . [a]nd the court or tribunal may act on its own motion, and should do so when the lack of jurisdiction is called to its attention. . . . The requirement of subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived by any party and can be raised at any stage [of] the proceedings. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>\u201cStanding is not a technical rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court; nor is it a test of substantive rights. Rather it is a practical concept designed to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented. . . . These two objectives are ordinarily held to have been met when a complainant makes a colorable claim of direct injury he has suffered or is likely to suffer, in an individual or representative capacity. Such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy . . . provides the requisite assurance of concrete adverseness and diligent advocacy. . . . The requirement of directness between the injuries claimed by the plaintiff and the conduct of the defendant also is expressed, in our standing jurisprudence, by the focus on whether the plaintiff is the proper party to assert the claim at issue.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC </em>v. <em>Alves, </em>262 Conn. 480, 485-86, 815 A.2d 1188 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">We first address the judgment of dismissal as it relates only to the landed plaintiff. The landed plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in holding that he did not have standing to challenge the commission\u2019s adoption of the text amendment to the zoning regulations. Specifically, he argues that he is statutorily aggrieved under \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1) because his land abuts or is within a radius of 100 feet of the area affected by the newly created overlay zone. In response, the commission argues that the landed plaintiff does not have standing because the text amendment created a floating zone. Specifically, the commission argues that the zone does not apply to any specific parcel of land, and, therefore, the landed plaintiff is not aggrieved. We agree with the landed plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>We begin by addressing the defendant\u2019s claim that the text amendment created a floating zone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By definition, a floating zone does not apply to a specifically described parcel of land. <em>Campion </em>v. <em>Board of Aidermen, </em>278 Conn. 500, 519, 899 A.2d 542 (2006). A floating zone \u201cdiffers from the traditional \u2018Euclidean\u2019 zone [which has definite bounds] in that it has no defined boundaries and is said to \u2018float\u2019 over the entire area where it may eventually be established.\u201d <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>168 Conn. 20, 22, 357 A.2d 495 (1975). In <em>Schwartz, </em>our Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs were not aggrieved by the enactment of floating zone regulations. Id., 25-26. \u201cAt the time of [the commission\u2019s] adoption the new districts, designated regional, community, and neighborhood shopping center districts, did not affect any particular area or property within the town.\u201d Id., 22. In examining the <em>Schwartz </em>decision, this court in <em>Hayes Family Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>98 Conn. App. 213, 222 n.9, 907 A.2d 1235 (2006), cert, denied, 281 Conn. 903, 904, 916 A.2d 44 (2007), concluded that <em>Schwartz </em>is distinguishable from cases in which the plaintiff can demonstrate that it, unlike the community as a whole, owned property likely to be affected by a particular regulation. Additionally, the <em>Hayes </em>court noted that there was no indication that the plaintiffs in <em>Schwartz </em>even owned property whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>development potential was impacted directly by a specific provision in those regulations. Id. \u201cAggrievement does not demand certainty, only the possibility of an adverse effect on a legally protected interest.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 222. \u201cSince the floating zone regulations establish a zone for a type of use with an <em>undetermined location, </em>the zone can technically be applied anywhere in the municipality. It can result in individual preferences and respond to development pressures rather than considering the best area for location of particular uses.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Campion </em>v. <em>Board of Aldermen, </em>supra, 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The trial court held that the landed plaintiff was not aggrieved because no particular area was affected by the text amendment. The court, citing <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 168 Conn. 23, reasoned that \u201cthere can be no aggrievement when the zoning regulations of a municipality are amended in such a way that no particular area or property is affected.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In particular, under <em>Schwartz, </em>\u201c[b]efore the floating zone can \u2018descend,\u2019 an application must be made for a change of zone and a public hearing must be held.\u201d <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 24. The trial court also relied on a more recent case, <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>259 Conn. 402, 788 A.2d 1239 (2002), in which our Supreme Court further explained that the aggrievement principle set forth in <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Planning Board, </em>159 Conn. 1, 266 A.2d 396 (1969), \u201cstands for the proposition that a prospective, personal and legal interest in the subject matter of a zoning commission\u2019s decision does not satisfy the first prong of the test for classical aggrievement.\u201d <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 414 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In the present case, the parcel of land subject to the commission\u2019s decision does not float over the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>community but has distinct geographical boundaries. The text amendment creates a new zoning district, which the plaintiffs refer to as the \u201cRoute 262 Planned Commercial District (B-PCD262)\u201d for specific property bounded by Route 262, Turkey Brook, Echo Lake Road, Connecticut Route 8, and Frost Bridge Road in Water-town. The text amendment defines the specific geographical area to which it relates. The newly created B-PCD262 zoning district permits commercial uses in an IR-80 industrial zone. The text amendment applies to the otherwise industrially zoned area, and the commission identified the area \u201cRoute 262, Turkey Brook, Echo Lake Road, Route 8, and Frost Bridge Road\u201d as the boundaries of the new zoning district in \u00a7 36.2 of the regulations titled \u201cOverlay District Location.\u201d The parties do not dispute that the area has definite bounds. The area described is bounded on all sides and consists of only approximately 150 acres. Because this particular 150 acre area is affected by the commission\u2019s decision, the area affected has descended to a particular part of the town under the language set forth in <em>Schwartz. </em>We conclude that the text amendment sufficiently defined the specific, limited geographic area to which the text amendment related, and, therefore, the new zoning district cannot be considered a floating zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We next address the landed plaintiffs claim that he is statutorily aggrieved because he owns land that abuts or is within a radius of 100 feet of any portion of the land of the particular area to be affected by this newly created zoning district that permits certain commercial uses in an otherwise industrially zoned area. Section 8-8 (a) (1), which governs planning and zoning commission appeals, allows an appeal to be brought by an \u201c \u2018aggrieved person\u2019 . . . [and] includes any person owning land which abuts or is within a radius of one hundred feet of any portion of the land involved in the decision of the board.\u201d A person owning property within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>the designated distance of the land involved in the agency\u2019s decision is called \u201cstatutorily aggrieved\u201d and has standing to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>219 Conn. 168, 173, 592 A.2d 386 (1991), our Supreme Court held that classical aggrievement in an administrative appeal is established if there is a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that some legally protected interest has been affected by the action of a zoning authority. Statutory aggrievement, as opposed to classical aggrievement, occurs when a landowner owns land \u201cthat abuts or is within a radius of one hundred feet of any portion of the land involved in the decision of the board\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1); and the landowner appeals to the Superior Court. Citing <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 402, the trial court held that the landed plaintiff had \u201cnot shown any aggrievement.\u201d However, in <em>Harris, </em>our Supreme Court dealt with classical aggrievement, not statutory aggrievement. See <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 413-15 and 415 n. 15. Classical aggrievement requires a twofold showing. \u201c[F]irst, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all the members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that the specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 410. Neither of these prongs must be proved if a plaintiff is statutorily aggrieved under \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In the present case, the trial court dismissed the case of all plaintiffs because they were not aggrieved. In the case of the landed plaintiff, the court dismissed his case for lack of aggrievement although it found that he owned land that abuts or is within a radius of 100 feet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>of the bounds the commission established as affected by its text amendment to the regulations permitting commercial uses in that area of the municipality, which, prior to the amendment, allowed only industrial uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The trial court specifically found that \u201c [i]n the present case, the landed plaintiff owns land in an area, which the commission added an overlay zone.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This finding is dispositive of our resolution of this claim. \u201cPersons whose land falls within the statutory category need not prove aggrievement independent of their status of owners of property bearing the necessary relationship to property involved in the agency\u2019s action.\u201d R. Fuller, 9A Connecticut Practice Series: Land Use Law and Practice (2007) \u00a7 32.4, p. 147. Our decision in <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>30 Conn. App. 511, 620 A.2d 1324 (1993), is analogous to the present case. In <em>Cole, </em>we held that pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1), the plaintiffs were aggrieved parties by virtue of their ownership of land within the zone to which the amendment at issue pertained.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id., 514-15. The plaintiffs had appealed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>a decision of the Cornwall planning and zoning commission that adopted an amendment to its regulations permitting the operation of a commercial sawmill in certain residential zones. Id., 512. The plaintiffs in <em>Cole </em>owned land within 100 feet of the property on which a permanent sawmill operation was intended to be established in accordance with the new regulation. Id., 515. The court found that the plaintiffs were aggrieved parties by virtue of their ownership of land within the zone to which the amendment pertained. Id. Their appeal, like the appeal in the present case, was from the adoption of the amendment to the regulations, not from the issu-ances of a permit and site plan approval for the actual use. Id., 511. The plaintiffs in <em>Cole </em>alleged that \u201c[a] permanent sawmill [operation] was not permitted on said property under the original regulation but was permitted under the amended regulation.\u201d Id., 515. Similarly, the text amendment in the present case amended the existing bounded parcel of IR-80 industrial zoned property to permit certain new uses, particularly, \u201chigh quality retail and office development,\u201d and to exclude other certain enumerated commercial uses, e.g., Laundromats. In both cases, additional limitations to the text amendment were anticipated to be set forth in the permit process. In <em>Cole </em>and the present case, the use was prospective but then was permitted by the new regulation. We conclude, therefore, that the text amendment created a defined, bounded zoning district and that the landed plaintiff is statutorily aggrieved under \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1) because his property falls within the particular zone to which the text amendment pertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The commission also argues that the landed plaintiff is not aggrieved because there has not been any change to the zoning map, nor have any zoning map change applications been filed. Additionally, the commission argues that further steps in the application process must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>be taken, such as submission and approval of a conceptual site plan filed in conjunction with a zoning map application, before the text amendment touches or impacts any parcel of land. Whether the zoning map has been changed or further steps in the application process will be taken is immaterial to our determination that the landed plaintiff is statutorily aggrieved. The area is no less bounded than if it were delineated on the zoning map. The landed plaintiff, as an owner of land within the newly created, bounded zoning district, the area to which the text amendment pertains, is an aggrieved party by virtue of \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1). See <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning </em>Commission, supra, 30 Conn. App. 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The commission also argues that the landed plaintiff is not aggrieved because a person owning land within the B-PCD262 zone is not required to join or to have his or her property included in the amendment to the zoning map. Whether a landowner may choose to have his or her property not included in the amendment to the zoning map, a future step in the process, is immaterial to our conclusion because the landed plaintiff is already statutorily aggrieved by virtue of owning land within the newly created B-PCD262 zone. The commission\u2019s argument erroneously presumes that the new zoning district is a floating zone. For the reasons stated earlier in this opinion, the newly created zoning district is not a floating zone because it has defined, definite bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The text amendment created the new B-PCD262 zone, a new zoning district with specifically defined, definite bounds, which permits development that previously was not permitted. In its brief, the commission recognizes that the new text amendment permits development that was not permitted at all in the preexisting zone. Even if the landed plaintiff were somehow able to opt out of the amendment to the zoning map, he is no less statutorily aggrieved because his land still \u201cabuts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>or is within a radius of one hundred feet of any portion of the land involved in the decision of the board.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1). The landed plaintiffs decision to opt out does not affect whether his neighbors decide to opt out and, consequently, whether the lands of such adjoining property owners are still subject to the text amendment. The landed plaintiff, therefore, is no less of an abutter of some adjoining property owner who did not decide to opt out. \u201cStatutory aggrievement exists by legislative fiat, which grants appellants standing by virtue of a particular legislation, rather than by judicial analysis of the particular facts of the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 30 Conn. App. 514-15. The landed plaintiff only had to prove that he owns land that abuts or is within a radius of 100 feet of any portion of the land involved in the decision of the commission to have standing to appeal by legislative fiat. It was not necessary for the landed plaintiff to prove any specific aggrievement.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The text amendment created a defined, bounded zoning district, and the landed plaintiff is statutorily aggrieved because his property falls within the particular zone to which the text amendment pertained. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court improperly dismissed the landed plaintiffs case and reverse the judgment in part, with direction to restore his case to the docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">We next turn to the question as to whether the trial court properly dismissed the claims of the intervening plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The intervening plaintiffs claim that the court erred in holding that they did not have standing to challenge the conduct of the commission in adopting the text amendment. Specifically, the intervening plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>argue that the commission illegally failed to follow regulations requiring it to submit an environmental impact statement in connection with the text amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u201cWe begin with some well settled principles regarding standing and its aggrievement component, as recently reaffirmed in <em>Windels </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Commission, </em>284 Conn. 268, 287-89, 933 A.2d 256 (2007). If a party is found to lack standing, the court is without subject matter jurisdiction to determine the cause. ... A determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. When . . . the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pond View, LLC </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>288 Conn. 143, 155, 953 A.2d 1 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The intervening plaintiffs intervened under \u00a7 22a-19 (a), which provides: \u201cIn any administrative, licensing or other proceeding, and in any judicial review thereof made available by law, the Attorney General, any political subdivision of the state, any instrumentality or agency of the state or of a political subdivision thereof, any person, partnership, corporation, association, organization or other legal entity may intervene as a party on the filing of a verified pleading asserting that the proceeding or action for judicial review involves conduct which has, or which is reasonably likely to have, the effect of unreasonably polluting, impairing or destroying the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">On the basis of this expansive language, our Supreme Court previously has concluded that \u00a7 22a-19 confers standing on a broad range of individuals, entities and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>government agencies to intervene in both administrative proceedings and subsequent \u201cjudicial review\u201d thereof on appeal. See <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>280 Conn. 405, 413-14, 908 A.2d 1033 (2006); <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>212 Conn. 727, 733-34, 563 A.2d 1347 (1989). An intervenor\u2019s standing pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19 strictly is limited to challenging only environmental issues covered by the statute, and \u201conly those environmental concerns that are within the jurisdiction of the particular administrative agency conducting the proceeding into which the party seeks to intervene.\u201d <em>Nizzardo </em>v. <em>State Traffic Commission, </em>259 Conn. 131, 148, 788 A.2d 1158 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In <em>Pond View, LLC </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 288 Conn. 143, our Supreme Court reiterated its prior holding that intervening environmental plaintiffs have standing to intervene on environmental issues only. Id., 157. The court held that a person seeking to intervene under \u00a7 22a-19 (a) must plead issues to be decided that fall within the ambit of the statute. Id., 159. In the present case, the intervening plaintiffs set out numerous claimed irregularities in the manner in which the commission proceeded. These are set forth in paragraph 24 (a) through (j), inclusive, of the complaint.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> All of these subparagraphs set out procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>irregularities. Subparagraph (f) comes closest to the required environmental threshold in its claim that the commission voted on the amendment without \u201cdefensible standards and without standards protective of water quality, erosion and flooding.\u201d However, even paragraph 24 (f) of the complaint is really a claim of lack of standards in the legislative adoption, thus making it \u201cillegal, arbitrary, capricious, and in abuse of its discretion, and in violation of its own regulations and applicable state statutes.\u201d The <em>Pond View, LLC, </em>court made it clear that the issues that the intervenors ask to be decided must be those properly within the scope of the statute. <em>Pond View, LLC </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 159. Claimed noncompliance with zoning statutes or zoning regulations are not within that scope. Allegations of noncompliance with procedural requirements do not give rise to standing to challenge the commission\u2019s action pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19 (a). See <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC </em>v. <em>New London, </em>supra, 282 Conn. 797-98 (plaintiffs claim that defendants failed to follow certain procedural requirements in adopting development plan insufficient to establish standing under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The intervening plaintiffs also argue that they have standing to appeal under \u00a7 22a-19 because of the reasonable likelihood of environmental harm as a result of the text amendment to the zoning regulations. In support, they argue that their allegations are distinguishable from those that undermined the plaintiffs\u2019 case in <em>Pond View, LLC, </em>a case on which the trial court relied in dismissing their complaint. We disagree with the intervening plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>In paragraph 22 of their complaint, the intervening plaintiffs allege various environmental issues, including poor water and air quality, that may arise as a result of the amendment to the zoning regulations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Relying on our Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Pond View, LLC, </em>the trial court found that the conduct of the commission, construed even in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, cannot be found to be harmful to the environment because the creation of an overlay zone is not conduct that causes environmental harm. \u201cThe cases wherein we have permitted standing under \u00a7 22a-19 have involved circumstances in which the <em>conduct </em>at issue in the application before this court allegedly would cause direct harm to the environment.

In <em>Pond View, LLC, </em>the commission argued, and the court agreed, that a zone change itself did not involve \u201c \u2018conduct\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 22a-19 that could be analyzed for its unreasonable pollution effects on air, water or other natural resources. Id., 154-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The inteivening plaintiffs distinguish the intervenors\u2019 allegations in <em>Pond View, LLC, </em>on the ground that they were not environmental.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is not necessary for us to address this argument because the distinction, if any, is immaterial to our conclusion. The inclusion of environmental issues in the complaint does not per se provide the intervening plaintiffs standing under \u00a7 22a-19 or allow them to avoid application of our court\u2019s holding in <em>Pond View, LLC. </em>The language in <em>Pond View, LLC, </em>clearly states that a zone change is a legislative action which does not directly threaten the environment. Id., 157, 160-61. \u201c[A]ny environmental harm to the \u2018air, water or other natural resources of the state\u2019 necessarily would result from the [commission\u2019s] conduct in actually developing the property, not from the zone change . . . .\u201d Id., 160-61. The court in <em>Pond View, LLC, </em>further stated that the proper forum to challenge alleged environmental harm and related procedural issues under \u00a7 22a-19 was in an appeal from the commission\u2019s decision granting a special exception permit or, more specifically, approving the site plan. Id., 161. \u201cIt is this application that actually involves the \u2018conduct\u2019 . . . that might lead to adverse environmental impacts that standing pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19 is meant to guard against.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Id. For these reasons, as to the intervening plaintiffs, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">We conclude that the trial court improperly dismissed the landed plaintiffs case and reverse the judgment in part, with direction to restore the landed plaintiffs case to the docket. As to the remaining plaintiffs, we affirm the judgment of the trial court dismissing their intervening complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAs used in this section: (1) \u2018Aggrieved person\u2019 means a person aggrieved by a decision of a board and includes any officer, department, board or bureau of the municipality charged with enforcement of any order, requirement or decision of the board.

The outermost boundaries of the overlay District are Route 262, Turkey Brook, Echo Lake Road, Route 8, and Frost Bridge Road. The Commission may amend the Zoning Map to include all or a portion of land within said boundaries to be the B-PCD262 overlay District. A lot or any portion of a lot not within the adopted overlay District, as District is defined on the Zoning Map, is not in the District. The Planned Commercial District may be one or several lots, however, the Commission encourages all lots in the District to be developed as if one parcel. No lot may be developed inconsistent with the provisions and intent of Section 36, as determined by the Commission. The location, orientation, structure, texture, materials, landscaping, and other features shall be consistent with the character of the District, character of the neighborhood, character of the Town, the Zoning and Subdivision Regulations, the Zoning Map, and the Plan of Conservation and Development, all as interpreted by the Commission.

For the purpose of this opinion, we use the description of the bounds defined in \u00a7 36.2 of the regulations.

Citing <em>Heithaus </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>258 Conn. 205, 216-18, 779 A.2d 750 (2001), the trial court stated that \u201c[a]n overlay zone has been considered a \u2018floating zone,\u2019 which is a zone that floats \u2018over the entire area where it may eventually be established\u2019 or a \u2018special permit.\u2019 \u201d The trial court found that \u201cthe floating zone is a more proper designation [of the area in the present case], as this overlay zone is alleged to create a zone which will allow for zoning changes.\u201d The trial court dismissed the case based on a finding that no particular area or property was affected, the quintessential attribute of a floating zone. Despite the trial court\u2019s reference to this area as an overlay zone, whether the area in question properly can be considered a floating zone is relevant to our resolution of this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b126-5\"> See footnote 4 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b126-6\"> See also <em>Stauton </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>271 Conn. 152, 160, 856 A.2d 400 (2004) (\u201cwe must interpret the phrase \u2018land involved\u2019 in \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1) in light of the legislature\u2019s intent to relieve a narrow class of landowners who are presumptively affected by the zoning commission\u2019s adverse decision because of their close proximity to a <em>projected zoning action </em>from the arduous burden of proving classical aggrievement\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>62 Conn.
