(Nerac), and five individual employees<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Nerac (individual defendants), following the court\u2019s granting of the defendants\u2019 motion to strike. The plaintiffs, former employees of Nerac, commenced this action against the defendants following the termination of their employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, they claim that the court (1) improperly concluded that Warner\u2019s contract based claims were insufficient as a matter of law and (2) improperly concluded that the individual defendants did not owe the plaintiffs a legal duty. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint, taken as true and construed in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency; see <em>Greenfield </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>122 Conn. App. 465, 466,1 A.3d 125, cert, denied, 298 Conn. 922, 4 A.3d 1226 (2010); asserts the following facts. Nerac, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Tol-land, employed each of the plaintiffs for a period of time before they were terminated from their employment. Brule held the position of advisor and was terminated on February 6, 2007. Warner served as a business unit director-strategic accounts and was terminated on February 5, 2007. Wynkoop was employed as a client service manager and was terminated on January 12, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>By amended complaint filed August 21, 2008, the plaintiffs sought to recover damages from the defendants on the basis of a number of legal theories. The gravamen of these claims is that in 2003 Nerac provided a management training course, entitled \u201cManaging Within the Law,\u201d which was attended by certain Nerac managers, including Warner and several of the individual defendants. The plaintiffs alleged that the training materials used in the course directed Nerac\u2019s managers to provide progressive discipline, open communication and an opportunity for improvement prior to terminating their subordinates\u2019 employment. By virtue of teaching the attendees the contents of this training course, the plaintiffs claimed, Nerac formed contractually binding obligations not to terminate its managing employees absent such discipline. Because Warner attended the course as a manager, he alleged against Nerac breach of an express or implied employment contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Additionally, each plaintiff alleged that the individual defendants had committed negligence by terminating their employment. They claimed that the contracts of employment included a duty on the part of the individual defendants not to terminate their subordinates without affording progressive discipline and an opportunity to improve, and that the individual defendants had breached this duty by not providing these procedures prior to the plaintiffs\u2019 terminations.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The defendants subsequently filed a motion to strike Warner\u2019s claims of breach of contract and breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The defendants contended that the terms of the alleged employment contract that arose out of the \u201cManaging Within the Law\u201d course were too indefinite to form an enforceable contract and, therefore, that Warner had failed to state a cognizable contract based claim. The defendants\u2019 motion also sought to strike each count in the amended complaint that alleged a claim of negligence against the individual defendants. They argued that such claims were insufficient because the individual defendants did not owe a legal duty to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The court, by memorandum of decision, granted the defendants\u2019 motion to strike. In addressing Warner\u2019s contract based claims, the court explained that the purpose of the \u201cManaging Within the Law\u201d course was to instruct the attendees on effective managing strategies and to provide useful advice regarding what managers \u201c \u2018should\u2019 \u201d do with respect to their subordinate employees. The course materials, however, did not manifest an intention on the part of Nerac to undertake any employment related contractual obligations of the type asserted by the plaintiffs. The court concluded, therefore, that any representations made in the management course could not reasonably be construed as contractual promises and were unenforceable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Turning to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the individual defendants, the court explained that these allegations were premised on the notion that the individual defendants were negligent by failing to follow Nerac\u2019s customs and policies, including a duty to provide progressive discipline prior to terminating their subordinates\u2019 employment. The plaintiffs contended that such obligations arose from the employment contracts between the individual defendants and Nerac that allegedly were formed when they attended the \u201cManaging Within the Law\u201d course. The court disagreed, reasoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>that a duty to provide progressive discipline could not have arisen as a result of the individual defendants attending such a course, \u201cwhich contained advice and suggestions, not contractual obligations.\u201d Accordingly, the court concluded that, as a matter of law, the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claims did not allege a legal duty owed to them by the individual defendants. After judgment was rendered in favor of the defendants pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-44, the plaintiffs filed the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u201cThe standard of review in an appeal from the granting of a motion to strike is well established. Because a motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court, our review of the court\u2019s ruling . . . is plenary. ... It is fundamental that in determining the sufficiency of a complaint challenged by a defendant\u2019s motion to strike, all well-pleaded facts and those facts necessarily implied from the allegations are taken as admitted. . . . For the purpose of ruling upon a motion to strike, the facts alleged in a complaint, though not the legal conclusions it may contain, are deemed to be admitted. ... A motion to strike is properly granted if the complaint alleges mere conclusions of law that are unsupported by the facts alleged.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Metcoff </em>v. <em>Lebovics, </em>123 Conn. App. 512, 516, 2 A.3d 942 (2010). With these principles in mind, we turn to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The plaintiffs first claim that the court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to strike Warner\u2019s contract based claims asserted against Nerac. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that the facts alleged in their complaint demonstrate that the language in the \u201cManaging Within the Law\u201d course set forth contractually binding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>mandatory directives by which Nerac promised to provide Warner with progressive discipline and adequate warning prior to his termination. The defendants counter that, consistent with the court\u2019s decision, the language in the course relied on by the plaintiffs was not sufficiently promissory to support contractual liability. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u201cUnder established principles of contract law, an agreement must be definite and certain as to its terms and requirements.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bayer </em>v. <em>Showmotion, Inc., </em>292 Conn. 381, 411, 973 A.2d 1229 (2009). \u201cFurthermore, [t]o form a valid and binding contract in Connecticut, there must be a mutual understanding of the terms that are definite and certain between the parties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>LeBlanc </em>v. <em>New England Raceway, LLC, </em>116 Conn. App. 267, 283, 976 A.2d 750 (2009). Although the determination of whether the parties intended to undertake a contractual commitment is generally a question of fact; see <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>202 Conn. 190, 199, 520 A.2d 208 (1987), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>225 Conn. 782, 786, 626 A.2d 719 (1993); when the proposed language could not reasonably be construed as a basis for a contractual promise, the issue should not be submitted to the trier of fact. See <em>Christensen </em>v. <em>Bic Corp., </em>18 Conn. App. 451, 457-58, 558 A.2d 273 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In granting the defendants\u2019 motion to strike, the court determined that the provisions in the \u201cManaging Within the Law\u201d course contained no language that was promissory in nature. We agree with that determination. Con-tiary to the plaintiffs\u2019 assertions, the representations allegedly made during the course manifested no present intention on the part of Nerac to undertake immediate contractual obligations to the plaintiffs. See <em>D\u2019Ulisse-Cupo </em>v. <em>Board of Directors of Notre Dame High School, </em>202 Conn. 206, 214-15, 520 A.2d 217 (1987). Our review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>of the course text reveals that the language at issue could not reasonably be construed as mandatory directives but instead was meant to inform the attendees on suggested managing practices. For example, in the section of the training materials entitled \u201cAt-will vs. Progressive Discipline,\u201d the text allegedly stated: \u201c[A]twill employment . . . means that you do not have to follow any specific procedures or processes before you terminate someone. <em>You do not need to follow a specific \u2018progressive discipline program.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The materials went on to instruct the attendees that this language did not prohibit them from using progressive discipline as part of their management strategy; instead, it simply meant that they were \u201cnot bound by any formal rules or discipline.\u201d This section is followed by a series of suggested principles that the managers <em>should </em>observe, including terminating employees without prior warning or discipline only when their conduct resulted in egregious company violations. The materials are devoid, however, of any language that demonstrates an intention to contractually bind the parties by way of directing the attendees to follow specified management procedures in a mandatory fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We conclude that the \u201cManaging Within the Law\u201d materials merely suggested how the attendees, including Warner, should manage their subordinates and, thus, cannot reasonably be construed as sufficiently definite to create an enforceable contract. The plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint, therefore, did not sufficiently allege an express or implied employment based contract claim by Warner against Nerac.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">We turn next to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to strike the counts of their amended complaint that alleged negligence on the part of the individual defendants. The plaintiffs contend that the court failed to construe their amended complaint in the light most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency when it concluded that their negligence counts failed adequately to allege a duty of care owed to them by the individual defendants. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\u201cThe essential elements of a cause of action in negligence are well established: duty; breach of that duty; causation; and actual injury. . . . Duty is a legal conclusion about relationships between individuals, made after the fact, and [is] imperative to a negligence cause of action. . . . Thus, [t]here can be no actionable negligence . . . unless there exists a cognizable duty of care.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mazurek </em>v. <em>Great American Ins. Co., </em>284 Conn. 16, 29, 930 A.2d 682 (2007). \u201cIf a court determines, as a matter of law, that a defendant owes no duty to a plaintiff, the plaintiff cannot recover in negligence from the defendant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>267 Conn. 539, 565-66, 839 A.2d 1259 (2004) <em>(Katz, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The plaintiffs contend that the individual defendants had a duty to use progressive discipline and to provide an opportunity for employees to improve prior to being terminated. They claim that this duty arose from the alleged employment contracts that were formed between Nerac and several of the individual defendants when they attended the \u201cManaging Within the Law\u201d course; see <em>D'Angelo Development &amp; Construction Corp. </em>v. <em>Cordovano, </em>121 Conn. App. 165, 186, 995 A.2d 79 (\u201c[t]here is no question that a duty of care may arise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>out of a contract\u201d), cert, denied, 297 Conn. 923, 998 A.2d 167 (2010); and that the individual defendants breached this duty when they elected to terminate the plaintiffs in a manner that was inconsistent with the principles espoused at the course.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">As set forth in part I of this opinion, the materials used in the training course did not set forth mandatory directives that bound the individual defendants to provide their subordinates with progressive discipline or an opportunity for improvement prior to termination. Because the training materials completely lacked any promissory language, they could reasonably be construed only as suggestive guidelines for managing Nerac employees. Accordingly, there was no contractual obligation from which the alleged duty may have arisen. See <em>Sheiman </em>v. <em>Lafayette Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>4 Conn. App. 39, 45, 492 A.2d 219 (1985) (\u201c[njegligence cannot be predicated upon the failure to perform an act which the actor was under no duty or obligation to perform\u201d). We conclude, therefore, that the court concluded correctly that the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence counts failed adequately to allege a legal duty owed to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-7\"> The five individual employees named as defendants are Kevin A. Bouley, Betsy Petrie, Geni Potash, Jil Corso and Paul Harger, all of whom were managers or executives of Nerac.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\"> Two additional former employees of Nerac, Carol Green and Jennifer Santry, who were named as plaintiffs and listed as appellants in the docketing statement filed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 63-4, have withdrawn their appeals. We therefore refer in this opinion to Brule, Warner and Wynkoop as the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b346-7\"> Brule and Wynkoop also alleged similar contract based claims against Nerac. The defendants did not challenge these claims in their motion to strike. After judgment was rendered on the motion to strike, Nerac filed a motion for summary judgment on Brule\u2019s and Wynkoop\u2019s contract based claims. The court granted Nerac\u2019s motion and rendered summary judgment on those remaining claims, and the plaintiffs do not challenge that ruling on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b350-6\"> The plaintiffs allege in their amended complaint that Warner\u2019s claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was \u201cimposed\u201d on Nerac as a result of his alleged employment contract with Nerac. Because we conclude that the court properly determined that such a contract did not exist, his breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim also was properly stricken. See generally <em>Magnan </em>v. <em>Anaconda Indus</em>tries, <em>Inc., </em>193 Conn. 558, 567-72, 479 A.2d 781 (1984); <em>Cowen </em>v. <em>Federal Express Corp., </em>25 F. Sup. 2d 33, 37-38 (D. Corm. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
