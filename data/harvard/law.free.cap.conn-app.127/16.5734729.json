The board had affirmed a decision by the zoning enforcement officer (officer), who had denied the plaintiffs request for zoning permits to build and to divide the plaintiffs parcel of property into two lots. The plaintiff claims that the court erred in affirming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>the decision of the board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant. The plaintiff is the owner of a parcel of land the deed to which is recorded in the Wilton land records (parcel). The parcel, which consists of 4.283 acres, is bounded on the east side by Old Huckleberry Hill Road.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff had a map prepared, dated November 17, 2005, which divided the parcel into two smaller lots, both of which abut Old Huckleberry Hill Road. It is undisputed that Old Huckleberry Hill Road was a public highway in the town of Wilton until 1968, when it was statutorily discontinued pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 13a-49.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">In October, 2007, the plaintiff filed a request with the officer for recognition that the division of the parcel into two lots did not require subdivision approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>because the division was a \u201cfirst cut,\u201d which was not a subdivision as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 8-18.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff also requested that the officer recognize that the lots complied with the Wilton zoning regulations (regulations). The officer denied the plaintiffs request for zoning permits and the division of the property into two lots because, inter alia, the parcel did not have frontage on a public street.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The plaintiff filed an appeal from the officer\u2019s decision to the board. Following a public hearing, the board denied the appeal and upheld the decision of the officer on the ground that the parcel did not have frontage on a public street, and, therefore, failed to comply with the regulations. The plaintiff thereafter appealed to the Superior Court from the decision of the board. The court dismissed the plaintiffs appeal, concluding that the board\u2019s determination that the parcel did not have frontage on a public street, as defined in the regulations, was not unreasonable, arbitrary or illegal. The plaintiff filed the present appeal after this court granted its petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The plaintiff claims that the court erred in determining that under the regulations, a lot must have frontage on a public street before zoning permits could be issued under the regulations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">We first set forth our standard of review. \u201cBecause the interpretation of . . . regulations presents a question of law, our review is plenary. . . . Additionally, zoning regulations are local legislative enactments . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>and, therefore, their interpretation is governed by the same principles that apply to the construction of statutes.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jewett City Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>280 Conn. 274, 278, 907 A.2d 67 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">The relevant town regulations are as follows. Section 29-4.B (5) of the regulations provides: \u201cNo permit shall be issued for any building unless the lot upon which such building is to be built shall have the frontage required by these [regulations on a street as defined herein.\u201d \u201cFrontage\u201d is defined in \u00a7 29-2.B (60) of the regulations as: \u201cThe length measured along that side or sides of a lot abutting on a public street.\u201d The term \u201cpublic\u201d is defined in \u00a7 29-2.B (119) of the regulations as: \u201cBelonging, or available, to all the people.\u201d Section 29-2.B (152) of the regulations defines \u201cstreet\u201d as: \u201cAn existing state or town highway, or a way shown upon a subdivision plat approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, as provided by law, or a way shown on a plat duly filed and recorded in the office of the Town Clerk prior to July 6, 1951, but not including private driveways or rights-of-way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The court first determined that Old Huckleberry Hill Road meets the definition of the term \u201cstreet\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 29-2.B (152). After concluding that Old Huckleberry Hill Road was a street, the court then examined whether Old Huckleberry Hill Road constituted a public street. The court concluded that Old Huckleberry Hill Road was not a public street, and, as a result, the parcel did not satisfy the requirement of \u00a7 29-4.B (5) that it have \u201cfrontage,\u201d because \u201cfrontage\u201d is defined in terms of the length of the lot abutting a \u201cpublic street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The plaintiff contends that the court was correct in its determination that Old Huckleberry Hill Road meets the definition of the term \u201cstreet\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 29-2.B (152), and the defendant does not challenge this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>determination on appeal. The plaintiff claims, however, that the court\u2019s determination that Old Huckleberry Hill Road was a street should have ended the inquiry. The plaintiff argues that the court erred in determining that under the regulations, a lot must have frontage on a <em>public </em>street before a permit could be issued under \u00a7 29-4.B (5). The plaintiff argues that the term \u201cfrontage,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 29-2.B (60), concerns merely where frontage is measured and does not impose a requirement that a lot abut a public street. The plaintiff argues that to read the regulations to require that a parcel abut a <em>public </em>street before a permit can be issued under \u00a7 29-4.B (5) negates the definition of \u201cstreet,\u201d as the term is defined in \u00a7 29-2.B (152), which includes certain private ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">It is clear from the plain language of the regulations, that in order for a permit to be issued under \u00a7 29-4.B (5), a parcel must abut a public street. Section 29-4.B (5) provides that no permit for any building will be issued unless the lot on which the building is to be placed has <em>\u201cthe frontage </em>required by these [regulations on a street as defined herein.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, according to this regulation, for a permit to be issued, the subject lot must, inter alia, have frontage. Under \u00a7 29-2.B (60), \u201cfrontage\u201d consists of the sides of a lot \u201cabutting on a <em>public </em>street.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The term \u201cpublic\u201d is defined in \u00a7 29-2.B (119) as \u201c[belonging, or available, to all the people.\u201d Thus, when we interpret \u00a7 29-2.B (60) so that no clause is superfluous; see <em>A. Aiudi &amp; Sons, LLC </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>72 Conn. App. 502, 512, 806 A.2d 77 (2002), aff d, 267 Conn. 192, 837 A.2d 748 (2004); it is clear that in order for a lot to have \u201cfrontage,\u201d it must abut a street that is public.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s argument, reading the regulations to require that a parcel abut a public street before a permit can be issued under \u00a7 29-4.B (5), does not contradict the definition of \u201cstreet.\u201d Section 29-2.B (152) defines \u201cstreet\u201d as: \u201cAn existing state or town highway, or a way shown upon a subdivision plat approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, as provided by law, or a way shown on a plat duly filed and recorded in the office of the Town Clerk prior to July 6, 1951, but not including private driveways or rights-of-way.\u201d Thus, under this regulatory definition, a street can be public or, in certain circumstances, private. It is not inconsistent with this definition of \u201cstreet\u201d as being public or private to define \u201cfrontage\u201d as abutting a street that is public. The town of Wilton was free to impose the requirement that a lot have frontage on a public street<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> before a permit can be issued under \u00a7 29-4.B (5), and it is not inconsistent with the definition of \u201cstreet\u201d to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The plaintiff also makes an argument based on General Statutes \u00a7 13a-55. The plaintiff notes that when Old Huckleberry Hill Road was statutorily discontinued pursuant to \u00a7 13a-49, owners of property that abutted the discontinued road were given, pursuant to \u00a7 13a-55, a private right-of-way over the road to access their respective properties. The plaintiff argues that the court erred in affirming the decision denying it zoning permits to build on the parcel as a result of Old Huckleberry Hill Road having been discontinued as a public highway. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The interpretation of statutes presents a question of law and, thus, our review is plenary. <em>Jewett City Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>The court found unavailing the plaintiffs argument that the right-of-way conferred by \u00a7 13a-55 to abutting landowners over Old Huckleberry Hill Road satisfies the frontage requirements of the regulations. The court determined that under \u00a7 13a-55, the plaintiff is not entitled to anything more than a private easement of access over the road and accordingly concluded that the plaintiff had not made a sufficient showing that Old Huckleberry Hill Road was public.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Section 13a-55 provides: \u201cProperty owners bounding a discontinued or abandoned highway, or a highway any portion of which has been discontinued or abandoned, shall have a right-of-way for all purposes for which a public highway may be now or hereafter used over such discontinued or abandoned highway to the nearest or most accessible highway, provided such right-of-way has not been acquired in conjunction with a limited access highway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[t]he effect of \u00a7 13a-55 is to alter the common law consequences of the discontinuance of a public highway. While, before the statute, discontinuance extinguished both the public easement of travel and the private easement of access . . . after the statute, the public easement ceases but the private easement remains. The abutting owners now continue to have an easement of access over the discontinued highway.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tighe </em>v. <em>Berlin, </em>259 Conn. 83, 88, 788 A.2d 40 (2002). Thus, when Old Huckleberry Hill Road was statutorily discontinued, property owners, such as the plaintiff, who owned land abutting the road, continued to have a private right of access over Old Huckleberry Hill Road. See id. The public right of travel over Old Huckleberry Hill Road terminated when the road was discontinued. See id., 89. \u201cSection 13a-55 does not purport to reinstate that right of public access.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>As previously stated, the regulations require that in order for a permit to be issued, the parcel must abut a public street. Section 13a-55 grants the plaintiff a private right of access over Old Huckleberry Hill Road and does not purport to reinstate a right of public access. Accordingly, we conclude that the court correctly determined that the plaintiff did not meet its burden of showing that the board erred in determining that the plaintiffs property does not have frontage on a public street.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-6\"> The plaintiff also argues that because the parcel \u201cexisted prior to the discontinuance of the road as a public street, the definition of frontage in the regulations cannot preclude a zoning permit, and the regulation is unenforceable as an inverse condemnation of the property.\u201d The defendant argues in its brief that this claim is unreviewable because the plaintiff abandoned it before the trial court. In its reply brief, the plaintiff admits that it did not pursue an inverse condemnation claim at trial. At the beginning of trial, the plaintiff stated: \u201cWell, in the complaint there was a confiscation claim. I think that\u2019s premature and so I\u2019m not pursuing that.\u201d Additionally, in its memorandum of decision, the court did not address an inverse condemnation claim. We decline to review this claim, which the plaintiff abandoned in the trial court and which the trial court declined to address.
