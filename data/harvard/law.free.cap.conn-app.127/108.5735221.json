Spitz, appeals from the judgment of the trial court dismissing his administrative appeal from the decision of the defendant, the board of examiners of psychologists (board). The board suspended the plaintiffs license for two years, with such suspension immediately stayed, and placed him on probation for conduct in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>applicable standard of care, codified in \u00a7 10.08<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the American Psychological Association (APA) ethical code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court committed reversible error in (1) concluding that he was provided with adequate notice of the charges, (2) determining that he failed to prove bias against him, (3) upholding the final decision of the board notwithstanding that the board violated the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), General Statutes \u00a7 1-200 et seq., and (4) concluding that the board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On September 27, 2007, the department of public health (department) filed a statement of charges (charges) with the board against the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>a practicing psychologist. The charges consisted of five counts that alleged a number of instances in which the plaintiff had \u201c \u2018acted negligently, incompetently or wrongfully in the conduct of his profession\u2019 \u201d and stated that such actions \u201cconstitute[d] grounds for disciplinary action pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 20-192 . . . .\u201d The factual basis for each of the five counts may be summarized as follows: (1) the plaintiff treated a male patient, R.B.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the plaintiff began a personal and sexual relationship with R.B.\u2019s wife, L.B., within one year of ceasing R.B.\u2019s treatment; (2) the plaintiff also treated L.B., and the plaintiff began a personal and sexual relationship with her within one year of ceasing her treatment; (3) the plaintiff provided L.B. with Xanax and/or amphetamines; (4) the plaintiff conveyed confidential information about at least three of his other patients to L.B.;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (5) the plaintiff treated E.B., L.B.\u2019s minor son, and began a personal and sexual relationship with L.B. within one year of ceasing E.B.\u2019s treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">On October 12, 2007, the department served a notice of hearing and charges on the plaintiff by certified mail. The plaintiff filed an answer, special defenses and a motion for a more definite statement of charges pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-177,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which was denied. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>board also denied the department\u2019s motion for summary suspension of the plaintiffs license in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-17 (c)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 4-182 (c).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Administrative hearings to adjudicate the charges were held on November 28, 2007,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and February 1 and April 18, 2008. The board members present at those hearings consisted of three psychologists and one layperson. The department presented three witnesses: R.B., L.B. and an investigator with the practitioner investigations unit of the department, who had produced an investigative report for the department. The plaintiff was represented by counsel and given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>opportunity to respond to the charges, to cross-examine the board\u2019s witnesses, to present evidence, to testify and to argue each of the factual issues involved in the case. The plaintiff did not deny having a personal and sexual relationship with L.B., or treating R.B. and E.B., but rather disputed whether L.B. was ever a patient of his or if he had a psychologist-patient relationship with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The board concluded that the department had sustained its burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence as to counts two and five. With regard to count two, the board found that the plaintiff had breached the \u201capplicable standard of care, codified in \u00a7 10.08 of the APA ethics code, [which] prohibits a psychologist from engaging in sexual intimacies with former clients/ patients for at least two years after termination of therapy.\u201d The board stated that, with respect to count two, \u201con the basis of its specialized professional knowledge . . . because L.B. was present in the [plaintiffs] office in his home during a therapy session, a psychologist-patient relationship existed .... Additionally, L.B. testified that she received treatment from the [plaintiff].\u201d With regard to count five, the board found that \u201c [r] elying on its specialized professional knowledge, the board concludes that in the practice of psychology, when a minor is treated, the parent is part of the treatment. This conclusion reflects a recognized principle within the practice of psychology. . . . Therefore, a psychologist-patient relationship between the [plaintiff] and L.B. existed. . . . Thus, [the plaintiffs] conduct in having a sexual relationship with L.B. less than two years after the termination of that psychologist-patient relationship violated the applicable standard of care, as codified in \u00a7 10.08 of the APA ethics code.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Based on its findings, the board suspended the plaintiffs license for two years, stayed immediately, subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>to the plaintiffs compliance with the terms and conditions of probation for two years. The terms required that, inter alia, the plaintiff undergo regularly scheduled therapy, his practice be supervised at all times by a licensed psychologist, he inform the department of any address changes and he cover any costs associated with these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The plaintiff appealed from the board\u2019s decision to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> claiming, inter alia, that (1) he was not provided with adequate notice of the charges, (2) two of the board members were biased, (3) the board violated the FOIA and (4) the board\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs and hearing oral argument, the court dismissed the plaintiffs appeal. The court found that (1) the plaintiff had adequate notice and the board\u2019s reliance on its own expertise in making certain findings was a proper function of the board, (2) the plaintiff failed to meet his burden of establishing actual bias with respect to either board member, (3) the freedom of information commission (commission) had the authority to remedy a violation and the court would not provide the plaintiff with a result he could not obtain from the commission, and (4) there was substantial evidence to support the board\u2019s findings. The plaintiff appealed to this court. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">First, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cWe review the issues raised by the plaintiff in accordance with the limited scope of judicial review afforded by the [Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq.] .... Judicial review of an administrative agency decision requires a court to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. . . . [Constrained by a narrow scope of review] [n] either this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the administrative agency on the weight of the evidence or questions of facts. . . . Our ultimate duty is to determine, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u201cThe substantial evidence rule governs judicial review of administrative fact-finding under the UAPA. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j) (5) and (6).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> An administrative finding is supported by substantial evidence if the record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. . . . The substantial evidence rule imposes an important limitation on the power of the courts to overturn a decision of an administrative agency . . . and . . . provide [s] a more restrictive standard of review than standards embodying review of weight of the evidence or clearly erroneous action. . . . The United States Supreme Court, in defining substantial evidence in the directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>verdict formulation, has said that it is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Towbin </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners of Psychologists, </em>71 Conn. App. 153, 162-63, 801 A.2d 851, cert, denied, 262 Conn. 908, 810 A.2d 277 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The present appeal is from the decision of the trial court. We review that decision only to determine whether it was rendered in accordance with the UAPA. See id., 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u201c[A]s to questions of law, [t]he court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>239 Conn. 124, 139-40, 680 A.2d 1329 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The plaintiffs first claim is that the trial court committed reversible error in concluding that the plaintiff was provided with adequate notice of the charges.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specifically, he argues that notice was inadequate because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>was not informed of which specific acts amounted to \u201cnegligence, incompetence or wrongful conduct\u201d as alleged in the charges and because the final decision relied on \u201cspecialized professional knowledge\u201d or \u201crecognized principles\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that were not mentioned in the charges or during the hearing. He contends that he was not provided notice that (1) L.B.\u2019s attendance at one session at which her husband was being treated would constitute the development of a psychologist-patient relationship between L.B. and the plaintiff, and (2) his treatment of the minor, E.B., could be considered treatment of the minor\u2019s mother, L.B. The trial court found, inter alia, that the charges put the plaintiff on notice that the board would be asked to consider the appropriateness of his conduct in engaging in a sexual relationship with a former patient, who was also the wife and mother of two of his former patients, and that there was no variance between the allegations of the department and the conclusions reached by the board. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u201c[D]ue process [in the administrative hearing context] requires that the notice given must . . . fairly indicate the legal theory under which such facts are claimed to constitute a violation of the law. . . . [T]he fundamental reason for the requirement of notice is to advise all affected parties of their opportunity to be heard and to be apprised of the relief sought. . . . [N]otice of a hearing is not required to contain an accurate forecast of the precise action which will be taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>on the subject matter referred to in the notice. It is adequate if it fairly and sufficiently apprises those who may be affected of the nature and character of the action proposed, so as to make possible intelligent preparation for participation in the hearing ....</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u201cDue process in the administrative context is prescribed by the UAPA. General Statutes \u00a7 4-177 (b) requires that notice of a contested hearing include the following: (1) A statement of the time, place, and nature of the hearing; (2) a statement of the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held; (3) a reference to the particular sections of the statutes and regulations involved; and (4) a short and plain statement of the matters asserted.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Goldstar Medical Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>288 Conn. 790, 823-24, 955 A.2d 15 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the plaintiffs claim. Prior to the administrative hearing, in addition to being served with the charges, the plaintiff was provided with a detailed investigative report prepared by the department\u2019s practitioner licensing and investigations section that summarized the conduct that formed the basis of the charges and the allegations of the parties and set forth the applicable sections of the APA ethical code. Appended to the report were a number of exhibits, including (1) L.B.\u2019s and R.B.\u2019s civil complaints against the plaintiff containing the same allegations as those in the present case; (2) the expert opinions supporting the claims made in the civil complaints, in which the experts, inter alia, specifically alleged violations of a number of APA ethical rules, including \u00a7 10.08, which rule the plaintiff was ultimately found to have violated; (3) a sworn statement from L.B. stating that she was a former patient of the plaintiff; (4) numerous e-mails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>between the plaintiff and L.B. substantiating the personal and sexual relationship; (5) a letter from the plaintiff\u2019s attorney responding to the allegations; and (6) a May 6, 2007 letter from Donna H. DiCello, a psychologist, opining that the plaintiffs conduct raised a number of serious ethical violations and stating that \u201c[i]t would be expected that a psychologist would not commence a sexual relationship with a patient (APA Ethics Section 10.05), nor a former patient (APA Ethics Section 10.08) for at least two years after termination of therapy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">As an initial matter, we reject in its entirety the plaintiffs claim that he was never provided notice that a single meeting that L.B. attended could be the basis of the finding that he and L.B had a psychologist-patient relationship. This was not the basis of the board\u2019s finding. The board <em>did not </em>rest its finding solely on a single meeting but also credited L.B.\u2019s testimony that she regularly received treatment from the plaintiff. Credibility of witnesses is a matter within the province of the administrative agency. See <em>Prioleau </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>116 Conn. App. 776, 787, 977 A.2d 267 (2009). The charges alleged in count two that L.B. was a former patient,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and, therefore, the plaintiff cannot sustain a claim of inadequate notice as to the board\u2019s conclusion based on that allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>The plaintiff also was given satisfactory notice of wrongful conduct resulting from his treatment of E.B. in conjunction with his treatment of L.B. In count five, the charges specifically alleged that wrongful conduct occurred as a result of the plaintiffs treatment of E.B.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the charges, the department\u2019s investigative report and the attached exhibits, the plaintiff was apprised of the possibility of ethical issues arising from the psychological care of E.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The purpose of administrative notice requirements is to allow parties to prepare intelligently for the hearing. <em>Goldstar Medical Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 288 Conn. 823-24; see also <em>Fleischman </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>22 Conn. App. 181, 191, 576 A.2d 1302 (1990) (stating that \u201c[t]he test of whether one is given adequate notice is whether it apprises him of the claims to be defended against, and on the basis of the notice given, whether [the] plaintiff could anticipate the possible effects of the proceeding\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Here, the charges specifically alleged violations of \u00a7 20-192 and included a description of the facts supporting those violations.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The investigative report supplemented those factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>allegations underlying the charges. Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiff was accorded his due process rights with respect to the adequacy of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court committed reversible error in concluding that he failed to establish that two of the board members were biased. Specifically, he contends that the chairperson of the board (chairperson), a licensed psychologist, demonstrated bias by (1) allowing the witnesses to be referred to by their initials without according the plaintiff the same protection and (2) asking L.B. leading questions during cross-examination. In addition, he claims that the layperson member of the board (board member) demonstrated bias by requesting that the board go into executive session, in which the board member solicited clarification from legal counsel as to whether the board could at that time institute summary suspension. See footnote 8 of this opinion. We conclude that the plaintiff failed to show actual bias on the part of either the chairperson or the board member.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. On January 31, 2008, before the second hearing, the plaintiff moved to disqualify the chairperson. The plaintiff claimed bias as a result of the chairperson\u2019s decision to refer to the witnesses only by their initials and his \u201cinterruption\u201d of the plaintiffs cross-examination of L.B. Subsequently, the plaintiff also moved to disqualify the board member, claiming bias as a result of the board member\u2019s motion to go into executive session to inquire from the board\u2019s counsel whether the board could initiate summary process proceedings. The board denied both motions to disqualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">\u201cThe applicable due process standards for disqualification of administrative adjudicators do not rise to the heights of those prescribed for judicial disqualification. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>. . . The mere appearance of bias that might disqualify a judge will not disqualify an arbitrator. . . . Moreover, there is a presumption that administrative board members acting in an adjudicative capacity are not biased. ... To overcome the presumption, the plaintiff . . . must demonstrate actual bias, rather than mere potential bias, of the board members challenged, unless the circumstances indicate a probability of such bias too high to be constitutionally tolerable. . . . The plaintiff has the burden of establishing a disqualifying interest.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Moraski </em>v. <em>Connecticut Board of Examiners of Embalmers &amp; Funeral </em>Directors, 291 Conn. 242, 262, 967 A.2d 1199 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">We cannot conclude, upon a review of the record, that the board and trial court were incorrect in holding that the plaintiff had presented insufficient evidence to meet his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The plaintiffs next claim is that the trial court committed reversible error in upholding the final decision of the board notwithstanding a violation of the FOIA.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The trial court declined to provide the plaintiff with a remedy that he was unable to obtain from the commission. We agree with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">In the present case, the plaintiff previously availed himself of the statutory process under General Statutes \u00a7 1-206 (b), which provides the exclusive remedy for the violation of a right conferred by the FOIA. <em>Pane </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>267 Conn. 669, 680, 841 A.2d 684 (2004), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Somers, </em>294 Conn. 324, 349, 984 A.2d 684 (2009). The plaintiff prevailed and was provided relief for the FOIA violation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He had the ability to appeal from the commission\u2019s decision pursuant to \u00a7 1-206 (d),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> were he dissatisfied with the relief provided. Accordingly, we will not disturb what the commission deemed to be the proper remedy for the board\u2019s violation of the FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The plaintiffs final claim is that the court improperly dismissed his appeal upon concluding that the board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. The plaintiffs claim fails because there is substantial evidence in the record to support the board\u2019s conclusion that he engaged in a sexual relationship with L.B. in violation of the APA ethical code.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\u201cThe substantial evidence standard is satisfied if the record provides a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. ... In determining whether an administrative finding is supported by substantial evidence, the reviewing court must defer to the agency\u2019s assessment of the credibility of witnesses. . . . The reviewing court must take into account contradictory evidence in the record . . . but the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>228 Conn. 651, 668, 638 A.2d 6 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the court properly declined to set aside the board\u2019s conclusion that L.B. was a patient of the plaintiff. The board\u2019s conclusion is supported by substantial evidence and the board\u2019s assessment of the more credible of the conflicting testimony. Specifically, the court noted that \u201cL.B. and R.B. both testified that they attended joint marriage counseling sessions with the [plaintiff]. . . . In addition, as noted by the board in its decision, there was evidence, including testimony from L.B., that she received treatment from the [plaintiff] beyond those sessions she attended with her husband and son. \u201d (Citation omitted.) Furthermore, the court found that \u201c[w]hile the [plaintiff] denied treating L.B., he admitted to treating R.B. and E.B. and to engaging in a sexual relationship with L.B. [The plaintiff] also admitted that L.B. was present during two sessions with R.B.\u201d (Citation omitted.) The trial court acknowledged but dismissed the absence of medical records for the treatment of L.B. because the evidence showed that the plaintiff \u201cwas concerned about other clinicians learning of his contact with L.B. outside [of] treatment sessions\u201d and therefore had motivation to omit her treatment from his records. We cannot conclude on the basis of this record that the trial court\u2019s determination that substantial evidence existed to support the board\u2019s findings and conclusions was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\"> Section 10.08 of the Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct provides in relevant part: \u201cSexual Intimacies with Former Therapy Clients/Patients: (a) Psychologists do not engage in sexual intimacies with former clients/patients for at least two years after cessation or termination of therapy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-9\"> The board acted pursuant to the authority vested in it by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-17 and 20-192.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Section 19a-17 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cEach board or commission [such as the board of examiners of psychologists] . . . may take any of the following actions, singly or in combination, based on conduct that occurred prior or subsequent to the issuance of a permit or a license upon finding the existence of good cause ...
