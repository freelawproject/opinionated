On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion by failing, sua sponte, during the trial, to order a competency hearing. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">The trial court found the following facts. On February 12,2008, Officer Frank Bellizzi of the New Britain police department, assigned to a federal Drug Enforcement Administration task force (task force) along with officers from several other local police departments, participated in the arrest of Sheveran Hardy. Hardy, who was in possession of 100 grams of heroin at the time of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>arrest, agreed to cooperate with the police by ordering more drags from his supplier. Without being provided a script by Bellizzi or anyone else associated with the task force, Hardy made a series of telephone calls to his supplier while a task force member listened to and simultaneously recorded the calls. The individual with whom Hardy spoke was a male who identified himself as \u201cPapi\u201d and spoke English with a heavy Spanish accent. During the conversation, Hardy and \u201cPapi\u201d planned a drag transaction, using language of the drag trade and referring to items by their quantity. \u201cPapi\u201d agreed to meet with Hardy at his home shortly after midnight when \u201cPapi\u201d returned to Hartford from New York. The purpose of their meeting was for \u201cPapi\u201d to deliver 500 grams of heroin to Hardy. Hardy told the officers that \u201cPapi\u201d drove a green Ford Explorer.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Shortly after midnight on February 13, 2008, task force members on surveillance near Hardy\u2019s home on Allendale Road in Hartford witnessed a green Ford Explorer (vehicle) matching the description of Papi\u2019s vehicle travel from Zion Street onto Allendale Road. When the vehicle stopped, the task force members executed a containment maneuver and approached the vehicle. The officers removed the sole occupant from the vehicle, later identified as the defendant. On the front seat of the vehicle was a large shopping bag containing five separately wrapped 100 gram blocks of a substance that later was identified as heroin. Also on the front seat was a mobile telephone that was associated with the telephone number Hardy had been calling earlier in the evening. The defendant had no drag paraphernalia on his person or in the vehicle. Hardy identified \u201cPapi\u201d as the defendant and said that he was his source of supply. The defendant later admitted that the voices on the audio recordings of the telephone calls were himself and Hardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The events that occurred in the trial court also are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. The defendant was a fifty-two year-old resident of the Dominican Republic who, throughout the proceedings, spoke through a Spanish language interpreter. The defendant stated that he had visited the United States periodically for twenty-eight years and eventually married a woman who lived in Hartford. The defendant had no prior criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Throughout the pretrial proceedings, the defendant maintained his innocence and rejected offers to plead guilty. On October 6, 2008, the defendant waived his right to a jury trial and elected to be tried by the court. During the canvass, the court inquired of the defendant whether he understood why the court would be asking questions regarding his election of a trial by the court. The defendant responded: \u201cMaybe to clear up the case?\u201d The court explained that the canvass would clear up his decision for a trial by the court. The court then apprised the defendant of his right to a trial by jury and advised him that a trial by jury was one of his \u201cmost important constitutional rights\u201d and that, by electing a trial by the court, he would be giving up this right. The defendant responded: \u201cI believe in the experience of the judge.\u201d The court and the defendant then engaged in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">\u201cThe Court: ... As long as you make the decision with your eyes wide open and understanding the important right that you are giving up. Okay? Has anyone forced you to make this decision, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">\u201cThe Defendant: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">\u201cThe Court: Has anyone said \u2014 made any promise to you to get you to make this decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">\u201cThe Defendant: No, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Would it be fair to say that this is the decision you\u2019re making because you think it\u2019s in your best interest to have a trial before a judge instead of a jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">\u201cThe Defendant: God told me so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. And the only other question that I would have is, do you understand that if \u2014 if I accept your waiver \u2014 if I accept your decision, that that decision will be final? And that we will \u2014 final in the sense that we will proceed to a trial before me and not have a jury at all, and you will not have an opportunity to change your mind over the next couple of days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">\u201cThe Defendant: I\u2019m learning this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">\u201cThe Court: What percentage of what I\u2019m telling you in English do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-10\">\u201cThe Defendant: Fifty percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-11\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Well, good, make sure that you listen to 100 percent of what the interpreter says so that you have it all the way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-12\">\u201cBecause there are times when I see you react to my words and I say, well, he understands most of this. But what I don\u2019t want to do is, I don\u2019t want to \u2014 I want to be sure that despite the fact that you have a pleasant smile, that you understand that this is veiy serious business. But I want you to understand that this is very serious business, and I don\u2019t do this for my health but for yours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-13\">\u201cThe Defendant: I believe that I am innocent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-14\">\u201cThe Court: Well, that\u2019s good and that\u2019s perfectly fine. But the issue is, here, how you get tried on the question of guilt or innocence itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-15\">\u201cThe Defendant: I believe that I\u2019m innocent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u201cThe Court: And that\u2019s of course, not responsive to my question. The question I have is, do you wish to be tried by a judge alone? Are you satisfied that that\u2019s the right decision for you to make that gives you the best opportunity to defend yourself properly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, yes. I believe in that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The court then explained the range of possible penalties the defendant could face were he to be found guilty and asked the defendant if he understood those penalties. The defendant responded: \u201cWell, I said I don\u2019t understand but \u2014 \u201d whereupon the court interrupted and again explained the potential penalties in a different manner. The defendant then responded: \u201cI believe in you, forget it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Following the canvass, the court inquired whether the attorneys had any questions or concerns. The court and defense counsel first discussed a separate issue, after which defense counsel stated that he had no further questions about the court\u2019s canvass. The court then stated: \u201c[It] would appear to me that [the defendant] is capable of making this decision. He has been advised of his rights, I will accept his waiver . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">On October 30, 2008, after the state rested its case, defense counsel made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: We are going to proceed with the case, and the case is going to consist of my client testifying. But I want the court to know, and it\u2019s a little bit awkward and perhaps if this were a jury trial I would see the court in chambers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">\u201cI have never, during the pendency of this case, filed a motion for competency of my client, and I am not doing so at this time. But I want to make the court aware of some things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>\u201cMy client would like to testily to things that I have advised him not to. In fact, I\u2019ve advised him not to take the witness stand. He insists on doing so and telling a story that I don\u2019t feel comfortable asking questions about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">\u201cAnd I know that the procedure, if it were a jury trial, would be for the court to permit perhaps a narrative from the defendant and perhaps I could start asking questions. But I think he just, as he put it, wants to talk to the court. And I explained to him that\u2019s not the procedure we use. We\u2019re bound by the rules of evidence [and] there would be questions and answers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">\u201cHe has items in a manila envelope that he says proves his innocence. He chooses not to share those with me. So, keeping in mind, having done this for thirty years, I know there is a vast difference between the ability to cooperate with counsel and the desire to. I haven\u2019t seen anything in my representation of him since February that shows me he doesn\u2019t understand the proceedings or that he doesn\u2019t have the ability to cooperate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Upon taking the witness stand, the defendant first indicated that he was not feeling well and wanted \u201csome pills\u201d because he had an argument with his lawyer and his heart was \u201cbeating very fast.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>explained the advantages and disadvantages of testifying, and emphasized the importance of the decision. The defendant confirmed his wish to testify in narrative form. The court explained to the defendant that the state had a right to cross-examine him, and the defendant affirmed that he understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The defendant\u2019s testimony was that he did not knowingly possess heroin. Rather, the defendant claimed that Hardy offered him $700 to bring an envelope to some individuals in New York, who then unexpectedly gave him two bags to bring back as gifts to Hardy. The defendant repeatedly maintained his innocence, insisting that he was the victim of a conspiracy between Hardy and the . police. The defendant explained that he did not suspect that Hardy would involve him in a drug transaction because Hardy \u201cknows that I don\u2019t deal drugs. . . . He told me to take the envelope, and I took the envelope. They sent a gift to him with me, and I sent it to him and that was all.\u201d To support these assertions, the defendant stated that Hardy was aware that the defendant had withdrawn $15,000 from his bank account and was keeping the money in his home. The defendant offered into evidence a portion of an investigation report prepared by the task force, which indicated that Hardy had seen large amounts of cash in the defendant\u2019s bedroom closet. The defendant stated: \u201cThe case begins where [Hardy] says that I have a lot of money in my house. That\u2019s where the trap begins and the falseness of the case \u2014 that\u2019s where the falseness of this case begins.\u201d The defendant asserted that his arrest was an attempt by Hardy and the police to steal his money, stating that \u201cthey weren\u2019t interested in looking for drugs because there were no drugs; they were interested in getting my money. That\u2019s what they were interested in. They made a mention . . . because they thought I had a lot of money.\u201d The defendant also asserted that the audio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>recordings of his conversation with Hardy were edited to make innocuous conversations seem incriminating.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The defendant insisted that he never had dealt narcotics. He expressed his desire to \u201ccontact the whole world\u201d about the police conspiracy so that the corrupt officers could be removed from the police force.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Over the course of the trial, he expressed open dissatisfaction with his defense counsel. At one point, the defendant declared that defense counsel was asking him \u201cstupid questions,\u201d and he repeatedly claimed that defense counsel was not representing him properly. \u201cI would tell [defense counsel] for instance, this is salmon colored, and he\u2019d say it\u2019s white or it\u2019s black. He always says the contrary.\u201d The defendant occasionally appeared confused and frustrated by court procedures. When the defendant stated that he did not understand some of the procedures because he was in court for the first time in his life, the court responded: \u201cI\u2019m confident that you understand enough. Answer [the state\u2019s] questions.\u201d The defendant also repeatedly referred to Hardy and other drug sellers as \u201cdelinquents,\u201d insisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>that the task force and other government agencies should not be investigating him but should be investigating the \u201cdelinquents,\u201d the real sellers of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">At the conclusion of cross-examination, defense counsel conducted a redirect of the defendant, who expressed a concern for his safety and requested court protection. The defendant stated: \u201cThe favor that I\u2019m asking \u2014 I made a strong testimony yesterday. I fear for my life. I could fear for my life because there are very dangerous people out there. I fear for my family, I fear for myself. I need protection wherever I am. I need you to do me that favor no matter where I am. If I have to go on, I\u2019ll go on. I don\u2019t care about names, I don\u2019t care about anything. If I have to defend this nation, I\u2019ll give names, and I don\u2019t care who falls. I\u2019m sorry for whoever \u2014 detectives, whoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The court found the defendant guilty of possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent and possession of narcotics with intent to sell within in 1500 feet of a public school, as the evidence showed that Hardy\u2019s home on Allendale Road is within 1500 feet of the real property of Moylan School, a public elementary school in Hartford. At sentencing, the defendant again insisted that he was innocent and that he had been convicted unjustly. The court stated that it was confident in its determination and noted that the defendant has \u201cbeen respectful to me and to the court . . . and you have, frankly, behaved appropriately throughout.\u201d The defendant was sentenced to consecutive three year terms on each charge, for a total effective sentence of six years imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The defendant raises one claim on appeal, namely, that the trial court violated his due process right to a fair trial when it failed to order, sua sponte, a competency examination after observing his behavior at trial. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>defendant did not raise this issue at trial and, accordingly, seeks to prevail on this unpreserved claim pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Under the <em>Golding </em>doctrine, \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 239-40. \u201cThe first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>address the reviewability of the claim, and the last two involve the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>56 Conn. App. 26, 31, 741 A.2d 321 (1999), cert, denied, 252 Conn. 927, 746 A.2d 790 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The state concedes that the defendant has met the first two <em>Golding </em>requirements in that the record is adequate to permit review and the defendant\u2019s claim is of constitutional magnitude. We therefore proceed to a consideration of the third prong, namely, whether the alleged constitutional violation exists that deprived the defendant of a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>237 Conn. 633, 662, 678 A.2d 1369 (1996). We conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim does not meet the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">At the outset, we set forth the relevant standard of review and legal principles that guide our resolution of the issue. We review the court\u2019s determination of competency under an abuse of discretion standard. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DesLaurier, </em>230 Conn. 572, 586, 646 A.2d 108 (1994). \u201cIn determining whether the trial court [has] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>abused its discretion, this court must make eveiy reasonable presumption in favor of [the correctness of] its action. . . . Our review of a trial court\u2019s exercise of the legal discretion vested in it is limited to the questions of whether the trial court correctly applied the law and could reasonably have reached the conclusion that it did.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Hernandez, 254 Conn. 659, 665-66, 759 A.2d 79 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u201cThe conviction of an accused person who is not legally competent to stand trial violates the due process of law guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions. . . . This rule imposes a constitutional obligation, [on the trial court], to undertake an independent judicial inquiry, in appropriate circumstances, into a defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>205 Conn. 673, 686, 535 A.2d 345 (1987). General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (a) codified this constitutional mandate, providing in relevant part: \u201cA defendant shall not be tried, convicted or sentenced while the defendant is not competent. ... [A] defendant is not competent if the defendant is unable to understand the proceedings against him or her or to assist in his or her own defense. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u201cThis statutory definition mirrors the federal competency standard enunciated in <em>Dusky </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S. Ct. 788, 4 L. Ed. 2d 824 (1960) (per curiam). According to <em>Dusky, </em>the test for competency must be whether [the defendant] has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him. . . . Even when a defendant is competent at the commencement of his trial, a trial court must always be alert to circumstances suggesting a change that would render the accused unable to meet the standards of competence to stand trial.\u201d (Citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>253 Conn. 1, 20-21, 751 A.2d 298 (2000). \u201cThus, in appropriate circumstances, a trial court must, sua sponte, make a further inquiry into a defendant\u2019s competence to ensure that he is competent to plead guilty.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>65 Conn. App. 234, 248, 783 A.2d 7, cert, denied, 258 Conn. 929, 783 A.2d 1031 (2001). A court is required to conduct such an inquiry \u201cwhenever [the court becomes aware of] substantial evidence of mental impairment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>292 Conn. 483, 523, 973 A.2d 627 (2009). \u201cSubstantial evidence is a term of art. Evidence encompasses all information properly before the court, whether it is in the form of testimony or exhibits formally admitted or it is in the form of medical reports or other kinds of reports that have been filed with the court. Evidence is substantial if it raises a reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s competency . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>269 Conn. 213, 272, 849 A.2d 648 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Nonetheless, \u00a7 54-56d (b) presumes that a defendant is competent, and \u201c[t]he standard governing the determination of competency to stand trial is a relatively low one and . . . mental illness or reduced mental capacity does not alone provide a basis for concluding that a defendant is not competent to stand trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>supra, 292 Conn. 524. \u201cAn accused may be suffering from a mental illness and nonetheless be able to understand the charges against him and to assist in his own defense . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeAngelis, </em>200 Conn. 224, 230, 511 A.2d 310 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In this case, the defendant claims that the court, sua sponte, should have ordered a competency evaluation. We are unaware, however, of evidence that was before the court that would have indicated that the defendant suffered from <em>any </em>known or apparent mental disease or defect, much less one that would have impacted his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>ability to understand the charges against him and assist in his defense. In fact, the record reveals that the defendant fully participated in his decisions not to plead guilty, to waive a jury trial and to elect to testify in his own defense. He responded pertinently with respect to the court\u2019s questions regarding his decisions to waive a jury trial and to testify on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Furthermore, the court had ample opportunity to witness the defendant\u2019s behavior and demeanor firsthand. The court canvassed the defendant twice \u2014 first regarding his decision to waive a jury trial and again regarding his decision to testify on his own behalf. While the defendant was being canvassed regarding his waiver of a jury trial, the court noted that he reacted to and seemed to understand much of the English spoken by the court. When the court inquired, the defendant stated that he understood about 50 percent of the court\u2019s English. During the defendant\u2019s testimony, when he stated that he did not understand court procedures because he was in court for the \u201cfirst time in fifty-two years,\u201d the court responded: \u201cI\u2019m confident that you understand enough. Answer [the state\u2019s] questions.\u201d At sentencing, the court noted that the defendant had \u201cbehaved appropriately throughout\u201d the trial. The court, having been in the best position to assess the defendant\u2019s competence, offered no indication that it thought that the defendant was incompetent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">We note that the trial judge \u201cis in a particularly advantageous position to observe a defendant\u2019s conduct during a trial and has a unique opportunity to assess a defendant\u2019s competency. A trial court\u2019s opinion, therefore, of the competency of a defendant is highly significant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>supra, 292 Conn. 523-24. As such, \u201cthe trial court was entitled to rely on its own observations of the defendant\u2019s responses during the canvassing, in light of his demeanor, tone, attitude and other expressive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>characteristics. . . . The trial court was in the best position to assess whether the defendant behaved rationally at that time.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DesLaurier, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Also, a trial court is entitled to consider trial counsel\u2019s assertions that his client is competent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Monk, </em>88 Conn. App. 543, 550, 869 A.2d 1281 (2005) (\u201c[t]he fact that the defendant\u2019s counsel did not request a competency hearing is an indicator of the defendant\u2019s competency to plead guilty\u201d). In the present case, defense counsel expressly stated that he was not seeking a competency evaluation of the defendant, and noted that \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything in my representation of him since February that shows me he doesn\u2019t understand the proceedings or that he doesn\u2019t have the ability to cooperate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Although the defendant offers examples of behavior that he argues constituted substantial evidence of mental impairment, we see nothing in the record that would lead us to conclude that the court, sua sponte, should have ordered a competency evaluation. Specifically, the defendant notes that (1) he admitted, on several occasions, that he was confused about the proceedings and acknowledged that he still was learning about certain court procedures; (2) he often gave unresponsive answers to questions; (3) he responded, \u201cGod told me so,\u201d when asked by the court why he was electing a court trial rather than a jury trial; (4) he said the police officers who investigated him were thieves who were attempting to steal his money; (5) he stated that he feared for his safety following his testimony regarding the officers; (6) he insisted that the audio recordings of his telephone conversations with Hardy were incomplete; (7) he expressed a desire to \u201ccontact the whole world\u201d about his case; (8) he suggested that the allegedly corrupt police officers be arrested; and (9) he demonstrated open hostility toward defense counsel, going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>so far as not to share certain documents with him and to disregard his advice not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">First, although the defendant did admit that he often was confused by court procedures, a lack of legal expertise is not indicative of incompetence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 28 n.27. The defendant had no prior criminal record and had never been in court before. Therefore, it is to be expected that he occasionally would be confused and require the court or his counsel to explain and to clarify certain issues and procedures. Furthermore, the record demonstrates that the defendant was lucid and that he understood his rights as well as the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">We also do not conclude that the defendant\u2019s response of \u201cGod told me so\u201d during a canvass by the court demonstrates incompetence. The defendant did assert, during the canvass, other rationales for his choice to waive a jury trial such as his discussions with defense counsel and the defendant\u2019s belief in the experience of the judge. Additionally, although the record indicates that the defendant spoke of God on two occasions, there is no evidence that his references were because of any disabling mental health issues.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>123 Conn. App. 625, 653, 2 A.3d 990 (trial court did not abuse discretion in determining that defendant\u2019s belief that divine intervention would occur at trial to produce evidence of innocence did not create reasonable doubt as to defendant\u2019s competency), cert, denied, 299 Conn. 902, 10 A.3d 521 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s allegations of doctored evidence, police corruption, and a conspiracy against him, these must be viewed in the context of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>defense. The defendant advanced the theory that he did not knowingly transport heroin but had been tricked into doing so by Hardy and the police, whose motive was to steal the large sum of money he was keeping in his house. The defendant\u2019s assertion that the recordings were altered was offered to explain the highly incriminating nature of the conversations. His defense, although ultimately unpersuasive, is not facially illogical. Rather, the defendant demonstrated an ability to assert a cogent defense that, if believed, would have exonerated him. The fact that the defendant\u2019s testimony was unconvincing is not evidence of incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The defendant\u2019s assertion that he could be in danger after implicating police officers in criminal activity and his expressed desire to \u201ccontact the whole world\u201d about the \u201creal drug dealers\u201d were also not evidence of incompetence within the context of his defense. Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>65 Conn. App. 59, 82, 782 A.2d 149, cert, denied, 258 Conn. 923, 782 A.2d 1251 (2001), the defendant asserted that there was a police conspiracy against him. Despite a finding by a psychiatrist associated with a New Haven court clinic that the defendant was incompetent to stand trial, this court affirmed the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant was competent, as well as its refusal to grant additional evaluations of the defendant\u2019s competency. Id., 87. This court stated that \u201c[t]he record lacks any credible evidence that could raise a reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s competency throughout the course of the proceedings\u201d; id., 86; and that the defendant\u2019s attempt to place the blame on law enforcement \u201cmay well have been his way of coping with the dire situation confronting him.\u201d Id., 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Furthermore, a defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction with defense counsel does not indicate incompetence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Collazo, </em>113 Conn. App. 651, 663-65, 967 A.2d 597 (trial court did not abuse discretion by denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>defendant\u2019s motion for competency evaluation, despite fact that defendant and defense counsel engaged in \u201cshouting matches\u201d and defendant said he did not want defense counsel to represent him), cert, denied, 293 Conn. 904, 976 A.2d 705 (2009); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 65 Conn. App. 86 (defendant\u2019s refusal to raise defense of insanity, as recommended by counsel, not indication of incompetency but rather disagreement over trial strategy).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Finally, the defendant cites a case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arenburg, </em>605 F.3d 164 (2d Cir. 2010), to support the argument that his competency should be revisited.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Arenburg, </em>the pro se defendant, at a pretrial appearance before the District Court, \u201cproduced a signed note that contained several incoherent statements, such as \u2018[o]n the radio stations airing my thoughts all over the world blaming me for being a drug trade,\u2019 and \u2018[a]king my thoughts through the T.V. channels.\u2019 \u201d Id., 167. At trial, in his opening statement, the defendant told the jury that \u201che was \u2018going to prove that MGM [Studios] is hiding the illegal drug trade in my name through the radio stations that you can call up or they can call you to tell people how to treat me or to find out about me because of MGM.\u2019 \u201d His cross-examination of witnesses included references to \u201c \u2018radio waves\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018microwave channels.\u2019 \u201d During trial, the assistant United States attorney expressed concerns about the defendant\u2019s ability to represent himself. Id. After the jury returned a verdict of guilty, the defendant\u2019s standby counsel filed a motion for a new trial on the ground that the defendant had not been fit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>to proceed pro se. Id., 168. The District Court denied the motion, stating that counsel had not challenged the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial but, rather, that the question then before the court was whether it was required to revoke the defendant\u2019s pro se status. Id. On appeal, the Second Circuit noted that the District Court\u2019s duty to order a competency hearing sua sponte \u201ctakes on increased significance where, as here, a criminal defendant elects to proceed pro se.\u201d Id., 169. The court ultimately held that \u201cthe District Court erred by misapprehending its statutory obligations\u201d; id., 168; and \u201cfailed to acknowledge its statutoxy obligation to revisit defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial \u2014 even in the absence of an application from the parties \u2014 if there was \u2018reasonable cause\u2019 to do so.\u201d Id., 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In the present case, the defendant did not exhibit extreme behavior like the defendant in Arenburg,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although his testimony at trial was unpersuasive, it was not incoherent or bizarre. Secondly, there is no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>that the experienced trial court was unaware of its duty to order a competency hearing if it had any doubt as to the defendant\u2019s competency. The record, in fact, indicates that the court had confidence in the defendant\u2019s ability to comprehend the proceedings, which it noted on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not ordering a competency hearing, sua sponte. Accordingly, the defendant has failed to prove that his constitutional due process right to a fair trial was violated, and his claim fails to meet the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\"> The colloquy was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">\u201cThe Defendant: I feel sick and I need some pills, and I had a very tough argument with [my lawyer] and I\u2019m not feeling well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">\u201cThe Court: What kind of pills?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-12\">\u201cThe Defendant: Something for the nerves \u2014 something for the heart because it\u2019s beating very fast.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-13\">\u201cThe Court: You understand that the job of your lawyer is to give you advice? Is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-14\">\u201cThe Defendant: I don\u2019t feel well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-15\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019m not asking you that right this second.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-16\">\u201cThe Defendant: I\u2019ve been fighting with my lawyer for eight months, and he\u2019s not defending me.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b87-6\"> During trial, the following colloquy occurred when defense counsel questioned the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">\u201cQ. Okay. Now, during the trial last week, one day the testimony \u2014 excluding what we heard this morning from the chemist, you heard in court eight different CD recordings of two voices; do you remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">\u201cQ. All right. And was one of them yours?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">\u201cQ. And was the other one Mr. Hardy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-12\">\u201cA. Let it be known that \u2014 that recording was not complete.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b87-13\"> In his testimony, the defendant stated: \u201cHere, I\u2019m telling, in front of everyone, that they\u2019re delinquents, they should be investigated. They should be kicked out. All these policemen should be investigated from the inside because testifying here they said \u2014 being the law of this country \u2014 they put a delinquent on the phone to ask the questions over the phone with a formula, and the intelligence of this country should work the way it should work.\u201d Later, he stated: \u201cI just want everyone\u2019s cooperation that we clean this country and we clean \u2014 and we clean it of corruption and the same in my country. I want it to be clean.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b94-9\"> The second occasion on which the defendant referenced God was at the conclusion of closing arguments when he stated: \u201cHave a nice day and whatever God wills it to be.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\"> The defendant requests that either his conviction be overturned and a new trial ordered or, as in <em>Arenburg, </em>his case be remanded \u201cin order to provide the court with an opportunity to consider whether defendant was competent throughout the proceedings that led to his conviction.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arenburg, </em>supra, 605 F.3d 165.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\"> <em>Arenburg </em>relies on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Auen, </em>846 F.2d 872 (2d Cir. 1988), which is also distinguishable. In <em>Auen, </em>the court found that \u201cthere were abundant indications that Auen [the defendant] may not have been competent to stand trial. During the government\u2019s initial investigation, Auen\u2019s correspondence with [the special government agent investigating his case] in which he relayed [a story concerning the death of his cat] can only be characterized as the product of a disturbed mind. After Auen was arrested and the government agents discovered his cache of semiautomatic assault weapons, he threatened the government attorneys. Then, when he was brought before Magistrate [Edward M.] Conan, he set forth his various irrational, paranoid beliefs concerning the nature of this country\u2019s tax laws and the basis for the prosecution against him. Finally, when Auen appeared before [District Court Judge Thomas J. McAvoy], he continued to ramble concerning his fear of persecution \u2014 \u2018psychopolitical terrorism\u2019 \u2014 and his belief that he was correct and that the government, the court and lawyers in general were somehow responsible for his unjustified incarceration. Taken together these factors lead us to conclude that reasonable cause existed to warrant an inquiry into Auen\u2019s competency and that the district court\u2019s failure to consider this issue during the pretrial and trial proceedings constituted an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id., 874. In the present case, the defendant\u2019s behavior was far from the bizarre and irrational behavior exhibited by the defendant in <em>Auen.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
