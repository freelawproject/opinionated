Davenport, appeals from the judgment of conviction rendered after he pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2). The defendant claims that his conviction should be reversed and the case should be remanded so that he may withdraw his plea because the trial court improperly accepted his plea without first complying with the mandates of General Statutes \u00a7 54-251 (a) and ensuring that he understood that he would be required to register as a sex offender as a consequence of his plea. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history that are relevant to the resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim on appeal. On September 23, 2009, the defendant entered a plea of guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine to one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2). On December 2, 2009, the defendant was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, execution suspended, with ten years of probation. The defendant also was required to register as a sex offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>pursuant to \u00a7 54-251 for a period of ten years. On December 22, 2009, the defendant filed a notice of appeal, a motion for stay of probation and sex offender registration pending appeal, and a motion to correct an illegal sentence. On January 15, 2010, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to stay probation and sex offender registration pending appeal. The defendant subsequently withdrew his motion to correct an illegal sentence. At no point did the defendant file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred in failing to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 54-251 (a) by accepting his guilty plea without adequately informing him that he would be required to register as a sex offender as a consequence of his plea. The defendant contends that because the court failed to comply with \u00a7 54-251 (a), his conviction should be reversed and his case remanded so that he may withdraw his plea. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">As an initial matter, we must address the defendant\u2019s failure to properly preserve his claim by filing a timely motion to withdraw his plea pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 39-26. \u201cPractice Book 39-26 provides in relevant part: A defendant may not withdraw his or her plea <em>after </em>the conclusion of the proceeding at which the sentence was imposed. . . . Our courts have held that [b]ecause Practice Book \u00a7 [39-26] precludes a defendant from withdrawing his plea after the conclusion of sentencing, [t]he failure of the defendant to make a motion to withdraw his plea before the conclusion of the proceeding at which the sentence was imposed ordinarily precludes review of claimed infirmities in the acceptance of a plea.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>62 Conn. App. 805, 810, 772 A. 2d 690 (2001). The defendant, however, seeks redress of his claim under the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>\u201c[The plain error] doctrine, codified at Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, is an extraordinary remedy used by appellate courts to rectify errors committed at trial that, although unpreserved, are of such monumental proportion that they threaten to erode our system of justice and work a serious and manifest injustice on the aggrieved party. [T]he plain error doctrine ... is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, for reasons of policy. ... In addition, the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. . . . Plain error is a doctrine that should be invoked sparingly. . . . Implicit in this very demanding standard is the notion . . . that invocation of the plain error doctrine is reserved for occasions requiring the reversal of the judgment under review. . . . [Thus, an appellant] cannot prevail under [the plain error doctrine] . . . unless he demonstrates that the claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>290 Conn. 278, 289, 963 A.2d 11 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">\u201c[W]e recently clarified the two step framework under which we review claims of plain error. First, we must determine whether the trial court in fact committed an error and, if it did, whether that error was indeed plain in the sense that it is patent [or] readily discemable on the face of a factually adequate record, [and] also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>. . . obvious in the sense of not debatable. . . . [T]his inquiry entails a relatively high standard, under which it is not enough for the defendant simply to demonstrate that his position is correct. Rather, the party seeking plain error review must demonstrate that the claimed impropriety was so clear, obvious and indisputable as to warrant the extraordinary remedy of reversal. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">\u201cIn addition, although a clear and obvious mistake on the part of the trial court is a prerequisite for reversal under the plain error doctrine, such a finding is not, without more, sufficient to warrant the application of the doctrine. Because [a] party cannot prevail under plain error unless it has demonstrated that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice . . . under the second prong of the analysis we must determine whether the consequences of the error are so grievous as to be fundamentally unfair or manifestly unjust. . . . Only if both prongs of the analysis are satisfied can the appealing party obtain relief.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>294 Conn. 165, 205, 982 A.2d 620 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Although not a per se rule; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>supra, 290 Conn. 290 n.10; both this court and our Supreme Court have often found plain error in instances where a trial court failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of an applicable statute. See, e.g., <em>Genovese </em>v. <em>Gallo Wine Merchants, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 475, 480 n.6, 628 A.2d 946 (1993) (\u201c[i]t is plain error for a trial court to fail to apply an applicable statute, even in the absence of the statute having been brought to its attention by the parties\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>182 Conn. 330, 331-32, 438 A.2d 93 (1980) (\u201c[wjhere the legislature has chosen specific means to effectuate a fundamental right, failure to follow the mandatory provisions of the statute is plain error\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>32 Conn. App. 849, 853, 632 A.2d 47 (1993) (trial court\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>comply with applicable rule of practice constituted plain error).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court committed a clear and obvious mistake by failing to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 54-251 (a) and that, as a result of this failure, his conviction under \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2) is manifestly unjust. Pursuant to \u00a7 54-251 (a), a person who is convicted of a \u201ccriminal offense against a victim who is a minor\u201d is required to register as a sex offender. A \u201ccriminal offense against a victim who is a minor,\u201d as the term is used in \u00a7 54-251 (a), includes a violation of \u201csubdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 53-21 . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-250 (2). Thus, the defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2) subjected him to the registration requirements of \u00a7 54-251 (a). Section 54-251 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cPrior to accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere from a person with respect to a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor or a nonviolent sexual offense, the court shall (1) inform the person that the entry of a finding of guilty after acceptance of the plea will subject the person to the registration requirements of this section, and (2) determine that the person fully understands the consequences of the plea.\u201d Therefore, pursuant to \u00a7 54-251 (a), prior to accepting the defendant\u2019s plea, the court was required to both inform him that an entry of a finding of guilty after accepting his plea would subject him to the sex offender registry requirements and determine that he fully understood those consequences of his plea.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>A thorough review of the transcript of the plea hearing reveals that, contrary to the requirements of \u00a7 54-251 (a), the court did not inform the defendant that he would be required to register as a sex offender prior to accepting his guilty plea Although the court inquired as to whether the defendant had discussed penalties that attached to his offenses with his attorney, to which the defendant responded affirmatively, the court never informed the defendant that he would be required to register as a sex offender as a consequence of his guilty plea, or inquired as to whether he was aware that sex offender registration was a consequence of his plea. During the ongoing canvass immediately following the acceptance of the defendant\u2019s plea, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\">\u201cThe Court: All right. . . . I\u2019m going to make the following findings: I\u2019m going to find that your plea is entered knowingly and voluntarily and it\u2019s also entered intelligently. You understand the penalty of the crime that you\u2019ve pled guilty to, as well as the penalties and consequences of entering that plea. I\u2019m going to find that you have received adequate advice and effective assistance of competent counsel. I\u2019m going to find a factual basis for the plea. The plea is hereby accepted, a finding of guilty is made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-6\">\u201cThe court does hereby order the preparation of a presentence investigation. Now . . . the agreement is that you\u2019re going to receive a sentence of ten years suspended, ten years probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-7\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-8\">\u201cThe Court: All right. And that\u2019s the only promise or inducement that\u2019s been made to you in order to have you plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-9\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes. The only thing, I was trying to avoid the \u2014 the, you know, the register \u2014 to register <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>because, like I said, I want to continue to try to prevent this problem. And I want to deal with the kids. I\u2019m really qualified to do it. That\u2019s the field I should have been in, but I like volunteering to do that. That\u2019s just something I like to do, so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-6\">\u201cThe Defendant: So\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">\u201cThe Court: But I \u2014 I think a plea under this section, sir\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-8\">\u201cThe Defendant: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-9\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014makes the registration mandatory\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-10\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-11\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014if I\u2019m thinking of the right section. And I\u2019m quite sure that that\u2019s something [your attorney]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> has already considered\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-12\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-13\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014in trying [to] work out a deal for you. All right. So, are you going back to Florida at this point . . . ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-14\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-15\">\u201cThe Court: You always have a right to modify the conditions of your probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-16\">\u201cThe Defendant: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-17\">\u201cThe Court: The registration part, though, that, you should speak to [your attorney] about because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-18\">\u201cThe Defendant: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-19\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014that\u2019s a trickier issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-20\">\u201cThe Defendant: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Okay. It\u2019s not an issue that I can give you a simple answer to cause there is no simple answer to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">\u201cThe Defendant: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Any more questions, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-7\">\u201cThe Defendant: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">\u201cThe Court: December 2 for sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-9\">\u201cThe Defendant: Thank you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">The defendant claims, and we agree, that the court\u2019s statements did not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 54-251 (a). Although the court mentioned the sex offender registry requirements during the ongoing canvass, its discussion was not sufficient to satisfy the mandate of \u00a7 54-251 (a). The court\u2019s statement that it thought registration was mandatoiy if it was \u201cthinking of the right section\u201d and its assertion that there was \u201cno simple answer\u201d to the question of whether the defendant would be required to register, were not adequate to inform the defendant that he would be required to register as a sex offender or to ensure that he fully understood the consequences of his plea, as is required by \u00a7 54-251 (a). Thus, under the first step of our plain error analysis, we conclude that the trial court erred by not adequately complying with the requirements of \u00a7 54-251 (a) and that such error is obvious in the sense that it is not debatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">Turning to the second step of our analysis, we conclude that, under the unique circumstances of this case, the court\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 54-251 (a) constitutes \u201cone of the truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>thereby warrants reversal under the plain error doctrine. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>280 Conn. 69, 87, 905 A.2d 1101 (2006), cert, denied, 549 U.S. 1269, 127 S. Ct. 1491, 167 L. Ed. 2d 236 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">In the present case, the error went beyond merely failing to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 54-251 (a). Rather, during the canvass, the defendant informed the court that one of the reasons he was entering his plea was to avoid the requirement that he register as a sex offender. By doing so, the defendant brought the issue of registration to the attention of the trial court and explicitly indicated to the court his fundamental misunderstanding about the consequences of his guilty plea. In response to this statement, the court, rather than expressly informing the defendant that he would, in fact, be required to register as a consequence of his plea, essentially told the defendant that it was unsure if registration was a consequence of the plea. Therefore, in the present case, the court not only failed to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 54-251 (a), but failed to do so even after the issue had been raised and the court had been informed that the defendant was entering his plea on the mistaken belief that doing so would allow him to avoid the registry requirements. We conclude that, under the unique circumstances of this case, not reversing the conviction would result in manifest injustice to the defendant and, thus, the court\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 54-251 (a) constituted plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to allow the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea and for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-10\"> See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b791-7\"> The defendant also requests that this court, exercise its supervisory authority to review his claim, or in the alternative, review his claim under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>the doctrine set forth in <em>State </em>v. Golding, 213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Because we find that plain error exists, we need not address these requests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b794-6\"> Neither party contests that the requirements of \u00a7 54-251 (a) are mandatory. We note that such an interpretation is consistent with the plain language of the statute in light of the fact that the word \u201cshall\u201d is juxtaposed with the substantive action verbs \u201cinform\u201d and \u201cdetermine,\u201d thus indicating that the provisions of the statute are mandatory. See <em>Wiseman </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>295 Conn. 94, 101, 989 A.2d 1027 (2010) (\u201cthe word shall creates amandatory duty when it is juxtaposed with [a] substantive action verb\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b796-21\"> The record reflects that during the plea proceedings the defendant was represented by attorney Matthew S.
