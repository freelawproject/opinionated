Smith, M.D., LLC, and Robert M. Smith, appeal from the judgments of the trial court denying their amended application to vacate an arbitration award and confirming the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>award in favor of the plaintiff, Thomas I. Knox.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendants claim that the court improperly confirmed the award because the arbitrator acted with manifest disregard of the law in contravention of General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. On January 20, 2008, the plaintiff commenced arbitration proceedings pursuant to the parties\u2019 operating agreement alleging, inter alia, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. Thereafter, extensive hearings were held over the course of three days in April, 2009, before attorney Thomas J. Groark, an arbitrator appointed by the American Arbitration Association. Posthearing briefs and other supplemental materials were submitted to the arbitrator for consideration through June 8, 2009. Then, on July 1, 2009, the arbitrator awarded the plaintiff approximately $325,000, plus interest, as damages for the plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">On August 5, 2009, the defendants filed an amended application to vacate the arbitration award. In support thereof, the defendants argued that the arbitrator\u2019s award exhibited a manifest disregard of the governing law applicable to the plaintiffs claims and, therefore, should be vacated pursuant to \u00a7 52-418.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>the defendants maintained that, in light of the evidence presented, the arbitrator could not reasonably have concluded that the plaintiff had proven his claims for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. On October 16,2009, the court denied the defendants\u2019 application to vacate and rendered judgment confirming the award in favor of the plaintiff. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The defendants now claim that the court improperly denied their application to vacate the award, as the award, when considered together with the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d in their favor, demonstrates a manifest disregard of the law in violation of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">\u201cJudicial review of arbitral decisions is narrowly confined. . . . When the parties agree to arbitration and establish the authority of the arbitrator through the terms of their submission, the extent of our judicial review of the award is delineated by the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement. . . . When the scope of the submission is unrestricted, the resulting award is not subject to de novo review even for errors of law so long as the award conforms to the submission. . . . Because we favor arbitration as a means of settling private disputes, we undertake judicial review of arbitration awards in a manner designed to minimize interference with an efficient and economical system of alternative dispute resolution.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Harty </em>v. <em>Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>275 Conn. 72, 80, 881 A.2d 139 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">\u201cEven in the case of an unrestricted submission, we have, however, recognized three grounds for vacating an award: (1) the award rules on the constitutionality of a statute ... (2) the award violates clear public policy ... or (3) the award contravenes one or more of the statutory proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>223 Conn. 1, 6, 612 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>742 (1992). Pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4), \u201can award that manifests an egregious or patently irrational application of the law is an award that should be set aside . . . because [in that case] the arbitrator has exceeded [his] powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made. We emphasize, however, that the manifest disregard of the law ground for vacating an arbitration award is narrow and should be reserved for circumstances of an arbitrator\u2019s extraordinary lack of fidelity to established legal principles.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Here, the defendants\u2019 claims can be summarized as an attack on the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation and analysis of the evidence presented during and after the arbitration hearings. As the defendants argue, because \u201cthe overwhelming evidence\u201d was in their favor, there \u201ccan be no doubt\u201d that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law in awarding the plaintiff damages for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. One need only look to the arbitrator\u2019s award, however, to see that the arbitrator thoroughly considered the defendants\u2019 arguments in the context of the plaintiffs claims and, nonetheless, awarded damages in favor of the plaintiff. Further, in rejecting the same claims raised by the defendants on appeal, the trial court, in confirming the award, correctly explained that the arbitrator \u201chas [the] right to interpret, or not interpret . . . the facts based upon not just credibility of the witnesses, but the documents, other exhibits, and . . . testimony . . . .\u201d See <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Kasper Group, Inc., </em>278 Conn. 466, 474\u2014 76, 899 A.2d 523 (2006) (explaining broad discretion afforded arbitrators in weighing evidence and issuing awards thereon); see also <em>Nussbaum </em>v. <em>Kimberly Timbers, Ltd., </em>271 Conn. 65, 76, 856 A.2d 364 (2004) (\u201cafter parties have signified their willingness to submit to arbitration, arbitrators have the authority to interpret <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the provisions of the agreement which are involved in, or applicable to, the facts of the dispute submitted\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). In reversing the judgments of the trial court, the defendants would have this court review the conclusions reached by the arbitrator based on his thorough, firsthand analysis of the evidence presented by both parties; that we cannot do. See <em>Comprehensive Orthopaedics &amp; Musculoskeletal Care, LLC </em>v. <em>Axtmayer, </em>293 Conn. 748, 754, 980 A.2d 297 (2009) (\u201c[u]nder an unrestricted submission, the arbitrators\u2019 decision is considered final and binding; thus the courts will not review the evidence considered by the arbitrators nor will they review the award for errors of law or fact\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>National Association of Government Employees </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>99 Conn. App. 54, 61, 912 A.2d 539 (2007) (\u201c[courts] are not at liberty to set aside an [arbitrator\u2019s] award because of an arguable difference regarding the meaning or applicability of laws urged upon it\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). In this case, the arbitrator was tasked with the unrestricted responsibility of resolving the plaintiffs claims for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty; that he did, notwithstanding the defendants\u2019 arguments to the contrary. See <em>Saturn Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Premier Roofing Co., </em>238 Conn. 293, 304, 680 A.2d 1274 (1996) (\u201ca party cannot object to an award which accomplishes precisely what the arbitrators were authorized to do merely because that party dislikes the results\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Moreover, our review of the record reveals no \u201cextraordinary lack of fidelity to established legal principles\u201d; <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 10; that would justify vacatur of the award pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). Accordingly, the defendants\u2019 claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-6\"> On July 17,2009, Thomas I. Knox filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award in a separate action that was already pending at that time. The trial court consolidated the proceedings. For convenience, we refer in this opinion to Robert M. Smith, M.D., LLC, and Robert M. Smith as the defendants and Thomas I. Knox as the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 provides in relevantpart: \u201c(a) Upon the application of any party to an arbitration, the superior court . . . shall make an order vacating the award if it finds ... (4) [that] the arbitrators have exceeded their powers . ...\u201d An arbitrator is said to \u201chave exceeded [his or her] powers\u201d in violation of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) when his or her award either does not conform to the submission for arbitration or the award demonstrates a manifest disregard of the law. See <em>Harty </em>v. <em>Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>275 Conn. 72, 88, 881 A.2d 139 (2005). Here, there is no dispute that the submission to Groark was unrestricted and that the award conformed to the submission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
