M. Donehoo, Esq., a justice of the peace, should not be stricken off, as improvidently entered, for the reason that the judgments of the justice were rendered in suits for a penalty from which an appeal can only be taken upon an allowance of the court of common pleas upon cause shown as provided in the Act of April 17, 1876, P. L. 29, and sec. 14, article 5, of the constitution, and that no such allowance was granted in the above cases. And upon petitions filed January 7, 1897, for an allowance nunc pro tunc in said cases, in case the appeals taken to the common pleas under the Act of March 22, 1814, 6 Sm. L. 182, be stricken off by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">Suits were brought by the plaintiff above named, John Thompson for himself and the school board of Buffalo township to the number of three against John Preston, J. B. Akin, and Joseph W. Craig, the owners and operators of oil wells and leases on the land of the plaintiff, before D. M. Donehoo, Esq., a justice of the peace, to recover the penalty in each suit prescribed by the Act of June 10, 1881, P. L. 110, for violation of said act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-9\">The -summonses were issued on April 11, 1896, and the defendants John Preston and J. B. Akin were served in all three of the cases, the other defendant Joseph W. Craig could not be found. The hearings were continued from time to time by agreement until May 5, 1896, at which date the cases were proceeded in to a hearing by the justice and parties; plaintiff and defendants served appeared with their witnessess, and on May 7, 1896, the justice publicly entered judgment against the defendants, John Preston and J. B. Akin for $200, the penalty provided in said act, and costs in each case. On May 15, 1896, the defendants appeared with bail and entered same, and took transcripts of appeal which were filed in the common pleas July 27, 1896, to the above numbers and term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The plaintiff moves to strike off these appeals from the records because the appeals were taken under the act of March 22,1814, and not entered by law \u201cupon allowance of the appellate court or a judge thereof upon cause shown, as provided in the case of appeals on suits for penalties under article 5, see. 14, of the constitution.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-5\">In the applications before us the appellants allege in two of the cases that they have not abandoned the wells; that at some time they intend to drill them deeper, and in the other case, that the well was plugged when the casing was pulled. We must assume that any and every defense the defendants had to these allegations of the plaintiffs in the complaints, were set up at the trial before the justice, and that his findings upon which judgments were entered were based entirely upon a violation of the act as shown by the weight of the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) in making the rule to strike off the appeal absolute.

McCann, 174 Pa. 19.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-9\"><em>E.

The reason assigned is that the Act of April 17, 1876, P. L. 29 under which the application to the court below was made for the allowance of the appeal from the judgment of the justice of the peace, gives no appeal from the order of the court refusing the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">This is quite true, and if we were required to look at the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>as here on appeal or writ of error, technically so called, we would be without jurisdiction. But as everything that comes to this court for review is brought up by a general proceeding called an appeal, a sort of omnium gatherum which includes the appellate proceedings, formerly divided into three classes, namely, writs of error, certiorari, and appeals, we are required to examine each case and determine how far, and in what manner, we shall take cognizance of it. Our jurisdiction is limited by section 7 of the Act of June 24,1895, P. L. 212, to cases of a certain character, which were rev'iewable in the Supreme Court, before the passage of that act. If the latter tribunal could have properly acted on this case, if brought before it in any one of the three ways mentioned, we have the same right when it comes before us generally on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">It cannot be doubted, that it might have been reviewed in the Supreme Court on certiorari. As was said in appeal of Commissioners of Northampton County, 57 Pa. 452, \u201c The general rule is that where a new jurisdiction is created by statute, and the court or judge exercising it proceeds in a summary method or in a new course, different from the common law, a certiorari lies.\u201d We deem it our duty therefore to hear and decide the case as if it had been brought before us by certiorari. The decision in Commonwealth v. Eichenberg, 140 Pa. 158, cited in support of the motion to quash, when properly viewed, tends to sustain our jurisdiction, to the extent already indicated, rather than to deny it.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">But an examination of the record satisfies us that we cannot aid the appellants. An appeal from the judgment of a magistrate for a penalty, or in a summary conviction, should not be allowed save for cause shown: McGuire v. Shenandoah, 109 Pa. 613; Commonwealth v. Eichenberg, supra. To ascertain the cause alleged, reference must be had to the petition presented to the court below: Commonwealth v. Menjou, 174 Pa. 25, and we cannot go outside the petition and deal with the case, as though it had originated on a certiorari to the magistrate. Ordinarily an appeal should not be permitted, if the party desiring it has had an opportunity to fully and fairly present his ease before the magistrate, unless a doubtful legal question is involved, or there is something to indicate oppression, corruption or disregard of law on the part of the magistrate, oi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>after-discovered evidence which would justify a new trial, under the well-known rules relating to new trials for that cause. Neither art. V., sec. 14 of the constitution, nor the act of 1876, which was passed to carry it into effect, contemplates that an appeal shall be allowed merely because the party desiring it is dissatisfied with the result of the trial before the magistrate, as is the ease with most defeated litigants, and cheers himself with hopes of better success in the next encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In the present case the petition, when analyzed, shows no better reasons than the above, coupled with the allegation that two of the appellants\u2019 witnesses were in an adjoining state, at the time of the trial, and that their personal attendance could not be had. It is not intimated that the trial was not in every respect fair and legal, nor is it averred that the justice was asked for a continuance of the cause until the appellants could obtain the presence or the depositions of the absent witnesses. Had they asked for time, wherein to do either, doubtless it would have been granted them; and if refused it is safe to assume that the court of common pleas would have allowed the appeal. They did not choose to ask for indulgence, but deliberately went to trial. We cannot say that the court below was guilty of an abuse of discretion, in refusing the appellants\u2019 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The order of the court below is affirmed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
