An objection that the vacation of the portion of the road asked for, will result in a cul do sac is untenable, when it appears the road, as changed by the viewers, ends at a plan of lots- having streets dedicated to public use and connecting with the original destination through other streets.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b298-9\">Argued April 27, 1897.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7c\">Appeal, No. 111, April T., 1897, by James A.

The said unopened portion in traversing a distance along its own route, of less than one half mile, makes five right angles in its course, runs through a swamp, and at points is steep, thereby greatly increasing its length and making it inconvenient, impracticable and difficult to open, and burdensome and expensive to maintain. That if a public road be necessary between said Allegheny .and Butler plank road from a point near or opposite Undercliff station and the public road known as the Butler pike, at or near the public schoolhouse, there is a shorter, more direct, convenient and practicable route and one easier opened and less burdensome and expensive to maintain.\u201d We fail to see what more was necessary to be said on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The second objection is equally untenable. The road, as changed by the viewers, ends at a plan of lots having streets and alleys dedicated to public use, and connects with Butler street in the plan. Thence, it passes along and over Butler and other streets to the Butler pike, which is the highway reached by the vacated part of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Decree affirmed at costs of appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
