He can declare the contract rescinded and recover back the purchase money paid on the agreement where the vendor has executed and delivered a deed for the same property to another party and put the deed on record.\u201d (4) In charging the jury as follows : \u201c But the plaintiff alleges that this agreement of surrender was never signed by him. He states that no such an agreement was made between him and Wells and that the paper which purports to have been signed by him was not signed by him, but on the coirtrary alleges it is a forgery. This is a question of fact which the jury must determine under the evidence, and we submit it to you, .... it will be for you to determine by the evidence whether the receipt indorsed on the back of this agreement is a genuine receipt and was executed by Willsey as claimed by the defendants. ... If, however, the jury are fully satisfied, and as I have already said to you the evidence must be clear and satisfactory, if you are fully satisfied that the paper is a forgery, then we say to you the plaintiff would be entitled to recover back the amount of the purchase money, $685, and interest upon it from the time it was .paid.\u201d (7) In their answer to defendants\u2019 fifth point, which point and answer thereto are as follows : \u201c 5. That the deed of the above-named defendants to Daniel Mulvihill offered in evidence conveyed no more to the said Mulvihill than the interest which the defendants had at the time, and did not deprive the plaintiff of any equities which he had in the property at that time. <em>Answer: </em>That point is refused.\u201d (9) In their answer to the defendants\u2019 seventh point, which point and answer are as follows: \u201c 7. That the deed from the defendants to the said Mulvihill did not affect the equitable title of the plaintiff, and that he had the same remedy against the said Mulvihill for the possession' of the property as he would have had against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>said Wells, or against said defendants if the deed to Mulvihill had not been executed and delivered. <em>Answer: </em>That point is also refused.\u201d (11) In their answer to defendants\u2019 ninth point, which point and answer thereto are as follows: \u201c 9. That the judgment of P. O\u2019Hagan &amp; Son against the said plaintiff offered in evidence, which was entered in 1888, was a lien upon the equitable title of the said plaintiff, and the sheriff\u2019s deed to James O\u2019Hagan, made in pursuance of the sale on said judgment, divested the equitable title of the plaintiff before this suit was brought, and therefore the plaintiff has not been injured, and he has no right of action in this case. <em>Answer: </em>That point is refused.\u201d (12) Refusal of binding instructions for defendant. (14) Sustaining objections and excluding the offer in evidence of the record of the judgment of Peter O\u2019Hagan &amp; Son v.

The testimony of the plaintiff shows that he was in possession of the property at the time the deed was made to Mulvihill. He says that his tenant moved out immediately after the deed was made. That being the case, Mulvihill took the legal title with notice of Willsey\u2019s equity. He, therefore, stood in Wells\u2019s place in respect to the covenant of sale. He was subject to the same duty as Wells, and bound to perform all that Wells would have been bound to perform, were the legal title yet in him: Kerr v. Day, 14 Pa. 112; Taylor v.

V. R. Wells agreed to convey to Willsey the land in fee, and after Willsey had been in possession of the land for several years and had paid a considerable portion of the purchase money, Willsey discovered that Wells did not own the land in fee, and \u201c could not and would not make a deed to him \u201d for the property. The title of the land in question had been in the defendant\u2019s son, Henry V. Wells. After his death, the title passed by inheritance to Wells and his two daughters. He had no power of attorney to act for them, but undertook to convey their title without their consent. Wells, upon one occasion after the execution of the agreement, called at Willsey\u2019s house and asked to see Willsey. He was told that Willsey was not in. Mrs. Willsey then asked him if he would give them a deed for the house. Wells replied that he \u201cwould not give a deed for the property; that the property did not belong to him, and that he could not nor would not give a deed.\u201d Afterward, and before this suit was commenced, Wells and his two daughters executed a deed conveying the property to Daniel Mulvihill. After the articles of agreement were entered into, and after Willsey discovered Wells\u2019s inability to convey any but his own interest in the property, which was less than an estate in fee simple, he had a right to insist upon a deed for whatever interest Wells had in the property, or to repudiate the contract and sue for whatever money he had paid to Wells under the articles of agreement on account of the purchase money of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">It is unnecessary to cite authorities to support this elementary and well-known principle of law. The party agreeing to convey can also put it out of his power to convey the land to the other party to the agreement by a conveyance to some one else. The choice of remedies would remain, in this instance, to the other contracting party to follow the land with his equitable interest, if the grantee took the title after notice of the other\u2019s equitable interest, or to sue the first party to the contract for the recovery of the money paid upon the agreement: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Feay v. DeCamp, 15 S. &amp; R. 227; Newcomb v. Brackett, 16 Mass. 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In this case, however, we cannot consider the former proposition. The .articles of agreement were not recorded; Willsey was not in the occupancy of the property, the house being vacant' at the time of the deed to Mulvihill, and he, therefore, took his deed without notice, and no equitable interest of Willsey\u2019s could follow the land into the possession of Mulvihill, even though Wells had the title to, or the power to convey, the whole of the property, which he never had.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The conditions seemed, upon first examination, to be complicated by the sale to O\u2019Hagan. O\u2019Hagan procured a judgment against Willsey, which was entered of record in 1888. The defendants offered to prove that at a sale upon a writ of venditioni exponas this property was purchased by O\u2019Hagan, and the sheriff\u2019s deed delivered to him January 11, 1893, which was rejected by the court. Subsequently, on February 10, 1893, a deed for this property was given by O\u2019Hagan to Wells and his two daughters. The offer of this deed was also rejected by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The question presented for our consideration would be a difficult one, had the deed from Wells and his two daughters to Mulvihill postdated the sale to O\u2019Hagan, and from him to Wells. But. Wells had himself repudiated the contract of sale to Willsey by his deed to Mulvihill on November 25, 1889. Before the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale, Wells had disaffirmed the contract; and, even though Wells had attempted to assert them, his equities had been divested because the articles of agreement had not been recorded, and there was no proof that Mulvihill ever had notice of their existence, except so far as notice to Mulvihill might be implied by the occupancy of the premises by Willsey\u2019s tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">What the effect of his removal, at the same time as the giving of the deed to Mulvihill might have had upon his equities, it is unnecessary for us to determine. The fact that Wells could never have conveyed title to the property, as he was the owner of only a life estate, is sufficient for our determination of the question before us. The entire property was conveyed to Mulvihill by all the owners. Willsey at once surrendered the possession of the property to Mulvihill, and the only right that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>was left him was the right to recover from Wells the amount paid as purchase money under the articles of agreement. There was nothing of Willsey\u2019s left for O\u2019Hagan to take by his purchase at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and the offer of the sheriff\u2019s deed and his deed to Wells were properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">It is contended by the appellant that, because the statement contains the averment that \u201c Wells, for himself, and for and on behalf of, and with the knowledge and consent of, Ada LaDue and Frances Wells Forster, made an agreement with the plaintiff, Samuel Willsey, then residing in Renovo, by the terms of which,\u201d etc., the plaintiff could only recover on the theory of facts contained in his statement; and that, unless his proof accorded with the facts as set forth in the statement, he was not entitled to recover at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">During the trial of the cause, a petition from the plaintiff was presented to the court to amend the record by striking out the names of Ada Wells LaDue and Frances Wells Forster as defendants, and \u201c a nolle pros, entered as to them.\u201d This amendment was allowed. The allowance by the court below of this amendment struck out all allegations of liability on the part of Ada Wells LaDue and Frances Wells Forster from the entire record, eliminating them not only as defendants, but eliminating from the statement of claim itself all averments which would make them liable as defendants. The amendment was made after the court had ruled that under the evidence the plaintiff had no right of action against these two defendants, and it was made, evidently, to make the entire record conform to this position of the court. Therefore, when the allegation as to the liability of Ada Wells LaDue and Frances Wells Forster was stricken from the record, as they were by this amendment, there were no averments left in the statement of claim with which the proof in the case did not accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">We have, in this general way disposed of all the material questions raised by the assignments of error. Those which we have not discussed are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
