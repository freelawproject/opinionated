The rule in Shelley\u2019s case, although still in force, is not a favorite in Pennsylvania and many other states, and will not be applied where the technical word children, or heirs in the sense of children, is used, as in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-15\">The primary and controlling devise here is plainly a life estate to David, and at his death a contingent remainder or an executory devise to his children as a class, and this was both the testator\u2019s particular and general intent, and the burden is on the appellant to satisfy the court, that when the testator used the words \u201c during their natural lifetime \u201d \u201c and at their death to be divided amongst their children,\u201d that he did not mean what he said.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-16\">This devise in question does not conflict with the Act of April 27, 1855, P. L. 368, sec. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-17\">The technical words \u201c surviving ones,\u201d mean in this will a definite failure of issue. The other words used also intend a definite failure of issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-18\">It is clear from the whole will that the testator intended to give Iris son, David, only a life estate, and the Supreme Court has frequently said with great emphasis, that such intent should and must prevail over any technical rules of construction, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>not be thwarted by the act of 1855, or by the rule in Shelley\u2019s case: Woelpper\u2019s Appeal, 126 Pa. 562.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-5\">In using the words \u201c dies without heirs,\u201d it is clear that the testator used the word \u201cheir\u201d as synonymous with children, and not in its general technical legal sense, for all of the testator\u2019s children, as well as the surviving ones of the four brothers, would have been heirs of David, had he died without children, and it was impossible for him to die without heirs, and at the same time leave surviving brothers, but of course had David died without children, then the testator wanted the farm kept in the family by its going to the survivors of the four brothers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-6\">The clause \u201c and providing any of them dies without heirs (meaning children) the share of the deceased shall be divided amongst the surviving ones meant only to provide against a lapse. This direction is followed by a devise over to their children in technical terms \u201c and at their death to be divided amongst their children:\u201d Waugh\u2019s Appeal, 78 Pa. 436.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-7\">A devise to one for life \u201cand after his decease, then theisame to go to his children, share and share alike, but should he die without issue then the said property to be equally divided among my surviving heirs; \u201d held he took a life estate only, the devise not being to him and his children, but to them by way of remainder : Curtis v. Longstreth, 44 Pa. 297.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-8\">\u2022 To the same effect is the leading case of Guthrie\u2019s Appeal, 37 Pa. 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-9\">These last two cases, together with Woelpper\u2019s Appeal, 126 Pa. 562, and Nes v.

His only surviving child, Minnie Seybert, contends that under his father\u2019s will he took but a life estate, and the remainder in fee vested in her. His sister contends that he took a fee tail, which, converted into a fee simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>by the act of April 27,1855, passed by his devise to her. The rights of the parties, therefore, depend on the quantum of estate devised to David Phillips.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The devise is in the following terms : \u201c I leave and bequeath to my four younger sons, Jonathan T. Phillips, David Phillips, Timothy Phillips and John Phillips, all the residue of my farm together with the coal scaffold at the river and lot belonging to it during their natural lifetime to be equally divided amongst them in quantity and quality and providing any of them dies without heirs the share of the deceased shall be divided amongst the surviving ones and at their death to be divided amongst their children and so on from one' generation to another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">From the variety of purposes and modes of expression found in wills, it is measurably true that each will is in the nature of a law unto itself, and that the construction given to one is no absolute guide to the meaning of another. The import of particular phrases, and even the effect of technical language and words of art, are so largely controlled by the context, the situation of the parties, and the evident purpose of the testator in its entirety, that language which in one will may be held to indicate a certain intention may in another, from differences in the context and the attending, conditions, receive a different interpretation. Nevertheless, there are some principles, definitely fixed, and invariable in their application, which are to be followed in the construction of all wills. \u201c Where well considered and unimpeached adjudications have assigned to certain forms of disposition a determinate result, we are bound by it as an ascertained law of construction: \u201d George v. Morgan, 16 Pa. 95, Bell, J. It is through the application of the rules thus ascertained that the question arising in the present case is to be determined. The principles to be applied here relate to the limitation of the estate given to the first devisee, the devise over upon his death, and the interpretation of the language employed in defining or describing the estates devised. A brief review of the authorities will exhibit the bearing of these principles on the case in hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">While a will is to be so construed as to carry out, as far as practicable, the testator\u2019s intention, it not infrequently happens that the intention is defeated by the inexorable legal effect of the language employed. Usually this result is due to the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>iii Shelley\u2019s case. \u201c When a testator uses words, without explanation or qualification in the context, which, according to a settled rule of law, import an estate tail, the legal meaning of the will is to prevail over the actual intention of the testator: \u201d Vaughan v. Dickes, 20 Pa. 509, Woodward, J. The rule is the same when words are used that import a fee simple. As the testator cannot create estates that are inconsistent or incompatible with each other, a particular intent must yield to a general intent, when necessary to preserve the compatibility of the estates created. Where the general intention is that the first devisee shall be the root of a new succession, and that those in remainder shall take as his heirs either general or lineal, they take by descent from him; consequently the estate given to him must be a fee, since nothing but an inheritable estate can be taken by descent. A life estate in the first taker, who is to become the root of the new succession, is incompatible with the transmission of an estate of inheritance to his heirs. His estate, therefore, though from a particular intent limited in terms to his life, is by operation of law enlarged to an estate of inheritance that effect may be given to the general intent. No expression of intention, however explicit and absolute, can hold his interest down to a life estate when the further intention appears that those in remainder shall take as his heirs; hence, as was said by Mr. Justice Trunkey in Blair v. Miller, 30 W. N. C. 486, \u201c Wills have been turned upside down by the rule in Shelley\u2019s case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">A devise for life may be enlarged to a fee simple by a limitation, upon the death of the devisee, to his heirs, or to a fee tail by a like limitation to the heirs of his body. Such limita.tion will arise not only from the use of the words \u201c heirs,\u201d or \u201c heirs of the body,\u201d but from any equivalent expression not restrained in effect by a different intent appearing from the will as a whole. Examples of these results are numerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Thus, a fee simple has been created by the following limitations upon the death of the life tenant: \u201c With remainder over to his heirs in fee: \u201d Doebler\u2019s Appeal, 64 Pa. 9; \u201c To the lawful heirs of them the said A. and wife in fee simple: \u201d Auman v. Auman, 21 Pa. 343; \u201c To be equally divided among them the right heirs of my said niece: \u201d Physick\u2019s Appeal, 50 Pa. 128 ; \u201c Reversible after her death to her children, if any surviv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>ing, or issue of such children: \u201d McKee v. McKinley, 33 Pa. 92; \u201c To such persons as at the decease of the said E. shall and may be her heirs or legal representatives : \u201d Ralston v. Wain, 44 Pa. 279; \u201c To such person or persons as should be her right heirs, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns forever, in such proportions as they would be entitled to in case she had died intestate seized and possessed of the property in her own right:\u201d Nice\u2019s Appeal, 50 Pa. 143; \u201cTo such person or persons as would be entitled to the same if the said PI. had died intestate seized of the said premises in fee simple, and in such manner and for such quantity of estate as such person or persons would in such case be entitled to by law:\u201d Dodson v. Ball, 60 Pa. 492; \u201cTo such person or persons as would be entitled to the same in case my said daughters had survived their respective husbands and departed this life intestate seized thereof in fee: \u201d Yarnall\u2019s Appeal, 70 Pa. 335; \u201c At their death shall descend to their children, if any, if no children, then to descend to the brothers and sisters and their children: \u201d Potts v. Kline, 174 Pa. 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">A fee tail has been created by the following limitations upon the death of the life tenant: \u201c To my daughter R., and she shall have it as her own during her life, and then it is to come to the heirs of her body for their own use: \u201d Bender v. Fleurie, 2 Grant, 347; \u201c To W. my son, and to J. my son, and to their children after them: \u201d Blair v. Miller, 30 W. N. C. 486; \u201c When the children or legal heirs of the said W. come to the age of twenty-one years or more, then the one half of the said farm to belong to the children or legal heirs of the said W. forever: \u201d Sheeley v. Neidhammer, 182 Pa. 163; \u201cTo the heirs male of the body of my son E. lawfully begotten, and the heirs and assigns of such heirs or heir male forever: \u201d Carter v. McMichael, 10 S. &amp; R. 429; \u201cIf he shall have lawful issue, then to them, their heirs and assigns forever: \u201d Paxson v. Lefferts, 3 R. 59; \u201cTo the heirs of his body lawfully begotten and to their heirs forever: \u201d George v. Morgan, 16 Pa. 95 ; \u201c To descend to his legitimate offspring forever: \u201d Allen v. Markle, 36 Pa. 117 ; \u201cTo descend and go to the child, and if children, share and share alike: \u201d Haldeman v. Haldeman, 40 Pa. 29; \u201c To his legal heirs, if he have any, (meaning heirs of the body), at his death: \u201d Bassett v. Hawk, 118 Pa. 94: \u201c At his death the use and occu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>pancy to be continued to his issue, if he- shall so have: \u201d Armstrong v. Michener, 160 Pa. 21; \u201c To her lawful issue, to have and to hold the same in common to them, their heirs and assigns forever:\u201d Grimes v. Shirk, 169 Pa. 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Except in the first three of the cases last cited, the limitation was followed by a devise over on failure of issue. This, of itself, is sufficient to create a fee tail in the first taker. \u201c An estate tail would be implied from the devise over, even if there were no gift of a remainder directly to the issue: \u201d Kay v. Scates, 37 Pa. 31, Strong, J. The devise over on default of issue implies that if there be issue they shall take. Whether the primary devise be in fee simple or for life, such a devise over converts it into a fee tail; cutting it down if a fee simple: Amelong v. Dorneyer, 16 S. &amp; R. 323; Hackney v. Tracy, 137 Pa. 53; and enlarging it if a life estate. Among the limitations over on default or failure'of issue, with no intervening remainder given directly to the issue, by which a life estate has been enlarged to a fee tail, are the following: \u201c If she should die without lawful issue of her body, to be equally divided among my other three children: \u201d Mast and Monis\u2019 Appeal, 2 W. N. C. 404: \u201c In case my granddaughter shall not leave issue at her death, I give and devise my said plantation to the children of my sister R.: \u201d Price v. Taylor, 28 Pa. 95; \u201c Upon the decease of either or any of my said sisters or nieces, without issue, (if with issue the issue inherit their shares) I grant and convey their portion of my estate for the use of my other sisters and children in fee: \u201d Potts\u2019 Appeal, 30 Pa. 168; \u201c If he should die leaving lawful issue, to him, his heirs and assigns forever, but if he should die leaving no such lawful issue,\u201d then over: Wynn v. Story, 38 Pa. 166. And \u201cWhere the remainder over, after dying without heirs, is limited to one who is or may be heir to the first devisee, this has always been determined to be an estate tail: \u201d Amelong v. Dorneyer, 16 S. &amp; R. 323, Duncan, J. This relation between the first devisee and those taking by the devise over is a feature of nearly every case in which such a devise occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Upon a devise over on failure of issue, or by expressions of like import, an indefinite failure is understood; those in remainder taking nothing until the entire line of issue is extinct. This is settled by numerous authorities referred to in part by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Mr. Justice Green in Hackney v. Tracy, 137 Pa. 53. And upon a devise over on the death of the first taker \u201c without heirs,\u201d or \u201c without legal heirs \u201d \u2014 terms of equivalent meaning \u2014 to collateral relatives who would take as his heirs, death without heirs of the body is to be understood, since these are the only heirs to whom this description can apply. \u201c It is very plain that the clause \u2018 leave no heirs \u2019 must be read \u2018 leave no issue; \u2019 for the devisees being all related to each other, neither of them could die without leaving an heir if he left a survivor: \u201d Wall v. Maguire, 24 Pa. 248, Lowrie, J. \u201cAs the devisee\u2019s brothers and sisters would have been his heirs on leaving no issue, the testator must have meant lineal descendants and not collateral, when he used the words \u2018lawful heirs : \u2019 \u201d Moody v. Snell, 81 Pa. 359, Per Curiam. To the same effect are Braden v. Cannon, 24 Pa. 168; Covert v. Robinson, 46 Pa. 274; Bassett v. Hawk, 118 Pa. 94; Cochran v. Cochran, 127 Pa. 486. And a provision that \u201c if any of my sons and daughters dieswithout lawful heirs, their portion reverts back to my heirs in common,\u201d is to receive the same construction. \u201c To give the clause any effect whatever, the words \u2018lawful heirs \u2019 must mean \u2018 lawful issue: \u2019 \u201d Biddle\u2019s Appeal, 69 Pa. 190, Agnew, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">When the words \u201c heirs \u201d or \u201c heirs of the body \u201d are used, the presumption is that they are employed in their legal sense, and the intent to use them otherwise must unequivocally appear: Guthrie\u2019s Appeal, 37 Pa. 9. When the word \u201c children \u201d is used to denote the entire line of lineal descent, it is to be understood as meaning \u201c heirs of the body.\u201d It is never applied otherwise where \u201c evidently intended to define an entire line of descent: \u201d Haldeman v. Haldeman, 40 Pa. 29; Yarnall\u2019s Appeal, 70 Pa. 335. \u201c Where a testator intends the estate to go to the whole body of persons in legal succession constituting in law the entire line of descent lineal, he evidently means the same thing as if he had said \u2018 issue \u2019 or \u2018 heirs of the body; \u2019 or if he intends it to go to the whole line of descent, lineal and collateral, he means the same thing as if he had used the term \u2018 heirs,\u2019 which as a word of art describes the same line of descent: \u201d Yarnall\u2019s Appeal, supra, Agnew, J. \u201cWhenever the words of the limitation can be fairly and justly interpreted to mean \u2018 heirs,\u2019 or \u2018 heirs of .the body,\u2019 an estate of inheritance will be presumed to have been intended by the testator. When<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>ever he means to limit an estate to the heirs of the life tenant, no matter how his intent is expressed, an estate of inheritance will vest in the tenant for life: \u201d Dodson v. Ball, 60 Pa. 492, Agnew, J. \u201c Any form of words sufficient to show that the remainder is to go to those whom the law points out as the general or lineal heirs of the first taker will be sufficient, unless it be perfectly clear that such heirs are selected on their own account, and not simply as heirs of the first taker: \u201d Price v. Taylor, 28 Pa. 95, Lowrie, J. An estate tail is created by the limitation \u201cto descend to the lawful heirs from generation to generation,\u201d since \u201cthis could no otherwise be effected than by estates tail given to each of the devisees: \u201d Gause v. Wiley, 4 S. &amp; R. 509, Tilghmajst, C. J.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">While a fee tail can no longer subsist, it may still be created, to be by force of the statute transformed into a fee simple. Whether a fee tail was created by the devise in the present case, depends on the effect of the primary limitation, and of the devise over. This is to be determined by the principles already referred to as governing the construction of the language employed; since nothing in the context, or the situation of the parties, requires a departure from the settled rules for its interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">It is evident that the testator intended equality among the sons; equal shares in quantity and quality and equal estates. The estate devised to each was limited, first, to his own life; next, to his children, \u201c and so on from one generation to another;\u201d and finally, on his death \u201cwithout heirs,\u201d to the survivors. The shares given directly, and those passing by the devise over, are alike thus limited to the children. The language of this limitation embraces the entire line of descent or lineal succession to the remotest generation. The intention that the estate should descend from the sons to their lineal heirs, as- long as the line should endure, is clearly apparent. \u201c This being the int\u00e9nt of the testator, it is immaterial whether he describes the line of descent by a word of art, or by a periphrasis, meaning the same thing : \u201d Yarnall\u2019s Appeal, supra, Agnew, J. This intention can be carried out only through estates tail in the sons. Nothing but the whole line of issue, the heirs of the body, answers the testator\u2019s description of those who are to take by this limitation. Nothing in the situation of the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>ties demands a different interpretation of the language. The limitation is not to children living at any particular time. At the death of the testator, three of the sons were unmarried and without issue. The fourth had one child, but whether this was born previous to the date of the will does not appear. The words of limitation, while inapplicable and inadequate as decriptio persona, sufficiently indicate the character in which the testator intended those in the line of succession to take, since they are strictly commensurate with the entire line of lineal heirship. In legal effect, therefore, the limitation is to the heirs of the body, creating an estate tail. This is quite as manifest, to say the least, as in the limitations, \u201c to their children after them,\u201d in Blair v. Miller; \u201cTo his legitimate offspring forever,\u201d in Allen v. Markle; \u201c To the child, and if children, share and share alike,\u201d in Haldeman v. Haldeman; each of which was held to create a fee tail.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Next as to the devise over to the surviving brothers. Here, as in Wall v. Maguire, Moody v. Snell, and other cases cited on this point, since none of the sons could die without heirs leaving a brother surviving, the devise over on dying \u201cwithout heirs \u201d is in legal effect a dying without issue, or heirs of the body, and thus creates a fee tail. The failure in contemplation is unquestionably an indefinite failure; not until the line of a son, \u201cfrom one generation to another,\u201d is extinct, do the survivors take. In this aspect of the question it is immaterial how the limitation to the children of the testator\u2019s sons is to be construed. The devise over, whether with or without an intermediate estate given to the issue of the first taker, enlarges his life estate to a fee tail. Further, the devise over is to those who would take as heirs of the first devisee, and this has always been held to create an estate tail: Amelong v. Dorneyer, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Thus, features rvhich are severally sufficient to enlarge a life estate to a fee tail are here concurrent; and upon the principles settled by all the authorities, the estate devised to David Phillips must be pronounced a fee tail, which the statute converted into a fee simple. His devise to Margaret Hibbert passed a fee simple, and the court below should have directed a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
