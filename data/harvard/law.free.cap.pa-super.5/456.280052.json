The plaintiff, the owner of the alleged dominant tenement, brought this action in trespass against the defendant,. the owner of the alleged servient tenement, for obstruction of a right of way over the alleged servient tenement. It was alleged that a petition was presented for a road, which should run both over the land of Hudson and Watson, and that it was agreed between Watson and Hudson that if Watson, who was about to object to the new road, would withdraw his objection and allow the new road to be laid out that Hudson would cease to travel the old road; that Watson acquiesced and the new road was laid out upon the Watson property; that Hudson succeeding in having the new road opened, repudiated his agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>and undertook to travel over the Watson property by both routes, whereupon Watson undertook to and did obstruct the old road. Hudson then brought an action of trespass. Watson defended on the grounds : First. That-the road was abandoned by the agreement of Hudson and that the agreement was carried out and that by virtue thereof an additional servitude was put upon his land which resulted in his injury and Hudson\u2019s benefit and that Hudson could not repudiate his agreement. Second. That the road was a public one and that the remedy for obstructing a public road was indictable, not actionable. Third. That the plaintiff could not acquire a right of way through unenclosed woodland. Fourth. That the road claimed was not over the same route, but was a loose and rambling way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-5\">On the first trial a verdict was rendered in favor of the defendant, but the judgment was reversed by the Superior Court.

Now, if you find from the evidence that this road was opened by Moore, and used across, the land of Watson with the consent and agreement of the former owners in title and that Moore and the successors in title to this property now owned by Hudson had the right of way as an easement across the land of Watson, and this right of way was appurtenant to this land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>occupied by Hudson, then Hudson Avould have the right to use that way unless he would abandon the right in some way.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-5\"><em>W.

Superior Ct. 422, one of the assignments of'error was directed to a point presented by the defendant and to the answer of the court thereto. The point and answer were as follows: \u201c If the jury believe the evidence of Israel Watson, that the plaintiff agreed to abandon the road in dispute on the completion of the new road, the plaintiff cannot recover and the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant. That point is affirmed.\u201d The inadequacy of the point was sustained for the reason that it did not affirm as a fact that the new road had been'completed. We' said then in reference thereto: \u201c The mere agreement between Hudson and Watson, even if actually made, would not be sufficient upon Avhich to base an' abandonment of the easement claimed by Watson, unless that agreement was'actually carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>into effect, and the jury should have been so instructed.\u201d If the public road concerning which the agreement was made was actually opened, the agreement between the parties was then \u201ccarried into effect\u201d and the abandonment of the easement claimed by Hudson could be enforced. This seems to have been clearly comprehended by the court in the general charge to the jury'; and,, if nothing further had been said upon the subject, no objection could be taken thereto. The plaintiff\u2019s ninth point, however, goes much farther and, in affirming that point, the court fell into error. The answer of the court to this point constitutes the first assignment of error. The point and answer are as follows: \u201cWe instruct you that the mere agree-' ment between Hudson and Watson, even if actually made, would not be sufficient upon which to base an abandonment of the easement claimed by Hudson, unless that agreement was actually carried into effect, and to carry it into effect it was essential that Watson, the defendant, should have taken possession of the way or obstructed the road, under and in pursuance of the terms of the agreement.\u201d The agreement, as claimed by the defendant, was that, if Watson, the owner of the servient tenement, refrained from interfering in any way with the opening of the public road which was the subject of negotiations, that then and in that event Hudson, the owner of the dominant tenement, would abandon the easement claimed by him. Watson was under no obligation, by reason of the terms of the agreement or otherwise, to obstruct the right of way claimed by Hudson. He might wish to keep it open for his own use or for the use of the public. He already had possession of the land over which the easement was claimed and that portion of the plaintiff\u2019s point, therefore, which related to carrying the agreement into effect was erroneous and altogether misleading and should have been refused, as stated; or, the first part of the point could have been affirmed and the latter part relating to the manner in which the agreement was to be carried into effect, refused or modified. In order to carry the agreement into effect, it was' only necessary that the public road which was the subject of the agreement should be actually opened for public use. The first assignment of error is, therefore, sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">If in that portion of the charge of the court to the jury embodied in the second assignment of error the court intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>convey the impression that an easement can be gained by the use of a way with the consent and agreement of the owner of the land over which the same is used, it was erroneous. Mr. Chief Justice Lewis, in Okeson v. Patterson, 29 Pa. 22, clearly stated the law upon this subject: \u201c An uninterrupted adverse possession of land for the period of twenty-one years gives a title which is not to be defeated by a mere protestation of the owner. He must make an entry or bring an action within twenty-one years or his right is gone; so in the case of an easement over his land, uninterrupted enjoyment of it for twenty-one years adversely to the rights of the owner of the land gives a title which cannot be defeated by mere objections or denials of the right. He must bring an action or obstruct the enjoyment within twenty-one years from its commencement or his right to obstruct it is gone.\u201d So, in Bennett v. Biddle, 140 Pa. 396, it was held that \u201c The right must not only have been enjoyed without interruption for twenty-one years but that enjoyment must have been adverse to the rights of the owner of the land, in order to give a title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">None of the other assignments of error are sustained. Even if the trial judge were mistaken in his recollection as to the name of the witness who testified as to Watson\u2019s declarations in regard to the character of the road through his premises, as complained of in the third assignment, it would not he a reversible error. The name of the wdtness is not stated as a fact and, therefore, the question was practically left to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">As to the fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth and ninth assignments it is only necessary to say that two of the essential qualities of easements are that they are imposed for the benefit of corporeal property and that there must be two distinct tenements, the dominant to which the right belongs and the servient upon which the obligation rests: Washburn\u2019s Easements and Servitudes (3d ed.), 1873, sec. 3. They do not attach, at least when claimed by prescription, to the person. The same particularity, therefore, in regard to the title of the dominant tenement is not necessary as in the case of an ejectment. If the occupier of the dominant tenement who laid the foundation of the right of way by prescription were there by a claim of right, as John Moore seemed to be, we think the necessary conditions of acquiring a right by prescription were fulfilled. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>evidence is not very explicit, lie would seem to have acquired title to the laud which he occupied as well as to the right of way, by possession of the one and use of the other, and this prior to the act of April 25, 1850. There was no error in the answers of the court to the first and second points of the plaintiff, as complained of in the eighth and ninth assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">As to the seventh assignment, there is no attempt on the part of the plaintiff to recover for damages sustained by the public. The fact that the- public traveled the road referred to does not necessarily interfere with his right of way as claimed in his statement. As a matter of careful pleading, it would have perhaps been better to have omitted the statement as to the public but we cannot see that the statement of this fact interferes with the right to recover. It is, at the most, a bit of surplus-age which would have been stricken out by the court upon application.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Being compelled to sustain the first assignment of error and also the second, if the construction put by the appellant upon the part of the charge of the court complained of therein is correct, as it seems to be, the judgment is reversed and a new venire awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
