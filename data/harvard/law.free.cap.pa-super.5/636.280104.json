If you should consider she has not established these facts that would be the end of the case. If, on the other hand, you think she had made this complaint and it was disregarded, as she says, then you would have to decide what compensation ought to be given her for the injuries she has sustained. You have seen the injury, and it is patent from-looking at her hand what injuries she has suffered, and you have a right to consider that; you have a right to consider the pain and suffering she has undergone, the loss of business, and any other injury of that character growing out of such a wound. All these things you have a right to consider; but, of course, you must consider them from a business standpoint, and not from any sentiment you may feel towards her. You must consider this question as business men. We all know that Philadelphia is a great manufacturing center, and that it is a great advantage for manufacturers to employ labor at a reasonable rate, and it is a great advantage to men having large families to put their children in these factories to earn money towards their support, and therefore these people are not to be looked upon as enemies of the human race. You must look at it in this way; you must come down to look at it from a business standpoint as business men, as if it had happened in your employ. You must consider the question carefully, as if it were a matter of business you were involved in, and arrive at what you think would be a fair and reasonable compensation for the injury received and the suffering undergone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-6\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $500.

The assignment of errors, when filed, constitutes the declaration of the appellant and specifies the errors alleged to have been committed by the trial court. Each error must be specified separately and distinctly, and to these the appellee should plead, or demur, as the circumstances may warrant. In this way questions are properly presented for review: Burkholder v. Stahl, 58 Pa. 371; Armstrong\u2019s Appeal, 68 Pa. 409. An appellate court may, in its discretion, consider jurisdictional or other fundamental errors apparent on the face of the record, though unassigned; but errors not thus manifest, though they might be adjudged fatal if properly brought to notice, will not be considered unless specifically assigned: Anderson v. Long, 10 S. &amp; R. 55: Uplinger v. Bryan, 12 Pa. 219; Hutchinson v. Campbell, 25 Pa. 273; Arthurs v. Smathers, 38 Pa. 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">The assignment in the present case contains two specifications. The exception on which the first is based is the following: \u201c Exception for defendant to the charge of the court submitting the case to the jury at all to find in favor of the plaintiff; \u201d and on this the entire charge is assigned for error.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">Both the Supreme Court and this court have discountenanced the practice of assigning the entire charge for error, without specifying the ground of complaint. Nearly half a century ago, the Supreme Court said: \u201c The fourth error assigned, to wit: that the court erred in their charge to the jury generally, is no assignment of error at all. If the party cannot put his finger upon some error and specify it, we take it for granted that he cannot find any: \u201d Zerbe v. Miller, 16 Pa. 488, Coulter, J. A similar view repeatedly appears in later cases. How such an assignment has been regarded by this court is shown in Com. v. Swayne, 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 547, and in Taylor v. Sattler, decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>in the present term (to be reported in 6 Pa. Superior Ct.). Its defects are strikingly exhibited in the case before us. The charge embraces the views of the court below in relation to the alleged negligence of the defendant, the plaintiff\u2019s assumption of the risks of the employment, the effect of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged complaint of defects in the machinery used, and the defendant\u2019s alleged promise of remedy; in general, the matters to be established to entitle the plaintiff to recover, and to be considered in estimating the damages in the event of her right to recover. An assignment, in gross, of the charge on all these points as erroneous, is a flagrant violation of Rule XV., which requires that \u201c Each error relied on must be assigned particuularly, and by itself. If any assignments embrace more than one point, or refer to more than one bill of exceptions, or raise more than one distinct question, it shall be considered a waiver of the errors so alleged.\u201d In the present case, neither specifically nor by description are the errors complained of indicated. The assignment includes every point involved and every question embraced in the charge; and as it makes no discrimination among these, it can be understood only as alleging error in the instruction respecting each. Further than this, it includes, without specification, all possible errors of omission, of bias, of misrecital of evidence, and of inadequacy in any respect. Under the rule, its inclusion of all that might, for any reason, be complained of, must be regarded as a waiver of the errors thus indefinitely alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">There are other aspects of this assignment, but they are equally untenable. If construed as alleging error \u201c in submitting the case to the jury to find in favor of the plaintiff,\u201d it must fail, because the case was not so submitted. The court distinctly instructed the jury as to the matters which the plaintiff must establish to their satisfaction, with the further instruction that unless these were established \u201c that would be the end of the case.\u201d If construed as alleging error, not in the manner of submitting, but in \u201csubmitting the case to the jury at all,\u201d it has nothing to stand on, since there was no request to take the case from the jury. In this view, the assignment can be regarded only as in substance alleging that the court erred in not directing a verdict for the defendant; but in the absence of a request for such direction this affords no ground of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>The second assignment was practically abandoned for insufficiency at the argument. It violates Rule XVII. in not quoting the full substance of the bill of exceptions, and indeed exhibits no exception. When the rejection of evidence is assigned for error, the assignment should show that the ruling was excepted to. It is not enough that this may be indicated by the notes of evidence, as in the present instance it appears to be, though somewhat obscurely, from the unusual method of printing it. The assignment must be self-sustaining, and contain in substance the bill of exceptions on which it is based. In the absence of this, there is nothing to entitle it to consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The record disclosing no error, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
