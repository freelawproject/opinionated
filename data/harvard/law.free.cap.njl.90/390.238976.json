In order that a defendant may have the benefit of section 130 of the Criminal Procedure act <em>(Comp.

And where the defendant neglects to obtain such a certificate, the review is limited to alleged errors arising on the face of the record itself or upon bills of exceptions duly taken.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b428-10\">2. A lack of sufficient evidence to make out the case charged in the indictment is not a ground for arresting judgment.

J. L. </em>580.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">There is no bill of exceptions, and the only assignment of error is \u201cbecause the court denied the motion made on behalf of (he defendant before judgment was announced for an arrest of judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">!\\re are of the opinion that such motion was properly denied. The sole contention made in support of the motion is that (here was not sufficient evidence to support the, conviction.. But a lack of sufficient evidence is not a ground for arresting judgment. In order to properly raise such a question there should have been a request to direct an acquittal or to charge in conformity with the contention. <em>Powe </em>v. <em>State, </em>48 N. <em>J. L. </em>34; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>84 <em>Id. </em>1. No such request was made. However, in order to see that no injustice has been done, we have looked into the question argued and find no merit in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">The judgment of the court below will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
