It was not-error in this case to refuse to direct a verdict in favor of the defendant on, the ground that there was no proof of negligence on the part of the defendant, or because the decedent was guilty of contributory negligence. They were both jury questions. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em>74 <em>N. J. L. </em>469; <em>Weiss v.

A rule to show- cause was allowed, reserving objections and exceptions noted at the trial. The verdict was reduced to the sum of four thousand ($4,000) dollars. The trial court refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>set aside the verdict on the ground that it was against the weight -of evidence. The points argued by the appellant for a reversal of the judgment are, first, there was no proof of negligence on the part of the defendant; second, a verdict-should have been directed for the. defendant because of contributory negligence of the decedent, Ferdinand Materka; third, error in the charge of the trial judge, and in the refusal to charge as requested, but this latter point involves the same points.as are in the first two, except as hereinafter noted. This is the second trial of the case. The judgment recovered in the first trial was reversed by the Supreme Court for trial errors. The judgment of the Supreme Court was affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals. In the report of the case the facts-are quite fully and satisfactorily stated. <em>Materka </em>v. <em>Erie Railroad Co., </em>88 <em>N. J. L. </em>372.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The crux of the case is whether there was evidence, from which the jury might find, that the decedent attempted to make the crossing, while the safety gates were up and without receiving any warning from the flagman, that the train, which struck the decedent, approached the crossing without giving the statutory signals, of ringing a bell or sounding a steam whistle.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The. record shows the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">David Harris, a witness, testified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Were the gates up when you crossed over ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes. * * * I crossed into East Rutherford and I saw this gentleman get off this trolley car and cross the railroad tracks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Were the gates up when he crossed ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>The gates were up on one, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>On your side?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>The side I crossed the gate was up on, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-15\"><em>\"Q.- </em>That is the side he entered the tracks from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-16\"><em>\"A. </em>That is the side he entered the tracks on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-17\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>When he came from the trolley car and went on the tracks the gates were up, I understand ?_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-18\"><em>\u201cA. </em>That is right, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number><em>\u201cQ. </em>After he got on the tracks what occurred?

P^5, </em>where he was standing at that time.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-24\">Re-direct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-25\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Now, Mr. Hobart asked you if you were listening for the .express train; you did not know it was coming until you saw it, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-26\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-27\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And from the time you started across the crossing up to and until the time you saw the express train, had you heard any whistle or bell of any kind ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-28\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-29\">Genevieve Ruth Saxly, a witness standing at the crossing at the time of the accident, did not hear any whistle before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the decedent was struck; she said she was not listening for whistles.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Under the rule laid down in the cases, in the Court of Errors and Appeals of this state, such as <em>Danskin </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em>83 <em>N. J. L. 522, </em>526; <em>Horandt </em>v. <em>Central Railroad Co., </em>81 <em>Id. </em>488; <em>Waible </em>v. <em>West Jersey, &amp;c., Railroad Co., </em>87 <em>Id. </em>573; <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Erie Railroad Co., </em>69 <em>Id. </em>57, 60; <em>affirmed, </em>70 <em>Id. </em>337, this evidence was for the jury\u2014it made a jury question. The point cannot be removed from the domain of the jury. . \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The cases of <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em>74 <em>N. J. L. </em>469; <em>Weiss </em>v. <em>Central Railroad Co., </em>76 <em>Id. </em>348; <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Northern Railroad Co., </em>78 <em>Id. </em>683, distinguished. So, contributory negligence of the decedent was also a jury question under such cases as <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Erie Railroad Co., </em>87 <em>Id. </em>487; <em>Fernetti v. West Jersey, &amp;c., Railroad Co., Id. </em>268.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">This disposes of the case, except it is further urged that there was error in the refusal of the trial court to charge each of two specific requests in reference to the statutory signals and the operation of the crossing gates; each request covers separate charges of negligence. The judgment must be reversed, so it is argued, because the trial judge permitted the jury to base a verdict aipon either ground, notwithstanding the specific requests submitted by the defendant with respect to each allegation of negligence. The court in the charge to the jury \u2022\u2022had covered each ground fully, accurately and clearly. The requests refused were, in effect, to take the case from the jury, hence this was not error, in view of the cases above cited. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u25a0 The judgment of the-Hudson Circuit Court is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
