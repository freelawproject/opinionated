L. </em>273, this court decided that a defendant could not recover costs against an administrator in an action brought under the \u201cDeath act.\u201d He also admits that for nearly fifty years this rule has been applied in this court. He then argues with much force that the rule is wrong, for the reason that the administrator does not sue in the right of his intestate, but in the right of statutory beneficiaries. We express no opinion as to whether the original decision of this question ivas correct or not, for the reason that it is the judicial habit of this court under the circumstances now before us to follow its own previous decision, leaving it to the Court of Errors and Appeals' to review the legal merits of such decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The rule of <em>non pros, </em>may be entered, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
