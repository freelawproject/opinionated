Whether or not such suggested requirement would meet this defect is not up for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">The payment of real estate taxes on a residence or place of business affords no basis for exemption from an occupa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>tion tax; the two imposts are entirely unrelated. A nonresident might own and pay taxes on all the real estate in the borough and still be required to pay this occupation tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The grounds of exemption being thus arbitrary and illusory, the ordinance fails to support the conviction, which is set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
