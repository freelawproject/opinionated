A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A5o\">The infant plaintiff, a seven-year-old child, while riding a bicycle in a public street was injured in a collision with an automobile being operated by defendant. She sued for damages. Her father also sued for medical expenses incurred on behalf of his daughter. The case was submitted to a jury which returned a verdict of \u201cno cause of action.\u201d Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">On behalf of the infant plaintiff it is contended that the trial court\u2019s charge on contributory negligence was confusing and erroneous. We do not agree. The charge substantially set forth the correct rule of contributory negligence applicable to the instant case. Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 objection to the charge, at trial, was confined to the court\u2019s statement that the jury should judge the infant \u201cby the conduct <em>expected </em>of a girl her age * * * as to the conduct <em>expected </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>of a seven-year old child and her intelligence or her ability.\u201d (Emphasis added.) While not carefully articulated, the language used was substantially correct. Note the similar use of the word \u201cexpected\u201d in <em>Bush v. N. J. &amp; N. Y. Transit Co., Inc., </em>30 <em>N. J. </em>345, 358 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">It is also argued that the trial court erred in charging the jury that the father\u2019s claim for consequential damages would be barred by the contributory negligence of the infant plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">It is conceded that the general rule in this country is that a parent\u2019s claim for consequential damages is barred by the contributory negligence of the injured child. 3 <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>\u00a7 703, <em>comment </em>a (1938); 39 <em>Am. Jur., Parent and Child, </em>\u00a7 85, <em>p. </em>731; 67 <em>C. J. S. Parent and Child </em>\u00a7 47. However, the rule has been criticized as illogical. See <em>Prosser, The Law of Torts (2d ed. </em>1955), \u00a7 104, at <em>p. </em>702; 1 <em>Harper and James, The Law of Torts </em>633 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In this State the issue has never been directly passed upon, although several cases indicate that the general rule, <em>supra, </em>would be followed. <em>Cf. Vorrath v. Burke, </em>63 <em>N. J. L. </em>188 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1899); <em>Rossman v. Newbon, </em>112 <em>N. J. L. </em>261 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1934); <em>Folley v. United B. &amp; L. Assn., </em>13 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>293, 178 <em>A. </em>95 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">On behalf of the parent claimant herein it is argued that the recent decision- of our Supreme Court in <em>Orr v. Orr, </em>36 <em>N. J. </em>236 (1961), indicates that the court would now hold that the contributory negligence of the child is not a bar to the parent\u2019s claim for consequential damages. In <em>Orr </em>it was held that a parent\u2019s claim for consequential damages was basically a separate cause of action and could be maintained even though the infant\u2019s claim became barred by her subsequent marriage to the tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">All that the Supreme Court held in <em>Orr </em>was that the infant\u2019s subsequent marriage to the tortfeasor operated to bar only her own suit and did not affect her father\u2019s claim which, like her own, was initially valid and enforceable. The opinion therein, while holding that the father\u2019s claim was \u201cbasically a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>separate cause of action,\u201d recognized that ordinarily the facts establishing initial liability of the defendant to the child must be proved in a parent\u2019s canse of action for consequential damages. Where the infant is contributorily negligent there is no initial cause of action on behalf of the infant. The <em>Orr </em>decision is distinguishable on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We adhere to the genera] rule that a parent\u2019s claim for consequential damages is barred by the contributory negligence of the injured child.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">We note that this would have been an appropriate ease to utilize the procedures set forth in <em>R. R. </em>4:50 regarding special verdicts. We do not know whether the jury\u2019s verdict of \u201cno cause of action\u201d was based on a finding that defendant\u2019s negligence had not been established by a preponderance of the evidence, or that defendant was negligent but that the infant plaintiff was contributorily negligent. Had the jury been required to return special findings of fact this appeal might have been obviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
