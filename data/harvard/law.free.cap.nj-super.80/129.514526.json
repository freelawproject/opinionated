A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AIN\">Petitioner was denied workmen\u2019s compensation by the Division but the County Court reversed, in an opinion reported in 73 <em>N. J. Super. </em>175. Steinbacher Packing Co. (Steinbacher) appeals. We affirm, but on somewhat different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">The evidence shows that Hawksford had his own small meat route, making deliveries to his customers in a rented truck. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Steinbaeher was a wholesaler. Hawksford came to Steinbaeher\u2019s plant daily to bny meat for distribution to his customer\u2019s. One day, when Hawksford was at the plant to make such a purchase, Steinbaeher asked him to cut up a quarter of beef for a customer who was in a hurry, Steinbacher\u2019s other butchers being out or engaged. While doing so, Hawksford was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">As the County Court said, the only question in the case is whether Hawksford was an employee as defined in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15\u201436 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">\u201c* * * \u2018employee\u2019 is synonymous with servant, and includes all natural persons * * who perform service for an employer for financial consideration, exclusive of casual employments, which shall be defined, if in connection with the employer\u2019s business, as employment the occasion for which arises by chance or is purely accidental; * * <em>it</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">As the County Court pointed out, Hawksford is entitled to compensation if he was performing the service for Steinbaeher \u201cfor financial consideration\u201d; financial consideration need not be in money, and, if Hawksford was an employee as defined in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-36, his employment was not casual. <em>Graham v. Green, </em>31 <em>N. J. </em>207 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">We hold that Hawksford was doing a service for Steinbacher in exchange for special concessions in his purchases of meat received from Steinbacher in the past and to be received in the future, and, in view of their economic relationship to each other and their course of dealing, that constituted service for financial consideration. 1 <em>Schneider, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 227, <em>pp. </em>600-601; 1 <em>Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 47.43(b), <em>pp. </em>702-703; <em>Killebrew v.

Industrial Commission, supra, </em>Verretto and Sullivan, partners, were baling hay for Walter A. Duncan. Duncan\u2019s son Jimmy helped the partners do the job. Further facts appear in the excerpt from the opinion quoted below. The question was whether Jimmy was an employee of the partnership. The court held that he was, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">\u201c\u00ae * * While Jimmy Duncan deemed himself indebted to Verretto for favors in machinery lent to him in the past, he neither asked for nor received any compensation from Verretto or the partnership for his work as punch-back on the Walter Duncan job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>of July 1, 1945. It appears from the testimony of Jimmy Duncan that he had worked for Yerretto and Sullivan prior to said July 1, 1945, and had been paid 50$ an hour * * * Jimmy Duncan testified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">\u2018Q. I would like to know\u2014was there any change in your relationship as to who was boss on the job on that day and in comparison with the days you worked and received pay for them? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">Q. You were working and Rusty (meaning Verretto) was the boss? A. Yes, sir.\u2019 [176 <em>P 2d, p. </em>927]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">* * * <em>t\u00a1\u00a1 </em>#</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">* <em>* </em>* Ho had previously been so employed and paid by Verretto and Sullivan for similar work. His employment at the time of the alleged accident was for exchange of services for favors, and the fact that the services were to be compensated for in some manner not by money does not make the contract for hire any the less legal and effective. * * (176 <em>P. 2d, </em>at <em>p. </em>928)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">In <em>Johnson v. Industrial Commission, supra, </em>Johnson, a prisoner in the county jail, was \u201cloaned\u201d with other prisoners to respondent Arizona and Yuma County Pair, Inc., a private corporation. Johnson was, of course, fed and housed <em>gratis </em>while in the county jail. The consideration he received for working for respondent was primarily three days\u2019 credit on his sentence for each day worked. The respondent corporation fed and housed the prisoners while they were working for it, and gave them \u201csundries and cigarettes.\u201d Johnson was injured while working on the fair grounds. The court held he was an employee entitled to compensation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">\u201c* * * In the instant case petitioner was at all times under the control of the employer, Yuma County Fair, Inc., which had the right to direct the manner in which the service was to be performed and the right to terminate petitioner\u2019s services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUH\">xllthough petitioner was under duress in that he was a prisoner of Yuma County, there is nothing in this record to indicate that the actual services of these eight prisoners for the Yuma County Fair, Inc. was compulsory. As an additional inducement they were each given three-days credit for each day\u2019s work and seemingly were free to choose whether they worked or not. All the essentials of a contract for hire were present. Consideration flowed from the employer by way of different food and lodging, perhaps better, and sundries and cigarettes. Petitioner evidenced his agreement to the arrangement by performing the work tendered. * * (356 <em>P. 2d, </em>at <em>p. </em>1023).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>In <em>Aleckson v. Kennedy Motor Sales Co., supra, </em>Aleckson was an insurance broker with offices in Chicago, earning over $15,000 a year. Because of his daughter\u2019s health, his wife and daughter moved to Minnesota, while Aleckson continued to live in Chicago. Aleckson became acquainted with an officer of the Kennedy Motor Sales Company, a St. Paul car dealer, and learned that it purchased used cars in Chicago. As the opinion says, \u201can informal arrangement was made between them\u201d whereby whenever Aleckson chose to come to Minnesota to visit his family, if the Kennedy Company had bought a car in Chicago which had to be driven to St. Paul, Aleckson could drive it in. Between June 1948 and March 1950 Aleckson drove at least 12 Kennedy cars from Chicago to St. Paul. He would leave Chicago Friday afternoon and arrive at his wife\u2019s residence Friday night. He would then use the car over the weekend for personal purposes such as shopping, taking his daughter to the doctor, sightseeing and going to the movies. On Sunday night, before leaving for Chicago on the train, Aleckson would deliver the car to the Kennedy Company sales lot and leave the car keys with a written statement of his actual out-of-pocket expenses for gasoline, oil and repairs, which were usually under $10, for which Kennedy reimbursed him. These amounts were the only sums received by Aleckson.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">On one of these trips, Aleckson was killed. The court held that he was an employee of Kennedy and the death was compensable, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201c* * * The commission could reasonably find that Aleckson, in exchange for his services in driving and delivering the Cadillac to St. Paul, received the equivalent of wages in that he was thereby provided with a means of personal transportation from Chicago to Minnesota. He received something of computable value in that he did not have to pay for the gasoline and oil which he would have used had he driven his own car. Pie was also saved the wear and tear of his own vehicle, and upon arrival he had the use of the Cadillac in shopping for his family, taking his daughter to the dentist, going to church, and pleasure driving around the twin cities. * * (55 <em>N. W. 2d, </em>at <em>pp. </em>700-701)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>The opinion in <em>Boehm v. D. A. Sokol Hall Holding Corp., </em>supra, says that decedent was employed as a \u201ccasual porter,\u201d but gives no details. The accident happened after his regular hours of employment had terminated, but there was proof that he often performed some services after hours for which he was rewarded \u201cby way of refreshments.\u201d His injury was held compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In <em>Gant v. Industrial Commission, supra, </em>Gant and Hendrickson were neighboring farmers. One day, \u201cWithout the Hendricksons asking him to do so,\u201d Gant and his son came over and helped the Hendricksons do somo of their farm work \u201cbecause he could see that the Hendricksons were getting behind in their work.\u201d The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">\u201cNothing was said between the parties about paying Gant for the work he and his son had performed. However, the testimony disclosed that it was the custom among farmers of the community to exchange work. The fact that the Hendricksons had not offered to pay Gant for his services would tend to support the inference that the parties were observing such custom of exchange of work which prevailed in the community, that when one farmer helped out another, the latter would repay in equivalent services at some future time. The Hendricksons talked it over among themselves and decided they would help out Gant at some future date when he needed help in repayment for what he and his son had done.\u201d (56 <em>N. W. 2d, </em>at <em>p. </em>527)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Some mouths later Gant told Robert Hendrickson \u201cit was getting awful late and he had a lot of corn standing in the field yet, so I [Robert] told him not to worry and to quit picking it by hand; that when I finished * * *, I would go over and pick it for him.\u201d Thereafter Robert went to Gant\u2019s farm with a mechanical corn picker, and while picking Gant\u2019s corn was injured. Nothing was said between Gant and Robert about paying for Robert\u2019s services. The court said this \u201ctends to support the inference that Robert\u2019s services in picking com for Gant, was <em>in </em>repayment for Gant\u2019s services the previous May in helping the Hendricksons,\u201d and was therefore compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>In <em>Gabel v. Industrial Accident Commission, </em>supra, Gabel, a farmer, exchanged services with a neighboring farmer. A forest fire broke out and Gabel and his neighbors were engaged in fighting the fire. However, the neighbor with whom Gabel had been exchanging services asked him to take his truck and go to protect his farm buildings from the fire. While enroute, Gabel was injured. The court held it was compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The evidence which leads us to the conclusion that the rationale of those cases applies to the case at bar is the following (all emphasis being ours) :</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Apparently Hawksford\u2019s route did not keep him very busy (he gave it up as not sufficiently profitable about two months after the accident) and, beginning about six months before the accident, he \u201chelped out\u201d Steinbacher from time to time. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">\u201cQ. What type of work would you do for them? A. Well, <em>mostly </em>delivering meat, helping load the truck and delivering one run, one delivery run.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">Q. And would you deliver this merchandise in the trucks owned by the Steinbacher Packing Company? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">Q. Did you also help prepare the meat for these deliveries? A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">Q. And in what way would you prepare the meats? A.

And\u2014 A. \u2014and I helped route them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">Q. And who would give you the instructions to prepare the meat? A. Well, that would have been the boss; that was Mr. Steinbacher himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\"><em>Q. </em>And how would this procedure take place; I mean, would\u2014 A. Well, there\u2019d be a group of us working together and we\u2019d all pitch in and get that one run all ready for the truck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-13\">Q. And would you be paid for this\u2014compensated for doing this type of work? A. I\u2019d be paid for the whole job, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-14\">Q.

Did you always understand you would get $15.00? A. Well, no, we didn\u2019t make no definite price on delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-16\">Q. What\u2014 A. I <em>could have ashed for more if I wanted.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-17\">Q. <em>Did you ever ask him for more?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-18\">A. <em>No, I did not, but he used to give me a little break on the meat that I bought.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-19\">The judge of compensation then interrogated Hawksford about the work he was doing when he was injured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-20\">\u201cThe Judge: Did you understand that you were going to be paid for this service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-21\">The Witness : No; we didn\u2019t make no arrangements for payment or anything like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-22\">The Judge: <em>Well, did you feel you were going to be paid for it?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-23\">The AAriTNESS: <em>Well, in one toay or another I did, yes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-24\">The Judge : <em>What do you mean by that?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-25\">The Witness : <em>I\u2019d get a special piece of meat or something like that that I wanted or something like that-, </em>like, usually, if they didn\u2019t have no nice calf livers or beef livers or anything like that in the morning, I come back in the afternoon and pick out some nice stuff like that, and he\u2019d let me do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-26\">The Judge: You take the meat for nothing, you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The Witness : No, no; I\u2019d have to pay for it, but I\u2019d have a special\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\">The Judge: This would be special meat that maybe an ordinary wholesaler that came in couldn\u2019t get?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">The Witness : That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">The Judge: But because you had sort of an in, if I can use that term, you could get special cuts\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">The Witness : Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">The Judge: \u2014that wouldn\u2019t be available to anyone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">The Witness : Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">The Judge: <em>Is that the way you expected to he paid for butchering this fore quarter?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-11\">The Witness : Yes, <em>sir.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-12\">The Judge: All right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">Then the cross-examination resumed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-14\">\u201cQ. <em>You just expected to get a special preference? </em>A. <em>Yes, sir.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-15\">Q. <em>But this wasn\u2019t promised to you ahead of time? </em>A. <em>There never teas anything promised; we never made arrangements like that on anything I did for him.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-16\">Q. <em>Well, did you consider this at the time, Mr. Hawksford, anything hut a favor for the Steinhachers? </em>A. <em>Well, you could say it was a favor, hut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a favor if they give me a little special privilege on what I want to pick up he cause that\u2019s what I was doton there for, </em>the special privilege of picking out some good livers, good calf livers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-17\">Q.

Well, that day I would have, yes. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-18\">He testified he had earned that right \u201cfor other things that I did for him.\u201d Then:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-19\">\u201cThe Judge: Were these special cuts or choice cuts hidden from the general purchaser or concealed from the general purchaser in some way at this warehouse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-20\">The Witness : The livers are, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-21\">The Judge: How do they hide those?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-22\">The Witness : They have a double ice box and there\u2019s\u2014these livers are put in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-23\">The Judge: The usual customer isn\u2019t allowed to shop from there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-24\">The Witness : That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-25\">The Judge: Was that laid aside especially for you or were there other butchers that he had special entrees or cuts as well, if you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>The Witness : I suppose he had some\u2014that I wouldn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">The Judge: Were you in a position where you could demand certain cuts by way of consideration for these odd jobs that you performed for Steinbacher?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">The Witness : No, I wouldn\u2019t say that. I\u2019m <em>not a </em>demanding type anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">The Judge: Was there any one way that they would set off</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">your meat pick-ups against any work that you did, or was it a set-up where you just came in and picked out what you felt you wanted? No one kept a record of what you were buying, did they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">The Witness : No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">The Judge : What I\u2019m trying to get at, in other words, was it a deal where they kept track of what you did for them and kept track of special cuts that you were getting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-10\">The Witness : No, they didn\u2019t do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-11\">The Judge: <em>If you were </em>around, <em>you'd help, and if they had meat that you wanted, even though the regular customer may not he ahle to get it, you got it?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-12\">Tiie Witness : Yes\u2014well, sometimes I used to go in there, I mean, like they have beef marked up for different customers and if I had to have a special piece of meat for that day, they would take maybe a piece of meat from this customer and give it to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-13\">The Judge: Even though it was reserved for another customer, if it met your particular need, they\u2019d take it out of his order and give it to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-14\">The Witness : That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-15\">The Judge: Whenever you saw something like that, whom did you see to make this arrangement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-16\">The Witness : Well, usually Mr. Steinbacher himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-17\">Prom the foregoing, we conclude that the parties had established the practice of Hawksford\u2019s \u201chelping out\u201d Steinbacher whenever Steinbacher asked him to do so, for which Steinbacher paid him by giving Mm the concessions described plus $15 for each \u201cdelivery\u201d; and that both doubtless intended that this practice should continue indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-18\">Hawksford had placed himself at Steinbacher\u2019s beck and call. He testified that when Steinbacher \u201casked me to come to work * * * and then the man * * * came in that was supposed to make the run * * * then he told me he didn\u2019t need me for that day.\u201d As we have seen, a \u201cdelivery\u201d entailed preparing the meat, loading a Steinbacher truck, etc., yet each time Hawksford made a \u201cdelivery\u201d he accepted $15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>in payment, no matter how much work was entailed, even though he \u201ccould have asked for more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Hawksford testified, in effect, that he \u201chelped out\u201d because Steinbacher gave him special treatment, which enabled him to get better and scarcer cuts and lower prices than other customers of Steinbacher. To Hawksford this was unquestionably \u201cfinancial consideration\u201d \u2014 <em>i. e., </em>money\u2019s worth. Hawksford doubtless obtained from his customers better prices and greater good will as a result of Steinbacher\u2019s special treatment. Had Steinbacher given Hawksford a 1% discount on his purchases because of Hawksford\u2019s \u201chelping out,\u201d there could be no argument that it was \u201cfinancial consideration\u201d for Hawksford\u2019s \u201cservice.\u201d Or, had Steinbacher permitted Hawksford to store his truck or other property at his pleasure in Steinbacher\u2019s plant, it would have constituted \u201cfinancial consideration.\u201d <em>Rhodes v. G. H. Crandall </em>Co., 4 <em>A. D. 2d </em>451, 167 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>101 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957). We see no reason to apply a different rule here because Hawksford was given a general and indeterminate but constant and recognized special treatment rather than a fixed consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">And we conclude that the evidence establishes that, although there was no such agreement in so many words, Steinbacher gave Hawksford this special treatment in payment for Hawks-ford\u2019s help when needed, and that it intended to continue to give Hawksford such special treatment so long as Hawksford continued to render himself useful. Steinbacher must have known that was why Hawksford kept himself subject to Steinbacher\u2019s orders, took $15 for each \u201cdelivery\u201d for work that often must have been worth more, and otherwise made himself obliging; and Steinbacher must have intended that it continue that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In short, from the course of dealing between the parties it is reasonable to assume that they understood that if Hawks-ford stopped being obliging the special treatment would stop <em>(cf. Ferragino v. McCue\u2019s </em>Dairy, 128 <em>N. J. L. </em>525, 527 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1942)), and that if Steinbacher stopped giving Hawks-ford the special treatment, it would lose an ever-ready spare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>man willing to work cheaply. We hold that this understanding constituted a contract of hiring of Hawksford\u2019s service for financial consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Steinbacher relies heavily on <em>Cerniglia v. Passaic, </em>50 <em>N. J. Super. </em>201 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958). However, that case is plainly distinguishable because there only a hope was held out to Cerniglia by one who had no authority to bind Passaic that he would do what he could to obtain from Passaic the uniform cleaning contract for Cerniglia.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
