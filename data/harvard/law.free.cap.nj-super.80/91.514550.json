A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A6H\">Plaintiff instituted an action in the Municipal Court of the City of Camden under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>9:16\u20143, by which she sought a determination that defendant is the father of her illegitimate child, and an order that defendant provide support for the child pursuant to <em>R. S. </em>9:16-2. The Municipal Court so held and ordered accordingly. On appeal to the Camden County Court, that court reached the same result. Thereafter the County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. Hence, this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">The background of the proceeding follows: In 1955, upon plaintiff\u2019s complaint, a grand jury of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, returned an indictment charging that the defendant \"did commit fornication with Heloyse Ellman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>[plaintiff] and a certain female bastard child of the body of the said Heloyse Ellman did then and there beget.\u201d The indictment was founded on <em>Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. </em>18, \u00a7 4506 (1945). The section specifically makes the offense a misdemeanor, and provides for a fine of $100, as well as for support of the child, and hospital or funeral expenses. The civil aspects of <em>Title </em>18\u2014the award of support and the expenses\u2014are implemented by <em>Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, </em>\u00a7 1003 (1953), which permits the entry of judgment for same in the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The ease was heard in the Municipal Court in Philadelphia, Women\u2019s Criminal Division. Under applicable Pennsylvania law the parties entered into an agreement whereby plaintiff was to receive $1,000, and a verdict of not guilty was to be entered for the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth v. Weaver, </em>9 <em>Pa. Dist. </em>427 (1899). The court and the district attorney approved the settlement and a judgment of not guilty was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">In 1958 plaintiff sought a rehearing in the Pennsylvania court claiming that she never received the $1,000. The court dismissed her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Thereafter, plaintiff established a domicile in New Jersey and instituted the present proceeding. Defendant denied paternity and also interposed the defense that the Pennsylvania judgment of \u201cnot guilty\u201d was <em>\u201cres judicata\u201d </em>of the issue of paternity, and was binding on the courts of this State under <em>Art. </em>IV, \u00a7 1 of the <em>Constitution of the United </em>States, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">\u201cFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and Judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">The Municipal Court found paternity as a fact and held that the Pennsylvania statute was penal in nature; therefore, it had no extraterritorial effect and could not be pleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>as a bar to the Few Jersey action which is deemed to be a civil action. See <em>Overseer of Poor of Town of Montclair v. </em>Eason, 92 <em>N. J. L. </em>199, 203, 1 <em>A. L. R. </em>631 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1918). The County Court likewise found paternity. It did not pass upon the character of the <em>charge\u2014i. e., </em>whether civil or criminal, but held that the settlement in Pennsylvania and the recordation of \u201cnot guilty\u201d in the judgment did not reflect a trial on the merits; hence, that the Pennsylvania judgment was not a bar to the Few Jersey proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The sole question presented to us is whether in the circumstances outlined, the \u201cnot guilty\u201d disposition arrived at by negotiation is dispositive of the paternity issue, and binding upon the courts of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Reconciliation of the criminal\u2014civil dichotomy which generally appears in bastardy statutes has long been a source of judicial difficulty in the construction of legislation in this field. In <em>In re El, </em>26 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>285, 287, 60 <em>A. 2d </em>893 <em>(City. Ct. </em>1948), Judge Drewen aptly analyzed the situation thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">\u201cThe briefs submitted are in large part given to a discussion of the correct and proper designation of proceedings of this kind, whether they are civil or criminal, or <em>quasi </em>in the one class or the other. But the denomination applied by our appellate courts in decisions on the point appears uniformly to depend upon the nature of the question presented; that is, the proceedings are to be thought of as quasi-criminal for some purposes and as <em>quasi-civil </em>for others. The Court of Errors and Appeals in <em>Montclair v. Eason, </em>92 <em>N. J. L. </em>199 * <em>* * </em>said: \u2018It may be conceded that bastardy proceedings are sometimes characterized as criminal or <em>quasi-criminal </em>in character, but usually they are held to be in the nature of civil pi'oeeedings. * * * In this state it seems to be settled that they are civil or at least <em>quasi-civil. </em>* * *\u2019 To show complete absence of category we need nothing more than the quoted statement. In the city\u2019s brief the proceedings are spoken of as \u2018essentially civil.\u2019 In <em>Thatcher v. Hackett, </em>16 <em>N. J. Misc. R. </em>459; 1 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>438, the court considers the element of conflict between the legislative grant of appellate jurisdiction to the Quarter Sessions, a criminal court, and the pronouncement in <em>Montclair v. Eason, supra. </em>In <em>Dally v. Overseers of Woodbridge, </em>21 <em>N. J. L. </em>491, the question was whether character evidence, admissible ordinarily only in a criminal case, was proper under a charge of bastardy. Such evidence had been excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>at the trial on the ground that it is allowable only in. a criminal case. The Supreme Court reversed and declared the case to be \u2018not strictly civil\u2019 so as to exclude character testimony. See, also, <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>21 <em>Id. </em>630. So, there is nothing to be gained by attempts at classification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">It is entirely clear that the judgment of \u201cnot guilty\u201d entered in the Pennsylvania action resulted from a settlement entered into by the mother and putative father of the child. Whatever the effect of the judgment might be as to any claim plaintiff might have against the defendant, in our view it should not operate to deprive the child of its right to seek support, absent a judicial determination <em>on the merits, </em>that the defendant is not the child\u2019s father. Parents are not ordinarily permitted to contract away the legal rights their children may have against third persons. Thus it is that settlements of such claims to be binding on the infant require a judicial determination that the proposed settlement is in the best interests of the child. We perceive neither logic nor justice in the idea that parents <em>inter sese </em>may enter any agreement which deprives the child of an absolute personal right granted to him by the law. Compare <em>Kopak v. Polzer, </em>4 <em>N. J. </em>327, 332-333 (1950). The design of our bastardy statute is primarily to compel the parents of an illegitimate child to provide the child with the care, education and maintenance which any other child would have as a matter of right; and secondarily, to protect the public from the financial burden of providing what is owed to the child by its parents. See <em>Kopak v. Polzer, supra, </em>4 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>333.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The basic purpose of protecting the child should not be subverted by legalistic categorization of statutory enactment unless no reasonable construction of the laws of the respective states, and the results of judicial proceedings provided therein, would permit the child to establish paternity\u2014the necessary foundation for the enforcement of its rights against its father.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Whether the Pennsylvania statute be placed in the quasi-civil category or in a gwasi-eriminal classification<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, we are satisfied that the <em>pro forma </em>judgment of non-paternity entered in the Pennsylvania court, purely in consequence of the settlement between the mother and the putative father, and without regard to the continuing needs of the child, is not binding on the child since it patently does not represent an adjudication of the child\u2019s rights on the merits of the charge of paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-5\"> We find it unnecessary to decide this question. However, if such determination were requisite to our decision we would hold that the Pennsylvania statute is essentially of criminal import and hence would not be binding upon the courts of this State. The penal attributes of the Pennsylvania statute have frequently been noted in the decisions of that state. A bill of indictment must be presented to the grand jury unless waived by the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth v. Stevenson, </em>198 <em>Pa. Super. </em>55, 181 <em>A. 2d </em>910 <em>(Super. Ct. </em>1962). A defendant\u2019s guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v. Becker, </em>168 <em>Pa. Super. </em>69, 76 <em>A. 2d </em>657 <em>(Super. Ct. </em>1950) ; <em>Commanwealth v. Young, </em>163 <em>Pa. Super. </em>279, 60 <em>A. 2d </em>831 <em>(Super. Ct. </em>1948) ; <em>Commanwealth v. DiMatteo, </em>124 <em>Pa. Super. </em>277, 188 <em>A. </em>425 <em>(Super. Ct. </em>1936). <em>In Commonwealth v. Shimpeno, </em>160 <em>Pa. Super. </em>104, 50 <em>A. 2d </em>39 <em>(Super. Ct. </em>1946), the court said the Soldiers and Sailors Act only applied to civil actions and hence would not toll the statute of limitations in a prosecution for failure to support a bastard child because that offense is criminal in nature. See also <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Houser v. Seip, </em>385 <em>Pa. </em>545, 124 <em>A. 2d </em>110 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
