The case was on the same day properly transferred to the County Court, and he duly tried on March 17, 1915. He was convicted and his punishment assessed at sixty days in jail and a fine of $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">The State proved that prohibition was properly in force in said county under an election, etc., in 1904, and this was also admitted. Said Williams after testifying positively to the sale to him by appellant, of a half pint of whisky in 1915, said: \u201cI bought said whisky this year. This year is <em>1904\" </em>The only other witness was appellant himself, who testified: \u201cI never sold Emmett Williams a half pint of whisky or any amount of whisky in my life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-17\">By the charge the court required the jury to believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant \u201cdid on or about the 1st day of January, 1915, in Johnson County, Texas, sell intoxicating liquor to one Emmett Williams as charged in the indictment,\u201d etc.,' before they could convict him; also the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt. In addition he gave appellant\u2019s special charge that if they believed said Williams purchased the whisky testified to by him.' from appellant, \u201cin the year <em>1904\" </em>to acquit him. The only point in the case is based on said Williams\u2019 testimony quoted above. It seems clear that when the witness said \u201cthis year is <em>1904\" </em>he meant and intended <em>1915, </em>and no one could have understood otherwise. At any rate, under the pleadings, evidence and charge of the court, the verdict is neither contrary to the law, nor to the evidence, which are the only grounds of his motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-18\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-19\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
