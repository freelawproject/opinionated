After passing a few words, he says appellant said to him, \u201cIf you will come across the fence I will stamp hell out of you.\u201d That he started, when appellant struck at him with a club about four feet long and as large as his arm. If the jury believed this state of facts it constituted an assault. Of course, appellant\u2019s testimony presents an entirely different state of ease, but the defense issues were presented in language chosen by appellant, the court giving the special charge requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
