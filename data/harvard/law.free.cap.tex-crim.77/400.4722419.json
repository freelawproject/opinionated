They sued out a writ of habeas, corpus before the district judge, who, after hearing all the evidence, denied them bail. Hence this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">The statement of facts is. voluminous. We nave given it, and appellants\u2019 briefs, careful consideration, in addition to having heard the evidence discussed on submission for an hour on each side, by the able .attorneys representing the appellants and the State. It is the rule of .this court not to discuss the evidence in appeals of this character, and 'we shall adhere to that rule now.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">\u201cThe rule is \u2018all prisoners shall be bailable.\u2019 (Sec. 11, art. <em>x, </em>of our Constitution.) The exception is, \u2018when the proof is evident\u2019 that not only the accused is guilty, but that the jury will, if they properly enforce the law, probably assess capital punishment. This conclusion to be reached by the well guarded and dispassionate judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>court, or judge passing upon the question.\u201d (Ex parte Stephenson, 71 Texas Crim. Rep., 382.)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\">As we understood appellants\u2019 attorney, on the submission hereof, it was conceded, that in all probability a jury will assess the death penalty, if on final trial, the guilt of appellants is shown. At any rate, whether conceded by appellants or not, in our opinion, if their guilt is so shown, a \u201cjury will, if they properly enforce the law, probably assess capital punishment.\u201d That feature need not be further considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The only other question then is, whether or not the evidence as a whole was clear and strong enough to \u201clead a well guarded and dispassionate judgment to. the conclusion . . . that the accused is the guilty agent.\u201d (Ex parte Russell, 71 Texas Crim. Rep., 377.)\" If so, bail was correctly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">. The law of our State on this question is well, and has long been, established, not only by our constitutional and statutory provisions, but by our decisions, as well. We will cite and quote from some of our decisions\u2014not all of them to.the same effect, by any means.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">In Ex parte Evers, 29 Texas Crim. App., 539, this court, by Judge Davidson, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">\u201c \u2018All prisoners shall be bailable by sufficient sureties unless for capital offenses when the proof is evident.\u2019 Bill of Rights, sec. 11. By virtue of this provision the right of bail is secured to all persons in this State who are accused of crime except in cases where the evidence manifests with reasonable certainty that the accused party is guilty of a capital offense. McCoy v. State, 25 Texas, 33; Ex parte Coldiron, 15 Texas Crim. App., 464; Ex parte Smith, 23 Texas Crim. App., 100.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">\u201cThe rule in this State for determining whether or not bail should be granted is as follows: \u2018If the evidence is clear and strong, leading a well guarded and dispassionate judgment to the conclusion that the offense has been committed, that the accused is the guilty agent, and that he would probably be punished capitally if the law is administered, bail is not a matter of right.\u2019 Bx parte Smith, 23 Texas Crim. App., 100. Stated in another form it is thus laid down: \u2018If, upon the whole testimony adduced, the court or judge entertains a reasonable doubt whether the relator committed the act, or whether in doing so he was guilty of a capital crime, bail should be granted.\u2019 Same authority, 126: <em>'This rule applies when the case is considered, on appeal, the court keeping %n mind the prima facie legal presumption that the action of the trial judge was correct.\u2019 </em>(Italics added.) Same authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-11\">\u201c \u2018To the mind of the tribunal passing upon the evidence the guilt of the applicant of a capital offense may be evident\u2014and yet there may be evidence in conflict with such inculpatory evidence. It is not all conflicting, exculpatory. evidence that will have the effect to raise a reasonable doubt of guilt and destroy or impair the force of \u201cevident proof\u201d made by inculpatory evidence.\u2019 Same authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">In Smith v. State, 23 Texas Crim. App., 100, cited by Juoge Davidson, it is said the rule is: \u201c \u2018If the evidence is clear and strong, leading a well guarded and dispassionate judgment to the conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the offense has been committed; that the accused is the guilty agent, and that he would probably be punished capitally if the law is administered, bail is not a matter of right/ \u201d and further (pp. 126-7): This rule \u201cis, as we understand it, in harmony with the constitutional requirement that bail shall be granted unless the proof is evident. It is, in effect, the same rule stated as a correct one in Bridewell\u2019s case, 57 Miss., 39, but in different language, that is, Tf, upon the whole testimony adduced, the court or judge entertains a reasonable doubt whether the relator committed the act, or whether in so doing he was guilty of a capital crime, bail should be granted.\u2019 This rule applies when the case is considered on appeal, the court keeping in mind th\u00e9 prima facie legal presumption that the action of the trial judge was correct.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-3\">\u201cA majority of the court are not to be understood, as holding that under the operation of this rule the evidence, though conflicting, may not at the same time be <em>evident. </em>To the mind of the tribunal passing upon the evidence the guilt of the applicant of a capital offense may be <em>evident; </em>that is, clear, strong, not admitting of a reasonable doubt, and yet there may be evidence in conflict.with such inculpatory evidence. It is not all conflicting, exculpatory evidence that will have the effect to raise a reasonable doubt of guilt and destroy or impair the force of 'evident proof\u2019 made by inculpatory evidence. It is for the judge or court who hears the testimony to consider the evidence as a whole, and if by the entire evidence a reasonable doubt of the applicant\u2019s guilt of a capital offense is not generated, the proof is evident and bail should he denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">In Ex parte Jones, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 422, this court, by Judge Simkins, again said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">\u201cBail should be granted in murder'cases unless, upon examination of all the evidence adduced, the court should conclude that the proof cf guilt is evident, and the accused would be convicted of murder in the first degree if the law was administered. The guilt of the accused may be evident, though there may be conflicting testimony. Ex parte Smith, 23 Texas Crim. App., 100; Drury\u2019s case, 25 Texas, 45. \u2018Proof is evident\u2019 if the evidence adduced on an application for bail would sustain a verdict convicting the applicant of murder in the first degree. Foster\u2019s case, 5 Texas Crim. App., 625.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In Ex parte King, 56 Texas Crim. Rep., 68, this court by Judge Ramsey, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">\u201cThe testimony introduced on the part of the State is amply sufficient, if true, to show that relator is guilty of murder in the first degree. His defense consists of proof of alibi, and also involves to some extent an attack and impeachment of the State\u2019s witnesses. The case is peculiarly one of fact, and in respect to a matter of this sort, as we view it from the statement, of the evidence contained in the record, the judgment of the trial court should not be set aside where there is proof showing the defendant\u2019s guilt to be evident. We are not prepared to say the action of the court below was without ample warrant, and without comment on the testimony we deem it our duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>affirm the judgment of the court below, which is here done.\u201d That case is specially and peculiarly applicable to this. See also Ex parte Cabrera, 53 Texas Crim. Rep., 466; Ex parte Brown, 63 Texas Crim. Rep., 613; Ex parte Finney, 70 Texas Crim. Rep., 284.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">As said by Judge Ramsey, in King, supra, so we say in this case: \u201cWe are not prepared to say the action of the court below was without ample warrant, and without comment on the testimony, we deem it our duty to affirm the judgment of the court below, which is here done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">[Rehearing denied October 13, 1915.\u2014Reporter.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
