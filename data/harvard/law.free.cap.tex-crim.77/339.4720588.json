McDonald, </em>Assistant Attorney General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b364-3\">HARPER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AeoL\">Appellant was convicted of murder and his punishment assessed at five years confinement in the State penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">The State\u2019s evidence is that appellant walked into a restaurant where deceased, Luke Callahan, Hose Murphy, Oscar Barnes, and Weaver Goodman were playing dominoes. The appellant walked into the restaurant, bought a cigar, when he wheeled around and commenced shooting, continuing to shoot until deceased fell, when he walked up to him and shot again, saying, \u201cGod damn you, I done got you.\u201d Deceased was unarmed and, according to the State\u2019s evidence, made no demonstration whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Appellant testified to going into the restaurant and buying a cigar, when he says deceased, as he, appellant, struck a match, reached around and pulled Mose Murphy\u2019s coat back and made some sort of sign, and then run his hand in his bosom, as he did so raising up in the chair; when he, appellant, remarked, \u201cYou son-of-a-bitch\u201d and began- shooting. That he does not know how many times he shot, .but he thought from remarks and threats that had been communicated to him his life was in danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">He further testifies that some time prior to this deceased had been the cause of him and his wife separating. The record shows they had been separated some six months, and appellant\u2019s wife had been cooking for Mr. Campbell during that time and at the time of the homicide, but appellant says that they had agreed to make up and live together again. That he saw deceased, and told him they had made up, and not to bother his wife further, and deceased agreed not to do so. Instead, though, of doing so, when his wife went to visit her father some days before the killing, deceased followed her up there and was seen in her company. However, the record clearly shows that appellant had met deceased in what is termed the Commissary Store since being informed of that fact, and this was not the first meeting when the homicide took place. No bills were reserved to the introduction' of .any testimony; no special charges requested, and no exceptions reserved to the charge of the court as given. The only exceptions in this record relate to the argument of counsel for the State. It appears that counsel said in his address to the jury: \u201cGentlemen, what an example it would be to the people of this county for you to return a verdict of not-guilty against this bloody assassin. ... If you turn this man loose on such evidence, you might as well tear down your courthouse, burn your jail, and throw your statutes into the sea. . . . They claim that the dead man broke up defendant\u2019s home and had intercourse with his wife. They have offered no evidence of this but the family of defendant. Could they find no one else that knew of this ? I know this, that while she worked for me, she was a mighty neat little negro woman, and a mighty good worker. ... It is time to call a halt in Trinity County and go to enforcing the law. It would humiliate me for such a murderer to be turned loose, upon the people of the county. No one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>would be safe. Who knows but that the next time it would be one of you gentlemen or me. I haven\u2019t long to stay here, but I have some grandchildren growing up, and for their saltes I\u2019d like to see killing stopped in Trinity County. Gentlemen, the defendant has asked for a suspended sentence. It would be a travesty upon justice, a travesty on law and a travesty on humanity to suspend the sentence of this murderer and turn him loose on the county.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The court in approving the bills states that no request was made to instruct the jury not to consider these remarks or any of them, and says further in approving some of the bills, that he was not sure the identical language was used, but something like it was said, and which he did not think was improper argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">As we understand it, it has always been the rule in this court that improper argument will not be ground for reversal of a case, unless such argument is excepted to, and special charges prepared and presented to the court instructing the jury not to consider such remarks unless the remarks are very inflammatory and without basis in the testimony. In the event the court refuses to give the instructions and the remarks are improper, then the case will be reversed. If no request is made to have the jury instructed not to consider the remarks, it is only in cases where the remarks are so improper, .hurtful and harmful that their withdrawal would not cure the error. We do not think the above remarks are of that inflammatory character, and the verdict of the jury evidences the fact, that the passions and prejudice of the jury were not aroused. To term the appellant \u201can assassin and murderer\u201d is to use strong terms. But if the State\u2019s evidence is true he shot deceased while he was sitting quietly at one table playing a game of dominoes, with no thought that death was near, and it was an assassination. The argument that \u201cif they turned appellant loose on such evidence, you might as well tear down the courthouse, burn up your jail and throw your statutes into the sea,\u201d has been frequently held not to present ground for reversal where no special charge was requested instructing the jury not to consider such remarks. Just and fierce invectives, based upon the facts in evidence and all legitimate inferences therefrom is not discountenanced by the courts. (Glascow v. State, 50 Texas Crim. Rep., 635; Tune v. State, 49 Texas Crim. Rep., 445; Choice v. State, 54 Texas Crim. Rep., 517; Vann v. State, 48 Texas Crim. Rep., 11; Sue v. State, 52 Texas Crim. Rep., 122.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The evidence showed that appellant\u2019s wife had been working at Mr. Campbell\u2019s for six months. immediately preceding the homicide, and his remark that while she worked for him she was a mighty neat little negro woman and a mighty good worker, certainly could not prejudice appellant\u2019s case. His contention was that his anger was aroused because deceased was trying to take this woman away from him, and one whom he was desirous of getting to live with him again. Certainly these few words of praise of her could not injure him. After carefully reviewing the authorities we have come to the conclusion that the remarks above present no ground for reversal in the absence of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>request that the jury be instructed not to consider them. Remarks that will authorize a reversal when no special charge is requested, must be highly inflammatory and hurtful and be such remarks that their withdrawal and instruction not to consider them will not remove then-harmful effect. If they are not of that character, then a request must-be made to instruct the jury not to consider them, or they will not present error. We think this the true rule underlying all of our decisions and the rule shown to be practically observed by all the courts, by the citation of authorities in the Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law &amp; Prac., vol. 5, p. <em>297.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The alleged newly discovered evidence is to no new fact, but only one more witness to facts (testified to on the trial) by other witnesses, and is such that it could have been discovered by the use of due diligence. The witness was not present when the homicide occurred, and is simply to a fact that occurred prior to the homicide amply proven and not disputed by any evidence offered by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">I am of the opinion the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b366-8\">PRENDERGAST, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Ase\">I concur, and it is ordered that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b366-9\">DAVIDSON, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ashe\">(dissenting).\u2014Appellant was allotted by the jury five years confinement in the penitentiary for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">I do not care to discuss the facts. Several bills of exception were reserved to arguments of State\u2019s counsel. The first bill recites that counsel for the State used the following language: \u201cWhat an example it would be to the people of this county for you to return a verdict of not guilty against this bloody assassin.\u201d The second bill shows the same counsel used this language: \u201cGentlemen, if you turn this man loose on such evidence, jmu might as well tear down your courthouse, burn up your jail and throw your statutes into the sea.\u201d The facts show defendant killed deceased because of adultery with his wife. The third bill shows the same counsel used this language: \u201cThey claim that the dead man broke up defendant\u2019s home and had intercourse with his wife. They have offered no evidence of this but that of the family of defendant. Could they find no one else that knew of this ? I know this, that while she (meaning defendant\u2019s wife) worked for me, she was a -mighty neat little negro woman and a mighty good worker.\u201d There was no evidence, recites the bill, \"of this before the jury. The fourth bill recites that said counsel used this language: \u201cGentlemen, it is time to call a halt in Trinity County and go to enforcing the law. It would humiliate me for such a murderer to be turned loose upon the people of the county. No one would be safe. Who knows but that the next time it would be one of you gentlemen or me. I haven\u2019t long to stay here, but I have some grandchildren growing up, and for their sakes I\u2019d like to see killing stopped in Trinity County.\u201d The humiliation of State\u2019s counsel' is not a reason for conviction of a defendant. He must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>be tried and convicted upon the law and facts. There are other comments that might be made on these remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Another bill recites this language was used: \u201cGentlemen, the defendant has asked for a suspended sentence. It would be a travesty on justice, a travesty on the law and a travesty on humanity to suspend the sentence of this murderer and turn him loose on the county.\u201d It is unnecessary, in view of the authorities in Texas, for me to discuss the impropriety of the language used. The judge qualifies these bills-by stating that appellant did not request a charge withdrawing same from the jury. The judge seemed to be of the impression as appellant did not request such a charge or such charges that, therefore, he was justified in not sustaining the exceptions to the remarks at the time the language was used. Many opinions have been written as to when an argument is improper and when a charge should be requested and when not, and when the language is fatal independent of requested instructions. It is unnecessary for me to review these cases; they are part of the historjr of the appellate courts in Texas. Some of the language used and most of it has been condemned so often by the decisions of this and other courts in this State I deem it unnecessary to discuss them. For a collation of the authorities, see Branch\u2019s Crim. Law, sec. 62; Liner v. State, 70 Texas Crim. Rep., 75; Grimes v. State, 64 Texas Crim. Rep., 64; Johnson v. State, 63 Texas Crim. Rep., 50; Davis v. State, 54 Texas Crim. Rep., 236; Smith v. State, 44 Texas Crim. Rep., 137; Thompson v. State, 33 Texas Crim. Rep., 472; Clark v. State, 23 Texas Crim. App., 260; Parker v. State, 43 Texas Crim. Rep., 526; Garrett v. State, 52 Texas Crim. Rep., 255; Smith v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 563; McKinley v. State, 52 Texas Crim. Rep., 182; Ware v. State, 49 Texas Crim. Rep., 413; Taylor v. State, 50 Texas Crim. Rep., 560; Jenkins v. State, 49 Texas Crim. Rep., 457; Stone v. State, 22 Texas Crim. App., 185; Robbins v. State, 47 Texas Crim. Rep., 312.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap6i\">One of the bills recites that State\u2019s counsel made a statement of fact, that is, that \u201cI know this, that while she (meaning defendant\u2019s wife) worked for me, she was a mighty neat little negro woman and a mighty good worker.\u201d The bill recites there was no evidence of that fact before the jury. This was a statement of a matter of materiality, and not being testified should not have been used or alluded to in argument. Counsel could not testify in a speech; he should have been sworn. His argument should be based on matters properly before the jury, and he should not make statements before the jury of matters not in evidence. If he desires to testify he may do so, but he must do so under oath. Davis v. State, 54 Texas Crim. Rep., 236 ; Bearden v. State, 46 Texas Crim. Rep., 144; Tillery v. State, 24 Texas Crim. App., 251 ; Exon v. State, 33 Texas Crim. Rep., 461; Weatherford v. State, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 530; Fuller v. State, 30 Texas Crim. App., 559; Hunnicutt v. State, 18 Texas Crim. App., 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Where argument is obviously hurtful and prejudicial, a reversal will follow. Smith v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 563; McKinley v. State, 52 Texas Crim. Rep., 182; Smith v. State, 44 Texas Crim. Rep., 137. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>These arguments and &gt; statements of State\u2019s counsel were so obviously wrong and of such a hurtful nature that this judgment ought to be reversed, although charges were not requested; exceptions were taken at the time, and the court declined to withdraw the remarks from the jury, or to control counsel in his' argument. I, therefore, can not agree to the affirmance of this case and believe the judgment ought to be reversed and the cause remanded for another trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
