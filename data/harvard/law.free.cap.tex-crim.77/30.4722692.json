In fact, the only question in the case that can be considered is the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">There is with the record the stenographic report of the proceedings, and testimony taken on the trial in question and answer form, and there is no statement of facts otherwise. This statement can not b\u00e9 considered as a statement of facts under the uniform holding in many decisions of this court, and the statute. See Criner v. State, 71 Texas Crim. Pep., 369, 159 S. W. Rep., 1059, where some of the cases to this effect are collated.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">However, we have read this stenographic report, and if we could consider it as a statement of facts we think it is clear that the evidence is amply sufficient to-sustain the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
