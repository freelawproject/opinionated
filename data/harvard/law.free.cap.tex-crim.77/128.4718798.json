That law provides the punishment shall not be less than five years. Here the conviction was for forty-five years. The sentence was pronounced for an indeterminate period of from two to forty-five years. The court will correctly enter up the judgment and reform the sentence to comply with the statute, fixing the punishment for pandering in accordance with the indeterminate sentence law. The judgment, therefore, will be reformed to this extent, and affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
