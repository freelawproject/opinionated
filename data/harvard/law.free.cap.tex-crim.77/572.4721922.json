Notice of appeal was given to this court. The Assistant Attorney General asks this court to dismiss this case because there was no final judgment in the Justice Court, and that the action of the County Court in dismissing the appeal was correct. This motion can not be sustained. The judgment is a sufficient final judgment, and the County Court should have entertained jurisdiction and tried the case de novo. Terry v. State, 30 Texas Crim. App., 408; Ex parte Dickerson, 30 Texas Crim. App., 448; Ex parte Cox, 53 Texas Crim. Rep., 240; Ex parte Williford, 50 Texas Crim. Rep., 417; Ex parte White, 50 Texas Crim.
