What may have been intended as the basis for a statement of facts is found with the record. It is signed by no one,\u2014not even a stenographer, by the attorneys for neither side, nor by the presiding judge. Hence, it can not be considered as a statement'of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">There are only two bills of exception in the record'. One is to the . court\u2019s overruling the application for a second, continuance. This can not he reviewed in the absence of a statement of facts. The other bill is to the court\u2019s refusing to sustain his challenge of a certain juror. This, even if we could consider it in the absence of a statement of facts, shows no error in the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
