It has been the uniform and repeated holding of this court, under such circumstances, that this court has no jurisdiction of the appeal. Ex parte Erwin, 7 Texas Crim. App., 288; Ex parte Hobbs, 32 Texas Crim. Rep., 312; Ex parte Walton, 45 Texas Crim. Rep., 74; Ex parte Richie, 177 S. W. Rep., 85, recently decided, and many other authorities. It is, therefore, the order of this court that this attempted appeal be dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this court; and it is further ordered that the clerk of this court transmit without delay to the sheriff of Uvalde County a certified copy of this judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>of dismissal for the information and guidance of that officer.
