However, the judgment introduced by him states the judgment of conviction was had on March 10, 1914.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-19\">In addition to this Warren Clark testified that he knew when appellant went on the road, and he purchased the whisky a little while before he went on the county road.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-20\">Appellant insists that the court erred in authorizing a conviction for any period of time two years prior to February 14, 1914, when he should have counted the time within two years prior to the filing of the indictment in this case. Appellant\u2019s contention is correct, and if the evidence suggested that the alleged sale may have been any time prior to two years before the filing of the indictment, his contention would be ground for reversal of the case. But, as the evidence and all the evidence shows that if a sale was made, it was made within les\u00e1 than two years prior to the return of the indictment, the assignment presents no ground for reversal</p>\n<p id=\"b558-21\">The judgment is affirmed</p>\n<p id=\"b558-22\">\n<em>Affirmed,.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b558-23\">[Rehearing denied October 13, 1915.\u2014Reporter.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
