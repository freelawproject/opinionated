As appellant was charged with a capital offense and counsel was appointed to defend him, if the court had not required the court stenographer to furnish him with a copy \"of the stenographic notes, this contention would be well taken. But in this instance the stenographer made out a full and complete statement of facts in narrative form, and appellant\u2019s counsel refused to file same, because he contends ifc is not correct in some particulars. The law requires the court stenographer only to furnish a copy of his notes that appellant\u2019s counsel may make out a statement of facts. As the stenographer went further, and certainly furnished appellant with all the information required by law to be furnished, and he could from the data furnished make out a statement of facts, the same as if he had only been furnished with <em>the </em>notes, this presents no ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-16\">The motion is overruled. <em>Overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
