Prior to the Act of March 20, 1907, amending article 1071 (641) of our Penal Code, the offense of abortion, as applicable to this case, was thus defined: If any person shall designedly use toward a pregnant woman with her consent any violence, or means whatever, externally or internally applied and shall thereby procure an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>abortion, he shall be punished, etc. Said Act of 1907, re-enacted said article, making no change therein applicable hereto, except it added a separate paragraph in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">\u201cBy the term \u2018abortion\u2019 is meant that the life of the fetus or embryo, shall be destroyed in the mother\u2019s womb, or that a premature birth thereof be caused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">So that the offense applicable herein by said statute, leaving out the unnecessary matters, is in this language: If any person shall designedly use toward a pregnant woman, with her consent, any violence or means, whatever, externally dr internal^ applied, and shall thereby procure an. abortion, he shall be punished by confinement in the penitentiary not less than two nor more than five years. By the term \u201cabortion\u201d is. meant that - the life of the fetus or embryo shall be destroyed in the woman\u2019s womb or that a premature birth thereof be caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The indictment in this case has more than one count. The trial court, however, restricted the case to the second count. After the other necessary averments in every indictment said count is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AiC\">That M. E. Gray, on March 12, 1913, \u201cdid unlawfully, wilfully and designedly make an assault in and upon the person of one Sadie Moore,, a pregnant woman, and did then and there, with the consent of the said Sadie Moore, insert, thrust and force into the private parts and womb of the said Sadie Moore a certain rubber instrument, towit, a. catheter, then and there calculated to produce an abortion and miscarriage of her, the said Sadie Moore; and that by the means aforesaid she, the said M.' E. Gray, did then and there produce an abortion, of the said Sadie Moore of the. child wherewith she, the said Sadie Moore, was then and there so pregnant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Appellant\u2019s contention is that this indictment is fatally defective because it fails to allege that by reason of the means applied to said Mrs. Moore \u201cthe life of the fetus or embryo in the womb was destroyed, or that a premature birth from the womb was caused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">A careful review of the authorities indicates that at common law an abortion could not be produced upon a woman, unless and until the child was \u201cquick\u201d within her womb. The courts, of our various States differ as to this, most of them holding that an abortion can be produced at any time after conception and before the woman was \u201cquick\u201d with child. We, of course, do not know for certain why our Legislature added said clause to article 1071 quoted above, as it did, unless it be for fear that the courts of this State might hold that an abortion could not be produced on a woman, unless she was \u201cquick\u201d with child as contra-distinguished from being pregnant, and the stage of pregnancy only embracing the early stages of the embryo or fetus. As we understand this addition to 'this article, it was not intended, and should not be construed, to restrict the definition of abortion, but to add to it instead, and to prevent that construction of the article as it formerly existed in the particulars mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak-\">In testing the sufficiency of an indictment under our law we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>necessarily be governed largely, if not wholly, by our codes. Of course, there are general principles which are also applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">How let us look to these statutory provisions: Article 451, subdivision 7, Code of Criminal Procedure, in prescribing the requisites of an indictment, says: \u201cThe offense must be set forth in plain and intelligible words.\u201d Article 453 says: \u201cThe certainty required in an indictment is such as will enable the accused to plead the judgment that may be given upon it in bar of any prosecution for the same offense.\u201d These articles were incorporated in our Code when originally enacted in 1856. The. tendency of the courts, then, and for some time afterwards, was to construe indictments strictly. So much so that the Legislature by the Act of March 26, 1881, page 60, undertook by legislative enactment to do away with this strict construction and by that Act added, among others, articles 460, 461 and 474. By article 460 it is enacted that an indictment \u201cshall be deemed sufficient which charges the commission of the offense in ordinary and concise language in such a manner as to enable a person of common understanding to know what is meant and with that degree of certainty that will give the defendant notice of the particular offense with which he is charged and enable the court on conviction to pronounce the proper judgment.\u201d And then further says certain words in no case are necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Article 461 is: <em>\"When a statute creating or defining an offense uses special or particular terms an indictment on it mag use the general\u25a0 terms which in common language embraces the special terms \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Article 474 is: \u201cWords used in a statute to define an offense need not be strictly pursued in the indictment; it is sufficient to use other words conveying the same meaning or which include the sense of the statutory words.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Tested by these statutes, we think it clear that the indictment in this case is sufficient as drawn, and that it is not fatally defective in that it does not contain the additional averments which appellant contends it should have contained. We are not holding that it may not have been proper to add, under the special facts of this case, what appellant contends for. It may be that that allegation would not have been, improper. What we hold is that the indictment, as written, is sufficient. We think the indictment, as written, is unquestionably of that certainty which will enable the accused to plead- the judgment herein given upon it in bar of any other prosecution for the same offense. Also that it charges the offense in such ordinary and concise language as to have enabled appellant or any other person of common understanding to know what is meant, and to give her notice of the particular offense with which she was charged and to enable the court to pronounce the proper judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">We also think that the special or particular language defining what the word \u201cabortion\u201d means is clearly embraced in the general terms used in the indictment and that the general terms used embraces the special or particular definition embraced by the addition to the article in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Act of 1907; and that the general words used in the indictment include the special terms in the law added by the Act of 1907 and include the sense of the whole of the statutory words.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">We have many statutes prescribing offenses in given words and language and then some words in the statute making the offense, are defined. As we understand, as a rule, it is never necessary in the indictment to allege the offense by defining the meaning of the several words in the statute, although prescribed by the statute itself. Take, for instance, our manslaughter statute (art. 1128, P. C.); it says, \u201cmanslaughter is voluntary homicide committed under the immediate influence of sudden passion arising from an adequate cause, hut neither justified nor excused by law.\u201d Then follow articles defining certain words and terms used. Thus, defining what is meant by \u201cunder the immediate influence of sudden passion.\u201d Then defines \u201cadequate cause?\u2019 and prescribes some of the things which are adequate cause and some which are not. It has never been held necessary and we think could not he, that an indictment for manslaughter should specifically allege what the terms and words used in the statute mean as defined and described by other provisions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">\u201cPregnancy is defined with reference to a woman as the state of being with child and is used to designate the condition of a woman from the moment of conception until she has been delivered of the child.\u201d 1 Corpus Juris., 312; 1 A. &amp; E. Ency. of Law &amp; Prae., p. 116. \u201cPregnancy extends from the whole period from the earliest conception to the actual expulsion of the fetus.\u201d State v. Howard, 32 Vt., 380. In 1 A. &amp; E. Ency. of Law &amp; Prac., p. 113, it is said: \u201cAbortion is the act of miscarrying or producing young before the actual time and before the fetus is perfectly formed; and to cause or procure an abortion is to cause or procure this premature bringing forth of the fetus. Though the word does not of itself import a crime, and does not always occur in the statutes, yet it has become a term of legal classification and is now generally if not universally used to designate the crime of causing the premature bringing forth of the human fetus, so far as that act is a crime at common law or has been made so by statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">In 1 Standard Ency. of Proc., p. 94, it is said: \u201cThe word \u2018abortion\u2019 in common terminology means the premature delivery of a human fetus. \u201c\u2018By abortion we understand the act of miscarrying, or producing young before the natural time, or before the fetus is perfectly formed. And to cause or produce -an abortion is to cause or produce this premature bringing forth of this fetus.\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">\u201c. . . The crime of abortion under modern statutes is the unlawful act of causing a woman to miscarry or abort, through the use of artificial means.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">Appellant next contends that the evidence was insufficient to sustain fhe verdict in that the evidence fails to show that said Mrs. Moore was pregnant at the time the appellant committed the acts that she was shown to have committed towards her. We have carefully read and studied the statement of -facts. Of course, it .was necessary for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>State to prove that Mrs. Moore was pregnant at the time. The court, in his charge on this point, gave a correct charge on circumstantial evidence and in accordance therewith required the jury to believe specifically that said Mrs. Moore was pregnant at the time, before they coulde convict and if the jury had a reasonable doubt of it to acquit her. We can see no useful purpose in stating the testimony. In our opinion, it was amply sufficient to meet the requirements of a charge on circumstantial evidence and from it the jury could find, as they did, that Mrs. Moore was pregnant at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Over appellant\u2019s objections the court permitted the introduction by the State of the testimony of Mrs. Duke, Mrs. Selby, E. J.\u00b0 Erwin, and W. B. Boddy to facts which would tend to show, and from which the jury were authorized to believe, that the appellant produced abortions on other women, both before and after the acts committed by her upon the said Mrs. Moore.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">It is unquestionably the rule in this State, established by all the textbooks and a great many decisions of this court, that ordinarily evidence of extraneous or other crimes are inadmissible; that an accused must he tried alone for the crime with which he is charged and that it is not admissible to prove him guilty in a given case by proving that he is a criminal generally, or committed other like crimes. See sec. 338, Branch\u2019s Cr. Law, where some of the cases are collated. Appellant, however, recognizes that proof of such extraneous crimes are admissible when they tend to show intent, knowledge, etc. There can be no question but that whenever knowledge and intent are necessary to be shown, evidence of extraneous crimes tending to show or showing this is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Our statutes create some offenses where intention or knowledge is not material. In most crimes, however, intention and knowledge are not only essential but must be proven. Under our law, if there is any crime more than another which requires that knowledge and intent is necessary, it occurs to us that that offense is the offense of abortion. Intent and knowledge are the very gist of the offense of abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Mr. Bishop says in the crime of abortion the evil intent \u201cis an element indispensable to the offense.\u201d Bish. on Stat. Or., sec. 747, p. 749. In 1 A. &amp; E. Ency. of Law &amp; Prac., p. 146, it is said: \u201cIntent, being an essential ingredient of the crime (abortion) must be proved.\u201d As we understand, all authorities hold that this is essential. It is unnecessary to collate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">It is perfectly manifest from the record in this case and the statement of facts that appellant\u2019s contention, to prevent conviction, was twofold: first, that said Mrs. Moore was not pregnant and that appellant did not know it if she was, and, second, that the acts she performed upon her were solely and simply for the innocent purpose and intention of bringing on the suppressed menses of Mrs. Moore under the belief that she was not pregnant. With the issues thus drawn there can be no doubt but that it was absolutely essential on the part of the State to introduce proof of any and all pertinent facts that would show or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>tend to show both knowledge of Mrs. Moore\u2019s pregnant condition and appellant\u2019s evil intention of producing an abortion upon her.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In 7 Ency. of Ev., p. 627, it is said: \u201cIn all cases in.which the guilty knowledge or intent of a party in the act or transaction in question is an essential. element, evidence of other general acts or offenses committed by such party or in which he bore a part, and happening at or about the same time, is relevant and competent to show intent,\u201d\u2014 citing, besides English decisions, and from the United States Supreme Court, the decisions of thirty-nine of the other States of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">1 Whart. on Cr. Ev., after laying down the general rule that proof of collateral offenses are inadmissible, in section 31, says: \u201cCertain exceptions exist, however, to the rule just stated,\u201d and then he enumerates nine specially, among them is (3) to prove scienter or guilty knowledge; (4) to prove intent. To the same effect see sec. 1126,. Bish. New Cr. Proc.; also 1 Greenl. on Ev., sec. 53; 1 Jones on Ev., see. 143; 1 Wigmore on Ev., sec. 302; 4 Chamberlayne on Ev., sec. 3222; Underhill on Ev., sec. 89. In fact, every other text-book writer on the subject of evidence lays down and applies the same rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Mr. Underhill, in section 89, says: \u201cAnother exception to the rule-occurs when the intention present in an act is material. Thus, suppose the question is, was a given act, either by the accused, or by some other person, intentional or accidental ? Here it is relevant to prove-that the person whose intention is in question had performed acts of a precisely similar nature either before or after the act the intention of which is in question. And if it be found that he has performed many such acts, we have the best of grounds for drawing the conclusion that the act, in the present instance; is intentional and not accidental. So where the commission of an act alleged to he a crime is admitted by the accused but he denies that he intended to commit it or alleges that he did it without guilty knowledge his doing similar acts, wholly independent and unconnected with that under investigation is relevant to-show intention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Jones on Evidence, voli 1, p. 725, in the latest edition of his work, after laying down and discussing the rules as stated, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">\u201cFormerly there was a clear distinction made between two classes of cases: (1) Where the intent with which an alleged offense was committed is equivocal, and such intent becomes an issue at the trial, proof of the commission of other similar offenses, within certain reasonable limits, is admissible, as tending to throw light upon the intentions of the accused in doing the act complained of; (2) where from the nature of the offense under inquiry, proof of its commission as charged carries with it the evident implication .of a criminal intent, evidence of the perpetration, or attempted perpetration, of other like offenses will not be admitted. That distinction does not appear to have been warranted, and the more modem -law may be taken to be that, notwithstanding there may he other proof of intent, in the case,. rendering evidence of another crime-unnecessary, yet - the' prdsecution is not thereby debarred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>from making all the proof possible on the subject, and consequently, in such a case, may introduce evidence of the other crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Almost every one of the above text-books specifically state that such evidence of other crimes are admissible in a case of abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Our statute (art. 1, 0. C. P.), in stating the object of the Code, -says: \u201cIt seeks . . . (4) to bring to the investigation of every offense on the trial all the evidence tending to produce conviction or acquittal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">That such independent crimes are aumissible to prove intent and knowledge has been held and applied in a great many of the decisions of this'court. In fact, we know of no decision of this court where the contrary is held. Persons v. State, 3 Texas Crim. App., 240; Francis v. State, 7 Texas Crim. App., 501; Jones v. State, 14 Texas Crim. App., 85; Martin v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 364; Street v. State, 7 Texas Crim. App., 5; Gilbraith v. State, 41 Texas, 567; Cesure v. State, 1 Texas Crim. App., 19; Fore v. State, 5 Texas Crim.

Rep., 438. The court gave appellant\u2019s special charge properly limiting for what purpose the jury could consider the testimony of said witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">In our opinion the testimony of all the witnesses objected to was clearly admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">It has been so many times decided by this court that the woman upon whom an abortion is committed is not an accomplice, that we regard the question as settled. Hunter v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 61; Miller v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 575; Willingham v. State, 33 Texas Crim. Rep., 98; Watson v. State, 9 Texas Crim. App., 237; Fondren v. State, 74 Texas Crim. Rep., 552, 169 S. W. Rep., 411. Mrs. Rob. Moore was not an accomplice and no charge thereabout was necessary or proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">As shown by the record, the appellant, on cross-examination of Mr, Reynolds, the sheriff, sought to show his ill-feeling and hostility to appellant in, order to discredit his testimony against her, and in cross-examination on the point had him testify that he, with the other white people in his community, resented the fact that appellant had bought a place in their community and moved into it,\u2014\u201cnot because she was a negro but because she is a character.\u201d The court, therefore, did not err in refusing to charge the jury not to consider the said sheriff\u2019s testimony to the effect that she was a professional abortionist, the court explaining that the testimony on the subject was brought out and introduced by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-15\">Appellant\u2019s bill Ho. 12, after the style and number of the cause and the usual \u201cbe it remembered,\u201d states \u201cthat when the prosecuting witness, Mrs. Streeter Moore, was giving her testimony she was permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>to <em>testify in </em>answer <em>to </em>a <em>question </em>propounded by the State\u2019s counsel that she, the witness, heard before she went to the defendant that the defendant performed abortions.\u201d This is, in substance, the whole of the bill, except the objections to said testimony which followed. Under-all the rules this bill is too meager and insufficient to require the court to pass upon the question. James v. State, 63 Texas Crim. Rep., 75; Conger v. State, 63 Texas Crim. Rep., 312; Best v. State, 72 Texas Crim. Rep., 201, 164 S. W. Rep., 996. The trial judge in approving this bill, qualified it by stating that while he at first admitted the testimony over appellant\u2019s objections, he \u201cgave to the jury a special instruction to disregard the same and not to consider said testimony for any purpose whatever.\u201d We find in the record a special' charge-to the jury telling them that said testimony \u201cwas improperly admitted in evidence and you are instructed that you must not consider said testimony for any purpose, nor permit your verdict to be influenced -thereby,\u201d' given at appellant\u2019s request. The court erred in admitting this testimony, but under the circumstances and the facts shown in this case, having given said special charge, the error of the court does not require, a reversal. Miller v. State, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 609; Hatcher v. State, 43 Texas Crim. Rep., 237; Robinson v. State, 63 S. W. Rep., 869; Trotter v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 468; Jones v.

Rep., 64, 167 S. W. Rep., 349. Especially as the statute now is, the said, charge withdrawing said testimony was given to the jury before any argument of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Appellant made no objection whatever to the court\u2019s charge. The court did not submit to the jury for a finding the offense of an attempt to produce abortion. Appellant requested no charge whatever upon the subject. She now claims that the omission of \u2019the court to so-charge is fundamental error. Under the proper construction of the Act of April 5, 1913, page 278, amending certain articles of the Procedure, we think appellant\u2019s contention is wholly untenable. We have, so held in a large number of cases since said amended act went into-effect. We deem it unnecessary to collate them or further discuss the-question.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b254-8\">DAVIDSON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AAS\">I can not agree to this affirmance.

In the original opinion it is stated: \u201cIt is perfectly manifest from the record in this case, and the statement of facts, that appellant\u2019s contention, to prevent conviction, was twofold: first, that said Mrs. Moore was not pregnant and that appellant did not know it if she was, and, second, that the acts she performed upon her were solely and simply for the innocent purpose and intention of bringing on the suppressed menses of Mrs. Moore under the belief that she was not pregnant.\u201d If this was the correct construction to place on the record and evidence, then the opinion would be correct beyond question, to our minds; for if the State shows one to have committed an act forbidden by law, and as a defense to such act the person on trial makes a defense that if he- in fact did the acts alleged by the State, he did so innocently or by mistake, then proof of other similar offenses is admissible to rebut the proof of innocent intent or mistake. After a renewed study of the record we have become convinced that the evidence offered by appellant tended only to show that Mrs. Moore was not pregnant at the time she committed the act complained of, and this was the defense relied upon. The evidence shows that Mrs. Moore had passed her menstrual period some seven or eight days, and she was fearful that she was pregnant. That she went to appellant to have this condition remedied. Appellant requested her to wait a month and see if her menstruation would not return without an operation. This Mrs. Moore declined to do, and insisted upon appellant performing the operation. We think the evidence demonstrates appellant did so for the purpose and with the intent, if Mrs. Moore was pregnant, to produce an abortion. This, we have come to the conclusion, is the only reasonable deduction from the evidence before us, and it does not raise the issue that she, at the time she performed the operation, knew that Mrs. Moore was not pregnant, and only performed thn operation to bring about a flow of the menses. But the acts performed were done to cause a flow of the menses in order to bring about an-abortion if Mrs. Moore was pregnant. There is, to our mind, no evir dence offered or introduced that tended to prove other than that the-acts which appellant performed were with the intention of producing an abortion if Mrs. Moore was pregnant. In the original opinion are quoted some opinions which hold that if the statute provides that in order to obtain a conviction, the State must show a guilty intention, other offenses which tended to show the intent of the person on trial would be admissible, even though the evidence offered by appellant did not raise the issues of mistake or innocent intent. We opine that the statutes of those States in which it was so held did not provide as does our Code, that \u201cwhen the facts have been proved which constitute the offense, it devolves upon the accused to establish the facts or circumstances on which he relies to excuse or justify the- prohibited act,\u201d and \u201cthe intention to commit an offense is presumed whenever the means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>used are such as would ordinarily result in the commission of the forbidden act.\u201d (Arts. 51 and 52, Penal Code.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\">Under these provisions of the Code it is the rule in this State, that when an accused is shown to have committed an act prohibited by law, there must be some evidence adduced on the trial raising the issue that the act was committed with no intent to produce the result, or the intent will be presumed from the doing of the act which results in a violation of the law. In a case of theft, it must be shown that the property was taken with the intent to deprive the owner of its value, and with the intent to appropriate such property to the use and benefit of the person taking same. But it is only necessary to prove that the property was taken, and that the accused took it and had it in his possession. Under such a state of facts our law presumes the intent to deprive the owner of the value of it, and the intent to appropriate it to the use of the taker, unless the evidence elicited on the trial raises the issue that it was taken under a claim of right, by mistake, or some other innocent motive, showing a lack of intent to take and appropriate another\u2019s property. If the evidence raises such an issue, then evidence of similar offenses is admissible to rebut this evidence of innocent intent. In those cases which hold other offenses admissible, it is shown that it is only in those cases where the evidence adduced on the trial raised the issue that there might be no guilty intent that evidence of other offenses became admissible and for that reason. Gilbraith v. State, 41 Texas, 567; Long v. State, 11 Texas Crim. App., 381; Davidson v. State, 12 Texas Crim. App., 214; McCall v. State, 14 Texas Crim. App., 353; Holmes v. State, 20 Texas Crim. App., 509; Harwell v. State, 22 Texas Crim. App., 251; Kelly v. State, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 211; Fielder v. State, 40 Texas Crim. Rep., 184; Stanfield v. State, 43 Texas Crim. Rep., 10; Lynne v. State, 53 Texas Crim. Rep., 375. On the other hand, it seems to be the well settled rule in this State, when the evidence adduced on the trial leaves no question as to intent of the accused in doing the act complained of, proof of other offenses, even though of similar character and kind, is not admissible on the issue of intent. Harris v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 469; Davenport v. State, 49 Texas Crim. Rep., 11; Clark v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep., 246, 128 S. W. Rep., 131; Bink v. State, 48 Texas Crim. Rep., 598, 89 S. W. Rep., 1075; Johnson v. State, 57 Texas Crim. Rep., 488; Miller v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep., 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-21\">Since the writer has been on the bench he had once before occasion to investigate this question (Bowman v. State, 70 Texas Crim. Rep., 22), and we there collated the decisions of this court, and held that proof of other offenses is not admissible to show intent, unless the evidence adduced on the trial renders it an issue in the case, and have again investigated the question, and our opinion thus expressed has been confirmed in view of the provisions of our Criminal Code, that the intent will be presumed when the means used are such as would ordinarily result in the commission of the offense complained of. In this case, from a re-reading of the record, we have come to the conclusion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>sole defense relied on by appellant, as shown by the testimony, was that Mrs. Moore was not pregnant at the time she inserted the rubber catheter in her womb. There was no denial of the fact that the catheter would not produce an abortion if in fact Mrs. Moore was pregnant, and no evidence tending even to raise that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Under such circumstances we are of the opinion the motion for rehearing should be granted, and the case reversed, and on another trial all evidence of other and different offenses excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The motion for rehearing is granted, and the judgment is reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b257-8\">PRENDERGAST, Presiding Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AoL\">(dissenting). Before the original opinion was written I carefully read and thoroughly studied the evidence and record. I then reached the conclusion that appellant\u2019s contention in the trial court was, that she not only did not know that Mrs. Moore was pregnant when she performed the acts she did upon her, but also \u201cthat the acts she performed upon her were solely and simply for the innocent purpose and intention of bringing on the suppressed menses of Mrs. Moore and under the belief that she was not pregnant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">In considering the motions for rehearing, I have again more carefully read and thoroughly studied the evidence and record, if that can be, than when I wrote the original opinion, and I am confirmed and strengthened in my original opinion. My brethren, however, have reached the other conclusion. If they are right, of course the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">I do not propose to give any detailed statement of the evidence,\u2014only sufficient of it to show how I reached the conclusion I did and why I adhere to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">Mrs. Sadie Moore was the State\u2019s first witness. The substance of her testimony on direct examination was that on March 13, 1913, she had been married about three months. \u201cIt had been just a short while since my menstrual period,\u2014about two weeks I reckon.\u201d That she knew appellant and went to her home and saw her there said date; that Mrs. Eob Moore (another Mrs. Moore) went out there with her. \u201cI told her (appellant) what I wanted done; I told her I wanted an abortion. . . . She asked me how far I was and I told her about two weeks or ten days or something like that. There was something said about pay,\u2014defendant said she charged $10 and I paid her. I then lay down on a couch and defendant used a catheter, a little rubber tube, and she inserted it into my womb. She put some cotton around the catheter. She left it in there. . . . The catheter remained inserted in my womb from about 11 o\u2019clock one day until about 11 o\u2019clock the next day, th.en I removed both the catheter and the cotton. . . . After the removal of the catheter and cotton I was sick; it was successful\u2014my menstrual period I guess came from the womb after the removal of the catheter and cotton. There was also something else came from my womb, but not very much of anything\u2014it looked like a little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>old white substance, just very small, about the size of a dime. After this about two or three, weeks I consulted with a physician\u2014Dr. Nance;. he came to my house and made an examination of my womb and put an ice bag on my side. I just wanted to have the doctor come and see me and tell him what I had done; I just kind of felt kind of bad and I thought there might be some inflammation there or something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aau\">Appellant then took her on cross-examination and had her testify that she was nineteen years of age when she married and never had been married before; that she had never given birth to a child, was ignorant of all such matters when she went to see appellant and had never before been, pregnant and knew very little about matters of that kind. \u201cMy regular menstrual period should .have arrived along some time about the first of March and my period not arriving about that time, I became uneasy as to my condition. There was nothing in my condition that aroused my apprehension except the fact that I had missed my monthly period and I was not accustomed to missing it.\u201d That she first discussed her condition with said Mrs. Bob Moore,' who was an older and longer married woman than she was, and told her about missing her menstrual period and the time; that Mrs. Bob Moore told her she could go out to appellant, and she went there mainly to see what her condition was, and told appellant the time she had missed her menses and that \u201cI was worried about my menstruation, and asked her if she could do anything to cause the resumption of my menstruation or cause me to \u2018come \u2019round/ . . . She asked me how long I had passed my period and I told her all I knew about my condition was that I had missed my period. She told me that she would not make an examination of me or try to bring on my menstruation unless my husband requested her to do it.\u201d She said that she then- phoned to her husband and he told her he would leave it with her; that defendant did not send for her but she voluntarily went to get the help of defendant to relieve her of the situation that was embarrassing her. \u201cWhen I talked to defendant about this and after we had called up my husband, it seems to me she said something about my waiting until the next month to see if my period would not come around without doing anything.\u201d That she was very nervous and crying at the time and told defendant that if she was going to have it done she would rather have it done then. She further said that after the catheter was inserted in her womb and her womb packed with cotton and after it remained there about twenty-four hours it \u201cproduced the flow\u2014more than usual.\u201d Appellant further had her testify: \u201cAt the time I went out to see defendant 1 thought I was pregnant but I did not know; I do not suppose that I could swear \u2019that I was; that I was absolutely certain about the matter, but I thought so then and still think I was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">On redirect examination she testified that she was living with her husband since she married him and that the ordinary relations between man and wife existed between them, and during the time within forty days preceding the time she discovered that her menstruation had ceased had had sexual intercourse with her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>On recross-examination appellant had her testify that she phoned Mrs. Eob Moore the day before March 12th and told her she thought she was pregnant. She said, \u201cMrs. Moore might have told me in this phone conversation that it was not unusual for a lady to go by her menstrual period,\u201d but she did not remember that she did; didn\u2019t remember telling her that she didn\u2019t know whether she was pregnant or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The next State\u2019s witness was .said Mrs. Eob Moore. On direct examination she said that on said occasion, March 12, 1913, she went with Mrs. Sadie Moore to appellant\u2019s house and heard the conversation between appellant and Mrs. Sadie Moore; that Mrs. Sadie Moore wanted Mrs. Gray to examine her and she refused, and Mrs. Sadie Moore began to cry and beg her to, and Mrs. Gray said she would if Mrs. Moore would phone her husband; Mrs. Moore phoned her husband, and he was perfectly willing to go ahead, and then Mrs.. Gray said she would. The horse hitched to the buggy in which these two ladies went to appellant\u2019s got loose and Mrs. Eob Moore said she went to catch the horse and did not see what appellant did to Mrs. Sadie Moore; that when she returned from catching the horse everything was over and Mrs. Sadie Moore was ready to go; that she knew that Mrs. Sadie Moore took some money with her, and thinks she paid defendant $10; that she thought Mrs. Sadie Moore was going to be sick and went over to Mrs. Sadie Moore\u2019s the next day to help her get dinner, found that she was up and just as cheerful as she had ever seen her.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">On cross-examination appellant had Mrs. Eob Moore to tell that the day before, March 12th, Mrs. Sadie Moore told her she had passed her period some eight or nine days and that she asked her, the witness, to go out with her to appellant\u2019s to find out whether she was pregnant or not. She said, \u201cI do not remember whether she just said it in that way or not, but she wanted to be examined. Mrs. Moore talked to me like she thought she was pregnant, and I tried to convince her that she was not, but she thought she was because she was so young and inexperienced; she just said she had passed her time eight or nine days and that was the.only reason she thought she was pregnant. I explained to her that missing her period was nothing uncommon.\u201d That when she went over the next day to help Mrs. Sadie Moore with her dinner, she said: \u201cIt seems she said something to me about having menstruated but she said nothing about having aborted or delivered a child. . . . Just stated that her menstruation had come around all right and that she was all right; she never told me that there was anything unusual about' the menstruation coming around or any unusual dis.charges.\u201d These two witnesses were the only ones other than appellant herself by whom the State could prove its case as to the immediate facts thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">I think the examination by the State and the direct testimony of both of these witnesses was for the sole purpose of showing that Mrs. Sadie Moore was pregnant and that the acts performed upon her by appellant were performed with the knowledge of that fact and with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>no other intention than to produce an abortion. On the other hand, I think the cross-examination of both of these witnesses was not only for the purpose of attempting to show that Mrs. Moore was not pregnant, but especially to show that if she was, that she, appellant, did not <em>know </em>or <em>believe </em>it, for she had Mrs. Moore to testify that she herself, Mrs. Moore, did not <em>know, </em>but simply <em>believed or thought </em>she was pregnant, and had the other Mrs. Moore to testify that she tried to convince Mrs. Sadie Moore that she was not pregnant, but simply that her menses was suppressed for a few days, which was not an unusual, but simply an ordinary condition of married women. And that appellant performed the act she did, not to produce an abortion, but simply and solely for the innocent purpose and intention of bringing on her suppressed menses. From the course of the whole cross-examination of these two witnesses to my mind, it is the same as if the appellant had said to the trial court and jury: \u201cI did not know that Mrs. Sadie Moore was pregnant,\u2014I did not believe she was. What I did to her was with no intention or purpose to bring on an abortion, but was simply and solely to relieve the lady of her distress and bring on her suppressed menses; that her menses were not suppressed because of pregnancy but from some. other cause, which was not unusual in women.\u201d This being the case, I believe the testimony of the other witnesses showing and tending to show that' she had produced abortions on other women, both before and after, was clearly admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">I think there can be no doubt, not only that appellant made this contention and showed it both directly and by implication from her cross-examination of these witnesses, but that she could make it appear more or less plausible, for there can be no doubt and is none, to my mind, that if Mrs. Moore had not been pregnant that what appellant did to her would unquestionably have brought on her suppressed menses whatever the cause other than pregnancy. In other words, here was a woman with delayed or suppressed menses. What appellant did to her would bring on her suppressed menses, whether caused by pregnancy or some other cause. Then unquestionably what appellant did was an equivocal act. The State contended that the act was performed to bring on an abortion and with that intent only; the appellant contended that that was not true, but that what she did was done for the purpose of bringing on suppressed or delayed menses and with that intent and for that purpose only. To bring on her menses if not pregnant was not a crime but a commendable and innocent act. Hence, the application of the rule that testimony of her like acts upon other women showing that her intention was to bring on an abortion and not innocently bring on suppressed menses, was clearly admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">I think the judgment should be affirmed,\u2014not reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
