We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err by denying the City\u2019s motion for change of venue?</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">\u00b64 According to the pleadings, on July 13,1999, a City bus struck an overhead gas heater in the Helena bus barn, separating a gas line. The following morning, the Plaintiffs decedent, City Bus Manager Orval Meyer, activated the electric garage door opener which caused gas fumes to explode. Mr. Meyer survived for a time. He was treated at St. Peter\u2019s Community Hospital in Helena and then transferred out of state, where he died two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">\u00b65 Defendant City is located in Lewis and Clark County and is a political subdivision of the State of Montana. Defendant Montana Power Company (Montana Power) was a Montana corporation, and its successor, Northwestern Energy, LLC (Northwestern), is a Montana limited liability company with its principal place of business in Silver Bow County.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">\u00b66 Plaintiff Rebecca Meyer, Personal Representative of Orval Meyer\u2019s estate (Meyer), filed a survivorship/wrongful-death action against the Defendants in Silver Bow County on July 11, 2002. The City filed a motion for change of venue to Lewis and Clark County, which was denied. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">\u00b67 Whether a county is a proper place for trial is a question of law involving the application of the venue statutes to pleaded facts. <em>State v. Pegasus Gold Corp. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 32, 35, 889 P.2d 1197, 1199 (citation omitted). Thus, <em>our review </em>of the trial court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for change of venue is plenary; we simply determine whether the court\u2019s ruling was legally correct. <em>Pegasus, 270 </em>Mont, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>35, 889 P.2d at 1199. <em>See also Gabriel v. School Dist. No. 4, Libby </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 177, 179, 870 P.2d 1351, 1352; <em>Emery v. Federated Foods, Inc. </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 83, 87, 863 P.2d 426, 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court err by denying the City\u2019s motion for change of venue?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u00b69 The City first argues that two of this Court\u2019s previous decisions, <em>Gabriel </em>and <em>Wentz v. Montana Power Co. </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 14, 928 P.2d 237, have established that the proper venue for trial of a combined survivorship/wrongfiil-death action is either the county in which the survivorship claim arose, or the county in which the wrongful-death claim arose. Pursuant thereto, the City argues that because neither claim arose in Silver Bow County, it is not a proper venue for trial of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u00b610 In <em>Gabriel, </em>the school district, a political subdivision, was the sole defendant in the plaintiffs survivorship/wrongful-death suit. The plaintiffs decedent, Richard J. Sasse, fell from a school roof in Libby, Lincoln County, while working on a construction project for the school district. He was transported to a hospital in Flathead County where he died of his injuries. The plaintiff later filed her complaint against the school district in Flathead County. The school district moved for change of venue to Lincoln County. On the grounds that the events surrounding the injury occurred there, the survivorship claim arose there, and the school district, a political subdivision, was located there, the district court granted the motion. The district court ruled that Lincoln County was the proper place of trial under \u00a7 25-2-126(3), MCA (now \u00a7 25-2-126(2), MCA), which provided that the \u201cproper place of trial for an action against a political subdivision is in the county in which the claim arose or in any county where the political subdivision is located.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\u00b611 We acknowledged that Lincoln County was a proper venue for the action pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-126(3), MCA, because defendant school district was located there. Noting, however, that venue for the combined survivorship/wrongful-death action would lie either where the survivorship claim arose or where the wrongful-death claim arose, we concluded that Flathead County was also a proper venue for the action, because the decedent had died there. <em>Gabriel, </em>264 Mont, at 179, 181, 870 P.2d at 1352,1353. Thus, we held that the district court had erred in granting the school district\u2019s motion to change the venue to Lincoln County because \u201cif a plaintiff files in <em>one </em>county where venue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>is proper, no motion for change of venue can be granted.\u201d <em>Gabriel, </em>264 Mont. at 179, 870 P.2d at 1352 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). The principle that venue for a combined survivorship/wrongful-death action \u201ccan be determined on the basis of either the survivorship action or the wrongful death action\u201d was reiterated in <em>Wentz. Wentz, </em>280 Mont, at 22, 928 P.2d at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b612 Although in both <em>Gabriel </em>and <em>Wentz </em>we approved such counties as proper venues for the trial of a survivorship/wrongful-death action, in neither case did we hold that these counties were the exclusive venue options provided by the venue statutes for survivorship/wrongful-death actions. In both cases, we simply determined that the counties in which the respective plaintiffs had filed their actions were proper venues under the statutes. Thus, <em>Gabriel </em>and <em>Wentz </em>did not set forth an exclusive venue rule for survivorship/wrongful-death actions which is determinative of the issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b613 Meyer asserts that Silver Bow County is also a proper venue for her claim against the City pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-117, MCA, which provides that \u201c[i]f there are two or more defendants in an action, a county that is a proper place of trial for any defendant is proper for all defendants ....\u201d It is not disputed that the residence of Defendant Northwestern is Silver Bow County, its principal place of business. <em>See Mapston v. Joint School Dist. No. 8 </em>(1987), 227 Mont. 521, 523, 740 P.2d 676, 677 (\u201cA corporation in Montana has only one residence. That residence is the county in which it has it\u2019s [sic] principal place of business\u201d). Because the \u201cproper place of trial for a tort action is ... the county in which the defendants or any of them reside at the commencement of the action,\u201d \u00a7 25-2-122(1)(a), MCA, Meyer argues that venue for her tort claim against Northwestern lies in Silver Bow County, where Northwestern resides, and, pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-117, MCA, her claim against co-defendant City also properly lies there. \u00b614 The City acknowledges the application of \u00a7 25-2-117, MCA, to cases involving multiple defendants that include a political subdivision, a principle we stated in <em>Weiss by and through Weiss v. State </em>(1986), 219 Mont. 447, 450, 712 P.2d 1315, 1317, but argues that because \u00a7 25-2-126(2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MCA (venue for actions against political subdivisions), is more specific than \u00a7 25-2-122, MCA (venue for tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>actions), it is entitled to application of the political subdivision provisions of \u00a7 25-2-126(2), MCA, which would require a change of venue to Lewis and Clark County. In support of this argument, the City cites <em>Whalen v. Montana Right to Life Assoc., </em>2002 MT 328, 313 Mont. 204, 60 P.3d 972, in which we applied, in the context of the venue statutes, the rule of statutory construction that a more specific statute prevails over a general one. <em>Whalen, </em>\u00b6 9. The City argues that <em>Weiss </em>did not consider this argument and, thus, a different outcome is required here by virtue of this rule of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b615 In <em>Whalen, </em>a contract case, we reasoned that \u00a7 25-2-121, MCA, the venue statute for contract actions, more specifically addressed the facts pled therein than \u00a7 25-2-118(1), MCA, the venue statute for all civil actions, and, accordingly, we applied \u00a7 25-2-121, MCA. <em>Whalen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-9. However, the venue statutes involved in this case do not address subject matter that can be compared to determine specificity in the way we compared the statutes at issue in <em>Whalen. </em>There, we could reason that all contract actions are civil actions, but not all civil actions sound in contract, and so it was clear that \u00a7 25-2-121, MCA, addressed contract actions more specifically than \u00a7 25-2-118(1), MCA. The subject matter of those two statutes was thus comparable, and allowed us to determine specificity, because both based their designation of venue on the same variable-the type of claim. By contrast, the statutes at issue here, \u00a7\u00a7 25-2-126(2) and 25-2-122, MCA, base their respective venue designations upon different variables: \u00a7 25-2-126(2), MCA, addresses a particular type of defendant, but no specific type of claim; \u00a7 25-2-122, MCA, addresses a specific type of claim, but no particular type of defendant. For this purpose, therefore, it cannot be said that either \u00a7 25-2-126(2), MCA, or \u00a7 25-2-122, MCA, is more specific than the other. We thus conclude that the reasoning of <em>Whalen </em>is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"AHo\">\u00b616 The precise question before us is whether \u00a7 25-2-126(2), MCA (venue for actions against political subdivisions), prevails over \u00a7 25-2-122(l)(a), MCA (venue for tort actions) in a multiple defendant case, where one defendant is a political subdivision and another defendant is a private entity, the plaintiff has chosen to sue both defendants in the county in which the private entity resides pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-122(l)(a), MCA, and that county is neither the county in which the plaintiffs claim arose nor a county in which the political subdivision is located-those being the two venues approved by \u00a7 25-2-126(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AsM\">\u00b617 We note that neither subsection of \u00a7 25-2-126, MCA, purports to prescribe the sole proper venue for an action in which the State or a political subdivision thereof is a defendant, to the exclusion of all other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>venue designations under the statutes. Further, we note that neither \u00a7 25-2-115, MCA (\u201cMultiple proper counties\u201d), nor \u00a7 25-2-117, MCA (\u201cMultiple defendants\u201d), textually exempts the application of \u00a7 25-2-126, MCA, from operation of the rules either sets forth. Thus, there is no statutory authority for the proposition that \u00a7 25-2-126, MCA, is a venue designation superior to the other statutes. Nor does anything in our prior venue holdings require such a conclusion. As noted, we held in <em>Weiss </em>that political subdivisions are subject to the operation of the multiple defendant provisions of \u00a7 25-2-117, MCA. <em>Weiss, </em>219 Mont, at 450, 712 P.2d at 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b618  We thus hold that \u00a7 25-2-126(2), MCA, does not prevail over \u00a7 25-2-122(l)(a), MCA, including, as applied here, in a matter involving multiple defendants pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-117, MCA. These provisions simply provide alternative venue options to the plaintiff, which she properly exercised herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b619 We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b314-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-13\"> Following the filing of the appeal and submission for decision, Montana Power initiated a bankruptcy proceeding under 11 U.S.C.
