The State Fund appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">\u00b62 While the State Fund raises the overall issue on appeal of whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in holding the State Fund liable for Murray\u2019s occupational disease, it breaks that question down into three subissues which we restate and address individually:</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court improperly rely on Dr. Nicholas Blavatsky\u2019s testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">\u00b64 2. Is the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Murray\u2019s work at MSE Technology Applications, Inc., significantly contributed to his knee condition and his need for surgery supported by substantial credible evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">\u00b65 3. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in concluding the State Fund, rather than Indemnity, is the liable workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>compensation insurer?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b66 Murray suffered injuries in 1967 and 1974 which required removal of part or all of the cartilage in both of his knees. He remained physically active both in the jobs he performed and in vigorous recreational activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u00b67 In 1982, Murray began working for MSE Technology Applications, Inc. (MSE) in Butte, Montana, as a security guard and mail carrier. He continued to work there for the next eighteen and one-half years. From approximately 1989 to 2000, he worked as a tool room attendant, issuing and repairing tools for other MSE employees. Much of Murray\u2019s work involved standing on concrete or asphalt.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\u00b68 From 1993 to 2000, Murray suffered several episodes of knee pain, swelling and effusion in connection with his personal recreational activities. Until 2000, he recovered quickly and resumed his active lifestyle after each episode. Nevertheless, physician Michael Gallagher advised him by 1996 that bilateral knee replacements were inevitable because his knees continued to degenerate.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\u00b69 In December of 2000, orthopedic surgeon Nicholas Blavatsky, who specialized in knee replacements and later performed Murray\u2019s knee replacement surgery, told Murray that the work at MSE had contributed to Murray\u2019s condition and need for surgery. Within a month, Murray filed an occupational disease claim and scheduled bilateral knee replacements. He had been given notice that his job at MSE was being phased out and knew he would need time to recover from his impending knee surgeries. As a result, Murray resigned from his employment with MSE on January 12,2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">\u00b6 10 The State Fund, MSE\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer at the time Murray filed his claim, began paying Murray benefits under a reservation of rights. It petitioned the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for a determination that Indemnity, MSE\u2019s prior workers\u2019 compensation insurer, is liable for compensation for Murray\u2019s bilateral knee condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">\u00b611 Murray testified at the hearing on the State Fund\u2019s petition. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court admitted depositions of Murray, Gallagher, Blavatsky, and Dr. Gary M. Rapaport into evidence. Rapaport, an occupational medicine specialist, had examined Murray in August of 2001 at the request of the Montana Department of Labor and Industry. In addition, the State Fund offered into evidence, and the court admitted over Murray\u2019s objection, a letter in which Rapaport <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>responded to specific questions the State Fund submitted to him after his deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b612 In detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court reviewed the evidence and determined it established that Murray\u2019s work both significantly aggravated his preexisting bilateral knee condition and led to or accelerated his need for knee replacement surgery. The court determined Murray is entitled to the indemnity and medical benefits available under the Montana Occupational Disease Act and concluded that, as the insurer at risk during Murray\u2019s last occupational exposure, the State Fund is liable for paying the benefits. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court subsequently denied the State Fund\u2019s request for reconsideration. The State Fund appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\u00b613 We review the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence. We apply the same standard of review when the record contains both deposition medical evidence and other trial evidence relevant to the medical issue. <em>See Wilson v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 313, 317, 903 P.2d 785, 787-88 (citation omitted). We review the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Hiett v. Missoula County Public Schools, </em>2003 MT 213, \u00b6 15, 317 Mont. 95, \u00b6 15, 75 P.3d 341, \u00b6 15 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">\u00b614 1. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court improperly rely on Blavatsky\u2019s testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">\u00b615 The State Fund argues that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court improperly relied on Blavatsky\u2019s testimony because Blavatsky\u2019s medical records do not reflect a relationship between Murray\u2019s knee problems and his work at MSE. This argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">\u00b616 Blavatsky was not specifically asked during his deposition whether he knew Murray stood or walked on concrete at work. In response to questioning, however, Blavatsky testified that working on concrete floors over repeated intervals can tend to result in osteoarthritis in the knees. Blavatsky stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">It\u2019s been shown that that kind of activity over repeated intervals-it may be years on end-can exacerbate that condition. And it\u2019s been shown in people that are diesel mechanics and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>waitresses and other occupations that have this kind of problem, that they tend to develop osteoarthritic changes more so than counterparts that are not on hard surfaces like that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">As the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court noted in denying the State Fund\u2019s motion for reconsideration, Blavatsky\u2019s testimony \u201cdoes not show that he was unaware of [Murray\u2019s] standing on concrete at work for long periods of time.\u201d In fact, the question about the effect of working on concrete, and his answer to that question, suggest the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b617 Under this argument, the State Fund also criticizes the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for \u201cdisregarding\u201d the opinion of Gallagher, who \u201ccould not express an opinion on the impact of work activities at MSE on Mr. Murray\u2019s knees.\u201d While Gallagher declined to express an opinion on the impact of work activities on Murray\u2019s knees, he also testified he would defer to Blavatsky\u2019s judgment on that question because he had not been involved in Murray\u2019s treatment since 2000. \u00b618 Finally, the State Fund advances a letter written by Rapaport which differs from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court finding that Murray\u2019s work at MSE significantly contributed to his knee condition. The State Fund analogizes this case to <em>Burglund v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 134, 950 P.2d 1371. There, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found the worker\u2019s disability was caused by a prior work injury, not by an occupational disease, in spite of the fact that his work may have hastened the degenerative process. We affirmed, determining the court\u2019s finding that the worker\u2019s condition was caused by a natural progression of the prior injury was supported by substantial evidence. <em>Burglund, </em>286 Mont, at 137, 950 P.2d at 1372-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u00b619  The question underlying whether a finding is supported by substantial evidence is not whether substantial evidence would support a different finding. The question is whether substantial evidence supports the finding the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court actually made. <em>Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp. v. Champion Intern. Corp. </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 76, 79, 945 P.2d 433, 435 (citation omitted). Thus, the fact that we affirmed a Workers\u2019 Compensation Court finding in <em>Burglund </em>that the claimant\u2019s disability was not caused by occupational disease has no relevance here.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u00b620 We conclude the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court properly relied on Blavatsky\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\u00b621 2. Is the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Murray\u2019s work at MSE significantly contributed to his knee condition and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>need for surgery supported by substantial credible evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\u00b622 We observe at the outset that the State Fund asserts the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court determined that Murray\u2019s \u201cwork activities at MSE substantially aggravated his underlying osteoarthritis.\u201d The State Fund then advances <em>Polk v. Planet Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 287 Mont. 79, 951 P.2d 1015, for the proposition that occupational factors must substantially aggravate an underlying condition to render the condition compensable. It asserts the overwhelming evidence of record reflects the likelihood Murray\u2019s osteoarthritis began with the 1967 and 1974 injuries and worsened during pre-MSE employment and his recreational activities. According to the State Fund, the effect of MSE employment on Murray\u2019s knees was \u201cinfinitesimal\u201d rather than substantial. The State Fund entirely misses the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u00b623 First, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that \u201c[Murray\u2019s] work at MSE significantly contributed to [his] knee condition and his need for surgery.\u201d The court did not use the \u201csubstantially aggravated\u201d language. Second, we rejected the \u201csubstantially aggravated\u201d argument in <em>Polk, </em>287 Mont, at 85, 951 P.2d at 1019, stating the test for compensability under the Occupational Disease Act as whether occupational factors significantly aggravated a preexisting condition. Thus, the State Fund\u2019s reliance on the \u201csubstantially aggravated\u201d test, and its application of that test to the evidence here, is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u00b624 The State Fund relies heavily on Rapaport\u2019s revised opinion in his post-deposition letter to the State Fund\u2019s counsel in September of2003. Ultimately, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court gave little weight to Rapaport\u2019s post-deposition letter on grounds that it was not sworn, was not subject to cross-examination and \u201cwas [written] in reply to carefully framed written questions of counsel.\u201d The State Fund contends the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in giving the letter little weight. We will not, however, substitute our judgment for that of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court where the issue relates to the weight given to certain evidence or the credibility of witnesses. <em>Best v. State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 302, 306, 916 P.2d 108, 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\u00b625 Evidence from several sources supports the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Murray\u2019s work at MSE significantly contributed to his knee condition. Murray, found by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to be \u201ca wholly credible witness,\u201d testified he stood or walked on cold concrete floors at MSE all but two or three hours a day of his 40 or more hour work week. In Rapaport\u2019s report, appended to his deposition, he acknowledged Murray\u2019s 1967 and 1974 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>injuries but stated subsequent activities, including Murray\u2019s recreational activities and work activities, had contributed to the advancing degeneration of both knees. Although Rapaport noted Murray\u2019s medical records referenced no specific occupational injury, he stated it appeared Murray was required to walk, bend, lift and climb on concrete sin-faces, which may have contributed in part to his degenerative joint disease. Rapaport apportioned 30 to 40 percent of Murray\u2019s condition to work activities. Blavatsky agreed with Rapaport that at least 30 per cent of Murray\u2019s knee condition was attributable to walking and standing on hard surfaces. While conceding that Murray\u2019s old knee injuries were \u201chuge initiating factors in his osteoarthritis,\u201d Blavatsky testified that \u201cin all fairness, work-related activities have some measure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b626  We conclude the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Murray\u2019s MSE employment significantly contributed to his knee condition is supported by substantial credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b627 3. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in concluding the State Fund, rather than Indemnity, is the liable workers\u2019 compensation insurer?</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u00b628 Finally, the State Fund asserts that, even if the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Murray\u2019s employment significantly contributed to his knee condition is supported by substantial credible evidence, his occupational disease occurred while Indemnity was MSE\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer. The State Fund points to Murray\u2019s deposition testimony that, as of October 1, 2000, when the State Fund became MSE\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer, he was sitting 40 to 50 percent of the time he was at work. The State Fund also points to Murray\u2019s statements in his exit interview with MSE that he was leaving the company because his job had been reduced to half time and his workload was \u201ctoo light.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\u00b629  Section \u00a7 39-72-303(2), MCA, provides that the insurer providing coverage at the earlier of (a) the date an occupational disease was first diagnosed, or (b) the date the employee \u201cknew or should have known that the condition was the result of an occupational disease\u201d is liable for the worker\u2019s occupational disease. Murray testified he was unaware that standing on concrete at work was a cause of his knee condition until Blavatsky so advised him in December of 2000. At that time, the State Fund was MSE\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer. The State Fund points to nothing which indicates Murray should have been aware of the connection between his knee condition and his employment earlier. We conclude the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>correctly determined the State Fund is the liable workers\u2019 compensation insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u00b630  We hold the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not err in holding the State Fund liable for compensation for Murray\u2019s occupational disease.
