The Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Ravalli County, found that the policy\u2019s pollution exclusion bars coverage for the environmental contamination due to the intentional nature of the dumping. We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to deny coverage to Ribi Immunochem Research, Inc. (Ribi) under a CGL policy provided by Travelers Casualty and Surety Company (Travelers).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">\u00b62 The parties raise numerous arguments on appeal and cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>appeal, but we need address only the following issues to resolve this matter:</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred in determining that the CGL policy\u2019s pollution exclusion provision bars coverage for Ribi\u2019s hazardous waste disposal in that the disposal was not \u201csudden or accidental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in determining Travelers had no duty to defend Ribi against claims brought by third-parties for cleanup costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erred in determining that Travelers may recoup its defense costs expended on Ribi\u2019s behalf for those claims that the District Court ultimately determined were barred by the CGL policy\u2019s pollution exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b66 4. Whether the District Court erred in ordering Travelers to pay attorneys\u2019 fees that Ribi incurred in litigating pre-trial discovery motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u00b67 Ribi also appeals the District Court\u2019s dismissal of its contract-based claims against Travelers, including breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and violations of the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act. We need not reach these issues, however, as our decision to affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusions denying coverage for Ribi\u2019s environmental contamination makes review of these matters unnecessary. <em>See Story v. City of Bozeman </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 436, 791 P.2d 767 (holding that breach of good faith and fair dealing claim requires showing of breach of contract); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA (an insurer may not be held liable under the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act if the insurer had a reasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting the claim). Similarly, we resolve Travelers\u2019s narrow cross-appeal question regarding which party bears the burden of proving an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the context of our analysis of the broader burden of proof discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">\u00b68 Ribi, a corporation located in Hamilton, Montana, at all times pertinent to these proceedings, develops biopharmaceutical products. From 1981 to 1985, Ribi used toxic solvents to extract and purify its products. Ribi routinely disposed of its hazardous wastes at Bitterroot Valley Sanitary Landfill (BVSL) for most of this period. Ribi employees transported containers of waste to BVSL each month and poured the liquid contaminants into an open, unlined, earthen pit that measured six feet deep, four feet wide, and eight feet long. Ribi recognized the hazardous nature of its chemical solvents, but hoped that much of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>waste would evaporate before migrating through the landfill into the shallow groundwater. Subsequent analysis revealed, however, that the hazardous contaminants migrated into the groundwater approximately 13 to 34 minutes after each disposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b69 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) discovered groundwater and soil contamination in 1987 resulting from Ribi\u2019s waste disposal at BVSL. The National Institute of Health (NIH) later excavated and cleaned the contaminated soil and groundwater. Neighboring property owners sued Ribi in 1993 for personal injury and property damages. The State also sued Ribi in 1997 to recover its response costs arising from contamination in and around the landfill. The next year, 1998, the United States sought contribution from Ribi for NIH\u2019s response costs. Ribi eventually settled the claims with all three parties. This litigation arises from the relationship between Ribi and its insurer-Travelers-regarding Ribi\u2019s requests for insurance coverage and defense against those three claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b610 Travelers issued the CGL policy to Ribi from 1982 through 1985. Ribi filed a claim with Travelers to recover the cost of remediating the damages caused by the contamination. In response, on December 6, 1993, Travelers executed a reservation of rights letter for the neighboring property owners\u2019 claims in which it informed Ribi that it owed no indemnity obligation to Ribi and therefore no defense. Travelers also sent Ribi a separate letter on February 10, 1994, regarding its intention to seek reimbursement for defense costs. Travelers and Ribi eventually agreed that Travelers would pay fifty percent of Ribi\u2019s defense costs in its suit with the neighboring property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u00b611 Travelers executed additional reservation of rights letters on January 25, 1996, and March 10, 1999, in response to Ribi\u2019s further demand for defense and indemnity of claims brought by the state and federal governments. Travelers again informed Ribi that it owed no indemnity obligations and therefore no defense and also notified Ribi of its intention to seek recoupment of any defense costs in the two government actions. Ribi raised no objections and thereafter, Travelers defended Ribi under its reservation of rights, paying one-hundred percent of the defense costs in the government suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\u00b612 Ribi regularly submitted claims to Travelers for defense costs and indemnification under the policies throughout these third-party lawsuits. Travelers denied Ribi\u2019s claims and finally brought an action seeking a declaration that it had no duty to provide insurance coverage and defense for these environmental claims. Ribi counterclaimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>against Travelers for breach of contract, declaratory relief, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and violations of the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act under \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\">\u00b613 Travelers filed a motion for summary judgment on December 12, 2001, on the declaratory judgment issue and also sought to recoup expenses incurred as part of its defense against the third-party suits. Travelers also refuted Ribi\u2019s counterclaim that it had breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing or violated the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act in denying Ribi\u2019s claims. The District Court granted summary judgment to Travelers on the coverage issue thereby negating all of Ribi\u2019s contract-based claims. The court further allowed Travelers to recoup its defense costs in the government suits expended after March 10,1999. With respect to the neighboring property owners\u2019 suits, the District Court initially denied Travelers\u2019s recoupment claims, but later amended its order to include those costs expended after February 10, 1994. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>based on the same criteria applied by the district court. <em>Counterpoint, Inc. v. Essex Ins. Co., </em>1998 MT 251, \u00b6 7, 291 Mont. 189, \u00b6 7, 967 P.2d 393, \u00b6 7. As the material facts here remain uncontroverted, we limit our review to questions of law. <em>Brabeck v. Employers Mut. Cas. Co., </em>2000 MT 373, \u00b6 8, 303 Mont. 468, \u00b6 8, 16 P.3d 355, \u00b6 8. The District Court interpreted Travelers\u2019s insurance contract in reaching its decision and this interpretation of an insurance contract represents a question of law. <em>Pablo v. Moore, </em>2000 MT 48, \u00b6 12, 298 Mont. 393, \u00b6 12, 995 P.2d 460, \u00b6 12. We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine whether it is correct. <em>Pablo, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u00b615 Whether the District Court erred in determining that the CGL policy\u2019s pollution exclusion provision bars coverage for Ribi\u2019s hazardous waste disposal in that the disposal was not \u201csudden or accidental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\u00b616 The District Court determined that Ribi\u2019s disposal constituted an \u201coccurrence,\u201d possibly triggering coverage under the CGL policy, but it found no coverage based upon the fact that Ribi\u2019s long-term disposal of hazardous wastes could not be deemed \u201csudden and accidental\u201d as defined in the CGL policy\u2019s pollution exclusion. Ribi argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>District Court erred in determining that the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d exception contains a temporal element and instead contends that the term \u201csudden\u201d should be understood to mean unexpected, and not necessarily quick or abrupt. Ribi maintains, in other words, that even though its disposal may have occurred over a period of years, the CGL policy should provide coverage so long as the ultimate migration of the wastes into the groundwater was unexpected and accidental. Thus, Ribi alleges that the ultimate migration of its waste into the groundwater constituted the relevant event under the CGL policy\u2019s pollution exclusion rather than its intentional disposal in the landfill.</p>\n<p id=\"AZT\">\u00b617  General rules of contract law apply to insurance policies and we construe them strictly against the insurer and in favor of the insured. <em>Erickson v. Dairyland Ins. Co. </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 119, 123, 785 P.2d 705, 707-08. Courts give the terms and words used in an insurance contract their usual meaning and construe them using common sense. <em>Hardy v. Progressive Speciality Ins. </em>Co., 2003 MT 85, \u00b6 14, 315 Mont. 107, \u00b6 14, 67 P.3d 892, \u00b6 14. Any ambiguity in an insurance policy must be construed in favor of the insured and in favor of extending coverage. <em>Farmers Alliance Mut. Ins. Co. v. Holeman, </em>1998 MT 155, \u00b6 25, 289 Mont. 312, \u00b6 25, 961 P.2d 114, \u00b6 25. An ambiguity exists where the contract, when taken as a whole, reasonably is subject to two different interpretations. <em>Holeman, </em>\u00b6 25. Courts should not, however, \u201cseize upon certain and definite covenants expressed in plain English with violent hands, and distort them so as to include a risk clearly excluded by the insurance contract.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Equitable Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>(1963), 142 Mont. 128, 131, 381 P.2d 778, 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">A. <em>Definition of \u201cOccurrence\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b618 At the outset we must determine whether the unintentional damage caused by Ribi\u2019s intentional disposal constitutes an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined in the CGL policy. The CGL policy\u2019s intent is \u201cto insure the acts or omissions of the insured, including his intentional acts, excluding only those in which the resulting <em>injury </em>is either expected or intended from <em>the insured\u2019s standpoint.\u201d Northwestern Nat. Cas. Co. v. Phalen </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 448, 455, 597 P.2d 720, 724 (emphasis added). Whether the resulting injuries were intended or expected must be measured from the insured\u2019s standpoint. <em>Phalen, </em>182 Mont, at 455, 597 P.2d at 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u00b619 As defined in the CGL policy, an \u201coccurrence\u201d constitutes an accident that results in property damage \u201cneither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d Travelers maintains in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>its cross-appeal that the District Court erred in determining that the \u201cneither expected nor intended\u201d language in the CGL policy represents an exclusion to coverage. As an exclusion, the District Court found that Travelers bears the burden of proving that it applies. Travelers argues, instead, that the District Court should have concluded that the \u201cexpected nor intended\u201d language provides a grant of coverage and that Ribi, as the insured seeking coverage, must prove that the damages arising from its disposal of hazardous wastes were \u201cneither expected nor intended.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\">\u00b620 The definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d clearly constitutes an inseparable element of the CGL policy\u2019s insuring agreement, specifying a number of factors that must be present for coverage to exist. Under the CGL policy\u2019s definition of \u201coccurrence,\u201d Ribi could establish coverage only if the property damage arising from its disposal of hazardous wastes had occurred unexpectedly or unintentionally. To interpret the \u201cneither expected nor intended\u201d language otherwise would force the insurer to provide coverage unconditionally for any claims and under any circumstances until it could discover independently evidence of damages caused by the insured. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Ex-Cell-O Corp. </em>(E.D. Mich. 1988), 702 F. Supp. 1317, 1328. Thus, on the face of the CGL policy, and under the rule discussed below (\u00b6 29, infra) that the insured initially must prove a loss stemming from an \u201coccurrence\u201d of the type included in the general coverage provision, the burden would be upon Ribi to prove that its claim arose from facts that came within the CGL policy\u2019s definition of \u201coccurrence.\u201d We conclude, therefore, that the District Court improperly determined that the \u201cneither expected nor intended\u201d language in the CGL policy constitutes an exclusion. This conclusion alone, however, does not bar coverage for Ribi; it merely imposes on it the burden of establishing an \u201coccurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b621 The CGL policy\u2019s core provision defines \u201coccurrence\u201d by reference to those accidents or conditions that result in damage that was \u201cneither expected nor intended.\u201d This provision contains no temporal component and focuses instead on the insured\u2019s expectations regarding damages. Thus, acts that take place over a significant period of time, but cause unexpected damage fall within the definition of an \u201coccurrence\u201d and are entitled to coverage. <em>Millers Mut. Ins. Co. v. Strainer </em>(1983), 204 Mont. 162, 663 P.2d 338 <em>overruled on other grounds </em>(holding that intentional acts do not exclude coverage under the \u201coccurrence\u201d language unless the injury was expected or intended).</p>\n<p id=\"ALZ-\">\u00b622 Here the District Court found that Ribi clearly intended to dispose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>hazardous wastes at BVSL for an extended period of time. The court found, however, that the parties disputed whether Ribi intended or expected damage from this intentional discharge. Given this disagreement and the fact that the resulting damages must be viewed from the insured\u2019s standpoint, we will assume for our purposes that an \u201coccurrence\u201d took place and coverage existed. <em>Phalen, </em>182 Mont, at 455, 597 P.2d at 724. This assumption transforms our inquiry into whether the pollution exclusion clause in the CGL policy eliminates coverage for damages arising out of the intentional disposal of hazardous wastes into or upon the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\n<em>B. Pollution Exclusion and its \u201cSudden and Accidental\u201d Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AxP\">\u00b623 A separate pollution exclusion in the CGL policy restricts the otherwise broad sweep of \u201coccurrence.\u201d It provides that the policy does not apply to property damages arising out of the disposal of hazardous wastes into or upon the land. The pollution exclusion clause\u2019s general thrust disavows any obligations by Travelers to provide coverage in cases such as this where Ribi\u2019s disposal of hazardous wastes caused the damages. The pollution exclusion would proscribe Travelers\u2019s coverage if we stopped here because Ribi\u2019s hazardous wastes undoubtedly contaminated neighboring soil and groundwater.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u00b624 In this case, however, the CGL policy\u2019s pollution exclusion contains an important exception. This exception states that the exclusion does not apply if the disposal is \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d In other words, the pollution exclusion eliminates claims from coverage unless the claim arises from the disposal of hazardous wastes deemed to be \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d Travelers contends that \u201csudden\u201d includes a temporal element within the CGL policy\u2019s context that must be applied to Ribi\u2019s disposal of hazardous wastes.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\u00b625 In <em>Sokolowski v. American West Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 93, 294 Mont. 210, 980 P.2d 1043, we discussed the meaning <em>of </em>a similar \u201csudden and accidental\u201d provision in a homeowner\u2019s policy. There we concluded that the gradual accumulation of soot and smoke on the walls, ceiling and floor of the insured\u2019s home caused by prolonged burning of candles during the holiday season did not constitute a \u201csudden\u201d release of pollutants. <em>Sokolowski, </em>\u00b6 17. We focused on the fact that the unambiguous language of the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d exception in a pollution exclusion clause in a homeowner\u2019s policy contains a temporal element. <em>Sokolowski, </em>\u00b6 15. We noted that the very use of the two words \u201csudden\u201d and \u201caccidental\u201d reveals a clear intent to define them to state two separate requirements. <em>Sokolowski, </em>\u00b6 15. In other words, the word \u201csudden,\u201d even if it includes the concept of unexpectedness, also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>encompasses a temporal element, because the word \u201caccidental\u201d already expresses \u201cunexpectedness.\u201d <em>Sokolowski, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">\u00b626 Thus, we concluded that in order for the word \u201csudden\u201d to have significant purpose, and not to be surplusage when used generally in conjunction with the word \u201caccidental,\u201d it must have a temporal aspect to its meaning, and not merely a sense of something unexpected. <em>Sokolowski, </em>\u00b6 15. Further, recognizing our duty to interpret the contract as a whole, the failure to show one condition, i.e., suddenness, negates the exception to the pollution exclusion resulting in no coverage under the insurance policy. <em>Sokolowski, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing \u00a7 28-3-202, MCA). We now extend <em>Sokolowski\u2019s </em>holding to the standard pollution exclusion in a CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b627 Ribi suggests that we should consider the drafting history of the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d pollution exclusion to determine its meaning. Extrinsic evidence may be used as an aid in interpreting contract provisions, however, only when the language contained therein is ambiguous. Section 28-2-905, MCA. We have declared identical policy language in <em>Sokolowski </em>to be unambiguous, and, therefore, we deem it unnecessary to consider Ribi\u2019s arguments pertaining to the drafting history of the CGL policy\u2019s pollution exclusion clause. <em>Sokolowski, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\n<em>C. Burden of Proof</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b628 Now that we have determined that the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d exception to the pollution exclusion contains a temporal element, we must address an issue of first impression: which party bears the burden of proving that an exception to an exclusion applies, such as the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d exception at issue here. We agree with Travelers that the insured bears the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u00b629  Courts generally allocate the respective burdens of proof to the insured and insurer consistent with the basic distinction between coverage clauses and exclusionary clauses. The insured must prove in the first place a loss stemming from an \u201coccurrence\u201d of the type included in the general coverage provision. <em>See, e.g., MacKinnion v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(Cal. 2003), 73 P.3d 1205, 1213. In turn, the insurer has the burden of proving the applicability of an exclusionary clause, such as the pollution exclusion. <em>See, e.g., United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty </em>(D. Kan. 1990), 734 F. Supp. 437, 442; <em>Keggi v. Northbrook Property and Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(Ariz. 2000), 13 P.3d 785, 788. We agree with those courts that have allocated the initial burden to the insured to establish that the claim falls within the basic scope of coverage and shifted to the insurer the burden to establish that the claim specifically is excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>\u00b630 We now turn to the third and final step in the process. Although courts remain split on the issue, the majority return the burden of proving an exception to an exclusion to the insured. For example, in <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. v. Warwick Dyeing Corp. </em>(1st Cir. 1994), 26 F.3d 1195, 1200, the court held that the insured who disposed of various waste materials at a landfill bore the burden of proving that an exception to the pollution exclusion applied. Likewise the court in <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund, </em>702 F. Supp. at 1328, determined that the insured carries the burden of proving the exception to the pollution exclusion because the insured possess the information pertaining to its activities. This allocation appropriately aligns the burden with the benefit as the party seeking the benefit of a particular policy provision bears the burden of proving its application. <em>See Intel Corp. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1991), 952 F.2d 1551, 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u00b631 The CGL policy\u2019s \u201csudden and accidental\u201d exception creates coverage for environmental contamination where it otherwise would not exist. Correspondingly, the insured bears the burden of proving that the coverage stems from this exception: \u201c[Wjhen a policy contains an exception within an exception, the insurer need not negative the internal exception; rather, the [insured] must show that the exception from the exemption from liability applies.\u201d 19 G. Couch, <em>Couch on Insurance 2d </em>\u00a7 79.385, 338 (1983). Further, if the burden were on the insurer to disprove the exception, the insured would have no incentive to discover whether its disposed wastes gradually were migrating into neighboring groundwater, because \u201cpreservation of ignorance would increase the likelihood of insurance <em>coverage.\u201d Aeroquip Corp. v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1994), 26 F.3d 893, 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b632  The District Court relied on <em>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. The Superior Court of Santa Clara </em>(Cal. 1998), 75 Cal. Rptr.2d 54, for the proposition that the insurer has the burden of making an affirmative showing in a summary judgment motion that the insured cannot establish that the claims fall within the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d exception to the pollution exclusion. <em>Travelers </em>is not persuasive here. Forcing the insurer to prove a negative-that the discharge was not all sudden and accidental-seems unfair where the insured solely possesses the relevant information pertaining to its activities. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund, </em>702 F. Supp. at 1328. By contrast, it would impose an undue burden on the insurer to require it to discover independently evidence of an insured\u2019s sudden and accidental disposal of pollutants. We conclude that Ribi had the burden of proving that its disposal of hazardous wastes into the groundwater of neighboring property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>owners was \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\">\n<em>D. Relevant Event Under the \u201cSudden and Accidental\u201d Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AVx\">\u00b633 Next, we must consider whether the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d exception of the CGL policy\u2019s pollution exclusion focuses on Ribi\u2019s initial disposal of the hazardous wastes or on the subsequent migration of these wastes away from the disposal site and the corresponding damage. Ribi maintains that the ultimate migration of its wastes into the groundwater constitutes the relevant event under the CGL policy\u2019s pollution exclusion rather than its intentional disposal of them into the landfill.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b634 Other courts have taken the opposite approach. For instance, the court in <em>LaFarge Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Co. </em>(11th Cir. 1997), 118 F.3d 1511, held that under Florida law, it is actual discharge, not resulting damages or contamination, that must be \u201csudden and accidental\u201d in order to fall within the exception to the pollution exclusion clause in comprehensive general liability policies. As discussed previously, basic coverage under the CGL policy arises from the occurrence of unintended damages. <em>See </em>\u00b6 22. And the CGL policy generally excludes from basic coverage those damages that arise from the disposal of hazardous wastes. <em>See </em>\u00b6 23. An important exception to the pollution exclusion exists, however, for those discharges that are \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u00b635 We determine that the language of the CGL policy\u2019s pollution exclusion clearly excludes coverage for \u201cproperty damage arising out of the <em>discharge\u201d </em>of hazardous wastes \u201cinto or upon the land\u201d unless \u201csuch <em>discharge </em>... is sudden and accidental.\u201d (Emphasis added). The occurrence that must be sudden and accidental then, is the disposal of hazardous wastes \u201cinto or upon the land\u201d from which the property damage arose, not the unexpected migration and corresponding damages. <em>See, e.g., Warwick, </em>26 F.3d at 1203 (under Rhode Island law, initial disposal of waste at landfill site was relevant discharge that had to be sudden and accidental for coverage to exist under exception to pollution exclusion clause in general liability policy; release of pollutants from landfill into surrounding environment was not relevant discharge); <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Duro Bag Mfg. Co. </em>(6th Cir. 1995), 50 F.3d 370, 373 (holding under Kentucky law that coverage barred insured\u2019s depositing of drums and fiberboard barrels containing ink and glue at landfill, when the disposal took place on regular basis or in ordinary course of business).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b636  To hold otherwise eliminates the distinction between unintentional and unexpected <em>disposal </em>and unintentional and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>unexpected migration and corresponding <em>damages. </em>The court in <em>Queen City Farms, Inc. v. Central Nat. Ins. Co. of Omaha </em>(Wash. 1994), 882 P.2d 703, blurred this distinction when it held that <em>\u201cif </em>the damage results from the dispersal of materials into the groundwater from a place of containment where the insured believed they would remain or from which they would be safely filtered, and that dispersal was unexpected or unintended, then coverage is provided under the policies.\u201d <em>Queen City Farms, </em>882 P.2d at 725. We determine instead, that whether the insured intended the hazardous wastes to migrate into the groundwater and cause damage after the intentional disposal into the land proves irrelevant. The disposal must be sudden and accidental to qualify for coverage, not the migration and corresponding damage. Even were we to apply the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d exception to the ultimate migration of the wastes, in contradiction to our holding today, the migration was not abrupt or quick, only unintentional. We conclude, therefore, that the initial disposal, rather than the migration and any resulting damages, must be \u201csudden and accidental\u201d in order to fall within the exception to the CGL policy\u2019s pollution exclusion clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b637 [5] Here Ribi intentionally disposed of hazardous wastes at the BVSL site over a three-year period. If, as we have held, the term \u201csudden\u201d constitutes both an \u201cabrupt\u201d and a \u201cquick\u201d discharge, then without question disposing contaminants into or upon the land for a period of three years cannot be construed as \u201csudden.\u201d Indeed, Ribi\u2019s employees transported containers of waste to BVSL each month and poured the liquid contaminants into an open, unlined, earthen pit that measured six feet deep, four feet wide, and eight feet long. Ribi\u2019s intentional disposal of hazardous wastes represents the relevant event and not the later migration of hazardous wastes from the landfill into the groundwater and neighboring property. Ribi\u2019s disposal of hazardous wastes into BVSL cannot be construed either as accidental or unexpected, and, therefore, the District Court correctly concluded that the CGL policy\u2019s pollution exclusion barred coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b638 Whether the District Court erred in determining Travelers had no duty to defend Ribi against claims brought by third-parties for cleanup costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u00b639 Ribi argues Travelers owed it a duty to defend against the third-party suits that alleged liability potentially covered by the CGL policy. Moreover, Ribi contends that Travelers\u2019s declaratory judgment action forced the District Court to consider two issues of first impression and such legal uncertainty on its own gives rise to a duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>\u00b640 We apply the \u201cfour-corners\u201d rule as the policy\u2019s language determines an insurer\u2019s duty to defend its insured. <em>City of Bozeman v. AIU Insurance Co. </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 370, 377, 865 P.2d 268, 272 (\u201ca liability insurer has no duty to defend an action against its insured when the claim or complaint clearly falls outside the scope of the policy\u2019s coverage\u201d). The acts giving rise to the claim form the basis for coverage, not any legal theories contained in the underlying complaint. <em>See New Hampshire Ins. Group v. Strecker </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 478, 481, 798 P.2d 130, 132 (holding that coverage could not be premised upon theories of negligence in the underlying complaint where based upon numerous acts of molestation that could not be deemed negligent acts). Simply put, if the asserted claim is not covered by the policy, then the insurer has no duty to defend the insured. <em>Insured Titles, Inc. v. McDonald </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 111, 116, 911 P.2d 209, 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\">\u00b641 The acts giving rise to the claims against Ribi are not in dispute. The third-party suits alleged that Ribi intentionally disposed of hazardous wastes at BVSL. Thus, Travelers did not need to resolve any factual disputes in analyzing its duty to defend. These circumstances differ, therefore, from those in <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Staples, </em>2004 MT 108, \u00b6 24, 321 Mont. 99, \u00b6 24, 90 P.3d 381, \u00b6 24, where we held that an insurer could not look to facts developed outside the policy language and the pleadings in analyzing its duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b642  As discussed previously, intentional disposal cannot be considered \u201caccidental\u201d under the exception to the CGL\u2019s pollution exclusion. <em>See </em>\u00b6 26; <em>see also Sokolowski, </em>\u00b6 15. Further, Ribi\u2019s continued disposal over several years cannot be construed as \u201csudden\u201d under the pollution exclusion. <em>See </em>\u00b6 26; <em>see also Sokolowski, </em>\u00b6 15. The CGL policy bars coverage for the asserted claims because Ribi\u2019s intentional and repeated acts gave rise to the third-party suits. Accordingly, as no coverage existed, Travelers had no duty to defend Ribi. <em>Insured Titles, Inc., </em>275 Mont, at 116, 911 P.2d at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b643 Ribi contends nevertheless that certain of Travelers\u2019s defenses present issues of first impression in Montana thereby forcing Travelers to provide a defense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u00b644 The Alaska Supreme Court has concluded that the lack of court review of specific policy language proves insufficient on its own to create a possibility of coverage that requires a defense. <em>Makarka v. Great American Ins. Co., </em>(Alaska 2000), 14 P.3d 964, 970. In <em>Makarka, </em>the insured sustained injuries in a collision arising from an earlier negligent brake repair. Although the insured had cancelled her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>coverage before the accident, she argued it remained in effect due to the fact that the faulty brake repair work took place during the policy period. The insured based her claims on language in the policy that allowed for recovery on injuries \u201cto which this insurance applies.\u201d The insurer denied coverage based on the fact that the occurrence date of her injuries fell outside of coverage. The Alaska Supreme Court held insurers who accurately interpret their policies and give the insured timely notice of refusal need not provide a defense merely because a court has yet to interpret that particular policy language. <em>See Makarka, </em>14 P.3d at 970.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b645  We similarly conclude the District Court properly determined that Travelers had no duty to defend Ribi against claims brought by third-parties for cleanup costs. Travelers responded to Ribi\u2019s demand for defense and indemnity with three different reservation of rights letters. Travelers denied coverage in each, statingits investigation and participation in the defense under the policies took place under a continuing reservation of rights to decline coverage at a later time. Travelers eventually denied the claims when its investigation revealed Ribi intentionally had disposed of the hazardous wastes. Travelers\u2019s denial letters assessed Ribi\u2019s claim for injury and accurately explained that the injury occurred outside of the CGL policy\u2019s scope. Thus, the District Court correctly rejected Ribi\u2019s claim that the novelty of Travelers\u2019s defense on its own triggered a duty to provide a defense to the third-party suits. <em>Makarka, </em>14 P.3d at 970.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b646 Whether the District Court erred in determining that Travelers may recoup its defense costs expended on Ribi\u2019s behalf for those claims that the District Court ultimately determined were barred by the CGL policy\u2019s pollution exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\u00b647 Although the District Court initially denied Travelers\u2019s recoupment costs for the neighboring property owners\u2019 suit, it later amended its order to include these costs in addition to the costs expended in the government suits it awarded earlier. Ribi argues that an insurer may not extinguish its duty to defend \u201cpotentially covered\u201d claims retroactively and that Travelers thereby waived its recoupment rights when its reservation on March 10, 1999, came five years after the initial tender of the third-party suits. Ribi further argues that Travelers\u2019s reservation letters proved ineffective because it never expressly accepted the reservation and thus Travelers may not recoup its defense costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\u00b648 Travelers, on the other hand, contends that we should follow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>decisions from other jurisdictions that allow an insurer to recover defense costs when the insurer had no duty to defend. The court in <em>Grinnell Mut. Reinsurance Co. v. Shierk </em>(S.D. Ill. 1998), 996 F. Supp. 836, reviewed cases from other jurisdictions for guidance in deciding whether an insurer could recover defense costs in an assault claim when it had no duty to defend under a homeowner\u2019s policy. The court in <em>Grinnell </em>determined that to be entitled to reimbursement, an insurer must: (1) specifically reserve the right to seek reimbursement from the insured; and (2) provide the insured with adequate notice of this potential reimbursement. <em>Grinell, </em>996 F. Supp. at 839. The court held that the insured had accepted the benefit of the insurer\u2019s defense and was fully appraised that the insurer reserved its right to seek reimbursement in the event that it was later determined that it had no duty to defend the insured. <em>Grinell, </em>996 F. Supp. at 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\">\u00b649 Similarly, in <em>United Nat. Ins. Co. v. SST Fitness Corp. </em>(6th Cir. 2002), 309 F.3d 914, the court held that an insurer may recover defense costs when the insurer did not have a duty to defend any of the asserted claims under a general liability policy where the insurer: (1) timely and explicitly reserved the right to recoup the costs; and (2) provided specific and adequate notice to the insured of the possibility of reimbursement. <em>United, </em>309 F.3d at 921. The court determined a reservation of rights proves enforceable where an insurer meets these conditions even absent an express agreement by the insured. <em>United, </em>309 F.3d at 921; <em>see also Colony Insurance Co v. G&amp;E Tires &amp; Service, Inc. </em>(Fla. Cir. 2000), 777 So.2d 1034, 1039 <em>citing </em>RESTATEMENT (SECOND) Of Contracts \u00a7 69 (1981) (\u201c[a] party cannot accept tendered performance while unilaterally altering the material terms on which it is offered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b650  We likewise conclude the District Court properly determined that Travelers may recoup its defense costs expended on Ribi\u2019s behalf for those claims outside the CGL policy\u2019s pollution exclusion provision. Travelers timely and explicitly reserved its right to recoup defense costs when it notified Ribi of the reservation prior to the payment of the defense costs in letters dated February 10, 1994, for the neighboring property owners\u2019 suit and January 25, 1996, and March 10, 1999, for the state and federal government claims respectively. Travelers expressly reserved its right to recoup defense costs if a court determined that it had no duty to provide such costs. Travelers also provided specific and adequate notice of the possibility of reimbursement. Ribi implicitly accepted Traveler\u2019s defense under a reservation of rights when it posed no objections. Under these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>circumstances, the District Court appropriately concluded that Travelers may recoup its defense costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b651 Whether the District Court erred in ordering Travelers to pay attorneys\u2019 fees that Ribi incurred in litigating pre-trial discovery motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b652 Finally, Travelers argues in its cross-appeal that the District Court improperly awarded Ribi attorneys\u2019 fees to sanction Travelers for refusing to produce drafting history relating to the CGL\u2019s pollution exclusion. Travelers moved for a protective order on the basis of our holding in <em>Sokolowski </em>that \u201csudden and accidental\u201d was unambiguous as a matter of law and included a temporal component. Travelers maintains that it sought the protective order to avoid the costs associated with searching for and producing the voluminous drafting history regarding the pollution exclusion. The District Court denied Travelers\u2019s motion and ordered Travelers to pay Ribi\u2019s fees incurred in litigating the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u00b653 Travelers asked the District Court to reconsider its award of fees relating to the protective order after the District Court ultimately determined on summary judgment that the CGL policy\u2019s pollution exclusion\u2019s language was unambiguous and thereby rendered extrinsic evidence inadmissible. Travelers argued that fees are warranted under Rule 37(a)(4), M.R.Civ.P., only if the losing party\u2019s position was not \u201csubstantially justified\u201d and the District Court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment verified the justification for its earlier motion for a protective order. The District Court concluded, however, that Travelers\u2019s concerns of costs related to searching for and producing the drafting history were not appropriate matters for a protective order during discovery, and thus, were not substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">\u00b654 The trial court has discretion to control discovery and determine from the circumstances of the case whether the parties have complied with discovery requests. <em>In re H.D. </em>(1992), 256 Mont. 70, 77, 844 P.2d 114, 119. We will reverse that determination only if the substantial rights of the opposing party have been so materially affected as to allow a possible miscarriage of justice. <em>In re H.D., </em>256 Mont, at 77, 844 P.2d at 119. A court may award costs under Rule 37(a)(4), M.R.Civ.P., for expenses incurred in relation to litigating motions for a protective order. If the motion is denied, the court shall require the moving party to pay the opposing party \u201cthe reasonable expenses incurred in opposing the motion, including attorney fees, unless the court finds that the making of the motion was substantially justified ....\u201d Rule 37(a)(4), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>\u00b655 We agree with the District Court that Ribi should have been allowed to discover the drafting history of the CGL policy\u2019s pollution exclusion and that Travelers, as the party seeking protection, failed to show good cause for its omission. Although the issues were ultimately adjudged in its favor, Travelers was not substantially justified seeking a protective order at the time due to the substantial case law relying on the drafting history in interpreting the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d clause and its potential relevancy in aiding the court\u2019s determination. <em>See, e.g., Textron v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>(R.I. 2000), 754 A.2d 742, 751 (holding that the drafting history of the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d exception to the pollution exclusion clause of a CGL policy facilitated an interpretation of \u201csudden\u201d to include unexpected); <em>Nestle Food Corp. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>(D. N.J. 1990) 135 F.R.D. 101, 104-105 (holding that the drafting history of operative language from a general liability policy is discoverable when ambiguity in policy has not been resolved); <em>Morton Intern, Inc. v. General Acc. Ins. Co. of America </em>(N.J. 1993), 629 A.2d 831, 847-48 (holding that the pollution exclusion\u2019s drafting and regulatory history enhanced a fuller understanding of the meaning of its terms). Further, the District Court found Travelers\u2019s systematic obstruction during discovery \u201cclearly and unequivocally stonewalling,\u201d and intentionally sought to prevent the discovery of potentially relevant material.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\">\u00b656  The record reveals the District Court administered the discovery process fairly. Thus, we conclude that the District Court exercised appropriate discretion in controlling discovery and did not violate Travelers\u2019s rights in compelling discovery and awarding fees. <em>In re H.D., </em>256 Mont, at 77, 844 P.2d at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b657 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b217-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON, WARNER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
