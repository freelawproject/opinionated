We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in dismissing MWC\u2019s action because it did not exhaust its administrative remedies?</p>\n<p id=\"b443-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">\u00b64 This action arises out of the efforts of MWC to cease providing water service to a subdivision developed by Circle H in the Missoula <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>area. In 1994 Circle H proposed to develop 78 lots. MWC agreed to provide water service to these lots pursuant to the rules and regulations of PSC and DEQ. DEQ approved Circle H\u2019s water system design. In 1997 Circle H applied to DEQ for approval of a new water system design intended to provide water for a modified subdivision proposal with more lots. DEQ approved this proposal, but specified that construction of the system had to commence within two years. In 1999 DEQ approved a time-extension for the construction of this new system, but mandated that the construction of the water system had to be completed by November 22,2002. On January 26,2000, Circle H applied to DEQ for approval of an interim water system to provide water for five lots while construction of the approved water system was being completed. DEQ approved this request March 27, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b65 On April 25, 2000, Circle H requested a two-inch commercial service from MWC, from an existing water main, for a commercial building on the outskirts of the Circle H Ranch. MWC granted Circle H\u2019s request. Since this time, Circle H has apparently been using this source of water to supply water to the entire subdivision. Circle H.has never completed construction of the DEQ approved water system, and the time to complete it has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b66 Circle H now has proposed another subdivision on its land. MWC has declined to agree to supply water for this new development. Circle H contends MWC is legally obligated to help it secure approval of its new subdivision and demands that MWC represent to DEQ that it will provide water to the new subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u00b67 MWC filed this action seeking a <em>declaratory </em>judgment that it may cease providing water to the various Circle H subdivisions, as well as injunctive relief, seeking, in essence, a reprieve from having to provide water to the various Circle H subdivisions. The District Court dismissed MWC\u2019s Complaint concluding it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case because MWC had not exhausted its administrative remedies. MWC appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">\u00b68  The decision to dismiss a complaint for declaratory relief is within the sound discretion of the district court and this Court will not disturb that decision absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Northfield Ins. Co. v. Montana Assn. of Counties, </em>2000 MT 256, \u00b6 8, 301 Mont. 472, \u00b6 8, 10 P.3d 813, \u00b6 8 (citation omitted). However, this Court reviews the conclusions upon which such a dismissal is based, which in this case is the District Court\u2019s determination it lacked subject matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>jurisdiction, to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Art v. Mont. Dept. of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>2002 MT 327, \u00b6 9, 313 Mont. 197, \u00b6 9, 60 P.3d 958, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err in dismissing MWC\u2019s action because it did not exhaust its administrative remedies?</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b610 MWC does not dispute that both DEQ and PSC have regulatory jurisdiction over the issues alleged in its Complaint. MWC\u2019s argument is that the District Court incorrectly dismissed its Complaint because it has no adequate remedy at the administrative level, and therefore has not failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. It asserts that since Circle H\u2019s alleged violations involve two administrative agencies, DEQ and PSC, a declaratory ruling issued by either agency cannot address matters which are within the jurisdiction of the other. Thus, MWC argues, if it were to proceed with a contested case hearing through each respective agency, upon review of those separate agency decisions in district court, the district court could only bind one agency, and not both, with each decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u00b611 MWC asserts that only a district court judgment, naming all agencies involved as well as Circle H, can bind the agencies and a third party to the same course of action. Additionally, MWC argues that since there are no factual issues in this case, the underlying purpose of the exhaustion doctrine, to ensure a factual foundation is of record, is not served by requiring MWC to exhaust its administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u00b612 Circle H argues MWC is not excused from the requirement that it exhaust its administrative remedies simply because it alleges a single administrative process may not provide a complete remedy for issues involving more than one agency. Circle H maintains that MWC must exhaust the separate remedies available through PSC and DEQ because there is no exception to the exhaustion doctrine for matters involving multiple agencies. Circle H denies MWC\u2019s contention there are no issues of fact for the agency determination, pointing to MWC\u2019s allegations in its Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">\u00b613 Defendants PSC and DEQ advance similar arguments as those raised by Circle H and assert that our decision in <em>Brisendine v. Department of Commerce, Bd. of Dentistry </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 361, 833 P.2d 1019, is controlling. MWC disputes the applicability <em>ofBrisendine, </em>arguing that it would be futile to proceed with agency contested cases.</p>\n<p id=\"ASE\">\u00b614  Generally, before a party can seek declaratory relief in district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>court, it must exhaust its administrative remedies. <em>Brisendine, </em>253 Mont, at 366, 833 P.2d at 1021-22. By filing a declaratory judgment action in district court before exhausting its administrative remedies, MWC seeks to skip the administrative process. This constitutes an unwarranted intrusion into PSC and DEQ\u2019s regulatory authority granted under \u00a7 69-1-102, <em>et seq., </em>MCA, and \u00a7 75-6-101, <em>et seq., </em>MCA, respectively. Such a practice is not permitted. <em>Brisendine, </em>253 at 365, 833 P.2d at 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u00b615 In <em>DeVoe v. Department of Revenue </em>(1993), 263 Mont. 100, 866 P.2d 228, we held that when Plaintiff DeVoe had attempted to exhaust his administrative remedies but, because of the particular administrative rules and statutes involved, he was unable to obtain relief, it would be a useless act to require him to continue on in the administrative process. We noted that the law did not require useless acts. <em>DeVoe, </em>263 Mont, at 115, 866 P.2d at 238; \u00a7 1-3-223, MCA. However, in this case MWC has neither attempted to exhaust its administrative remedies, nor has it alleged facts that if proven would show the futility of the available administrative remedies. It has only speculated that the two agencies might issue conflicting opinions which would not be binding on each other, but leave it in an untenable position. This untested possibility does not lead to the conclusion that it would be futile to secure an administrative remedy from either, or both, PSC or DEQ.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b616  The courts generally will not require exhaustion of administrative remedies when recourse to an administrative remedy would be futile. However, the mere possibility of an adverse decision does not mean that resort to an administrative agency is futile. 73 C.J.S. <em>Public Administrative Law &amp; Procedure, </em>\u00a7 91 (2004). Likewise, the mere possibility that PSC and DEQ might render decisions that could in some degree conflict with each other, does not justify bypassing the agencies altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b617 The parties do not dispute that both agencies, independent of one another, have the authority and the ability to provide MWC the relief it seeks. We decline to discard the expertise and the fact-finding mechanisms of administrative agencies based on speculation that they will render irreconcilable decisions. The agencies involved can be made aware of what is being asked of each of them, and it can be anticipated they will cooperate to reach a harmonious result, rather than enter decisions that will be irreconcilable. <em>Cf. Pennsylvania v. Interstate Commerce Com. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1977), 561 F.2d 278, 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u00b618  The District Court did not err when it dismissed MWC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, holding MWC must first exhaust its administrative remedies, and then if it is dissatisfied, seek judicial review. <em>Gilpin v. State </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 37, 39, 812 P.2d 1265, 1266-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\">\u00b619 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b447-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
