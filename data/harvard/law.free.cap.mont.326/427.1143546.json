We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">\u00b62 On appeal, we address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-15\">\u00b63 1. Is Carter\u2019s appeal properly before this Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-16\">\u00b64 2. In a criminal trial for DUI, is the Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses implicated when the State introduces a certification report for a breath analysis instrument without also providing the author of the report for cross-examination?</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b65 Carter was driving through Great Falls on May 14,2002, when he was pulled over by Officer Michael Reddick of the Montana Highway Patrol. Officer Reddick stopped Carter after seeing him drive recklessly near a group of pedestrians. When Carter exited his vehicle, Officer Reddick noticed the odor of alcohol on him. Because Reddick was about to go off duty, he turned the matter over to Officer Robert Armstrong of the Montana Highway Patrol, who had also observed Carter\u2019s reckless driving. Armstrong also noticed the smell of alcohol on Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b66 Carter was arrested after he failed the field sobriety tests administered by Officer Armstrong. Carter consented to a breath alcohol test, which was administered with the Intoxilizer 5000. The test registered a result of .210. Carter was charged with one count of misdemeanor DUI, one count of misdemeanor failure to carry proof of liability insurance, and one count of misdemeanor driving with a suspended license. After a jury trial in Cascade County Justice Court on July 23, 2002, Carter was convicted on all three counts. Carter appealed to the District Court. Subsequently, the charge of driving with a suspended license was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b67 At Carter\u2019s District Court jury trial on May 29, 2003, the State introduced three certification reports in order to demonstrate that the Intoxilizer 5000 was working properly when it was used to test Carter. First, the State introduced two weekly field certification reports. One was prepared by Deputy Troy Leasure, of the Cascade County Sheriffs Department. The other was prepared by Deputy Kenneth Wienheimer, also of the Cascade County Sheriffs Department. Then, the State introduced the yearly certification report prepared by Benny Better of the Montana State Crime Lab. After testifying that he was the senior operator for the Intoxilizer 5000, Deputy Leasure testified that each of these reports indicated that the machine had tested within the acceptable range for certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u00b68 Carter objected to the admission of the weekly field certification report prepared by Deputy Wienheimer, arguing that it was hearsay because Wienheimer was not present to testify. Carter also objected to the admission of the yearly certification report prepared by the Montana State Crime Lab, arguing that it was hearsay because the author was not present to testify. Finally, Carter objected to the admission of the Montana State Crime Lab report on the grounds that the State had failed to provide the necessary foundation. In support of this objection, Carter argued the State needed to demonstrate that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>author fully understood the inner workings of the Intoxilizer 5000. The District Court admitted both reports over Carter\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b69 Carter was convicted of misdemeanor DUI and misdemeanor failure to carry proof of liability insurance. Carter appeals his DUI conviction and requests a new trial on the grounds that the admission of the weekly and yearly certification reports is a violation of his Sixth Amendment confrontation right.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AJ-\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u00b610 <em>Is Carter\u2019s appeal properly before this Court?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\u00b611 Because Carter asserts a legal theory that was not raised at trial, the threshold issue is whether this Court should consider the merits of his argument. As noted above, Carter objected to the admission of two certification reports which the State proffered to demonstrate that the Intoxilizer 5000 was working properly when it was used to test him. One of these reports was a weekly field certification prepared by Deputy Wienheimer. The other was a yearly certification prepared by the Montana State Crime Lab. The District Court admitted both reports over Carter\u2019s hearsay objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">\u00b612 Carter\u2019s appeal focuses on these same two pieces of evidence, but he no longer stands by his original hearsay objections. Instead, he now asserts a theory that was not available to him at trial. Carter\u2019s argument is based on <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, which established a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure while Carter\u2019s case was on direct appeal before us. Carter now argues that admission of the certification reports, when the authors are not present for cross-examination, is a violation of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution pursuant to <em>Crawford. </em>Further, Carter argues that <em>Crawford </em>should be applied retroactively in his case, pursuant to <em>State v. Whitehorn, </em>2002 MT 54, 309 Mont. 63, 50 P.3d 121, and that retroactive application mandates a new trial wherein he is entitled to confront the authors of these certification reports regarding the procedures they used to maintain the Intoxilizer 5000. In response, the State suggests that we decline review of Carter\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim because his objections at trial were not based on his right of confrontation. In supporting this position, the State cites the firmly established rule that a party may not raise new arguments or change its legal theory on appeal. <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 58, \u00b6 39, 320 Mont. 211, \u00b6 39, 89 P.3d 947, \u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>\u00b613 While we generally do not consider arguments first raised on appeal, our precedent clearly establishes that review of such arguments is proper in certain circumstances. We have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\">[T]he general rule is that issues brought before this Court for the first time on appeal will not be considered. [Citation omitted.] However, this Court \u201creserves to itself the power to examine constitutional issues that involve broad public concerns to avoid future litigation on a point of law.\u201d Even if an issue is raised for the first time on appeal this Court can hear the issue \u201cif the alleged ... error affects the substantial rights of a litigant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARG\"><em>Cottrill v. Cottrill Sodding Serv. </em>(1987), 229 Mont 40, 42, 744 P.2d 895, 896 (quoting <em>Matter of N.B. </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 319, 323, 620 P.2d 1228, 1231). Due to our commitment to the general rule against raising new arguments on appeal, we do not often utilize the <em>Cottrill </em>rationale, the plain error doctrine, or other precedents which allow us to review arguments first raised on appeal. However, our commitment to that general rule does not negate our overriding obligation to acknowledge and protect the substantial rights of litigants. This overriding obligation is well reflected in the firmly established <em>Cottrill </em>exception to the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b6 14 Other precedent issued from this Court provides further rationale for departing from the general rule in certain circumstances. In <em>Kudrna v. Comet Corp. </em>(1977), 175 Mont. 29, 572 P.2d 183, we considered an issue that was not raised below, noting that by doing so we did not repudiate the requirement that timely and specific objections be raised at trial. We observed that \u201c[i]f the court were limited to the arguments and reasoning of counsel in its decisions of cases, to the exclusion of its own observations, many cases would lead us far from what we understand to be the true object of the court.\u201d <em>Kudrna, </em>175 Mont, at 51, 572 P.2d at 195 <em>(quoting Big Creek Stone Co. v. Seward </em>(Ind. 1896), 43 N.E. 5, 5). We also stated that \u201c[w]here resort to the record is necessary, the case will be determined by the record, and in such a case the court will not regard itself as bound down to the conceptions of counsel on either side as to the nature of the controlling facts.\u201d <em>Kudrna, </em>175 Mont, at 51, 572 P.2d at 195 (quoting <em>Cleveland, Cine., Chic. &amp; St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Moore </em>(Ind. 1908), 84 N.E. 540, 540). Hence, it is evident that in the same way which we are not bound to render decisions based solely on the reasoning offered by appellate counsel, our review is not necessarily restricted by trial counsel\u2019s failure to preserve a specification of error for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b615 We have previously encountered an appeal similar to the one we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>face here. In <em>State v. Hardy </em>(1980), 185 Mont. 130, 604 P.2d 792, the defendant contested for the first time on appeal a jury instruction given at his trial because that instruction was later declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court. <em>Hardy, 185 </em>Mont, at 137, 604 P.2d at 797. Because the instruction was declared unconstitutional while the defendant\u2019s appeal was pending, we reviewed the defendant\u2019s argument even though it was not raised at trial. <em>Hardy, </em>185 Mont, at 137-38, 604 P.2d at 797. <em>Hardy </em>thus provides a basis for considering an argument first raised on appeal where that argument is based on a new constitutional rule of criminal law established during the appeal. Here, Carter\u2019s predicament is similar to that of the defendant in <em>Hardy, </em>in that Carter had no opportunity to make a timely confrontation argument based on <em>Crawford </em>because that case was decided more than nine months after his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b616 Returning to the <em>Cottrill </em>exception, we note that it is well established by its use in recent years to justify review of constitutional claims not raised at the lower court. In <em>Eastman v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 332, 337, 777 P.2d 862, 865, we invoked the exception to review two untimely constitutional challenges to the Occupational Disease Act. More recently, in <em>In the Petition to Transfer Territory, </em>2000 MT 342, \u00b6 11, 303 Mont. 204, \u00b6 11, 15 P.3d 447, \u00b6 11, we invoked the exception to consider the constitutionality of a statute giving authority to county superintendents of schools to grant or deny petitions to transfer territory among school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b617 Our review of the record in Carter\u2019s case leads us to conclude that this appeal contains the elements necessary for invoking the <em>Cottrill </em>exception. The substantial right at issue here is Carter\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him. By reviewing the merits of Carter\u2019s argument we can avoid future litigation on the issue of whether certification reports for breath testing instruments represent \u201ctestimonial\u201d hearsay which triggers the protections of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause. Finally, broad public concern is implicated by Carter\u2019s contention that the State is obligated to provide State Crime Lab personnel at DUI trials to testify regarding the certification reports. As such, we conclude that review of Carter\u2019s argument is proper pursuant to <em>Cottrill, Kudrna, </em>and <em>Hardy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b618 Finally, we observe that appellate review of Carter\u2019s argument flows logically <em>from </em>the requirements of retroactivity law. Once a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure is applied to the defendant in the case announcing the rule, evenhanded justice requires that it be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>applied retroactively to all who are similarly situated. <em>State v. Goebel, </em>2001 MT 155, \u00b6 16, 306 Mont. 83, \u00b6 16, 31 P.3d 340, \u00b6 16 (citing <em>Teague v. Lane </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 288, 300, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 1070, 103 L.Ed.2d 334). Thus, we apply new constitutional rules of criminal procedure retroactively to cases pending on direct review or not yet final on the date of the new ruling. <em>Goebel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-17 (citing <em>Griffith v. Kentucky </em>(1987), 479 U.S. 314, 326-27, 107 S.Ct. 708, 715-16, 93 L.Ed.2d 649). As noted above, <em>Crawford </em>announced a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure while Carter\u2019s case was pending on direct review before this Court. Carter argues that <em>Crawford </em>is applicable to his case and, had it been decided at the time, <em>Crawford </em>would have dictated the use of different procedures at his trial. If <em>Crawford </em>is in fact applicable here, Carter is entitled to retroactive application of the new rule established therein. Thus, to determine whether the new rule enunciated in <em>Crawford </em>should be applied retroactively in this case, we must examine Carter\u2019s argument. The <em>Cottrill </em>exception allows us to reach the merits of Carter\u2019s claim and determine whether the new rule of <em>Crawford </em>applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\u00b619  In summary, we reiterate our commitment to the general rule against raising new arguments on appeal. At the same time, however, we are compelled to take into account the unique circumstances of Carter\u2019s appeal with respect to the recent development in Confrontation Clause jurisprudence. Strict adherence to the general rule, in spite of Carter\u2019s inability to timely raise the <em>Crawford </em>argument, is not appropriate here. As we observed <em>in Kudrna, </em>such an approach could occasionally \u201clead us far from what we understand to be the true object of the court.\u201d <em>Kudrna, </em>175 Mont, at 51, 572 P.2d at 195. Ultimately, our decision to review Carter\u2019s argument harmonizes well with our previous invocations of the <em>Cottrill </em>exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b620 <em>In a criminal trial for DUI, is the Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses implicated when the State introduces a certification report for a breath analysis instrument without also providing the author of the report for cross-examination?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u00b621 In determining whether the procedure followed at Carter\u2019s trial complies with the Sixth Amendment, we address a question of constitutional law. We exercise plenary review of questions of constitutional law. <em>Pickens v. Shelton-Thompson, </em>2000 MT 131, \u00b6 7, 300 Mont. 16, \u00b6 7, 3 P.3d 603, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">\u00b622 The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d This procedural guarantee, the Confrontation Clause, applies to both federal and state prosecutions. <em>Pointer v. Texas </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 400, 406, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1069, 13 L.Ed.2d 923. The ultimate goal of the Confrontation Clause is to ensure the reliability of evidence \u201cby testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u00b623 As noted above, Carter\u2019s argument is based on <em>Crawford, </em>a case that was born out of the inherent tension between the Confrontation Clause and exceptions to the general evidentiary rule against admitting hearsay at trials. In <em>Crawford, </em>the Court overruled its prior interpretation of the Confrontation Clause established in <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374. <em>Roberts </em>held that an unavailable witness\u2019s out-of-court statement may be admitted at trial against a criminal defendant so long as it has adequate indicia of reliability-i.e., falls within a \u201cfirmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d or bears \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539. In rejecting this approach, <em>Crawford </em>observed that reliability is an amorphous concept and stated that the <em>Roberts </em>framework \u201cis so unpredictable that it fails to provide meaningful protection from core confrontation violations.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 63, 124 S.Ct. at 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"AOh\">\u00b624 In <em>Crawford, </em>the Court reviewed historical developments underlying the meaning of the Confrontation Clause and, for the first time, distinguished \u201ctestimonial\u201d and \u201cnontestimonial\u201d out-of-court statements. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. The Court held that testimonial out-of-court statements are not admissible at trial under the Confrontation Clause, unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b625 While declining to spell out a comprehensive definition of the term \u201ctestimonial,\u201d the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">Whatever else the term covers, it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations. These are the modern practices with closest kinship to the abuses at which the Confrontation Clause was directed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-7\"><em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374. The Court also observed that not all hearsay evidence implicates the Sixth Amendment\u2019s core concerns. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. Consequently, <em>Crawford </em>held that where nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>are allowed flexibility in the development of their hearsay law. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b626 In the present case, Carter requests a new trial based on <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>new interpretation of the Confrontation Clause. Specifically, Carter argues that the certification reports admitted at his trial are properly categorized as testimonial hearsay pursuant to <em>Crawford, </em>and thus, admission of such reports is a violation of the Confrontation Clause when the authors are not present for cross-examination. Further, Carter argues that because a constitutional right is at issue in this case, <em>Crawford </em>should be applied retroactively. Finally, Carter argues that retroactive application of <em>Crawford </em>requires a new trial wherein he is entitled to confront the authors of the two contested certification reports regarding the procedures they used to maintain the Intoxilizer 5000.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b627 The State contends that the procedure followed at Carter\u2019s trial was in compliance with the new ride of <em>Crawford. </em>The State\u2019s argument is based on <em>State v. Delaney, </em>1999 MT 317, 297 Mont. 263, 991 P.2d 461, a DUI case where the State introduced a yearly certification report for the Intoxilizer 5000 in order to establish foundation for the admission of breath test results. <em>Delaney, </em>\u00b6 10. The defendant in that case, Robert Delaney, argued that his constitutional right to confront witnesses was violated when the State introduced the certification report without also presenting the author of the report for cross-examination. <em>Delaney, </em>\u00b6 17. We held that Delaney had not established a violation of his confrontation right because the annual certification report was not substantive evidence used to prove the charged DUI offense, but it merely provided the foundation necessary for the admission of substantive evidence. <em>Delaney, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b628 In <em>Delaney, </em>we distinguished <em>State v. Clark, </em>1998 MT 221, 290 Mont. 479, 964 P.2d 766, wherein we held that the hearsay exception in Rule 803(8), M.R.Evid., which allowed admission of a state crime laboratory report into evidence without the testimony of the compiler of the report, was unconstitutional because it violated the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 25. Delaney relied on <em>Clark </em>in arguing that his confrontation right had been violated. <em>Delaney, </em>\u00b6 17. Delaney contended that at his trial the State had offered the annual certification report as a state crime laboratory report pursuant to language in Rule 803(6), M.R.Evid., which is identical to the portion of Rule 803(8) held unconstitutional in <em>Clark, </em>and as a result, his right to confrontation was violated in the same manner as the defendant\u2019s in that case. <em>Delaney, </em>\u00b6 17. In distinguishing <em>Clark, </em>we explained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>Delaney </em>that the evidence offered under the state crime laboratory report hearsay exception in <em>Clark </em>was a report of the chemical analysis of alleged drugs taken from the defendant when he was arrested. <em>Delaney, </em>\u00b6 18. That chemical analysis was a critical part of the substantive evidence offered by the prosecution to prove that the defendant had committed the offense of criminal possession of dangerous drugs. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 24. Thus, we concluded in <em>Clark </em>that failing to call the compiler of the chemical analysis report violated the defendant\u2019s right to confront his accusers. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 25. More importantly for this case, in <em>Delaney </em>we explained that <em>Clark </em>was distinguishable from Delaney\u2019s situation because the annual certification report used in <em>Delaney </em>was not accusatory in the same manner as the chemical analysis in <em>Clark. Delaney, </em>\u00b6 18. Finally, we concluded that because the certification report used in <em>Delaney </em>was not offered or admitted pursuant to the state crime laboratory hearsay exception, <em>Clark </em>was inapplicable. <em>Delaney, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b629 Our decision in this case turns on the issue of whether the certification reports are properly categorized as testimonial or nontestimonial evidence. Carter contends that testimonial evidence includes \u201cstatements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. Based on this definition, Carter contends that the certification reports at issue here are properly categorized as testimonial evidence because they were created for use at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b630 We observe that while <em>Crawford </em>did mention the above definition for testimonial evidence, it did so only in noting various proposed formulations of the core class of statements with which the Confrontation Clause is concerned. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. <em>Crawford </em>also mentioned the following formulations: <em>ex parte </em>in-court testimony or its functional equivalent, meaning material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially; and, extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. However, <em>Crawford </em>did not adopt any of the above definitions, and declined to articulate a precise definition for testimonial evidence. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b631 Ultimately, <em>Crawford </em>designated only four kinds of statements as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>testimonial: prior testimony given at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial, and statements gleaned from police interrogations. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374. Similarly, we will not attempt to articulate a precise definition of testimonial evidence. We will only determine whether the evidence at issue here is properly categorized as testimonial or nontestimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\u00b632  The State argues that the certification reports used at Carter\u2019s trial are nontestimonial evidence because they do not fall within the core group of statements which the Confrontation Clause was meant to address, and thus do not implicate Carter\u2019s right of confrontation. We agree. As we stated in <em>Delaney, </em>such certification reports are not substantive evidence of a particular offense, but rather are foundational evidence necessary for the admission of substantive evidence. <em>Delaney, </em>\u00b6 18. In other words, the certification reports are nontestimonial in nature in that they are foundational, rather than substantive or accusatory. In the same way that the defendant\u2019s confrontation right was not implicated in <em>Delaney, </em>Carter\u2019s confrontation right was not implicated by the use of these certification reports, despite the fact that the authors of the reports were not present to testify and be confronted.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b633  That is not to say, however, that the authors of these certification reports may never be called to testify in person. If, in a given case, the defendant\u2019s pretrial investigation reveals that the reports are in error or are otherwise subject to attack, the defendant is always free to subpoena the authors for purposes of testifying at a hearing on a timely filed motion to suppress evidence or at trial for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\u00b634  <em>Crawford </em>established that where nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, the United States Constitution affords the States flexibility in forming their hearsay law, and such evidence may be exempted from Confrontation Clause scrutiny. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374. Thus, we adhere to the rationale of <em>Delaney </em>and hold that the nontestimonial pieces of evidence at issue here, the weekly and yearly certification reports for the Intoxilizer 5000, do not implicate Carter\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation. Therefore Carter is not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\u00b635 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b463-8\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b463-9\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"AdSU\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">\u00b636 I concur in the result reached in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">\u00b637 The functional difference between the hearsay rule and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Confrontation Clause has to do with the type of out-of-court statements addressed by each. While the hearsay rule is concerned with all out-of-court statements, \u201cnot all hearsay implicates the Sixth Amendment\u2019s core concerns.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192. In <em>Crawford, </em>the United States Supreme Court explained that the Confrontation Clause is concerned with \u201ctestimonial statements\u201d made by those who are \u201cwitnesses against\u201d the accused, or those who \u201cbear testimony.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 36, 124 S. Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192. In other words, the Confrontation Clause does not reach \u201cnontestimonial\u201d hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\u00b638 In the present case, we conclude that, since certification reports are non-substantive and non-testimonial in nature, a more specific Confrontation Clause objection was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b639 I would not, however, necessarily require this degree of specificity under all circumstances. For example, in a case involving a substantive out-of-court statement against the accused, defense counsel could make a colorable argument that a hearsay objection to the statement would double as a Confrontation Clause objection, since, under those circumstances, the hearsay rule is protecting the same values as the Confrontation Clause- i.e., excluding out-of-court testimonial statements by those who bear witness against the accused.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b464-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"ADT\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">\u00b640 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s determination that Carter\u2019s appeal is properly before us. Nor do I agree with the Court that the theory now advanced was not \u201cavailable\u201d to him at trial. I would hold the appeal is not properly before us and, <em>on </em>that basis only, affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">\u00b641 As the Court properly observes, Carter\u2019s counsel asserted hearsay objections to the evidence at issue during his trial. He has now abandoned those objections and raises a new theoiy on appeal. As the Court also properly observes, we generally do not consider arguments first raised on appeal. We should follow that longstanding general rule here.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">\u00b642 Instead, the Court first begins by stating Carter\u2019s Confrontation Clause argument was not available at trial, and goes on to note that the argument is based on the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent <em>Crawford </em>decision. It is true that the <em>Crawford </em>decision was not available during Carter\u2019s trial. That does not, however, equate to the argument being unavailable. Confrontation Clause arguments pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution have been available since that Clause became applicable to the states via the Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Amendment. Equating the unavailability of a particular court decision to the unavailability of the Sixth Amendment argument simply enables counsel to neglect consideration of available constitutional challenges until such time as another lawyer has had the foresight to make such an argument in her or his case, and then piggyback onto the other lawyer\u2019s sound thinking and resulting success. I am not persuaded the Court is wise in encouraging such conduct by Montana lawyers in representing defendants in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\u00b643 Moreover, I am very concerned over how far afield the Court had to search in order to determine this appeal is properly before us. It cites to a number of \u201cways out\u201d of the general rule, such as the \u201cexceptions\u201d in the civil cases of <em>Cottrill, Kudrna, Eastman </em>and <em>Petition to Transfer. </em>The Court does not clearly point out that those were civil cases-and understandably so, since different \u201cexceptions\u201d apply in the criminal case arena.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b644 Indeed, the two most common \u201cexceptions\u201d to the general rule of no new theories on appeal in criminal cases are \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA, and the common law \u201cplain error\u201d doctrine we apply very sparingly. <em>See State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 915 P.2d 208, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 215, \u00b6 21, 19 P.3d 817, \u00b6 21. The Court does not mention these authorities for occasionally allowing a criminal defendant on appeal to raise a new theory. The reason the Court avoids these approaches, and searches out others, may be that Carter does not raise these either.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u00b645 In fairness, I note that the Court advances <em>Hardy, </em>a criminal case, as an appeal \u201csimilar\u201d to the one we face here. The Court includes only a few sweeping statements about <em>Hardy </em>in its opinion. In fact, no basis at all is set forth in <em>Hardy </em>for the decision to \u201creview th[e] alleged error\u201d raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\u00b646 The only basis on which Carter relies in requesting that he be permitted to raise the Confrontation Clause issue from <em>Crawford </em>is our decision regarding retroactivity in <em>State v. Whitehorn, </em>2002 MT 54, 309 Mont. 63, 50 P.3d 121. Again, the Court does not rest its analysis of why this appeal is properly before us on that sole case cited by Carter; one can only speculate about why. Instead, the Court advances <em>Goebel, </em>a case which predated <em>Whitehorn, </em>as support for its observation that appellate review of Carter\u2019s argument \u201cflows logically from\u201d the requirements of retroactivity. Does the Court mean that retroactivity law <em>requires </em>review of Carter\u2019s argument? If so, the Court should clearly state why that is so. If not, what precise basis is the Court advancing for its conclusion that we \u201care compelled\u201d to take into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>account the \u201cunique\u201d circumstances of the appeal before us with respect to \u201cthe recent development in Confrontation Clause jurisprudence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b647 Perhaps the broadest-and most frightening-statement the Court makes in searching for a \u201cway out\u201d in the present case is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGa\">[I]t is evident that in the same way which we are not bound to render decisions based solely on the reasoning offered by appellate counsel, our review is not necessarily restricted by trial counsel\u2019s failure to preserve a specification of error for appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmXY\">No authority is cited for this statement. But a fair reading makes it clear that the Court intends to recognize no bounds in reaching an issue it wants to reach at any time and in any case. I suspect this unsupported statement will be quoted in future cases when the Court does not wish to conduct itself within any applicable parameters.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b648 The Court having failed to set forth an adequate basis-from applicable cases-for its decision that Carter\u2019s appeal is presently before us, I dissent from its conclusion in that regard and would not address the issue raised.</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-6\">JUSTICE RICE joins in the foregoing dissenting opinion of CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
