Eustance (Eustance) requesting reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in granting Eustance\u2019s petition to reinstate his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\u00b63 On the evening of March 24, 2004, Cascade County Sheriffs Deputy Scott Wagner (Wagner) arrested Eustance for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). During the arrest procedure, Eustance refused to comply with Wagner\u2019s request that he submit to a test of his breath to determine his blood alcohol content. Consequently, the State seized and suspended Eustance\u2019s driver\u2019s license pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">\u00b64 Eustance subsequently petitioned the District Court to reinstate his driver\u2019s license on the basis that Wagner did not have reasonable grounds to believe Eustance was-and did not have probable cause to arrest him for-DUI. The District Court held a hearing on the petition at which Eustance was the only person who testified. Based on the testimony, the court concluded \u201cthere is no evidence to support that the initial stop of Eustance\u2019s vehicle was justified by particular suspicion, and no probable cause existed for Eustance\u2019s arrest.\u201d The court granted Eustance\u2019s petition to reinstate his driver\u2019s license. The State appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">\u00b65 In reviewing a district court\u2019s ruling on a petition to reinstate a driver\u2019s license, we determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law correct. <em>Muri v. State, </em>2004 MT 192, \u00b6 5, 322 Mont. 219, \u00b6 5, 95 P.3d 149, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err in granting Eustance\u2019s petition to reinstate his driver\u2019s license?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">\u00b67 Section 61-8-402(1), MCA, provides that a person who is driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle on ways of Montana open to the public is considered to have given consent to a blood or breath test. When a person who is arrested for DUI refuses to submit to such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>test, the arresting officer must seize the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license and the State must suspend the license. Section 61-8-402(4), MCA. A person whose license is seized and suspended pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA, may challenge the suspension by filing a petition in district court. Section 61-8-403(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b68 Eustance timely filed a petition in the District Court pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-403(1), MCA, challenging the seizure and suspension of his driver\u2019s license. Under the circumstances of this case, the District Court\u2019s consideration of the petition was limited to the issues of whether Wagner had reasonable grounds to believe Eustance was DUI, whether Eustance was lawfully arrested and whether Eustance refused to submit to a blood or breath test upon request. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-8-403(4)(a)(i), -403(4)(a)(iv), MCA; <em>Muri, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-9. The suspension of a driver\u2019s license under \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA, is presumed to be correct and Eustance, as the petitioner, bore the burden of establishing that the State\u2019s action was improper. <em>See Muri, </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b69 Eustance was the only person who testified at the hearing on his petition. Based on his testimony, the District Court entered written findings of fact relating the following events which occurred on the evening Eustance was arrested. Eustance drove to the airport that evening to pick up his daughter and grandson who were arriving on a flight. Eustance had been having problems with his hip which resulted in his undergoing hip replacement surgery a week after his arrest. Because of the pain he suffered with his hip, it was more comfortable for him to wait in his vehicle than inside the airport. He had arranged with his daughter that she would call him on his cell phone when she arrived in the airport. Eustance parked in the lot of a nearby car rental agency and then fell asleep in his vehicle. At some point thereafter, Eustance was awakened by Wagner. Wagner subsequently requested Eustance to perform field sobriety tests. Eustance eventually refused to perform further tests and refused to submit to a breath test. The District Court also found that Eustance testified he had been operating his vehicle in a safe and legal manner prior to his arrest, his ability to drive was not impaired and he did not think there was reasonable suspicion or probable cause to justify his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b610 Based on its findings of fact, the District Court concluded there was no evidence establishing that Wagner had reasonable grounds to believe Eustance was DUI or that probable cause existed for Eustance\u2019s arrest. As a result, the court concluded Eustance had met his burden of establishing the suspension of his driver\u2019s license was improper and granted his petition to reinstate his license. The State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>contends that the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Eustance had met his burden of establishing the suspension of his driver\u2019s license was improper is erroneous. The State asserts that Eustance could not establish Wagner lacked either a reasonable suspicion to believe Eustance was DUI or probable cause to arrest without presenting Wagner\u2019s testimony at the hearing and that Eustance\u2019s own self-serving testimony was insufficient to meet his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b611  It is well-established that the testimony of one witness is sufficient to prove any fact. <em>See, e.g., State v. Russell, </em>2001 MT 278, \u00b6 22, 307 Mont. 322, \u00b6 22, 37 P.3d 678, \u00b6 22; <em>State v. Zeltner, </em>2000 MT 319, \u00b6 8, 302 Mont. 504, \u00b6 8, 15 P.3d 384, \u00b6 8. Here, Eustance testified regarding why he was at the airport and why he was asleep in his car. He further testified that he had been operating his vehicle in a safe and legal manner, his ability to drive was not impaired and he did not believe there were reasonable grounds for Wagner to believe he was DUI. Eustance\u2019s testimony, while perhaps self-serving, was sufficient to support the District Court\u2019s determinations that Wagner had no reasonable grounds to believe Eustance was DUI and that Eustance had met his burden of proof. <em>See, e.g., State v. Angeline, </em>1998 MT 139, \u00b6 25, 289 Mont. 222, \u00b6 25, 961 P.2d 1251, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b612 The State relies on <em>Hunter v. State, </em>264 Mont. 84, 869 P.2d 787, in support of its argument that a petitioner in a proceeding under \u00a7 61-8-403, MCA, cannot meet the necessary burden of proof based on only the petitioner\u2019s unsupported testimony, but must present the testimony of the arresting officer. The State\u2019s reliance on <em>Hunter </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b613 In that case, Hunter was arrested for DUI and taken to the local police station where the arresting officer requested her to submit to a breath test. After several unsuccessful attempts to perform the test, Hunter refused to try again. The arresting officer concluded she refused to perform the test and Hunter\u2019s driver\u2019s license was seized and suspended pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA. Hunter subsequently petitioned for reinstatement of her license. <em>Hunter, </em>264 Mont, at 86, 869 P.2d at 788-89. At the hearing on her petition, Hunter argued that the arresting officer was wrong in concluding she had refused to perform the breath test because she suffered from a medical condition which made her unable to perform such a test. She presented her own testimony in support of her argument, as well as the videotape of the testing procedure taken at the police station. The arresting officer did not testify. <em>Hunter, </em>264 Mont. at 87, 869 P.2d at 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u00b614 The district court concluded that Hunter did not meet her burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>of proving that the seizure and suspension of her driver\u2019s license was wrong because she was physically incapable of performing the breath test and denied her petition. <em>Hunter, </em>264 Mont. at 86-87, 869 P.2d at 789. In affirming the district court\u2019s conclusion, we observed that the only evidence presented at the hearing regarding Hunter\u2019s physical inability to perform the breath test was her own unsupported testimony. We further observed that Hunter\u2019s testimony was contradicted by the videotape she entered into evidence at the hearing, which revealed that Hunter never informed the arresting officer that she was unable to perform the test because of a physical ailment. Indeed, the videotape showed that Hunter informed the officer she was not ill, was not taking any medications and had no physical disabilities. <em>Hunter, </em>264 Mont. at 87, 869 P.2d at 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b615 Nowhere in <em>Hunter </em>did we hold that a petitioner in a proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-403, MCA, cannot meet the requisite burden of proof without presenting testimony from the arresting officer. Nor did we hold that a petitioner\u2019s testimony in such a proceeding, without more, is insufficient to meet the burden of proof. Rather, we observed that Hunter\u2019s testimony was contradicted by the videotape and, in light of the conflicting evidence, the district court did not err in concluding she had not met her burden of proof. <em>Hunter, </em>264 Mont. at 87-88, 869 P.2d at 789-90. In the present case, there was no conflicting evidence. The District Court was entitled to accept Eustance\u2019s uncontradicted testimony as true. <em>Hunter </em>does not support the State\u2019s agument that a petitioner in a \u00a7 61-8-403, MCA, proceeding cannot meet the burden of proof without presenting the arresting officer\u2019s testimony. The State advances no other legal authority for its argument in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b616  We conclude that the District Court did not err in determining that Eustance met his burden of establishing that Wagner did not have reasonable grounds to believe Eustance was DUI. Eustance having met his burden as the petitioner, the burden then shifted to the State to prove otherwise. The State presented no testimony or other evidence to refute Eustance\u2019s testimony at the hearing. We further conclude, therefore, that the District Court did not err in concluding that no evidence supported the State\u2019s position that Wagner had reasonable grounds to believe Eustance was DUI. We hold that the District Court did not err in granting Eustance\u2019s petition to reinstate his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b107-7\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
