We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it concluded a record of Barr\u2019s 1968 arrest was not confidential criminal justice information and thus Barr had no reasonable expectation of privacy in such information? \u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in finding there was no violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 or 1985(3) in connection with Barr\u2019s privacy claims? \u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in concluding the Defendants were not negligent <em>per se?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court err in concluding there was no duty as a matter of law owed to Barr and therefore his negligence claim failed?</p>\n<p id=\"Afx\">\u00b67 5. Did the District Court err in concluding Barr\u2019s only remedy was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>under the Montana Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b68 In the Fall of 1998, Barr applied for a part-time security officer position with the Airport. During his interview for the position, Barr consented to a criminal background check.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u00b69 The Airport participates in the Criminal Justice Information Network (CJIN), but must submit any criminal background request through an agency with computer terminal access to the CJIN database, which is a computer controlled telecommunications network that interfaces with computerized databases maintained by various law enforcement agencies throughout the nation. The National Crime Information Center (NCIC) is a computerized information system which links local, state, and federal criminal justice agencies for the purpose of exchanging information, including criminal history repositories of the states and FBI. GFPD is a terminal agency with access to the CJIN system; it has the capability to perform criminal background checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u00b610 On September 14, 1998, Bruce Sanford, an Airport security officer, contacted GFPD and requested a criminal background check on Barr for the preceding ten years. The background check did not reveal any arrests. Barr was hired as a part-time probationary security officer for the Airport on October 2,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u00b611 On November 7, 1998, John Vanni (Vanni), an Airport security officer contacted GFPD employee Gina Vincent and, without permission from the Airport, requested a criminal background check on Barr. The result of this request revealed Barr had been arrested in Alaska in 1968 for criminal non support. Vanni reported this arrest to Cynthia Schultz, the Airport Manager, who told Vanni it was not his concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">\u00b612 Barr was terminated from his employment at the Airport on March 18,1999, prior to the expiration of the six-month probationary period. Barr filed this lawsuit on March 3,2000, alleging a violation of his right to privacy, negligence <em>per se, </em>negligence, and violations of his civil rights. All three Defendants filed motions for summary judgment. Their motions were granted on July 2, 2003. Barr now appeals from the District Court\u2019s grant of these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">\u00b613 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same evaluation under Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>the district court. <em>Motta v. Philipsburg Sch. Bd. Trs., </em>2004 MT 256, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 72, \u00b6 11, 98 P.3d 673, \u00b6 11 (citation omitted). The party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of proving there are no genuine issues of material fact that would permit a non-moving party to succeed on the merits of the case, and if the moving party meets that burden, then the non-moving party must provide substantial evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact in order to avoid summary judgment in favor of the moving party. Once it is established no genuine issues of material fact exist, the district court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and this Court reviews that determination to determine whether the district court erred. <em>Motta, </em>\u00b6 11. Summary judgment is an extreme remedy which should not be substituted for a trial if a material factual controversy exists. <em>Mathews v. BJS Constr., Inc., </em>2003 MT 116, \u00b6 13, 315 Mont. 441, \u00b6 13, 68 P.3d 865, \u00b6 13 (citing <em>Montana Metal Bldgs. v. Shapiro </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 471, 474, 942 P.2d 694, 696).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ac9\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b614 Did the District Court err when it concluded a record of Barr\u2019s 1968 arrest was not confidential criminal justice information and thus Barr had no reasonable expectation of privacy in such information?</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u00b615 Barr argues the unauthorized disclosure of criminal justice information by the State, and its use and dissemination by Vanni, was a violation of his right to privacy under Article II, \u00a7 10 of the Montana Constitution as well as a violation of the Montana Criminal Justice Information Act of 1979 (MC JIA), specifically \u00a7 44-5-503, MCA, \u00a7 44-5-504, MCA, and \u00a7 44-5-302, MCA. He also claims such was a violation of the 1974 National Crime Prevention Policy Compact (the Privacy Act), codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a) and \u00a7 44-5-601, MCA, et seq. Barr, in essence, claims the Defendants failed to meet state and federal constitutional and statutory standards imposed for the protection of his privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\u00b616 The Defendants argue Barr\u2019s 1968 Alaska arrest was not confidential criminal justice information; rather, it was public information that anyone could access. They assert that Barr\u2019s right to privacy was not violated by any dissemination of this information. The State claims that, contrary to Barr\u2019s assertions, the civil remedy provisions of the Privacy Act do not provide a private cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>against a state agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b617  The Montana Legislature has defined confidential criminal justice information as: criminal investigative information, criminal intelligence information, fingerprints and photographs, criminal justice information or records made confidential by law, and any other criminal justice information not clearly defined as public criminal justice information. Section 44-5-103(3), MCA. Pursuant to \u00a7 44-5-103(13)(e)(ii), MCA, public criminal justice information includes Barr\u2019s initial arrest record at issue. Thus, under MCJIA, specifically \u00a7 44-5-103(13)(e)(ii), MCA, Barr\u2019s Alaska arrest was clearly public information.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b618  Aside from the MCJIA, this Court has adopted a two-part test to determine whether Barr has a constitutionally protected privacy interest in this information: 1) whether the person involved had a subjective or actual expectation of privacy, and 2) whether society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable. <em>Jefferson County v. Mont. Std., </em>2003 MT 304, \u00b6 15, 318 Mont. 173, \u00b6 15, 79 P.3d 805, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b619  In this instance, Barr had no subjective or actual expectation of privacy in his initial arrest record; it constitutes public information that anyone could access. He admitted in his deposition that his arrest record was public information. Although it may be difficult to access the arrest record-it is still public information. Thus, the District Court did not err when it concluded Barr\u2019s 1968 Alaska arrest was public information and that there was no breach of the MCJIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u00b620  Under the particular circumstances of this case, where Barr knew that the record of his long past arrest was public information and he also consented to a criminal background check, he had no actual or subjective expectation of privacy. Further, in this case, Barr was a security officer entrusted with helping to ensure the safety of the traveling public, and the record in question is specifically designated as public information by statute. Thus, under these facts, we conclude the public is not willing to recognize Barr\u2019s claimed expectation of privacy as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">\u00b621  As the State points out, the civil remedy provision of the federally enacted Privacy Act only applies to actions against a federal agency. <em>See Dittman v. California </em>(9th Cir. 1999), 191 F.3d 1020, 1026 (holding the Privacy Act applies only to federal agencies and that state agencies are immune from liability under the Act). There are no federal agencies named as defendants in this lawsuit. Accordingly, the District Court was correct when it granted the Defendants\u2019 motions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>summary judgment and held Barr\u2019s claim under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a), failed as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b622 Did the District Court err in finding there was no violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 or 1985(3) in connection with Barr\u2019s privacy claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b623 Barr asserts the Airport\u2019s conduct, in not hiring him as a permanent employee, violated his civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and resulted in a conspiracy denying him immunities and privileges under the law, contrary to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b624 In regard to this civil rights claim, the Airport argues that municipalities are not hable, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985(3), for the constitutional torts of their employees under the theory of <em>respondeat superior.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u00b625 GFPD makes a similar argument, stating that in order for a municipality to be liable under these statutes there must be a policy or custom of the government entity itself which inflicts the injury complained of by the Plaintiff. GFPD argues Barr cannot show this. \u00b626 The State argues Barr\u2019s claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985(3) fail as a matter of law because the Department of Justice is not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1985(3) and therefore this statute has no applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u00b627 Section 1983 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">\u00b628 Barr\u2019s claimed civil rights violations stem from an invasion of his privacy, which we have already determined did not occur. Thus, he cannot establish a \u00a7 1983 violation of his right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">\u00b629 Barr also claims damages for violations of his right to free speech. He cannot recover under this alleged claim. As with his inability to establish a violation of his constitutional right to privacy, he cannot recover from the State because the United States Supreme Court has held states are not \u201cpersons\u201d in the context of \u00a7 1983. <em>See Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police </em>(1989), 491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>2312, 105 L.Ed.2d 45, 58. The Department of Justice, as an entity within the executive branch of government in the State of Montana, see \u00a7 2-15-102(4), MCA, and \u00a7 2-15-2001, MCA, is a governmental entity which is considered an \u201carm of the state\" and not a \u201cperson\u201d for \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1985 purposes. <em>See Orozco v. Day </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 341, 357, 934 P.2d 1009, 1012 (citing Will, 491 U.S. at 70).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b630 Likewise, Barr did not offer proof of a policy or custom utilized by the Defendants which resulted in a violation of his civil rights. Under <em>Monell v. Dept. of Soc. Servs. </em>(1978), 436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2036, 56 L.Ed.2d 611, 636, municipalities such as the Airport and GFPD cannot be held liable unless action pursuant to official municipal policy of some nature caused the constitutional tort. <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 691. Bar offered no proof of a custom or policy of refusing to hire probationary employees who complained that their privacy rights had been violated. Accordingly, Barr has no valid claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985(3) against any of the Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b631  The District Court did not err when it granted the Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and held Barr\u2019s civil rights claims, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985(3), failed as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u00b632 Did the District Court err in concluding the Defendants were not negligent <em>per sel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\u00b633 Barr argues the Defendants violated NCIC regulations by improperly disseminating criminal history record information and that this constitutes negligence <em>per se </em>under Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">\u00b634 The Defendants argue that Barr cannot establish negligence <em>per se </em>because he failed to prove a predicate statutory violation as required by Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">\u00b635 The doctrine of negligence <em>per se, </em>or negligence as a matter of law, provides that the violation of a statute renders one negligent under the law. To establish negligence <em>per se, </em>a plaintiff must prove that (1) the defendant violated the particular statute; (2) the statute was enacted to protect a specific class of persons; (3) the plaintiff is a member of that class; (4) the plaintiffs injury is of the sort the statute was enacted to prevent; and (5) the statute was intended to regulate members of defendant\u2019s class. <em>Massee v. Thompson, </em>2004 MT 121, \u00b6 30, 321 Mont. 210, \u00b6 30, 90 P.3d 394, \u00b6 30 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">\u00b636  We have already determined that there was no violation of law pertaining to confidential criminal justice information. As Vanni was an Airport security officer, authorized to request the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>provided, there was no violation of NCIC regulations. Thus, there is no predicate statutory violation on which to base a negligence <em>per se </em>claim. Accordingly, summary judgment in favor of the Defendants was proper on Barr\u2019s negligence <em>per se </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b637 Did the District Court err in concluding there was no duty as a matter of law owed to Barr and therefore his negligence claim failed?</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b638 Barr argues the Defendants were negligent in failing to enforce restrictions on the dissemination of criminal justice history information, and were negligent in allowing unauthorized persons to make requests for confidential criminal justice information.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b639 The Airport asserts it owed no duty to Barr because Vanni was acting outside the course and scope of his employment when he requested the background check on Barr.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u00b640 The State and GFPD argue Vanni\u2019s request, although undertaken without permission by the Airport, was made through fully authorized channels. That being so, they assert they owed no duty to Barr not to provide the requested information. Relying on \u00a7 44-5-305, MCA, the State and GFPD assert further, that even assuming a duty existed, Barr cannot prove the element of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">\u00b641  Negligence is the failure to use the degree of care that an ordinarily prudent person would have used under the same circumstance. The four elements of a common law negligence claim are duty, a breach of that duty, causation and damages. Each of these elements must exist for a negligence claim to proceed. <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6 30. Where a plaintiff fails to offer proof of any one of the elements of negligence, summary judgment in favor of the defendant is proper. <em>Singleton v. L.P. Anderson Supply Co. </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 40, 44, 943 P.2d 968, 970.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">\u00b642  Since we have determined Barr\u2019s 1968 Alaska arrest was public information, and its dissemination was not improper, there was no duty owed to prohibit dissemination of the fact Barr had been arrested in 1968. Thus, the District Court did not err in granting the Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">ISSUE FIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">\u00b643 Did the District Court err in concluding Barr\u2019s only remedy was under the Montana Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>\u00b644 While Barr did not specifically claim he was wrongfully discharged in violation of the Montana Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act, \u00a7 39-2-901, MCA, et seq. (MWDEA), he claimed lost wages and the inability to obtain employment, based on allegations the Airport wrongfully refused to retain him as a permanent employee. The District Court considered the intent of Barr\u2019s Complaint to be one of wrongful discharge and held that such a claim, even if properly pled, was barred based on Barr\u2019s probationary status and the failure to prove any facts substantiating an improper motive or purpose in his termination. The District Court also pointed to the MWDEA\u2019s exclusivity provision, codified at \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA, and held it was an additional basis upon which to dismiss Barr\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b645 Barr asserts that despite his probationary employee status, he can recover from the Airport because his termination was based on impermissible reasons. Specifically, Barr believes his termination was a retaliatory discharge based upon his objections to the invasion of his privacy rights. Barr claims the MWDEA is not an exclusive remedy in his case because it does not specifically address the type of constitutional violation he believes was the reason the Airport did not permanently hire him.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b646 While Barr appeals the conclusion of the District Court that his exclusive remedy is under the MWDEA, he has at no time made a claim for relief under such act. We have concluded that the District Court was correct in granting summary judgment against Barr on all of the claims he did make. Thus, no controversy is presented concerning the MWDEA and we need not discuss this issue further. \u00b647 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b128-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
