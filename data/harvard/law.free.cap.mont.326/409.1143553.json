We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-16\">\u00b63 Did the denial of Juntunen\u2019s motion to set aside the entry of the default judgment constitute an abuse of discretion?</p>\n<p id=\"b436-17\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b436-18\">\u00b64 On July 2, 2003, Peak Development, LLP (Peak) filed a civil suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>in the Eleventh Judicial District Court alleging that Juntunen breached a lease agreement and claiming $64,121.85 in damages for unpaid rent and utility bills associated with the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b65 On July 22,2003, Juntunen was personally served with a copy of the summons and complaint. Juntunen is the owner of the Bear Naked Paving Company in Kalispell, Montana. The summons advised Juntunen that \u201cin case of your failure to appear or answer, judgment will be taken against you, by default, for the relief demanded in the Complaint\u201d within twenty days after service of the summons. However, Juntunen did not file an answer as directed by the summons, and Peak\u2019s attorney filed a praecipe for default, which the clerk of the court entered on August 14, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u00b66 In September 2003, Juntunen\u2019s company began paving a parking lot for the law firm of Quatman &amp; Quatman. Working at the law office brought to Juntunen\u2019s mind that he had been served with the summons and complaint, and he requested attorney John Quatman (Quatman) to inquire into the matter on September 16,2003. Quatman did so, and discovered the default which had been entered in August. He then apprised Juntunen of the situation, and, on October 3, 2003, filed a motion to set aside the default. However, on September 12, 2003, Peak had already filed a motion for default judgment, and further, on September 24, 2003, the District Court had conducted a hearing on Peak\u2019s motion and entered a default judgment against Juntunen. Peak responded to Juntunen\u2019s motion to set aside default on October 10, 2003, arguing that the motion was not well taken because the court had already entered a default judgment. Quatman then filed, on October 17, 2003, a motion seeking to set aside the default judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1) and (6), M.R.Civ.P. Quatman argued in his supporting brief that at the time Peak had served the summons and complaint, Juntunen\u2019s hectic business schedule contributed to his inadvertence in failing to file an answer. Included in Juntunen\u2019s affidavit, though not argued to the District Court in the motion, was this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">During this same period of time my wife and I separated and I was arrested for a fight I had with her father.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\u00b67 The District Court did not rule on the motion to set aside the judgment within sixty days, and therefore it was denied by operation pursuant to Rule 60(c), M.R.Civ.P. Juntunen appeals therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">\u00b68  In reviewing a default judgment, we are guided by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>principle that every litigated case should be decided on its merits; judgments by default are not favored. <em>In re Marriage of Whiting </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 180, 186, 854 P.2d 343, 347. When an appeal is from a denial of a motion to set aside a default judgment, our standard of review is that only a slight abuse of discretion need be shown to warrant reversal. <em>Lords v. Newman </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 359, 364, 688 P.2d 290, 293. The party seeking to set aside a default judgment has the burden of proof. <em>In re Marriage of Winckler, </em>2000 MT 116, \u00b6 10, 299 Mont. 428, \u00b6 10, 2 P.3d 229, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b69 Did the denial of Juntunen\u2019s motion to set aside the entry of the default judgment constitute an abuse of discretion?</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u00b6 10 Juntunen argues that his motion to set aside the default judgment should have been granted because, first, his motion satisfied the good cause criterion under Rule 55(c), M.R.Civ.P., and, secondly, satisfied the more stringent excusable neglect standard under Rule 60(b)(1), M.R.Civ.P. Further, Juntunen contends that the facts establish extraordinary circumstances which justify setting aside the default judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u00b611  Recently, in <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. Jaycie, Inc., </em>2004 MT 278, 323 Mont. 231, 99 P.3d 651, we clarified the respective standards t\u00f3 be applied in determining whether to set aside the entry of a default or a default judgment. <em>Essex, </em>\u00b6 12. We held that when the issue is setting aside an entry of a default under Rule 55(c), M.R.Civ.P., we will apply the <em>Cribb </em>standard. <em>Essex, </em>\u00b6 10 (referencing <em>Cribb v. Matlock Communications, Inc. </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 27, 30, 768 P.2d 337, 339, and noting that \u201cto evaluate a showing of good cause [to set aside a default,] the Court should consider: (1) whether the default was willful, (2) whether the plaintiff would be prejudiced if the default should be set aside, and (3) whether the defendant has presented a meritorious defense to plaintiffs claim\u201d). However, when the issue is the setting aside of an entry of a default judgment under Rule 60(b)(1), M.R.Civ.P., either alone or in conjunction with an entry of default, we will apply the <em>Blume </em>standard. <em>Essex, </em>\u00b6 12 (referencing <em>Blume v. Metro. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 465, 467, 791 P.2d 784, 786). We clarified that the criteria which must be satisfied by a defaulting party to set aside a default judgment are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">(1) the defaulting party proceeded with diligence; (2) the defaulting party\u2019s neglect was excusable; (3) the defaulting party has a meritorious defense to the claim; and (4) the judgment, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>permitted to stand, will affect the defaulting party injuriously.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AY2\"><em>Essex, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b612 <em>Essex </em>was decided while this case was pending, and the parties did not have the benefit of our holding for their briefing. Nonetheless, both parties have offered arguments in accordance with the <em>Blume </em>standard for setting aside a default judgment and, therefore, have provided an appropriate analysis, consistent with <em>Essex, </em>for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\u00b613 Juntunen argues that his failure to file an answer to Peak\u2019s complaint was not an intentional disregard for the judicial process, but a consequence of his schedule during this time, noting that he had too much on his plate. He explains that the summer months are the make-it or break-it season for his company, requiring him to work in excess of 100 hours per week, because asphalt batch plants only operate when the temperature is warm. He also offers that, during this period of time, he determined to separate from his wife and was arrested for an altercation with his father-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00b614 We first note that, in his motion and brief filed in the District Court, Juntunen did not argue that his marital separation and arrest affected his ability to file an answer, although his affidavit filed in support of his motion included a sentence mentioning these matters. Even so, Juntunen\u2019s affidavit did not specifically state the dates of his domestic separation and arrest so that those events could be correlated to the 20-day period within which Juntunen was to answer the complaint. As such, we conclude that Juntunen did not carry his burden of demonstrating that these factors interfered with his ability to answer the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\u00b615  Turning to Juntunen\u2019s business concerns, this Court has consistently held that a defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to appear due to forgetfulness and the press of other, more important business is not sufficient to establish excusable neglect.\u201d <em>Foster Apiaries, Inc. v. Hubbard Apiaries, Inc. </em>(1981), 193 Mont. 156, 161, 630 P.2d 1213, 1216 (no excusable neglect where a corporate president indicated he did not know what further action was required to make an appearance); <em>see also Morris v. Frank Trans. Co. </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 74, 75-76, 601 P.2d 698, 698-99 (business owner who \u201chad been ill and had left it up to other people to run his business and to take care of the lawsuit\u201d did not establish excusable neglect); <em>Dudley v. Stiles </em>(1963), 142 Mont. 566, 567, 386 P.2d 342, 342-43 (no excusable neglect where a defendant\u2019s personal problems \u201cdrove all thought of lesser matters from his mind\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AB9\">\u00b616  We cannot conclude from our cases that the mere press of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>busy schedule or a busy work season constitutes excusable neglect necessary to overturn a default judgment under Rule 60(b)(1), M.R.Civ.P., and the <em>Blume </em>standard. Such a conclusion would fail to recognize the significance of the entry of a judgment and undermine respect for the courts. Thus, having determined that Juntunen failed to meet his burden of establishing excusable neglect, it is unnecessary to determine whether Juntunen satisfied the remaining criteria under the <em>Blume </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b617  We now turn to Juntunen\u2019s argument under Rule 60(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., that he has demonstrated that extraordinary circumstances existed to set aside the default judgment. We have clarified when relief is available under Rule 60(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-4\">[Rjelief is available under Rule 60(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., for situations other than those enumerated in the first five subsections of the rule. Rule 60(b)(6) applies when the movant demonstrates each of the following elements: 1) extraordinary circumstances including gross neglect or actual misconduct by an attorney; 2) the movant acted to set aside the judgment within a reasonable time period; and 3) the movant was blameless. [Referencing <em>Karlen v. Evans </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 181, 190, 915 P.2d 232, 238.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\"><em>Bahm v. Southworth, </em>2000 MT 244, \u00b6 14, 301 Mont. 434, \u00b6 14, 10 P.3d 99, \u00b6 14. Had Juntunen established that the circumstances surrounding his failure to answer had constituted excusable neglect, he would have been eligible for relief under Rule 60(b)(1), M.R.C\u00cdV.P., not Rule 60(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P. Further, gross neglect or actual misconduct by Juntunen\u2019s attorney are not issues here, as required under Rule 60(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P. Thus, that provision is inapplicable. \u00b618 We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b440-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b440-7\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"Ax6\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">\u00b619 I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">\u00b620 The Court recognizes that only a slight abuse of discretion is needed to warrant reversal. \u00b6 8. It then cites the <em>Blume </em>standard for the proposition that a party seeking to set aside a default judgment must demonstrate that his neglect was excusable. \u00b6 11. With this, I agree. However, the Court then goes on to conclude that Juntunen failed to meet his burden of establishing excusable neglect. I submit that reasonable <em>minds </em>might differ in this respect, and that we should therefore resolve such doubts by allowing a trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">\u00b621 In <em>United States Rubber Co. v. Community Gas &amp; Oil Co. </em>(1961), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>139 Mont. 36, 39, 359 P.2d 375, 376, we said that in determining whether to set aside a default, the test to determine whether neglect is excusable is \u201cwhether the reasons given for the neglect are such that reasonable minds might differ in their conclusions concerning excusable neglect. If so, the doubt should be resolved in favor of a trial on the merits.\u201d Although this case predates Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., it has been cited favorably since the inception of the rules in cases in which the propriety of a default judgment has been under consideration. <em>See, e.g., Myers v. All West Transport </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 233, 236, 766 P.2d 864, 866, and <em>Griffin v. Scott </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 410, 412, 710 P.2d 1337, 1338. We seem to have abandoned this test in our recent cases. I believe, however, that this test should be applied in close cases, as resolving doubts in favor of a trial on the merits is wholly consistent with our standard of review in such cases-i.e., that only a slight abuse of discretion need be shown to warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"AA1\">\u00b622 Here, I would conclude that the confluence of a hectic seasonal business schedule, a marital separation, and a fight and ensuing arrest are sufficient to raise in reasonable minds a difference of opinion over whether failure to respond to a summons under such circumstances constitutes excusable neglect. I would therefore engage the presumption that such close cases should be resolved with a trial on the merits. I dissent from our refusal to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
