Cameron, Sr. (Cameron), appeals from a jury verdict rendered October 29, 2002, in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, finding him guilty of sexual assault. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\u00b62 The following issues are presented for appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in refusing to instruct the jury on misdemeanor assault as a lesser included offense?</p>\n<p id=\"AT\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in admitting a hearsay statement into evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">\u00b65 Cameron attacked his granddaughter\u2019s fourteen-year-old friend, T.P., at his home on February 18,2002. Cameron\u2019s granddaughter and T.P. often went to Cameron\u2019s to \u201chang out.\u201d T.P. considered herself close to Cameron, calling him \u201cGrandpa.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">\u00b66 On this particular day, T.P. went to Cameron\u2019s mobile home by herself because she was bored. While T.P. was there, Cameron drank shots of vodka until he was admittedly \u201creally drunk.\u201d No one else was in the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">\u00b67 After playing for a while with a pet bird, T.P. went to use the restroom. As she came out of the hallway near the bathroom, Cameron pushed her through a doorway onto a bed. Cameron grabbed her breasts, ripping her shirt. He licked her face and rubbed himself against her, simulating intercourse. Cameron told her to remove her pants, but she refused. T.P. managed to get out from under him and fell onto the floor. Cameron fell to the floor as well, blocking her exit from the room. As T.P. was trying to get up, Cameron grabbed her by the hair and pulled her toward his crotch, giving her a fellatiory directive. She pulled back and escaped from the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>\u00b68 T.P. subsequently ran and walked the eight miles back to her home, crying the entire way. When T.P. arrived home, she changed clothes, wrapped a blanket around her and sat on her porch, crying. Her sister, J.P., was home at the time, along with her boyfriend. J.P.\u2019s boyfriend went outside and asked T.P. what was wrong. T.P. asked for her sister. J.P. went to T.P. on the porch, and T.P. clung to J.P., weeping. J.P. testified, \u201cI have never been held so tight in my life by her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u00b69 During J.P.\u2019s testimony, she described what happened next:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">Q. [By the State] So how did you feel before [T.P.] said anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar\">A. I got scared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">Q. So you were scared about-what were you scared about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">A. What she was going to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">Q. What did she say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">A. I asked her what was wrong repeatedly. And she said that - MR. VAN DER HAGEN [Defense Counsel]: We\u2019re going to object to this as hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-10\">MR. [sic] RIES [State]: It\u2019s in the present impression, your Honor. THE COURT: All right. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-11\">Q. (BY MS. RIES) So you asked her repeatedly what was wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agv\">A. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-12\">Q. What did she say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-13\">A. She said, \u201cGrandpa tried raping me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-14\">Q. \u201cGrandpa tried raping me?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-15\">A. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-16\">Q. Did you know who she meant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-17\">A. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-18\">Q. Who did she mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-19\">A. Bill Cameron.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-20\">\u00b610 J.P. told T.P. to call the police, which she did from her neighbor\u2019s house. Officer Pre\u2019tat responded. He took photographs of T.P. depicting scratches on her face. J.P. testified that T.P. also had scratches and bruises on her chest that she did not show to Officer Pre\u2019tat. T.P. gave the officer the stretched and ripped shirt that she had been wearing during the incident with Cameron.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-21\">\u00b611 Cameron was charged with one count of felony sexual assault, two counts of misdemeanor assault, and one count of unlawful restraint. Prior to trial, the State moved to dismiss all counts except sexual assault, which the District Court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-22\">\u00b612 During trial, Cameron submitted proposed jury instructions on misdemeanor assault as a lesser included offense of sexual assault. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The District Court denied the instruction. Cameron was convicted of sexual assault, and he now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u00b613 We review criminal jury instructions to determine whether the instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the applicable law. <em>State v. Bowman, </em>2004 MT 119, \u00b6 49, 321 Mont. 176, \u00b6 49, 89 P.3d 986, \u00b6 49. District courts have broad discretion in formulating jury instructions, and we review such formulations for abuse of discretion. <em>Bowman, </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u00b614 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Nolan, </em>2003 MT 55, \u00b6 16, 314 Mont. 371, \u00b6 16, 66 P.3d 269, \u00b6 16; <em>see also State v. Hope, </em>2001 MT 207, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11, 306 Mont. 334, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11, 33 P.3d 629, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">\u00b615 <em>1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in refusing to instruct the jury on misdemeanor assault as a lesser included offense?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">\u00b616 Cameron\u2019s challenge to the District Court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense begins with a preliminary argument concerning the tactics of the State. Cameron notes that he had originally been charged with three misdemeanor offenses, including misdemeanor assault, in addition to the felony sexual assault charge, but that the State moved to dismiss the misdemeanor charges three days prior to trial, citing potential double jeopardy concerns, and the District Court granted the motion. Cameron argues that there was no actual double jeopardy problem with the charges against him, but, rather, the State raised the double jeopardy issue as a \u201cruse\u201d to cover its real purpose: to block Cameron\u2019s defense that he had committed only misdemeanor assault, and not felony assault. Citing <em>People v. Barton </em>(Cal. 1995), 906 P.2d 531, 536, for the proposition that \u201cneither the prosecution nor the defense should be allowed, based on their trial strategy, to preclude the jury from considering guilt of a lesser offense included in the crime charged,\u201d Cameron argues that the State acted improperly.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">\u00b617 We do not disagree with Barton\u2019s principle that the jury should not be precluded from considering \u201ca lesser offense included in the crime charged.\u201d Whether misdemeanor assault is, indeed, a lesser offense included within sexual assault is the central issue here. However, Cameron is incorrect in asserting that the State acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>improperly by dismissing the misdemeanor charges simply to block Cameron\u2019s strategy of seeking conviction of a lesser offense-whether or not \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d was the reason it sought dismissal of the charges. \u201c[T]hough the State may well have strategically avoided a double jeopardy defense by its charging decision, there is no error in doing so. The State is vested with broad discretion in making charging decisions.\u201d <em>State v. Matt, </em>2005 MT 9, \u00b6 10, 325 Mont. 340, \u00b6 10, 106 P.3d 530, \u00b6 10. \u201c[T]he rule of law we apply to alternative offenses is that of prosecutorial discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Beavers, </em>1999 MT 260, \u00b6 39, 296 Mont. 340, \u00b6 39, 987 P.2d 371, \u00b6 39. \u201cWhere the facts of a case support a possible charge of more than one crime, the crime to be charged is a matter of prosecutorial discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Fuqua, </em>2000 MT 273, \u00b6 13, 302 Mont. 99, \u00b6 13, 13 P.3d 34, \u00b6 13 (citing <em>Beavers, </em>\u00b6 39). Here, by deciding to dismiss the misdemeanor charges, the State narrowed the case-the elements of the offenses and the range of evidentiary proof necessary for conviction of a charged offense-and by so doing also broadened the risk that Cameron would be acquitted of the single remaining charge, sexual assault. Its decision to \u201cput all of its eggs in one basket\u201d is a strategical one that falls within its discretion and is not improper. That does not mean, however, that the State can block a jury instruction for an offense which was actually included within the remaining felony offense, an issue to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b618 Noting that \u00a7 46-16-607(2), MCA, requires a lesser included offense instruction to be given \u201cwhen there is a proper request by one of the parties and the jury, based on the evidence, could be warranted in finding the defendant guilty of a lesser included offense,\u201d Cameron argues that, under the evidence here, the jury could have concluded that he was guilty of misdemeanor assault, and thus, an instruction was required. He offers that misdemeanor assault, as defined both by subsection (a) and subsection (c) of \u00a7 45-5-201, MCA,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> constitutes a lesser offense included within sexual assault, a felony, as that offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>is defined by \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b619 An \u201cincluded offense,\u201d as defined by statute, means an offense which:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">(a) is established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">(b) consists of an attempt to commit the offense charged or to commit an offense otherwise included in the offense charged; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">(c) differs from the offense charged only in the respect that a less serious injury or risk to the same person, property, or public interest or a lesser kind of culpability suffices to establish its commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Section 46-1-202(9), MCA. Cameron concedes, pursuant to our decision in <em>Beavers, </em>which explained that the term \u201cfacts\u201d in subsection (a) of \u00a7 46-1-202(9), MCA, refers to the statutory elements of the charged offense and not to the individual facts of the case, that misdemeanor assault is not a lesser included offense of sexual assault under that subsection. However, he argues that misdemeanor assault constitutes a lesser included offense of sexual assault under either subsection (b) or subsection (c) of \u00a7 46-1-202(9), MCA. He correctly notes that an offense may qualify as a lesser included offense under any of the three subsections of \u00a7 46-1-202(9), MCA. <em>See Beavers, </em>\u00b6 25. We begin with Cameron\u2019s arguments under subsection (c) of the statute, and then turn to his arguments under subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">\u00b620  \u201cTwo criteria must be met before a defendant is entitled to a lesser included offense instruction. First, the offense must actually constitute a lesser included offense of the offense charged, and, second, there must be sufficient evidence to support the included offense instruction.\u201d <em>State v. Martinez, </em>1998 MT 265, \u00b6 10, 291 Mont. 306, \u00b6 10, 968 P.2d 705, \u00b6 10. Under the first criterion, Cameron argues that the misdemeanor assault \u201cactually constitutes\u201d a lesser included offense under subsection (c) of \u00a7 46-1-202(9), MCA, because the elements of that offense are similar to the elements of sexual assault and, thus, the misdemeanor differs only by posing a \u201cless serious risk.\u201d Cameron <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>reasons that sexual assault involves a greater risk of both physical and psychological injury to the victim. Although conceding that misdemeanor assault does not present a \u201clesser serious kind of culpability\u201d or \u201cless serious injury\u201d than sexual assault, Cameron notes our holding in <em>State v. Fisch </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 520, 881 P.2d 626, wherein we concluded that subsection (c) is \u201cwritten in the disjunctive and with an \u2018only^ qualifier. Thus, an included offense may differ from the offense charged by way of a less serious injury or a less serious risk or a lesser kind of culpability. In other words, an offense is an included offense under [subsection (c)], if it differs from the charged offense in one, but only one, of the three ways set forth in the subsection.\u201d <em>Fisch, </em>266 Mont. at 523, 881 P.2d at 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b621 Comparing the elements, Cameron first notes that, as defined by \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA, sexual assault occurs when a person \u201cknowingly subjects another person to any sexual contact without consent.\u201d He further notes that the definition of \u201csexual contact\u201d includes the \u201ctouching of the sexual or other intimate parts of the person of another ... in order to knowingly or purposely ... cause bodily injury to or humiliate, harass or degrade another,\u201d \u00a7 45-2-101(66)(a), MCA. Cameron then explains that misdemeanor assault, as defined under subsection (l)(a) of \u00a7 45-5-201, MCA, is committed if a person \u201cpurposely or knowingly causes bodily injury to another,\u201d and thus, he asserts that the jury could have determined that he had merely purposely or knowingly caused bodily injury to T.P. Likewise, Cameron notes that misdemeanor assault, as alternatively defined under subsection (1)(c) of \u00a7 45-5-201, MCA, is committed when a person \u201cpurposely or knowingly makes physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature with any individual,\u201d and thus, he asserts that the jury could have determined that he had merely purposely or knowingly made physical contact of any insulting or provoking nature upon T.P. Therefore, Cameron contends that misdemeanor assault as defined under either subsection (1)(a) or subsection (1)(c) \u201cactually constitutes\u201d an included offense to sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b622 Responding to Cameron\u2019s argument, the State argues that the elements of the offenses are not similar, and therefore, misdemeanor assault does not \u201cactually constitute\u201d an included offense to sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>assault. The State first explains that \u00a7 45-2-101(66), MCA,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> contains not one, but two different definitions of \u201csexual contact\u201d-one which includes bodily injury or humiliation as elements (subsection (a)), and one which does not (subsection (b)). The State points out that, although Cameron\u2019s argument compares the elements of misdemeanor assault to the sexual contact definition in subsection (66)(a)-\u201ccause bodily injury to or humiliate, harass or degrade another\u201d-the sexual assault charge against him did not allege that kind of sexual contact. Rather, the Information alleged sexual assault by way of sexual contact as defined by subsection (66)(b): \u201cThe above-named defendant knowingly subjected another person, Jane Doe, to sexual contact without consent ... by grabbing her breast and simulating sexual intercourse on top of her.\u201d Further, the District Court gave the jury an instruction consistent therewith, a precise quote from subsection (66)(b), which stated that \u201csexual contact\u201d is the \u201ctouching of the sexual or other intimate parts of the person of another, directly or through clothing, in order to knowingly or purposely arouse or gratify the sexual response or desire of either party.\u201d Thus, the State argues, the sexual assault charge as set forth in the Information and in the jury instructions included neither the element of bodily injury, which Cameron compares to the definition of misdemeanor assault under \u00a7 45-5-201(l)(a), MCA, nor the element of touching intended to \u201chumiliate, harass, or degrade another,\u201d which Cameron compares to the definition of misdemeanor assault under \u00a7 45-5-201(l)(c), MCA. Although these elements of misdemeanor assault are comparable to those within the definition of sexual contact as set forth in subsection (66)(a), that definition of sexual contact was not part of the charge filed here. The State further notes that Cameron\u2019s own proposed jury instructions were based solely on subsection (66)(b). Thus, the State contends that misdemeanor assault as defined by either subsection (l)(a) or (l)(c) of \u00a7 45-5-201, MCA, does not constitute an included offense of sexual assault because neither subsection differs from sexual assault <em>only </em>in the respect that the former is \u201cless serious,\u201d as Cameron asserts. Rather, the elements are dissimilar and do not overlap.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\u00b623 We agree with the State. Misdemeanor assault did not differ from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>sexual assault \u201conly in respect that a less serious\u201d risk exists. The offense as charged in the Information and stated by the jury instructions did not define sexual contact as including an element of bodily injury or physical contact to humiliate, harass or degrade, but, rather, defined sexual contact as touching to arouse or gratify the sexual response or desire of either party. Thus, the \u201crisk\u201d was not the <em>only </em>difference between these crimes. Additionally, there is a clear difference in the assailant\u2019s intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b624 In <em>State v. Long </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 502, 726 P.2d 1364, we addressed this issue under prior law. Although both parties offer that <em>Long </em>is outdated in that it applied the Blockburger<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> test, which we have now abandoned, that case also entertained the same arguments as offered by Cameron with regard to the offenses at issue here. We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">In order to adopt the defendant\u2019s lesser included offense theory, this Court must find that sexual contact and physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature are interchangeable terms. This we will not do. The defendant\u2019s contentions that misdemeanor assault is a lesser included offense of sexual assault is not supported by the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-6\"><em>Long, </em>223 Mont. at 510, 726 P.2d at 1369. After examination of the current statutes, we reach the same conclusion today about the elements of these offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u00b625  Cameron argues that the District Court erred by relying upon <em>Long </em>and <em>Blockburger </em>and, further, by stating that it was denying the request for a lesser included offense instruction because Cameron \u201cdidn\u2019t offer any alternate explanation\u201d as to what had occurred. Cameron asserts that despite his right not to testify, the District Court \u201cheld it against him.\u201d Cameron does not cite any authority for this argument, but further, we do not take from the District Court\u2019s statements that it was basing its decision on Cameron\u2019s election not to testify. It was referring more generally to the lack of any evidence which contradicted the State\u2019s case. In any event, this Court affirms a district court\u2019s ruling if it reaches the correct result, even if it does so for the wrong reason. <em>Ritchie v. Town of Ennis, </em>2004 MT 43, \u00b6 8, 320 Mont. 94, \u00b6 8,86 P.3d 11, \u00b6 8. Because the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Cameron\u2019s request for a lesser included offense instruction, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>reached the correct result, even if based on an incorrect rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b626 Lastly, Cameron argues that misdemeanor assault constitutes a lesser included offense to sexual assault under \u00a7 46-l-202(9)(b), MCA, which provides that an \u201cincluded offense\u201d is an offense which \u201cconsists of an attempt to commit the offense charged.\u201d Cameron asserts that an individual could cause bodily injury or could make physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature-the elements of misdemeanor assault-as part of an \u201cattempt\u201d to commit the charged crime of sexual assault. However, Cameron misreads the statutes. \u201cA person commits the offense of attempt when, with the purpose to commit a specific offense, he does any act toward the commission of such offense.\u201d Section 45-4-103(1), MCA. Further, a person convicted of attempt is punishable in the same manner as for conviction of the offense which was attempted. Section 45-4-103(3), MCA. Thus, the included offense here would not be misdemeanor assault, but <em>attempted sexual assault. </em>Cameron did not seek an included offense instruction for this felony. \u00b627 Because we conclude that misdemeanor assault does not constitute an included offense of sexual assault as charged here, we need not address Cameron\u2019s argument, under the second <em>Martinez </em>criterion, that sufficient evidence existed to support his request for a jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b628  We review \u201cwhether the [jury] instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the applicable law\u201d and give district courts broad discretion in formulating such instructions. <em>State v. German, </em>2001 MT 156, \u00b6 10, 306 Mont. 92, \u00b6 10, 30 P.3d 360, \u00b6 10. Additionally, we have consistently held, a trial court \u201cneed not give an instruction on a lesser included offense when there is no evidence to support it.\u201d <em>German, </em>\u00b6 11. Here, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion and correctly instructed the jury, and, consequently, that Cameron suffered no loss of constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"A1\">\u00b629 <em>2. Did the District Court err in admitting a hearsay statement into evidence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b630 As noted above, in the exchange between J.P. and the State\u2019s attorney, the District Court admitted into evidence T.P.\u2019s hearsay statement, \u201cGrandpa tried raping me.\u201d Cameron argues that T.P.\u2019s statement was inadmissible as a prior consistent statement. The State agrees but contends that the statement was admissible as an excited utterance. Both parties agree that it does not fit within the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule as the State argued at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b631 The record is silent both as to the prosecution\u2019s reason for offering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>the statement and as to the court\u2019s justification for admitting it. The statement clearly was not present sense impression since it did not describe contemporaneous events. <em>See </em>Rule 803(1), M.R.Evid. However, we will affirm a district court\u2019s ruling even if it reached the correct result for the wrong reason. <em>Davis v. State, </em>2004 MT 112, \u00b6 13, 321 Mont. 118, \u00b6 13, 88 P.3d 1285, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">\u00b632 The State argues that the District Court\u2019s ruling should be upheld because the statement was an excited utterance. Rule 803(2), M.R.Evid., defines an excited utterance as a \u201cstatement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.\u201d We have not previously considered this hearsay exception under similar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b633 The record indicates thatT.P. arrived at Cameron\u2019s trailer around six or seven in the evening. It is not clear how long T.P. stayed at Cameron\u2019s before she was attacked and ran home, but she evidently had enough time to converse with Cameron, play with the pet bird, and use the restroom. After the attack, T.P. had to travel roughly eight miles on foot, running at first and then walking. Very shortly after arriving home, T.P. made the statement to her sister. Thus, although the testimony is imprecise about the time which had elapsed, it can be reasonably inferred from the testimony that T.P. made the statement within an horn: or two after the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u00b634 Further circumstances are also relevant to resolution of this issue. T.P. wept from the moment she left Cameron\u2019s until well after she uttered the hearsay statement. As she arrived home, T.P. showed no sign of diminished excitement. To the contrary, when her sister went to the porch, T.P.\u2019s physical action of grabbing J.P. and clutching her firmly until she was able to cease sobbing long enough to utter, \u201cGrandpa tried raping me,\u201d demonstrates that T.P. was still laboring under the stress of excitement caused by the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\u00b635 Given these circumstances, we agree with the State. The facts adequately demonstrate that T.P. made a statement relating to a startling event while she was under the stress caused by the event. Thus, we conclude that her statement was an excited utterance as defined by Rule 803(2), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\u00b636 Though we have not previously addressed the question, our conclusion is not without precedent in other states. <em>See State v. Strauss </em>(Wash. 1992), 832 P.2d 78, 86 (victim\u2019s statement to officer qualified as an excited utterance, though made up to three and a half horn's after her flight from a rapist); <em>State v. Parker </em>(Idaho 1986), 730 P.2d 921, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>924 (affirming as an excited utterance a crying, red-eyed, tired-looking, fourteen-year-old victim\u2019s statement to her cousin, a State Fish and Game officer, two to three hours after her rape by a stranger, even though she silently waited for the cousin in the presence of her parents); <em>State v. Burns </em>(R.I.1987), 524 A.2d 564, 567 (eleven-year-old child\u2019s statement to mother hours after rape by stepfather was properly admitted as an excited utterance because the child\u2019s \u201cupset\u201d and \u201csuspicious\u201d demeanor, her fear of the defendant, her hesitancy in speaking about the incident, her tender years, and the short time between the incident and her mother\u2019s arrival home tended to show the statements were sufficiently trustworthy and not the product of deliberation or contrivance); <em>Fudge v. State </em>(Ark. 2000), 20 S.W.3d 315, 321 (admission of victim\u2019s statement to friends, one to several hours after incident, that the defendant had beaten, choked, and raped her was not abuse of discretion where victim appeared nervous and scared until some time after she made the statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b637  For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the statement into evidence because it qualified under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b638 The District Court did not err by refusing the defendant\u2019s proposed instruction on misdemeanor assault as a lesser included offense of felony sexual assault. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the hearsay statement into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\u00b639 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b88-8\">JUSTICES LEAPHART , COTTER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-5\"> 45-5-201 Assault.
