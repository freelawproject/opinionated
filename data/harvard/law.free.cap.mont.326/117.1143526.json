We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">\u00b62 We must decide whether Robert James (James), an attorney for an adverse party in a related case, has standing to petition for a conservatorship of Kloss pursuant to \u00a7 72-5-401, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">\u00b63 Kloss is a 97 year old widow without any children or grandchildren. Until 1998, when Kloss fell and broke her legs, hip, and pelvis, forcing her move from her apartment to an assisted living facility in Great Falls, she had no living relatives in Montana. Kloss requested, due to her injuries, that Kenneth Parrent (Parrent), Kloss\u2019s 71 year old nephew, move from Colorado to Great Falls, to assist in the care of Kloss\u2019s affairs. Kloss executed an unlimited power of attorney for Parrent to manage her assets, worth approximately $963,500, and Parrent later became sole trustee of Kloss\u2019s living trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">\u00b64 Kloss filed suit against her brokerage firm, Edward Jones and its local manager, Paul Husted (Husted), alleging they tortiously caused her to execute a charitable remainder trust. Parrent retained Joseph Engel, III, (Engel) to prosecute the action and to represent both Kloss and Parrent\u2019s interests. Our decision in <em>Kloss v. Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., </em>2002 MT 129, 310 Mont. 123, 54 P.3d 1, emerged from Kloss\u2019s action, where we decided that Kloss had not waived her constitutional right to a jury trial by executing a brokerage service agreement that contained a mandatory arbitration provision. We held that the brokerage service agreement constituted a contract of adhesion and, therefore, the mandatory arbitration provision could not be enforced. <em>Kloss v. Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29, 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">\u00b65 James and Cathy Lewis (Lewis) represented Edward Jones and Husted in <em>Kloss v. Edward D. Jones &amp; Co. </em>During the discovery process, J ames and Lewis learned that Kloss\u2019s estate had been depleted of more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>than $800,000 under Parrent\u2019s management, with over $400,000 being paid to Parrent and Engel for their services. James also learned that Parrent had previously petitioned the court to be appointed conservator of Kloss\u2019s estate and that when Kloss\u2019s other family members from Colorado and Washington were notified of Parrent\u2019s petition, they wrote letters to the court expressing their objections to Parrent\u2019s management of Kloss\u2019s financial matters. Based on this information, James, in consultation with the other partners in his firm, sought appointment of a conservator for Kloss. James filed the petition separately and in a different court from the <em>Kloss v. Edward D. Jones &amp; Co. </em>litigation, and his petition did not seek to have himself or any member of his firm appointed conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b66 Kloss objected on the grounds that James, as counsel for an adverse party, could not be considered \u201cinterested in [Mrs. Kloss\u2019s] welfare\u201d under \u00a7 72-5-401, MCA, and, therefore, lacked standing to petition for a conservatorship on her behalf. The District Court denied Kloss\u2019s motion after holding a hearing on the petition where it heard testimony from Kloss, James, Parrent, a court-appointed visitor, Kloss\u2019s new broker at Dain Rauscher, and an employee at the facility where Kloss lives. The District Court ordered appointment of a conservator to represent Kloss and to investigate \u201cany potential claims that may be made against individuals who were involved with Mrs. Kloss and her affairs over the last several years.\u201d Kloss appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u00b67 We conduct plenary review of a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s conclusions are correct as a matter of law. <em>Williams v. Schwager, </em>2002 MT 107, \u00b6 22, 309 Mont. 455, \u00b6 22, 47 P.3d 839, \u00b6 22 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">\u00b68  Under \u00a7 72-5-401, MCA, regarding the appointment of guardians or conservators, <em>\u201cany </em>person who is interested in [the protected person\u2019s]... welfare ... may petition for the appointment of a conservator.\u201d (Emphasis added). Kloss urges us to interpret \u201cperson who is interested in\u201d under \u00a7 72-5-401, MCA, to be \u201cinterested person\u201d Tinder the more general definitions of the Uniform Probate Code. This interpretation, Kloss contends, limits those who may petition for a conservatorship to those who have a property right in or claim against the estate. <em>See </em>\u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA, (defining \u201cinterested person\u201d as including \u201cheirs, devisees, children, spouses, creditors, beneficiaries, and any others having a property right in or a claim against a ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>protected person\u201d); <em>In re Estate of Miles v. Miles, </em>2000 MT 41, \u00b6 46, 298 Mont. 312, \u00b6 46, 994 P.2d 1139, \u00b6 46 (holding that an \u201cinterested person,\u201d in order to have standing, must have a property right in or claim against the estate); <em>In re Estates of Esterbrook and Simmons, </em>2003 MT 317, \u00b6 7, 318 Mont. 275, \u00b6 7, 80 P.3d 419, \u00b6 7 (interpreting \u201c[a] person who is furnishing or supplying any money for support or care of a person for whom a conservator has been appointed is a person interested in the welfare of the protected person\u201d under \u00a7 72-5-413(4), MCA, as an \u201cinterested person\u201d under \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b69 We decline in this instance, however, to accept Kloss\u2019s offer to change the language in \u00a7 72-5-401, MCA, from \u201cany person who is interested\u201d to \u201cinterested person.\u201d Section 72-1-103, MCA, provides that the definition of \u201cinterested person\u201d applies unless the context otherwise requires. Further, \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA, provides that, in addition to having a property right in or a claim against the protected person, the meaning of interested person, \u201cmay vary from time to time and must be determined according to the particular purposes of and matter involved in any proceeding.\u201d We determine this matter to be one of those times.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b610  The District Court found, and we agree, that the legislature broadly defined those who have standing to petition the court on behalf of another under \u00a7 72-5-401, MCA. When interpreting a statute, we seek to implement the objectives the legislature sought to achieve, and if the legislative intent can be determined from the plain language of the statute, the plain language controls. <em>In re Co-Guardianship of D.A., JR., </em>2004 MT 302, \u00b6 14, 323 Mont. 442, \u00b6 14, 100 P.3d 650, \u00b6 14. We further recognize that conservatorship proceedings exist to promote the best interests of the protected person. <em>Estate of Bayers, </em>2001 MT 49, \u00b6 14, 304 Mont. 296, \u00b6 14, 21 P.3d 3, \u00b6 14. The plain language of \u00a7 72-5-401, MCA, reads broadly enough to include those interested in the welfare of the protected person. James, under these facts, sought to protect Kloss from the continued rapid depletion of her estate; the depletion of which she had no knowledge according to her testimony at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u00b611 The District Court concluded that James\u2019s representation of Kloss\u2019s adversary in a separate action does not preclude him from acting in Kloss\u2019s best interests. The court noted that a conservatorship proceeding, being similar to a guardianship proceeding, is not an adversarial matter. <em>Bayers, </em>\u00b6 14. No error arises from the District Court\u2019s analysis under the facts of this case. The record clearly shows that James developed an interest in Kloss\u2019s welfare through the knowledge he gained by working on <em>Kloss v. Edwards D. Jones &amp; Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>James discovered facts that led him to believe that Parrent and Engel had depleted Kloss\u2019s estate at an alarming rate and to Kloss\u2019s detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b612  Kloss also has failed to demonstrate that James had a conflict of interest in petitioning for appointment of a conservator. James received no compensation for pursuing the conservatorship and nothing in the record suggests that James\u2019s clients, Edward Jones and Husted, benefitted. The fact that James represented adverse interests in a related case does not, in and of itself, disqualify him from petitioning for a conservatorship under \u00a7 72-5-401, MCA. We agree with the District Court that James filed the petition to protect Kloss and not for any other or improper purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u00b613 Kloss further invites us to decide that James lacked standing because he has no personal stake in the outcome of the controversy. This argument closely mirrors her \u201cinterested person\u201d argument. Kloss points out that we have held when distributing estates, a party does not have standing unless it possesses a personal stake in the outcome. <em>See In re Estate of Goick </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 13, 19, 909 P.2d 1165, 1169 (overruled on other grounds by <em>Lockhead v. Weinstein, </em>2003 MT 360, \u00b6 16, 319 Mont. 62, \u00b6 16, 81 P.3d 1284, \u00b6 16). We do not have in this instance, however, a matter where James must possess a personal stake. James has not requested the District Court to distribute an estate, but rather requested that Kloss and her estate be protected from further alleged exploitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u00b614 Kloss also argues James\u2019s petition constitutes a collateral attack on <em>Kloss v. Edward D. Jones &amp; Co. </em>and was designed \u201cto wear down and intimidate the elderly Mrs. Kloss ... so she would not have the stomach or stamina for trial\u201d in that matter. We do not view James's petition for a conservator to be a collateral attack because as pointed out in \u00b612 above, we agree with the District Court that James filed the petition to protect Kloss and not for any other or improper purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\u00b615 Kloss further contends that James\u2019s petition contains \u201coutrageous accusations against both her nephew and attorney.\u201d According to the testimony and evidence presented at the hearing to dismiss the petition, however, the value of Kloss\u2019s estate had suffered a precipitous decline under Parrent\u2019s supervision with substantial sums paid to Parrent and Engel for their services. In fact, it appears that, under their watch, the value of Kloss\u2019s estate declined by more than $800,000. Parrent is Kloss\u2019s declared dependent, lives in Kloss\u2019s house with his fiance, and he testified at the hearing that he is entirely dependent on Kloss\u2019s estate for his living expenses and income. Kloss, by contrast, testified that she was unaware that Parrent allegedly used her money for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>own personal legal matters and may have transferred much of her estate into technology stocks, when her previous investments generally involved low-risk investments designed to provide her daily living expenses. As for Engel, he allegedly charged both an hourly fee and a contingency fee for the same work and received more than $200,000 in fees, although Kloss testified that she had paid Engel only several thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b616 Finally, we note that the record shows that Parrent had argued that Kloss was competent to manage her financial affairs during the <em>Kloss v. Edward D. Jones &amp; Co. </em>litigation and even obtained a doctor\u2019s opinion to that effect. On the other hand, Parrent petitioned that he be appointed conservator of Kloss\u2019s estate. Parrent must have believed that Kloss needed a conservator to protect her estate based upon her inability to manage her financial affairs. Although the court never held a hearing on Parrent\u2019s petition, a number of Kloss\u2019s relatives expressed grave concerns to the court about Parrent\u2019s possible appointment. Now Parrent apparently has expended more of Kloss\u2019s money to oppose James\u2019s petition to protect Kloss\u2019s assets when Parrent earlier believed that she needed such protection, albeit with him serving as conservator. \u00b617 Based on these allegations, and the fact that Kloss\u2019s estate has been depleted by more than $800,000, we conclude James qualified as \u201cinterested\u201d in Kloss\u2019s welfare under \u00a7 72-5-401, MCA, and had standing, under these circumstances, to petition for a conservatorship for Kloss. The District Court concluded that Kloss needed a conservator to investigate \u201cany potential claims that may be made against individuals who were involved with Mrs. Kloss and her affairs over the last several years.\u201d This conservator will investigate whether James\u2019s petition was designed to intimidate Kloss or whether his \u201coutrageous accusations\u201d regarding the conduct of Parrent and Engel withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b618  We conclude, therefore, that the District Court correctly concluded that James had standing to petition for the appointment of a conservator for Kloss pursuant to \u00a7 72-5-401, MCA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b148-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
