We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred by awarding Nicki maintenance before determining the value of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in determining Jackson\u2019s income for purposes of calculating Nicki\u2019s maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\u00b65 Jackson and Nicki were married on July 31,1976, in Deer Lodge, Montana. The parties separated in March 2003 and on May 2, 2003, Nicki filed a petition for legal separation and later dissolution in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County. The parties later changed venue to the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Rosebud County.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\u00b66 Jackson owns a business providing heating, ventilation and air conditioning services. He purchased a van for use in his business in 2002 and deducted the entire cost of the van from his gross income pursuant to \u00a7 179 of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 179). At the time of trial, Jackson suffered an injury while working that limited his ability to perform rudimentary tasks and prompted him to hire an employee to execute the necessary physical work until he recovered from his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">\u00b67 Nicki is unemployed, but she receives Social Security disability payments stemming from an illness that she contracted at age 14. Nicki\u2019s illness has necessitated 20 surgeries and limited the type and extent of work that she can perform as well as the schooling that she can complete. The Social Security Administration periodically reviews her medical condition as it relates to her ability to work and has never found her fit to work. Nicki remains disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">\u00b68 The District Court held a proceeding and entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decree of Dissolution of Marriage on May 25, 2004, awarding Nicki spousal maintenance in the amount of $1100 and a percentage of the marital estate. Jackson filed a motion to alter or amend the court\u2019s judgment, contending the court erred by adding income deductions from his business in its valuation of marital assets and thereby awarding Nicki a disproportionate share of the marital estate in addition to maintenance. The District Court issued its amended order on July 26, 2004, finding that it incorrectly had added the entire amount of Jackson\u2019s business deductions for purposes of calculating the marital estate. The court accordingly reduced Nicki\u2019s maintenance award to $735, but did not reapportion the marital estate. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s division of marital property and maintenance awards to determine whether the findings of fact upon which the division is based proves clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage of Lee </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 410, 417, 938 P.2d 650, 654. A district court\u2019s findings prove clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the court made a mistake. <em>In re Marriage of Steinbeisser, </em>2002 MT 309, \u00b6 17, 313 Mont. 74, \u00b6 17, 60 P.3d 441, \u00b6 17. Absent clearly erroneous findings, this Court will affirm a district court\u2019s division of property and award of maintenance unless we identify an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Gerhart, </em>2003 MT 292, \u00b6 16, 318 Mont. 94, \u00b6 16, 78 P.3d 1219, \u00b6 16. A district court may award maintenance after marital property has been divided equitably pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, and the court properly has applied the criteria of \u00a7 40-4-203, MCA. <em>In re Marriage of Weed </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 162, 168, 836 P.2d 591, 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b610 Whether the District Court erred by awarding Nicki maintenance before determining the value of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">\u00b611 Jackson argues on appeal that the District Court erred in awarding Nicki maintenance before determining an equitable division of the marital estate. Jackson also contends that the court reduced the value of the marital estate in its amended findings, but declined to adjust the equitable division of the estate. Finally, Jackson alleges that Nicki failed to prove that she was entitled to maintenance and that he was able to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">\u00b612  A district court may grant a maintenance order for either spouse only if it finds that the spouse seeking maintenance lacks sufficient property to provide for his reasonable needs and proves unable to support himself through appropriate employment. Section 40-4-203(l)(a-b), MCA. The district court\u2019s maintenance order shall consider, among other things, the amount and duration of the party\u2019s request; the financial resources of the party seeking maintenance, including marital property and ability to meet financial needs; the duration and standard of living established during the marriage; the age and the physical and emotional condition of the spouse seeking maintenance; and the ability of the spouse from whom maintenance is sought to meet his needs as well as his spouse. Section 40-4-203(2)(a-f), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>MCA. Although a district court must consider each of the factors listed in \u00a7 40-4-203, MCA, the court need not make specific findings of fact regarding each factor, so long as this Court can determine that the trial judge actually considered each factor. <em>In re Marriage ofGrende, </em>2004 MT 36, \u00b6 38, 320 Mont. 38, \u00b6 38, 85 P.3d 788, \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b613  We conclude that substantial evidence supported the District Court\u2019s maintenance award after it valued and distributed the marital shares. The District Court initially valued the parties\u2019 assets and liabilities in determining the marital estate before equitably apportioning and distributing the marital shares to the parties. <em>In re Marriage of Hilt </em>(1984), 209 Mont. 140, 146-47, 679 P.2d 783, 786-87 (holding that pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-202 and \u00a7 40-4-203, MCA, a court may award maintenance after it has made an equitable distribution of property that proves insufficient to provide for the spouse\u2019s financial needs). The court awarded Nicki maintenance in the amount of $1100 per month based on her budgetary needs, including standard of living, disability income, and the physical impairment precluding her from work. <em>In re Marriage of Harris </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 291, 294, 828 P.2d 1365, 1367 (holding that an award of maintenance was proper based on evidence that a 54-year-old woman who was classified as totally disabled by the Social Security Administration, and as characterized by her own testimony as unemployable, could not work). Although the court later amended its findings to reflect Jackson\u2019s business deductions and the corresponding reduction in his income, this correction reflects Jackson\u2019s effort to reapportion the martial share, and not an attempt by the court to award maintenance before distributing property. The court thus properly considered the distribution of property and maintenance in tandem. <em>Hilt, </em>209 Mont, at 147, 679 P.2d at 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b614  Nicki lacks sufficient property to provide for her reasonable needs and Jackson will be able to provide for her needs in the future. <em>In re Marriage of Pfeifer </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 461, 472, 938 P.2d 684, 691 (maintenance should be awarded only if the spouse lacks sufficient property or is unable to support herself through employment). J ackson does not dispute that Nicki lacks sufficient property to provide for her needs or that he will be able to provide for her needs after he recuperates from his injuries. Further, the court\u2019s amended findings reducing the marital estate, but not reapportioning the shares, reflects the court\u2019s determination regarding Jackson\u2019s greater ability to produce income and acquire assets in the future as well as the reduced maintenance awarded to Nicki. An equitable disposition does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>require a 50/50 distribution of the marital estate. <em>In re Marriage of McNellis </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 492, 501, 885 P.2d 412, 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b615  We recognize that district courts face a considerable task in determining a maintenance award. In the final analysis, it is not a question of whether we would be persuaded to reach a different conclusion after considering the same evidence. Rather, the test remains \u201cwhether the district court had adequate evidence to support its conclusions.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Haines, </em>2002 MT 182, \u00b6 23, 311 Mont. 70, \u00b6 23, 53 P.3d 378, \u00b6 23. Thus, we conclude that appropriate findings of fact supported the District Court\u2019s decision to award maintenance that were, in turn, amply supported by the record. We affirm the award of maintenance to Nicki.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u00b616 Whether the District Court erred in determining Jackson\u2019s income for the purposes of calculating Nicki\u2019s maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u00b617 Jackson argues that the District Court improperly added to his income business deductions and back taxes in determining Nicki\u2019s maintenance. Jackson alleges that the court misconstrued the deduction provision allowing taxpayers to treat the cost of certain property as an expense in one taxable year and instead considered the deduction as a straight line depreciation that would add back income over a period of years. Jackson further contends that the court failed to consider his temporary disability in determining his ability to produce and provide income.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\u00b618 Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code allows taxpayers to elect to treat the cost of depreciable property purchased for use in the active conduct of a trade or business as an expense in the year that the property is placed in service, rather than as property that is capitalized and thereafter subject to depreciation over a number of years. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 179. At issue here is whether the District Court should have used a Section 179 deduction claimed by Jackson\u2019s business for the benefit of Jackson to lower his monthly net income for the purposes of calculating spousal maintenance. We have not considered the question before and neither party cites any authority directly on point. Jackson contends, however, that we should adopt analogous reasoning from other jurisdictions that have concluded that all \u201creasonable unreimbursed legitimate business expenses\u201d should be deducted from income in determining child support obligations. <em>Watson v. Watson </em>(Wyo. 2002), 60 P.3d 124, 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">\u00b619 In <em>Watson, the </em>father argued on appeal that the district court erred in recalculating his child support obligation by adding back to his income the business expenses deducted from his federal income tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>pursuant Section 179. The Wyoming Supreme Court held that, unlike depreciation that fails to reflect an actual cash expenditure, a Section 179 deduction reduces available resources from which to pay child support and therefore should not be added back to income. The court reasoned that in determining a parent\u2019s income for child support purposes, all \u201creasonable unreimbursed legitimate business expenses\u201d such as a Section 179 expense should be deducted from income. <em>Watson, </em>60 P.3d at 127-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b620  We deem <em>Watson </em>inapposite here and instead adopt the reasoning of other jurisdictions that have concluded that depreciation or deductions should not be deducted categorically as an expense or treated as income in all instances, but rather that the extent of its inclusion, if any, should depend on the particular circumstances of each case. <em>In re Marriage of Gaer </em>(Iowa 1991), 476 N.W.2d 324, 328; <em>see also Stoner v. Stoner </em>(Conn. 1972), 307 A.2d 146, 151. This approach remains consistent both with the statutory flexibility afforded to the court to award maintenance \u201cas the court deems just\u201d and our case law permitting district courts wide discretion in determining maintenance awards. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-4-203, MCA; <em>Harris, </em>252 Mont, at 298, 828 P.2d at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u00b621 In <em>Harris, </em>the husband argued on appeal that he no longer had sufficient wealth to pay $800 in maintenance to his wife and still meet his own needs. He contended that the district court failed to consider that his adjusted gross income included depreciation and payments on certain non-income producing properties. We concluded that substantial evidence supported the district court\u2019s order refusing the husband\u2019s deductions for non-income producing properties as they would distort his actual income from $30,000 to $22,219. <em>Harris, </em>252 Mont, at 298, 828 P.2d at 1369. We thus ordered the husband to pay $800 per month in maintenance to support his wife. <em>Harris, </em>252 Mont, at 298, 828 P.2d at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u00b622  We conclude that the District Court correctly determined Jackson\u2019s income for the purposes of calculating Nicki\u2019s maintenance. The District Court properly adjusted Jackson\u2019s income from $31,308.40 to $25,541.59 in order to provide him sufficient cash flow to maintain his business and also to meet his maintenance obligations. Further, the court spread the depreciation over the useful fife of the van, rather than a substantial part of it being taken in the first and only year, so that Jackson could sustain the business without depriving Nicki of her needs. The court thus concluded that in light of the reduced maintenance and the greater ability of Jackson to produce income and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>acquire assets in the future, it would decline to adjust the distribution of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b623  We therefore conclude that appropriate findings of fact supported the District Court\u2019s decision to include Jackson\u2019s business deductions in calculating Nicki\u2019s maintenance award that were, in turn, amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u00b624 We affirm the award of maintenance to Nicki.</p>\n<judges id=\"b492-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
