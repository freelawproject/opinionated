We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b62 J.A. presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">1. Did the District Court make clearly erroneous Findings of Fact amounting to an abuse of discretion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">2. Did the District Court err by not making any findings or conclusions determining V.F.A. was a youth in need of care by clear and convincing evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">\u00b63 V.F.A. was born October 18,2001, to mother J.A. and father D.A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 24, 2001, DPHHS petitioned for investigative authority and removed V.F.A. from J.A.\u2019s care upon discharge from the hospital after her birth. DPHHS subsequently petitioned for temporary legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">\u00b64 J.A. admitted to using drugs in the past, including usage while pregnant with V.F.A. J.A. was offered two Treatment Plans by DPHHS, both of which had the purpose of rehabilitating her so as to allow her to parent V.F.A. The first Treatment Plan covered the period from October 19, 2001, to January 19, 2002. The second Treatment Plan covered the period from May 20,2002, to September 1,2002. The court approved both Treatment Plans, but J. A. did not sign either one. \u00b65 The District Court granted temporary legal custody on February 19, 2002, finding by a preponderance of the evidence that V.F.A. was a \u201cyouth in need of care.\u201d DPHHS subsequently moved for permanent legal custody and termination of J.A.\u2019s parental rights. A hearing on this petition was conducted before the District Court on various days in October, November, and December, 2002, and January, February, and March, 2003. The District Court granted the petition October 8, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b66  We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>In re Matter of J.V., </em>2003 MT 68, \u00b6 7, 314 Mont. 487, \u00b6 7, 67 P.3d 242, \u00b6 7 (citation omitted). The test for an abuse of discretion is \u201cwhether the trial court acted arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>In re </em>K.C.H., 2003 MT 125, \u00b6 11, 316 Mont. 13, \u00b6 11, 68 P.3d 788, \u00b6 11 (citation omitted). However, because a parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest, it must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. <em>J.V., </em>\u00b6 7 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b67  To satisfy the relevant statutory requirements for terminating a parent-child relationship, a district court must make specific factual findings. We review those findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. It is well established that in reviewing a district court\u2019s findings, this Court does not consider whether the evidence could support a different finding; nor does it substitute its judgment for that of the fact-finder regarding the weight given to the evidence. <em>In re D.V., </em>2003 MT 160, \u00b6 23, 316 Mont. 282, \u00b6 23, 70 P.3d 1253, \u00b6 23 (citation omitted). It is the district court\u2019s responsibility to weigh the evidence presented and ascertain witnesses\u2019 corresponding credibility. <em>In re K.S., </em>2003 MT 212, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 88, \u00b6 20, 75 P.3d 325, \u00b6 20. Lastly, we review the court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court interpreted the law correctly. <em>J.V., </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u00b68  The district court is bound to give primary consideration to the physical, mental and emotional conditions and needs of the children. Consequently, the best interests of the children are of paramount concern in a parental rights termination proceeding and take precedence over the parental rights. Section 41-3-609(3), MCA. Moreover, the party seeking to terminate parental rights must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory requirements for termination have been met. <em>J.V., </em>\u00b6 8 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Axi\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">\u00b69 Did the District Court make clearly erroneous Findings of Fact amounting to an abuse of discretion?</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">\u00b610 J.A. argues the District Court\u2019s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order are clearly contrary to the witness testimony and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>exhibits presented to the District Court. Specifically, J.A. assigns error to the District Court\u2019s findings in regard to her parenting ability, her urine analysis (UA) and hair sample testing results, the testimony of psychologist Dr. Woolston, and her progress with her therapist, Darryl Weber. J.A. argues that minor noncompliance with a Treatment Plan does not render her an unfit parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b611 DPHHS responds that J.A.\u2019s refusal to comply with either of her Treatment Plans supports the District Court\u2019s findings. DPHHS points to J.A.\u2019s testimony at trial where she admitted to not complying with several terms of the Treatment Plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b612 To terminate a parent-child relationship, a district court must determine that one of the criteria in \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, exists. <em>In re </em>1998 MT 142, \u00b6 16, 289 Mont. 232, \u00b6 16, 961 P.2d 105, \u00b6 16. The sections of this statute relevant to this case are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">(1) The court may order a termination of the parent-child legal relationship upon a finding ... that any of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">(f) the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">(i) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">(ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">\u00b613  Complete compliance with a treatment plan is required. <em>D.V., </em>\u00b6 27. Substantial or partial compliance is insufficient to prove that a person is prepared to be a fit or responsible parent. <em>D.V., </em>\u00b6 27. From a thorough review of the record, it is apparent that J.A. did not completely comply with either of her Treatment Plans. A DPHHS social worker testified that J.A. did not meet all of the goals outlined in the Treatment Plans and did not comply with either Treatment Plan. Specifically, the evidence showed J.A. had suspect UA\u2019s, was failing to keep her social worker informed of the people living in her home, was failing to provide monthly verification of her income, was not consistently demonstrating increased parenting skills, was not following the recommendations of the Family Support Network, would not sign a general medical release, did not provide DPHHS information relating to her application for Social Security benefits, and did not maintain income through employment or other legal means. J.A. admitted to some of these things during her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u00b614 Additionally, testimony supported the District Court\u2019s conclusion that J.A.\u2019s conduct and condition rendering her unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Specifically, the evidence showed J.A. had a long history of choosing drugs over her children and that she either suffered from serious medical problems or was exaggerating them in order to claim she was not capable of securing gainful employment. The District Court refused to accept her contention that she was too disabled by her medical conditions to maintain employment, but was still capable of parenting a young child on a full-time basis. Further, a clinical psychologist testified J.A. was underestimating the demands of being a parent and that she would not comply with the intent of her Treatment Plans a minute longer than necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\u00b615  While J.A. did present some evidence of her intent to change her lifestyle, there was also ample evidence to the contrary. This Court does not consider whether the evidence offered could support a different finding; nor does it substitute its judgment for that of the fact-finder regarding the weight given to the evidence. <em>D.V.,\u00b6 </em>23. Even if the District Court\u2019s findings contain a few minor errors, there was more than sufficient evidence to support the District Court\u2019s determination that J.A. failed to comply with either Treatment Plan and that J.A.\u2019s conduct and condition rendering her unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Thus, we conclude the District Court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous and the District Court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b616 Did the District Court err by not making any findings or conclusions determining V.F.A. was a youth in need of care by clear and convincing evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u00b617 J.A. faults the District Court for not making a finding that clear and convincing evidence existed rendering V.F.A. a \u201cyouth in need of care.\u201d J.A. asserts the District Court merely relied on its findings from the February 19,2002, temporary custody proceeding which bore the lesser standard of proof, preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">\u00b618  Section 41-3-609(1), MCA, outlined earlier, does not require the District Court, in the termination proceeding, to find by clear and convincing evidence that the child is a youth in need of care; rather, it requires a finding that the child is an <em>adjudicated </em>youth in need of care. The District Court made this finding in its Finding of Fact Number 2. Further, in Conclusion of Law Number 7, the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>applied the correct standard of proof noting that DPHHS \u201cpresented clear and convincing evidence to establish that continuation of the parent-child legal relationship between [V.F.A. and J.A.] will likely result in continued abuse and neglect, and will likely cause serious emotional damage to this child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b619  Thus, the District Court did not err and made the proper Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law supporting the termination of the parent-child legal relationship between J.A. and V.F.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\u00b620 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b415-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-12\"> D.A.\u2019s parental rights have also been terminated and are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
