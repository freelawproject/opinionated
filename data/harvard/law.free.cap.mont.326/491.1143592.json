We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">\u00b62 The restated issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in granting partial summary judgment to the defendant on Rolison\u2019s federal and state retaliation claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court manifestly abuse its discretion in denying Rolison\u2019s motion for a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">\u00b65 3. In awarding costs to the prevailing defendant, did the District Court err by failing to apply the \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation\u201d standard?</p>\n<p id=\"b519-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">\u00b66 Bozeman Deaconess Health Services, Inc. (Deaconess) employed Rolison as a registered nurse in its hospital\u2019s endoscopy unit beginning in June of 2000. In March of 2001, Rolison filed a gender discrimination claim with the Montana Human Rights Bureau (HRB). The HRB discrimination complaint is not of record, but Rolison\u2019s deposition testimony reflects his belief that Deaconess discriminated against him on the basis of gender by posing certain questions and making statements to him and other staff members around the time of his job interview; not giving him a uniform; \u201cwriting him up\u201d for issues including failing to check in with day surgery before leaving; addressing errors in his charting; and failing to offer him a posted full-time equivalent position. Rolison obtained a supporting witness statement from Pam Styren, another nurse in the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b67 On September 18,2001, Rolison submitted a letter of resignation to Deaconess stating his last day of work would be October 16. He wrote his \u201cprimary concerns\u201d were \u201cvarying and preferential treatment of employees by the supervisor,\u201d \u201c[a] hostile work environment i.e., retaliatory accusations and discomfort from being more closely scrutinized than other employees, since filing a union grievance and consulting an attorney[,]\u201d and inconsistency in scheduling.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b68 On September 24, Rolison met with Hollie Raycraft, his supervisor, and Kathleen Wiese, the department manager. Deaconess\u2019 notes of the meeting-which Rolison later characterized as \u201cprobably\u201d accurate and \u201cprobably better than [his] memory\u2019-outline the following about the substance of the meeting. Raycraft and Wiese told Rolison that, on the basis of a collective bargaining agreement provision, they would not require him to work through October 16; they gave him a check compensating him through that date. Robson then asked when they would discuss a sexual harassment allegation against him. Raycraft and Wiese explained that discussing the allegation was not necessary because Rolison had resigned and would no longer be working there. Rolison stated he wanted to discuss it. Raycraft and Wiese responded that, if he insisted on a discussion, documentation of the matter would become part of his file. Rolison indicated he understood, and insisted on discussing the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u00b69 After the discussion, Raycraft and Wiese showed Rolison an untitled document stating, in part, that he would be required to complete online sexual harassment training and to summarize its key points. The document also stated \u201c[t]his is the implementation of the first step of the Progressive Performance Improvement Process\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>failure to comply would result in \u201ccontinuation of the disciplinary process up to and including termination[.]\u201d Raycraft and Wiese told him the purpose of discussing the allegation-absent his resignation-would have been to advise him that his behavior had made some of his co-workers uncomfortable and to prevent future occurrences. Rolison noted the September 18 date on the document. Raycraft and Wiese stated they had originally intended to discuss the allegation with him on that date, but he was unable to meet with them at that time. Then, after they received his resignation, they had decided not to discuss the allegation with him at all. Rolison signed the document, obtained a copy and stated \u201c[t]hank you-this is what my attorney wanted me to get.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b610 Rolison filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and a retaliation claim with the HRB in September of 2001. In October, Rolison sued Deaconess in the District Court, asserting discrimination and retaliation in violation of the Montana Human Rights Act (MHRA) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), as well as wrongful discharge under the Montana Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act (WDEA). The District Court dismissed the WDEA claim on Deaconess\u2019 motion, with the parties apparently agreeing the existence of a collective bargaining agreement precluded that claim. The parties jointly moved to stay the proceedings because Rolison had not yet exhausted his administrative remedies, and the District Court subsequently lifted the stay after Rolison filed a right to sue letter from the EEOC. The parties do not dispute that Rolison also obtained a right to sue letter on his HRB discrimination and retaliation claims before the court entered any rulings at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u00b611 Deaconess subsequently moved for summary judgment. After a hearing, the District Court granted partial summary judgment to Deaconess on Rolison\u2019s MHRA and Title VII retaliation claims, but denied the motion as to his MHRA and Title VII discrimination claims. The case proceeded to trial on the discrimination claims and the jury rendered a verdict for Deaconess.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u00b612 Deaconess moved for entry of judgment and filed a memorandum of costs, which it subsequently amended to a lower amount. Rolison objected to the amended memorandum of costs, asserting some costs were not authorized by Montana law and others \u201cshould be denied given the... public policy to encourage claims under the Human Rights Act and Title VII[.]\u201d He also moved for a new trial. The next day, the District Court-apparently unaware of Rolison\u2019s objection and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>motion-entered judgment and awarded Deaconess costs in accordance with its amended memorandum of costs. The District Court later entered an order denying Rolison\u2019s motion for a new trial and reducing the costs awarded to Deaconess. Rolison appeals. We set forth additional facts as necessary in the discussion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b613 We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P., requires summary judgment when the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with any affidavits, show no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Arthur v. Pierre Ltd., </em>2004 MT 303, \u00b6 14, 323 Mont. 453, \u00b6 14, 100 P.3d 987, \u00b6 14 (citation omitted). We review a denial of a motion for a new trial to determine whether the district court manifestly abused its discretion. <em>Bailey v. Beartooth Communications Co., </em>2004 MT 128, \u00b6 10, 321 Mont. 305, \u00b6 10, 92 P.3d 1, \u00b6 10 (citation omitted). Finally, a district court\u2019s application of either \u00a7\u00a7 25-10-101 and -102, MCA, or a different standard in determining whether a party is entitled to costs constitutes a question of law, and we review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law for correctness. <em>See Neal v. State, </em>2003 MT 53, \u00b6 4, 314 Mont. 357, \u00b6 4, 66 P.3d 280, \u00b6 4 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u00b614 <em>1. Did the District Court err in granting partial summary judgment to Deaconess on Rolison\u2019s federal and state retaliation claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">\u00b615 As stated above, the District Court granted Deaconess partial summary judgment on Rolison\u2019s retaliation claims under Title VII and the MHRA. Rolison asserts error in both regards. The federal \u201cretaliation\u201d statute provides, in part, that an employer may not discriminate against an employee because the employee has made a charge or participated in a proceeding under Title VII. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Montana\u2019s statute provides, in part, that it is unlawful discriminatory practice for a person to discriminate against an individual because he or she has filed a complaint or participated in a proceeding under Title 49, Chapter 2, MCA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 49-2-301, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">\u00b616 On appeal, both parties advance the burden-shifting test for summary judgment motions in disparate treatment discrimination cases set forth in <em>Heiat v. Eastern Montana College </em>(1996), 275 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>322, 331-32, 912 P.2d 787, 793. Under that test, Montana courts first evaluate whether a plaintiffs complaint alleges a <em>prima facie </em>case. If the plaintiff alleges a <em>prima facie </em>case, the employer must present a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its alleged action. Once the employer presents a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason, the plaintiff must produce evidence establishing his or her <em>prima facie </em>case, as well as evidence raising an inference that the employer\u2019s proffered reason is pretextual. <em>See Heiat, </em>275 Mont, at 331-32, 912 P.2d at 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\u00b617  Applying <em>Heiat, </em>we first analyze whether Rolison\u2019s complaint alleges a <em>prima facie </em>retaliation case. The elements of a <em>prima facie </em>retaliation case under Title VII are: (1) the plaintiff engaged in a protected activity; (2) thereafter, the employer took an adverse employment action against the plaintiff; and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer\u2019s action. <em>Beaver v. DNRC, </em>2003 MT 287, \u00b6 71, 318 Mont. 35, \u00b6 71, 78 P.3d 857, \u00b6 71 (citing <em>Wrighten v. Metropolitan Hosps., Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1984), 726 F.2d 1346, 1354). In MHRA cases, the relevant administrative rule provides that the elements of a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation in the employment context vary, but generally consist of proof that the charging party was qualified for employment, engaged in a protected activity, and was subjected to adverse action, as well as a causal connection or other circumstances raising a reasonable inference that the charging party was treated differently because of the protected activity. Rule 24.9.610(2), ARM. Here, neither party sets forth the elements in Rule 24.9.610, ARM, and Deaconess does not dispute that Rolison was qualified for employment. Therefore, for purposes of analyzing Rolison\u2019s MHRA claim in this case, we focus first on the \u201cprotected activity\u201d and \u201cadverse employment action\u201d elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b618 Rolison\u2019s complaint alleged he filed an HRB gender discrimination claim, which the parties agree is a protected activity that satisfies the first element of alleging a <em>prima facie </em>retaliation case. With regard to the \u201cadverse employment action\u201d element, Rolison claimed Deaconess, \u201cthrough its agents and employees\u201d filed a sexual harassment allegation against him and a co-worker and, when he heard about it, he was constructively discharged. In addition, he claimed he \u201csuffered an adverse employment action when he was charged with sexual harassment for filing the claim of discrimination.\u201d Regarding the \u201ccausal link\u201d element, Rolison asserted the sexual harassment allegation occurred \u201c[a]s a result\u201d of and \u201cin retaliation for\u201d his HRB claim. We conclude Rolison\u2019s complaint alleges a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, as required under the first prong of the <em>Heiat </em>burden-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>shifting analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\">\u00b619 On appeal, Rolison does not address whether Deaconess met its burden under the second prong of <em>Heiat, </em>which requires the employer to present a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its alleged actions. Deaconess asserts it addressed the sexual harassment allegation with Rolison because it had a legal duty to do so. We note Raycraft\u2019s affidavit and Deaconess\u2019 notes of the September 24 meeting indicate Raycraft and Wiese did not intend to discuss the allegation with Rolison because he had resigned, and they discussed the matter only after Rolison insisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\u00b620 The appellant bears the burden of establishing error, however, and Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., requires the appellant to support arguments with citations to relevant authorities. <em>RSG Holdings v. Missoula Irrigation Dist., </em>2004 MT 214, \u00b6 14, 322 Mont. 369, \u00b6 14, 96 P.3d 1131, \u00b6 14 (citation omitted). Rolison has not asserted in the District Court or on appeal that Deaconess failed to present a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason. Moreover, whether Deaconess discussed the sexual harassment allegation against Rolison because it was performing a legal duty or because Rolison insisted, either scenario reflects a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason. Thus, under these unique circumstances, we conclude Deaconess met its burden under the second prong of <em>Heiat.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u00b621 Under the third prong of <em>Heiat, </em>Rolison must present evidence establishing his <em>prima facie </em>case and evidence raising an inference that Deaconess\u2019 proffered reason is pretextual. <em>Heiat, </em>275 Mont, at 331-32, 912 P.2d at 793. On appeal, Rolison asserts he was constructively discharged \u201cbased on [Deaconess\u2019] treatment of him over the six months since he filed with the EEOC.\u201d He has produced no evidence establishing his constructive discharge claim, however, citing only to his complaint and to the District Court\u2019s recitation of his claims in its order granting partial summary judgment. A nonmoving party may not defeat a summary judgment motion by relying solely on the pleadings and conclusory statements, but must provide material and substantial evidence. <em>See Hiebert v. Cascade County, </em>2002 MT 233, \u00b6 21, 311 Mont. 471, \u00b6 21, 56 P.3d 848, \u00b6 21 (citations omitted). Moreover, Deaconess points out-as it did in the District Court \u2014 that Rolison \u201cdisavowed\u201d his constructive discharge claim at his deposition. Rolison did not dispute the disavowal in the District Court, and he does not do so here. Since Rolison has disavowed the constructive discharge allegation set forth in his complaint, we need not address it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u00b622  Regarding the events of the September 24 meeting, the parties have agreed that Rolison established the \u201cprotected activity\u201d element of a <em>prima facie </em>case because he filed a gender discrimination claim and Deaconess was aware of it. With respect to the \u201cadverse employment action\u201d element, Rolison asserts on appeal that he submitted his resignation on September 24, Deaconess \u201crefused\u201d his resignation and he suffered a \u201csummary dismissal.\u201d He cites to nothing of record supporting these assertions, however, and the record establishes he resigned on September 18 and Deaconess accepted his resignation on September 24. As stated above, a nonmoving party may not merely set forth conclusory statements, but must provide material and substantial evidence. <em>See Hiebert, </em>\u00b6 21. Thus, we conclude Rolison has not raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Deaconess refused his resignation and summarily dismissed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">\u00b623 Rolison maintains, however, that the discussion of the sexual harassment allegation against him, relevant documentation and decision to compensate him in lieu of requiring him to work until October 16 \u201ccould be considered\u201d adverse employment actions. He repeatedly asserts Deaconess \u201cdisciplined\u201d him, but the record reflects that Rolison insisted on the only actions Deaconess took to address the allegation with him-the discussion and documentation. Moreover, Rolison has provided no evidence that Deaconess\u2019 decision to pay him to the effective date of his resignation, instead of requiring him to work, was in any way adverse to him. We conclude Rolison has not raised a genuine issue of material fact that any event during the September 24 meeting constituted an adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"AKC\">\u00b624 Finally, Rolison points to Deaconess\u2019 alleged treatment of Styren as a possible adverse employment action. He provides no authority, however, for the proposition that an employer\u2019s treatment of a plaintiffs co-worker may constitute an adverse employment action against the plaintiff. Nor does he advance evidence that the alleged treatment of Styren adversely affected him. As stated above, the appellant bears the burden of establishing error. <em>See RSG Holdings, </em>\u00b6 14. Because Rolison has not produced evidence or advanced authorities to support his assertion regarding Styren, we decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\u00b625  We conclude Rolison has not raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding the adverse employment action element of his retaliation claims. Therefore, we further conclude Rolison did not meet his burden under the third prong of the <em>Heiat </em>burden-shifting test of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>retaliation case.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u00b626 As stated above, the plaintiffs burden under the third prong of <em>Heiat </em>is to produce evidence establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case and evidence raising an inference of pretext. <em>See Heiat, </em>275 Mont, at 331-32, 912 P.2d at 793. Having concluded Rolison has not met his burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>retaliation case, we need not address whether he has presented evidence raising an inference that Deaconess\u2019 proffered reason was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\">\u00b627  We hold the District Court did not err in granting partial summary judgment to Deaconess on Rolison\u2019s state and federal retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">\u00b628 <em>2. Did the District Court manifestly abuse its discretion in denying Rolison\u2019s motion for a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u00b629 Relying on \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, and his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection, Rolison moved the District Court for a new trial, arguing his trial was unfair because Deaconess had concealed certain evidence during discovery, some of which was then produced, offered and admitted at trial. The District Court addressed each of Rolison\u2019s assertions in turn and denied his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\u00b630 In his brief on appeal, Rolison recites three of the statutory grounds enumerated in \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, on which a district court may grant a new trial. However, he argues only that he was denied a fair trial-pursuant to \u00a7 25-11-102(1), MCA-on his discrimination claims because Deaconess did not disclose certain exhibits before trial and the District Court made an evidentiary ruling \u201crefusing any evidence of discrimination following the [complaint] to the Human Rights Commission.\u201d In turn, he asserts this lack of a fair trial violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\u00b631 Regarding the discovery matters, Rolison does not mention the District Court\u2019s reasoning, let alone establish a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>See Bailey, </em>\u00b6 10. As stated above, the appellant bears the burden of establishing error. <em>See RSG Holdings, </em>\u00b6 14. We conclude Rolison has not established a manifest abuse of discretion based on the discovery-related issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">\u00b632 Rolison raises the District Court\u2019s evidentiary ruling as grounds for a new trial for the first time on appeal and, therefore, we do not address it. <em>See Harding v. Savoy, </em>2004 MT 280, \u00b6 67, 323 Mont. 261, \u00b6 67, 100 P.3d 976, \u00b6 67 (citation omitted). In any event, Rolison refers only to a minute entry reflecting that Deaconess moved to exclude any comment on the retaliation claims and the court excluded certain anticipated testimony. Rolison has not provided this Court with a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>transcript or any other sufficient record for us to review, as required by Rule 9(a), M.R.App.P. <em>See Gentry Montana Enterprises v. McDonald, </em>2004 MT 322, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39, 324 Mont. 67, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39, 101 P.3d 767, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39. Without an adequate record, it is impossible to discern the substance of the anticipated testimony or what, if any, prejudice resulted from its exclusion. Thus, the lack of an adequate record provides an additional reason for our decision not to address his evidentiary argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">\u00b633  We hold the District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in denying Rolison\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u00b634 <em>3. In awarding costs to Deaconess, did the District Court err by failing to apply the \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without </em>foundation\u201d <em>standard?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u00b635 Generally, a party in whose favor a judgment is entered in an action for the recovery of money or damages is entitled to costs. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 25-10-101(3) and -102, MCA. The District Court initially awarded costs in accordance with Deaconess\u2019 amended memorandum of costs. Rolison objected, asserting the costs of demonstrative exhibits, photocopying and a videotaped deposition were not allowable costs pursuant to \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, and remaining costs \u201cshould be denied given ... the public policy to encourage claims under the Human Rights Act and Title VH[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\u00b636 After reviewing Rolison\u2019s objection, the District Court reduced the awarded costs, subtracting the costs of the videotaped deposition because it determined the use of the deposition at trial was frivolous. Recognizing the public policy of the MHRA and Title VII \u201cmight be\u201d to encourage claims, the court concluded that awarding Deaconess costs was mandatory pursuant to Montana statutes because the court had entered judgment for Deaconess in Rolison\u2019s action to recover <em>money </em>damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">\u00b637 On appeal, Rolison <em>argues the </em>District Court erred by applying Montana statutes rather than a standard applicable to Title VII proceedings. He advances 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k) as the relevant federal statute. That statute provides that \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party... areasonable attorney\u2019s fee (including expert fees) as part of the costs[.]\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k). Relying primarily on <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC </em>(1978), 434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648, 657, Rolison asserts a defendant in a Title VII case may recover costs from a plaintiff only if the action was \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d Neither the federal statute nor <em>Christiansburg </em>supports Rolison\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>position, however, because both apply to attorney\u2019s fees and not to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\">\u00b638  We hold the District Court did not err by applying \u00a7\u00a7 25-10-101 and -102, MCA, rather than the <em>Christiansburg </em>standard, in awarding costs to Deaconess.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\u00b639 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b527-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, LEAPHART and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
