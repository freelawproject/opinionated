This Court issued an order on November 9, 2004, affirming the District Court. This opinion supersedes that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">\u00b63 1. Whether a challenge to the adequacy of the State\u2019s funding of a basic system of free quality public elementary and secondary schools presents a non-justiciable political question.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erroneously concluded that the current school funding system violates Article X, Section 1(3), by failing to provide adequate funding for Montana\u2019s schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the State has violated Article X, Section 1(3), by not paying its share of the cost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>of the public school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\">\u00b66 4. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the State has violated Article X, Section 1(2), by not recognizing the cultural heritage of American Indians in its educational goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u00b67 5. Whether the October 2005 effective date of the District Court\u2019s opinion should be moved up to May 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b68 6. Whether the current school funding system violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\u00b69 7. Whether an award of attorney fees is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">\u00b610 A coalition of schools, education groups, and parents (the Coalition) brought this action contending that the State has acted unconstitutionally in administering and funding Montana\u2019s constitutionally-mandated public school system. After a three-week trial, the District Court found serious problems with the current school system, relating both to the manner in which the State funds its public schools and the educational product the schools are delivering. The District Court concluded that the current system violates the Public Schools Clause of Article X, Section 1(3), and the Indian Education Clause of Article X, Section 1(2). The District Court also concluded that the current school system does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Montana Constitution and that the Coalition should not be awarded attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">\u00b611 The State now appeals, arguing that we cannot reach the issue whether the current school system violates Article X, Section 1(3), because the issue is a political question. In the alternative, the State argues that the District Court wrongly concluded that the current school system violates Article X, Section 1(3). The Coalition cross-appeals, arguing that the court erred in concluding that the current school system does not violate Montana\u2019s Equal Protection Clause, that the effective date of the court\u2019s opinion should be moved from October 1, 2005, to May 1, 2005, and that the court erred in not awarding attorney fees. We conclude that, since the Legislature has implemented Article X, Section 1(3), the question whether the system it created violates the Constitution is not a political question. We affirm the court\u2019s determination that the current system violates Article X, Section 1(3), but we also defer to the Legislature for the definition of \u201cquality\u201d as used in that constitutional provision. Furthermore, we affirm the effective date of the District Court\u2019s opinion and vacate and remand the issue of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b612 Whether an issue presents a non-justiciable political question is a legal conclusion that this Court reviews de novo. <em>Northfield Ins.

We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous, <em>In re Estate of James, </em>2004 MT 314, \u00b6 9, 324 Mont. 24, \u00b6 9, 102 P.3d 12, \u00b6 9, and a district court\u2019s discretionary rulings, such as the award or denial of attorney fees, for abuse of discretion. <em>Johnson v.

Carr </em>(1962), 369 U.S. 186, 217, 82 S.Ct. 691, 710, 7 L.Ed.2d 663, 686, asserts that questions arising under Montana Constitution Article X, Section 1(3), are non-justiciable under the political question doctrine. That section provides: \u201cThe legislature shall provide a basic system of free quality public elementary and secondary schools.\u201d Of course, in interpreting our own Constitution, this Court need not defer to the United States Supreme Court. <em>State v. Jackson </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 338, 342, 672 P.2d 255, 257. Nonetheless, given the dearth of Montana precedent on the political question doctrine and the State\u2019s reliance on federal doctrine, we look to the federal precedent for guidance in developing our own doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">\u00b615 Both the United States Supreme Court and this Court recognize that non-self-executing clauses of constitutions are non-justiciable political questions. <em>Baker, </em>369 U.S. at 217, 82 S.Ct. at 710, 7 L.Ed.2d at 686 (listing one factor of the federal political question doctrine as \u201cthe impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Stafford v. Fox-Great Falls Theatre Corp. </em>(1942), 114 Mont. 52, 73, 132 P.2d 689, 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">\u00b616 To determine whether the provision is self-executing, we ask whether the Constitution addresses the language to the courts or to the Legislature. <em>Stafford, </em>114 Mont, at 73, 132 P.2d at 700. If addressed to the Legislature, the provision is non-self-executing; if addressed to the courts, it is self-executing. <em>Stafford, </em>114 Mont, at 73-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>74, 132 P.2d at 700. Louisiana\u2019s Constitution once provided that \u201cGambling is a vice and the Legislature shall pass laws to suppress it.\u201d <em>State v. Mustachia </em>(La. 1922), 94 So. 408, 409. In <em>Stafford, </em>we agreed with the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that provisions beginning \u201cthe Legislature shall\u201d are non-self-executing provisions; as such, in Louisiana, gambling was legal unless the Legislature enacted a provision making it illegal. <em>Stafford, </em>114 Mont, at 75-76, 132 P.2d at 701 (citing <em>Mustachia, </em>94 So. at 409).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\">\u00b617  Like the Louisiana clause, Montana\u2019s Public Schools Clause constitutes a directive to the Legislature: \u201cThe legislature shall provide a basic system of free quality public elementary and secondary schools.\u201d Since the Public Schools Clause is non-self-executing, it presents a political question which, in the first instance, is directed to the Legislature and is non-justiciable. That determination, however, does not end the inquiry. As here, (1) once the Legislature has acted, or \u201cexecuted,\u201d a provision (2) that implicates individual constitutional rights, courts can determine whether that enactment fulfills the Legislature\u2019s constitutional responsibility. <em>City of Boerne v. Flores </em>(1997), 521 U.S. 507, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 138 L.Ed.2d 624 (determining, under the First Amendment, that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 violates the Constitution despite Congress specifically implementing the Act through Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, that provides that \u201c[t]he Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"ANT\">\u00b618 Like Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, provisions that directly implicate rights guaranteed to individuals under our Constitution are in a category of their own.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That is, although the provision may be non-self-executing, thus requiring initial legislative action, the courts, as final interpreters of the Constitution, have the final \u201cobligation to guard, enforce, and protect every right granted or secured by the Constitution....\u201d <em>Robb v. Connolly </em>(1884), 111 U.S. 624, 637, 4 S.Ct. 544, 551, 28 L.Ed. 542, 546. Thus the question whether Article X, Section 1(3), presents a \u201cjusticiable\u201d controversy cannot be addressed in a vacuum. The clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>must be read in the context of any correlative individual rights guaranteed under the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b619  In this case, the requirement that the Legislature shall provide a basic system of free quality public schools, must be read in conjunction with Section 1 of Article X, which guarantees a right to education. <em>Kaptein ex rel. Kaptein v. Conrad Sch. Dist. </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 152, 155, 931 P.2d 1311, 1313; <em>see State ex rel. Bartmess v. Bd. of Trustees </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 269, 275, 726 P.2d 801, 804-05. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Legislature has addressed the threshold political question: it has executed Article X, Section 1(3), by creating a basic system of free public schools. As the final guardian and protector of the right to education, it is incumbent upon the court to assure that the system enacted by the Legislature enforces, protects and fulfills the right. We conclude this issue is justiciable.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b620 <em>Whether the District Court erroneously concluded that the current school funding system violates Article X, Section 1(3), by failing to provide adequate funding for Montana\u2019s schools.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u00b621 Article X, Section 1(3), of the Montana Constitution mandates that \u201c[t]he legislature shall provide a basic system of free quality public elementary and secondary schools.... It shall fund and distribute in an equitable manner to the school districts the state\u2019s share of the cost of the basic elementary and secondary school system.\u201d As we have just stated, the Legislature has made an initial policy determination regarding this language. It has created a public school system and a method of funding the system. Although Article X, Section 1(3), is textually committed to the Legislature in the first instance, once the Legislature acts we are not barred from reaching the question of whether the Legislature has fulfilled its constitutional obligation to \u201cprovide a basic system of free quality public elementary and secondary schools.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\u00b622  Although the Legislature <em>has </em>made an initial policy determination by establishing a public school system (the relevant consideration under the Political Question Doctrine), it <em>has not </em>made a determination as to the meaning of \u201cquality.\u201d Because the Constitution mandates that the Legislature provide a quality education, we determine that the Legislature can best construct a \u201cquality\u201d system of education if it first defines what is a \u201cquality\u201d system of education. In addition, even though we here defer to the Legislature as to what constitutes \u201cquality,\u201d given the unchallenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>findings of the District Court we do conclude that the educational product of the current school system is constitutionally deficient and that the Legislature currently fails to adequately fund Montana\u2019s public school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\">\u00b623 The Montana Legislature created the current education funding system in 1993 with House Bill (HB) 667. The Legislature did so in response to a court challenge to the former system. Unlike in the current proceedings, that challenge was brought under the Equality of Educational Opportunity Clause. Mont. Const. Art. X, Sec. 1(1). We addressed the challenge in <em>Helena Elementary Sch. Hist. No. 1 v. State </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 44, 55, 769 P.2d 684, 690, where we concluded that the spending disparities among the State\u2019s school districts constituted a denial of equality of educational opportunity as guaranteed by Article X, Section 1(1) of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b624 HB 667 sought to address those inequities. It did this by relying on a regression analysis designed to address spending and taxing disparities among school districts. Central to the funding system it instituted is the \u201cgeneral fund.\u201d The general fund is the largest and most important part of a school district\u2019s overall budget. Each school district\u2019s general fund budget includes a basic entitlement lump sum from the State, the Average Number Belonging (ANB) entitlement, locally raised funds, and special education funds. A school district\u2019s general fund budget has a built-in maximum and minimum, computed using a formula. Tellingly, most school districts currently either exceed their maximum budgets or are budgeting over 98 percent of the 100 percent they are allowed to spend. At trial some educators stated that their districts could not provide what they considered a \u201cquality\u201d education unless they were allowed to spend more than their general fund maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b625 This funding system is not correlated with any understanding of what constitutes a \u201cquality\u201d education. The evidence for this is twofold. First, as the State admitted at oral argument, in passing HB 667, the Legislature did not undertake a study of what the Public Schools Clause demands of it. That is, it did not seek to define \u201cquality.\u201d As stated above, since the Legislature has not defined \u201cquality\u201d as that term is used in Article X, Section 1(3), we cannot conclude that the current funding system was designed to provide a quality education. Second, as found by the District Court, the Legislature, in creating the spending formula of HB 667, did not link the formula to any factors that might constitute a \u201cquality\u201d education.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\u00b626 The District Court found that the \u201cmajor problems\u201d with HB 667 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>were: it provided no mechanism to deal with inflation; it did not base its numbers on costs such as teacher pay, meeting accreditation standards, fixed costs, or costs of special education; increases in allowable spending were not tied to costs of increased accreditation standards or content and performance standards; relevant data was already two years old when the bill was passed; and no study was undertaken to justify the disparity in ANB dollars dispensed to high schools as compared to elementary schools. From these credible findings we must conclude that the Legislature did not endeavor to create a school funding system with quality in mind. Unless funding relates to needs such as academic standards, teacher pay, fixed costs, costs of special education, and performance standards, then the funding is not related to the cornerstones of a quality education. We also note that in <em>Helena Elementary </em>we stated that \u201cthe accreditation standards establish a minimum upon which quality education can be built\u201d but \u201cdo not fully define either the constitutional rights of students or the constitutional responsibilities of the State of Montana for funding its public elementary and secondary schools.\u201d <em>Helena Elementary, </em>236 Mont. at 57, 769 P.2d at 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b627 Without an assessment of what constitutes a \u201cquality\u201d education, the Legislature has no reference point from which to relate funding to relevant educational needs. In the absence of a threshold definition of quality, we cannot conclude that the system is adequately funded as required by Article X, Section 1(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b628 The above analysis is essentially prospective in nature-that is, it states what the Constitution demands of the Legislature and what the Legislature must do to fashion a constitutional education system. Nonetheless, in order to address the Coalition\u2019s claims we have to address the <em>educational product </em>that the present school system provides, not just the <em>manner </em>in which the Legislature funds that school system. Even given the absence of a definition of \u201cquality\u201d education, the District Court\u2019s findings demonstrate that whatever legitimate definition of quality that the Legislature may devise, the educational product of the present school system is constitutionally deficient and that the Legislature currently fails to adequately fund Montana\u2019s public school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b629 The evidence that the current system is constitutionally deficient includes the following unchallenged findings made by the District Court: school districts increasingly budgeting at or near their maximum budget authority; growing accreditation problems; many qualified educators leaving the state to take advantage of higher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>salaries and benefits offered elsewhere; the cutting of programs; the deterioration of school buildings and inadequate funds for building repair and for new construction; and increased competition for general fund dollars between special and general education.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AN4\">\u00b630 The State counters by arguing that the District Court should have considered output measures, such as test scores, in determining whether the current system is constitutional, and that under such measures Montana compares very favorably with other states. Indeed, Montana\u2019s students often do perform quite well on standardized achievement tests. However, current test scores do not tell the whole story. First of all, a \u201csystem\u201d of education includes more than high achievement on standardized tests. We have noted elsewhere, for example, that school districts have an interest in integrating their academic programs with extracurricular activities. <em>Kaptein, </em>281 Mont. at 162, 931 P.2d at 1317. Secondly, it may be that test scores are not attributable to the current educational system. The voluminous evidence presented at trial and summarized in the preceding paragraph established that although Montana\u2019s students are testing well when compared with students in similar states, there are serious concerns as to whether this level of achievement will continue. With the District Court\u2019s findings of fact in mind, it may be that the achievement registered by Montana\u2019s students is not <em>because </em>of the current educational system.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\">\u00b631  Therefore, because the Legislature has not defined what \u201cquality\u201d means we cannot conclude that the current system is designed to provide a \u201cquality\u201d education. Article X, Section 1(3), explicitly requires the Legislature to fund a \u201cquality\u201d educational system. Therefore we defer to the Legislature to provide a threshold definition of what the Public Schools Clause requires. We also conclude, however, that given the unchallenged findings made by the District Court, whatever definition the Legislature devises, the current funding system is not grounded in principles of quality, and cannot be deemed constitutionally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b632 <em>Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the State has violated Article X, Section 1(3), by not paying its share of the cost of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>public school system,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b633 In light of our holding on issue number two above, we decline to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b634 <em>Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the State has violated Article X, Section 1(2), by not recognizing the cultural heritage of American Indians in its educational goals.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b635 The District Court concluded that the State has failed to recognize the distinct and unique cultural heritage of American Indians and that it has shown no commitment in its educational goals to the preservation of Indian cultural identity, as demanded by Article X, Section 1(2). It relied on our opinion in <em>Helena Elementary, </em>when we held that the \u201cprovision establishes a special burden in Montana for the education of American Indian children which must be addressed as part of the school funding issues.\u201d <em>Helena Elementary, 236 </em>Mont. at 58, 769 P.2d at 693. The State does not contest these conclusions. \u201cThis Court will not endeavor to review a matter when appellant has directed no argument toward it.\u201d <em>Sands v. Nestegard </em>(1982), 198 Mont. 421, 428, 646 P.2d 1189, 1193. Therefore, we merely recognize that the findings and conclusions of the District Court regarding Article X, Section 1(2), of the Montana Constitution stand unchallenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">ISSUE FIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">\u00b636 <em>Whether the October 2005 effective date of the District Court\u2019s opinion should be moved up to May 2005.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">\u00b637 We affirm the District\u2019s Court\u2019s selection of October 1,2005, as the effective date of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">ISSUE SIX</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">\u00b638 <em>Whether the current school funding system violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Montana Constitution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">\u00b639  The District Court concluded that the present system violates Article X, Section 1(3), of the Montana Constitution (basic system of free quality public schools), but not Article II, Section 4 (equal protection). Since we have concluded that the present system violates Article X, Section 1(3), we need not address the question of whether the system complies with the Equal Protection Clause of Article II, Section 4. <em>See Helena Elementary, </em>236 Mont. at 55, 769 P.2d at 691. Similarly, when the District Court concluded that the present system violates Article X, Section 1(3), it need not have addressed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Coalition\u2019s equal protection claim. Accordingly, we direct the District Court to vacate its conclusion that the system does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of Article II, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\">ISSUE SEVEN</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b640 <em>Whether an award of attorney fees is appropriate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b641  The District Court denied an award of attorney fees to the Coalition, citing our denial of attorney fees in <em>Helena Elementary, </em>236 Mont. at 58-59, 769 P.2d at 693. It is true that we denied attorney fees in that case. However, as the Coalition correctly points out, our decision there was based on the \u201ccommon fund\u201d doctrine. Since <em>Helena Elementary, </em>we decided <em>Montanans for the Responsible Use of the School Trust v. State ex rel. Board of Land Commissioners, </em>1999 MT 263, \u00b6 67, 296 Mont. 402, \u00b6 67, 989 P.2d 800, \u00b6 67 (Montrust). In <em>Montrust </em>we awarded attorney fees pursuant to the private attorney general doctrine. The District Court erred in not addressing this change in our attorney fees jurisprudence. Therefore, we vacate the District Court\u2019s denial of attorney fees and remand for reconsideration in light of <em>Montrust.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b341-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, NELSON, DISTRICT JUDGE RICE, sitting for FORMER JUSTICE REGNIER, concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-4\"> This contrasts constitutional mandates, for example, that \u201cthe legislature shall provide for a Department of Agriculture ...\u201d, Art.

Corp. v. Moore </em>(1975), 166 Mont. 510, 534 P.2d 859, our view of what sort of provision is and is not self-executing was softened somewhat from the definition we adopted in <em>State ex rel. Stafford v. Fox-Great Falls Theatre Corp. </em>(1942), 114 Mont. 52, 132 P.2d 689. In <em>General Agrie., </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">\u201cA provision is self-executing when it can be given effect without the aid of legislation and there is nothing to indicate that legislation is contemplated in order to render it operative.... The fact that a right granted by a constitutional provision may be better or further protected by supplementary legislation does not of itself prevent the provision in question from being self-executing; nor does the self-executing character of a constitutional provision necessarily preclude legislation for the better protection of the right secured, or legislation in furtherance of the purposes, or of the enforcement, of the provision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number><em>General Agric., </em>166 Mont. at 514, 534 P.2d at 862. Accordingly, I am not necessarily of the view that constitutional provisions beginning with the words \u201cthe legislature shall\u201d must all be denominated as non-self-executing. <em>See </em>Cameron Carter and Kyle Karineh, Note, <em>A Question of Intent: The Montana Constitution, Environmental Rights, and the MEIC Decision, </em>22 Pub. Land &amp; Resources L. Rev. 97, 119-21 (2001) (hereinafter <em>Carter). But see </em>John L. Horwich, <em>Montana\u2019s Constitutional Environmental Quality Provisions: Self-Execution or Self-Delusion?, </em>57 Mont. L. Rev. 323 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b644 Second, with the exception of rights protected under Article II of the Montana Constitution<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, there are those who might read our Opinion as suggesting that the legislature must always act upon a non-self-executing constitutional directive before a justiciable claim arises regarding the implementation of that provision. This raises a question: if the legislature fails or refuses to implement a non-self-executing constitutional directive, may a justiciable claim regarding the proper implementation of that clause eventually ripen? \u00b645 As early as 1900, this Court considered the problem posed by legislative inaction with respect to non-self-executing clauses. The case of <em>State ex rel. Whiteside v. First Judicial Dist. Ct. </em>(1900), 24 Mont. 539, 63 P. 395, dealt with the Court\u2019s constitutionally granted power of supervisory control as established in Article VIII, Section 2 of the 1889 Constitution. This section provided that such power was to be exercised \u201cunder such regulations and limitations as may be prescribed by law.\u201d The Court questioned whether the power of supervisory control would be dormant in the absence of legislation indicating specific procedures for the exercise of that power. While acknowledging that such legislative inaction would represent an ostensible limitation on the <em>exercise </em>this power, the Court flatly rejected the notion that such a constitutionally granted power could be rendered ineffective by the legislature\u2019s failure to enact guidelines for its use. <em>Whiteside, </em>24 Mont. at 563, 63 P. at 400. In doing so, the Court noted that \u201cthe legislature cannot decrease the powers granted by the Constitution.\u201d <em>Whiteside, </em>24 Mont, at 563, 63 P. at 400. This view pays due respect to the paramount nature and inherently positive force of constitutionally established powers, as well as constitutionally granted rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b646 When, in adopting their constitution, the people provided that a provision shall be implemented by the legislature, it cannot be gainsaid that the people had the right to expect, and do expect that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>branch of government to, in good faith, carry out its constitutionally imposed obligation to legislate. In truth, non-self-executing constitutional directives maybe, for all intents and purposes, nullified by a legislature which chooses to ignore such directives. Simply put, non-self-executing clauses, whether delineating a power or establishing a right, are not rendered ineffective by a legislative failure to enact laws in furtherance of such clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\">\u00b647 Other courts have recognized this principle, as well. For example, the Florida Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">The will of the people is paramount in determining whether a constitutional provision is self-executing and the modern doctrine favors the presumption that constitutional provisions are intended to be self-operating. This is so because in the absence of such presumption the legislature would have the power to nullify the will of the people expressed in their constitution, the most sacrosanct of all expressions of the people.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"><em>Gray v. Bryant </em>(Fla. 1960), 125 So.2d 846, 851. Similarly, the Arizona Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">\u201cThe general presumption of law is that all constitutional provisions are self-executing, and are to be interpreted as such, rather than requiring further legislation, for the reason that, unless such were done, it would be in the power of the Legislature to practically nullify a fundamental of legislation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-7\"><em>Morgan v. Board of Sup\u2019rs </em>(Ariz. 1948), 192 P.2d 236, 241. <em>See also Carter </em>at 116-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u00b648 Starting with the assumption, as does our Opinion, that non-self-executing constitutional mandates are, by their very nature, enacted with the expectation that the legislature will act to implement the directive, a justiciable claim must, at some point, arise if the legislature fails or refuses to fulfill its obligation. Indeed, choosing not to act, is an act in and of itself. <em>See State v. Weaver </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 505, 509, 917 P.2d 437, 440 (a court\u2019s failure to exercise its discretion is, in itself, an abuse of discretion (citations omitted)); <em>State ex rel. Westercamp v. State Bd. of Chiropractic Exam\u2019rs </em>(1960), 137 Mont. 451, 457, 352 P.2d 995, 999 (board\u2019s manifest abuse of discretion amounts to a failure to act at all).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">\u00b649 The only real question is, at what point in time is there an unacceptable failure or refusal? I submit that that issue is best resolved on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the nature of the right, the length of time during which the legislature has failed or has refused to act, and the reason for its failure or refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>legislate.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b650 Where the legislature fails or refuses to fulfill in its constitutional obligation to implement a non-self-executing constitutional right, and that failure or refusal is challenged in court, then it will necessarily fall to the courts to protect the right at least to the extent that the facts of the case require. Constitutional rights that cannot be enforced are illusory. It is as if those rights cease to exist as legal rights. <em>Kloss v. Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., </em>2002 MT 129, \u00b6 58, 310 Mont. 123, \u00b6 58, 54 P.3d 1, \u00b6 58 (Nelson, J. concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b651 Put another way, legislation which would defeat or restrict a self-executing mandate of the constitution is beyond the power of the legislature to enact. <em>Broderick v. Weinsier </em>(N.Y. 1938), 16 N.E.2d 387, 388. Similarly, it follows, that a legislative failure to act upon a non-self-executing constitutional directive, which defeats or restricts the purpose of that mandate, is just as unacceptable as legislation which defeats or restricts the purpose of a self-executing right. Were that not so, the people could be and would be effectively stripped of important constitutional guarantees and protections by default.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u00b652 As we stated in <em>General </em>Agrie.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">The supremacy of constitutional mandates is too well established to require citation.... \u201cA written constitution is not only the direct and basic expression of the sovereign will, it is also the absolute rule of action and decision for all departments and offices of government with respect to all matters covered by it, and must control as it is written until it is changed by the authority which established it. No function of government can be discharged in disregard of or in opposition to the fundamental law. The state constitution is the mandate of a sovereign people to its servants and representatives. No one of them has a right to ignore or disregard its mandates, and the legislature, the executive officers, and the judiciary cannot lawfully act beyond its limitations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-8\"><em>General Agrie., </em>166 Mont. at 515-16, 534 P.2d at 862-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">\u00b653 Indeed, no branch of <em>government </em>has, in default of its constitutional obligation to act, the power to, <em>de facto, </em>write out of the constitution important rights and guarantees which the people sought to secure unto themselves, believing when they did so, that their elected officials would, in good faith, honor their command.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">\u00b654 With those caveats, I concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b344-11\">JUSTICE COTTER joins in the concurrence of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\"> <em>See </em>\u00b6 18 and n.1, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b345-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"A9J\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\">\u00b655 I concur with the holding of the Court on all issues and write to offer alternative reasoning for affirming the District Court on Issues 1 and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b656 The State\u2019s argument that this is a political question reserved for the Legislature is well supported by case authority from other states. However, I agree with the Court\u2019s resolution and would add that this question was essentially resolved sixteen years ago by <em>Helena Elementary Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. State </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 44, 769 P.2d 684, wherein the Court first undertook judicial review of the constitutional issues related to school funding under the 1972 Montana Constitution. School funding has been analyzed pursuant to that decision ever since. It may have been more appropriate for the State to raise the political question defense at that time, but, in any event, I believe the Court\u2019s decision is clearly consistent with the expectations of the Constitutional Convention delegates, who rejected an amendment which would have placed school funding within the exclusive province of the Legislature, offered by Delegate McDonough:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A72\">[W]hat is distribution in an \u201cequitable manner\u201d; and what is \u201cfull funding\u201d of the educational program? Now, that should be left with the Legislature and the Legislature only, and nobody else. They\u2019re the representatives of the people up here to decide fiscal matters, not the Supreme Court of Montana and not anybody else. It\u2019s the Legislature that has this power, and the Legislature should have it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">... There\u2019s going to be problems from time to time, but if you leave [the words] in as they are now worded, you\u2019re going to have more problems of constitutional-legal construction on any lawsuits relative to the application of these last two sentences [of Article X, Section 1(3)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Mont. Const. Conv. Tr., Vol. VI at 1963. The delegates\u2019 rejection of the proposed amendment set the Constitution on a course that would make Delegate McDonough\u2019s observations prescient: school funding was made an issue of constitutional dimension which requires the involvement, within their respective spheres, of both the legislative and judicial branches in order to resolve \u201cproblems of constitutional-legal construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u00b657 Turning to the substance of school funding under Issue 2, the Court concludes that \u201cthe Legislature can best construct a \u2018quality\u2019 system of education if it first defines what is a \u2018quality\u2019 system of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>education\u201d based upon educationally relevant factors. <em>See </em>\u00b6 22. This is undoubtedly logical, but I would nonetheless refrain from suggesting how to \u201cbest construct\u201d the educational system, and upon what factors it must do so, believing it to be an inappropriate judicial comment on the Legislature\u2019s prerogative, if I was not convinced that the \u201csuggestion\u201d was, in fact, constitutionally compelled. Truly, the debates of the delegates demonstrate that, in assigning to the Legislature the task of designing the system, they intended the Legislature to assess the educational needs of the state before deciding funding issues. <em>\u201cAfter the state has assessed the needs </em>and established what a minimum program ought to be, we feel that the state ought then to provide, by whatever means it sees fit, for the funding of the program.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>\u201cOnce the needs </em>for a basic quality system of elementary and secondary schools have been <em>realistically assessed, </em>the state has the obligation to guarantee ....\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b658 Clearly, the power to determine what constitutes a quality system was granted to the Legislature. \u201cWe are saying to the Legislature, \u201cWe have untied your hands. We want you to set up a basic elementary and secondary education. You have full power to decide what that is going to be; but when you get it done, the state\u2019s share of it, as you determine it\u2019-we give the Legislature full power there to determine its share, too-we haven\u2019t tied their hands \u2014 \u2018shall be funded ....\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based on these indications from the delegates, I concur that the Court\u2019s directives-to define a quality system based upon relevant factors-are appropriately given.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b659 I agree with the Court\u2019s focus on the word \u201cquality,\u201d but the Constitution also uses two other important terms in regard to educational funding requirements-\u201cbasic\u201d and \u201cstate share.\u201d These terms are employed to shape the Legislature\u2019s duty with regard to educational funding. \u201cBasic\u201d occurs twice in describing the system the Legislature must create. Extensive explanation of the meaning of \u201cbasic\u201d was given by Delegate Habedank, who offered the motion to add the term to the Constitution in these two places. In summary, the intention was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>[T]o require the Legislature to do full funding of a basic educational program and that the frills and the things beyond the basic program, as the Legislature determines it, can still remain with the people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-3\">... [T]he public is concerned. They are very concerned. And the delegation here ... evidenced its concern about educational theorists coming in with every type of-shall we call it \u201cscrewball education proposal\u201d and insisting that this be in here, and it was felt that \u201cbasic\u201d would help.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Delegate Habedank, Mont. Const. Conv. Tr., Vol. VI at 1962, 2154. \u00b660 Next, the delegates inserted \u201cstate share\u201d into the Constitution to further define the Legislature\u2019s obligation. The first sentence of Article X, Section 1(3), states that the Legislature \u201cshall provide a basic system of free quality public\u201d schools. The third sentence of this section states that the Legislature \u201cshall fund ... the state\u2019s share\u201d of the cost of this basic system. From these provisions we understand that the Legislature must \u201cprovide\u201d- to establish or make available-a basic system of quality education, but that the Legislature must \u201cfund\u201d only the \u201cstate\u2019s share\u201d of this system. Indeed, the District Court concluded that \u201cthe State is not paying <em>its share </em>of the cost of the basic elementary and secondary school system.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u00b661 These provisions of the Constitution arose out of the delegates\u2019 concern that the Legislature had historically failed to fully fund the Foundation Program, the then-existing vehicle for state support of public education, or state share. (\u201cIt is only when our state Legislature fails to meet the obligation under the foundation program that we begin to get these real inequities built into it. For instance, the state right now is funding only about 65 percent, and the other 35 percent has to go back on local property tax levies.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) Although acknowledging that other revenue sources, including local levies, were also necessary in order to fund a basic system of <em>quality </em>education, the intent was to require the Legislature to fund only the state\u2019s share of that cost:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">I think there\u2019s fear here that we\u2019re asking the state to do all of the financing for education. This is not what we\u2019re trying to do. I think what we\u2019re trying to do here is to do what the foundation program has not done. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re trying to eliminate levies at the local level. I don\u2019t foresee this, and I would hate to see it come. I think at the local level, still there should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>ability-or the people should be able to have a higher quality of education [than] in some other community. And I really think the underlying fear here is that the state is going to provide the total financing, and this is not true. We\u2019re asking for the full funding [of the foundation program]; and when we\u2019re asking that, we\u2019re talking, really, in the sense that we have in the past in this area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aai\">Delegate Woodmansey, Mont. Const. Conv. Tr., Vol. VI at 1968.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">I think it\u2019s also essential that the Legislature should have the power to require school districts to tax for a portion of their educational program in order to keep control of education at a local level, in order to allow people to know what is being spent for education, and this is what my proposal also does.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Delegate Habedank, Mont. Const. Conv. Tr., Vol. VI at 2153.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u00b662 In my view, the District Court\u2019s conclusion that school funding is constitutionally inadequate is supported primarily by the evidence demonstrating that the system has once again fallen into the condition criticized by the delegates, and against which they reacted- namely, that the state\u2019s share of the cost of education has steadily eroded to the point of insufficiency. This condition was also critically noted by the Court in <em>Helena Elementary. Helena </em>Elementary, 236 Mont. at 55, 769 P.2d at 690. In inflation-adjusted dollars, state aid declined between 1991 and 2003 by 17 percent, and local taxes have increased by 120 percent to pay for the cost of education. The state share of the general fund declined to 60.95 percent in 2003. Thus, while the funding system created under HB 667 addressed the constitutional problem caused by disparities in funding between school districts-the primary issue in <em>Helena Elementary-it </em>nonetheless failed, over time, to maintain state support and satisfy the state\u2019s duty to fund its share of education, thus running afoul of a separate constitutional mandate. The evidentiary focus on such factors as deterioration of school buildings and the departure of educators is appropriate in assessing the health of the system, but such factors are merely symptoms of the underlying disease: the state\u2019s failure to fully fund its share of educational costs. This is a long term, systemic and fundamental flaw which I believe violates the last sentence of Article X, Section 1(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>\u00b663 In conclusion, the Court has noted that this decision stands on its own and does not necessarily affirm the entirety of the District Court\u2019s order. The District Court\u2019s yeoman efforts are to be saluted, and we simply do not have time to address each matter ruled upon in its lengthy decision. I would make one exception and offer comment thereon. In Finding of Fact No. 186, the District Court found that the constitutional mandate to the Legislature does not depend on the state\u2019s fiscal capacity, <em>citing Helena Elementary. </em>However, <em>in Helena </em>Elementary, we found \u201cunpersuasive the argument that statewide fiscal difficulties in the last few years somehow excuse the disparities in the spending per pupil in the various school districts.\u201d <em>Helena Elementary, </em>236 Mont. at 54, 769 P.2d at 690. In other words, limited resources did not excuse the unequal distribution of those resources. That is not the problem here. While legislators cannot avoid school funding problems because of financial concerns, it should also be stated that the school funding obligation, as with any financial obligation, even one of constitutional dimension, is necessarily circumscribed by the State\u2019s \u201cfiscal capacity.\u201d Indeed, this was acknowledged by the delegates: \u201cthe committee realizes that economic resources of the state limit this [educational] goal.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\">\u00b664 The extensive quotations from the transcripts of the constitutional convention herein are made with the understanding that the statement or intention of one delegate does not necessarily equate with the intention of the delegates as a body or of the Great Work they created. However, a comparison of the words of the Constitution with a study of the entirety of the debates allows one to glean the delegates\u2019 intentions with regard to the issue of educational funding with, in my view, a high degree of confidence. I believe the quotations herein accurately reflect those intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b665 I concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b349-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY joins in the special concurring opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-6\"> Delegate Harbaugh, Mont.
