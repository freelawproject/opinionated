We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">\u00b62 We must decide whether the District Court erred in determining that the contract between Christman and GRB lacked material terms, was vague on its face and, therefore, was unenforceable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">\u00b63 GRB and Christman entered into two separate farm-lease agreements for agricultural property on December 18, 1998, and September 30,1999. Under the terms of both agreements, Christman leased to GRB land on a cash per acre basis for a term of five years. Both agreements contained the following clause that allowed GRB an option to negotiate a renewal with Christman at some future date:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ali\">After October 1,2002, Lessee shall have the option to negotiate an extension of this lease for years subsequent to the year 2002, upon such terms and conditions as Lessor and Lessee shall agree to at that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">The parties agreed to include this provision in order to give Christman sufficient flexibility in the event it needed to sell the leased property to satisfy existing debts encumbering the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>\u00b64 Christman approached GRB with the option to purchase the subject property near the expiration of the leases in 2002. GRB refused. Christman later entered into a purchase agreement with a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b65 GRB filed a complaint on September 9,2002, after Christman sold the property to the third-party. GRB alleged that Christman breached the farm-lease agreements and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Christman moved for summary judgment and GRB filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b66 The District Court conducted a hearing on the competing motions for summary judgment and later entered its order granting Christman\u2019s summary judgment motion. The District Court concluded that the negotiation clause in the farm-lease contract constituted an agreement to agree, was vague on its face and, therefore, proved unenforceable. The court did not discuss specifically the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>based on the same criteria applied by the district court under Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. <em>Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, \u00b6 16, 321 Mont. 432, \u00b6 16, 92 P.3d 620, \u00b6 16. As the material facts here remain uncontroverted, we limit our review to questions of law. <em>Brabeck v. Employers Mut. Cas. Co., </em>2000 MT 373, \u00b6 8, 303 Mont. 468, \u00b6 8, 16 P.3d 355, \u00b6 8. The District Court interpreted the farm-lease agreement in reaching its decision and this interpretation represents a conclusion of law. <em>Pablo v. Moore, </em>2000 MT 48, \u00b6 12, 298 Mont. 393, \u00b6 12, 995 P.2d 460, \u00b6 12. We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine whether it is correct. <em>Pablo, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">\u00b68 Whether the District Court erred in determining that the contract between Christman and GRB lacked material terms, was vague on its face, and therefore was unenforceable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">\u00b69 GRB argues that the negotiation clause of the farm-lease agreements constitutes an agreement enforceable by the parties to negotiate an extension of the farm-lease. As a result, GRB contends that it deserves to continue leasing the land under the theory of specific enforcement even though the parties failed to negotiate a new agreement. GRB also maintains that the District Court failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>resolve issues of material fact in addressing its claims of breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b610 We interpret the language of contractual provisions according to their plain, ordinary meaning. <em>Schwend v. Schwend, </em>1999 MT 194, \u00b6 36, 295 Mont. 384, \u00b6 36, 983 P.2d 988, \u00b6 36. We apply the contract language as written when it is unambiguous and susceptible to only one interpretation. <em>Carelli v. Hall </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 202, 209, 926 P.2d 756, 761. An ambiguity exists when the contract language reasonably may be subject to two different interpretations. <em>Schwend, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b611  An agreement that requires the parties to agree to material terms in the future is not an enforceable agreement whereby specific performance will be granted. <em>Steen v. Rustad </em>(1957), 132 Mont. 96, 106, 313 P.2d 1014, 1020. As noted by the Court in <em>Steen, </em>a contract that necessitates specific performance must be complete and certain in all essential matters included within its scope. <em>Steen, </em>132 Mont, at 106, 313 P.2d at 1020. Further, \u201can agreement the terms of which are not sufficiently certain to make the precise act which is to be done clearly ascertainable\u201d cannot be specifically enforced. <em>Quirin v. Weinberg </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 386, 393-94, 830 P.2d 537, 541 (citing \u00a7 27-1-412(5), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b612 We conclude that the District Court correctly determined that the negotiation clause in the farm-lease contract represented a mere agreement to agree. The parties agreed only to contemplate negotiating an extension of the lease for some indeterminate period of time and for some unspecified amount. The negotiation clause specifically refers to such terms and conditions as the parties \u201cshall agree to at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\u00b613 The circumstances here mirror those in <em>Riis v. Day </em>(1980), 188 Mont. 253, 613 P.2d 696. In <em>Riis, </em>we considered whether a renewal provision in a lease agreement failed to contemplate a method for determining rent where the agreement\u2019s terms provided \u201cthe amount of the rental shall be subject to negotiation and mutual agreement between the parties.\u201d <em>Riis, </em>188 Mont, at 255, 613 P.2d at 697. After the lessee brought a claim seeking damages for breach of the renewal provision after the lessor terminated the lease, we held that the essential terms in the lease agreement were not enforceable where it failed to contemplate expressly a clear and definite mode for determining the amount of payment. <em>Riis, </em>188 Mont, at 257, 613 P.2d at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">\u00b614  The parties\u2019 failure here to include complete and material terms for determining duration and payments for another lease term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>in the negotiation clause similarly rendered it unenforceable. Specific performance remains unavailable to enforce an agreement to agree to material terms in the future. <em>Steen, </em>132 Mont, at 106, 313 P.2d at 1020. Further, the parties\u2019 failure to negotiate an extension to the farm-lease makes calculating damages untenable as \u201cdamages which are not clearly ascertainable in both their nature and origin cannot be recovered for a breach of contract.\u201d Section 27-1-311, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b615  Finally, we need not consider GRB\u2019s claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing as the covenant does not attach in the absence of an enforceable agreement. <em>Cate v. First Bank (N.A.)-Billings </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 429, 433, 865 P.2d 277, 279. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court properly granted Christman\u2019s motion for summary judgment after determining that the negotiation clause was vague and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b616 Lastly, Christman requests we award it attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to Rule 32, M.R.App.P., based upon GRB\u2019s appeal of the District Court\u2019s order \u201cwithout substantial or reasonable grounds.\u201d As a general rule, this Court declines to impose sanctions pursuant to Rule 32, M.R.App.P., unless the appeal appears entirely unfounded and intended to cause delay or unless counsel\u2019s actions otherwise constitute an abuse of the judicial system. <em>In re Marriage of Moss, </em>1999 MT 62, \u00b6 41, 293 Mont. 500, \u00b6 41, 977 P.2d 322, \u00b6 41 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b617 We hold GRB based its appeal on substantial and reasonable grounds and was not intended to cause delay. Indeed, GRB put forth several reasonable arguments why the District Court\u2019s judgment should have been modified or reversed. We remain satisfied from the record and presentation of the appeal, however, that no reversible error occurred. Accordingly, we decline Christman\u2019s request to award its attorneys\u2019 fees and Costs for having to respond to this appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b266-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
