We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">\u00b62 We restate Becker\u2019s issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">\u00b63 1. Whether Becker\u2019s convictions for criminal possession of dangerous drugs and criminal possession of precursors to dangerous drugs in addition to criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs by accountability violated his double jeopardy protections under the United States and Montana Constitutions and under \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">\u00b64 2. Whether Becker\u2019s sentence for criminal possession of dangerous drugs is twice the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-14\">\u00b65 3. Whether Becker\u2019s sentence for criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs by accountability is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-15\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b392-16\">\u00b66 On the morning of March 16,2001, Mike Smith went to the home of his estranged wife, Nora. Upon entering the garage, Mike discovered what he suspected was a methamphetamine lab which he immediately reported to the Great Falls Police Department. Thereafter, several law enforcement officers set up surveillance of the home and garage. The officers observed Becker and Huston Curran moving items from the house into the garage and then loading items into the trunk of a white Ford Taurus owned by Sharon Olson. After loading the car, Becker, Curran and Olson got into the car and drove away. The officers stopped the car a short distance from the house. Becker was found to be carrying several pairs of rubber gloves, several pairs of athletic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>gloves, and a glass pipe with a rubber tube used for smoking methamphetamine. In addition, Becker\u2019s clothing was wet and emitted a chemical odor. One of the officers who touched Becker had a physical reaction and was required to undergo decontamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b67 After obtaining a search warrant for Smith\u2019s home and garage and Olson\u2019s car, officers found items they believed to be consistent with the production of methamphetamine and a mason jar with a solvent at the top that contained methamphetamine. Based on these findings, the State charged Becker with criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs by accountability in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-2-302(3) and 45-9-110, MCA (1999), and felony criminal possession of dangerous drugs in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA (1999). The State also charged Smith, Olson and Curran with numerous drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b68 On June 22, 2001, Becker filed a motion to suppress all of the evidence obtained by the officers on the grounds that the search warrant application did not adequately establish the reliability and credibility of the informant; the search warrant application was legally invalid because it contained inaccurate and misleading information; the search warrant application lacked probable cause; the officers lacked particularized suspicion to stop Olson\u2019s car; and the statements made by Olson at the time of the traffic stop were taken in violation of her right to remain silent. The District Court denied Becker\u2019s motion to suppress after conducting a hearing on the matters raised in the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b69 The District Court had set Becker\u2019s trial to begin on November 19, 2001, however, six days prior to that date, the State filed an Amended Information adding the charge of criminal possession of precursors to dangerous drugs in violation of \u00a7 45-9-107(1)(n), MCA (1999). Defense counsel subsequently filed a motion to dismiss this charge as a violation of the prohibition against double jeopardy claiming that the course of conduct supporting this charge and the charge of criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs was the same. Defense counsel relied on <em>Blockburger v. United States </em>(1932), 284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306, for this argument. However, defense counsel made no argument regarding the specific protections against double jeopardy provided by the Montana Constitution or \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA. The District Court denied Becker\u2019s motion and the case proceeded to trial. The jury convicted Becker on all three charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\u00b610 Prior to his sentencing hearing, Becker filed a Sentencing Memorandum in which he argued that the maximum sentence he could receive for the charge of criminal production or manufacture of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>dangerous drugs by accountability was six months incarceration in the county jail. Becker contended that there was no penalty in the statutes for a first-time offense of manufacturing methamphetamine. Thus, he argued that \u00a7 46-18-212, MCA, a sentencing default statute, applied. Becker also filed an objection to the State seeking to sentence him as a persistent felony offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b611 At sentencing, the District Court rejected Becker\u2019s sentencing argument and determined that pursuant to \u00a7 45-9-110(4), MCA, it could, and did, sentence Becker to ten years in prison for the charge of criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs by accountability. The court also sentenced Becker to ten years in prison for the charge of criminal possession of dangerous drugs and five years in prison for the charge of criminal possession of precursors to dangerous drugs. The court ordered that all of the sentences were to run consecutively. In addition, the court declared Becker to be a persistent felony offender, but chose not to sentence him as such. Becker appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b612 <em>Whether Becker\u2019s convictions for criminal possession of dangerous drugs and criminal possession of precursors to dangerous drugs in addition to criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs by accountability violated his double jeopardy protections under the United States and Montana Constitutions and under \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u00b613 Becker argues on appeal that he should only have been convicted of the charge of criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs by accountability because the other two charges were part of the process of manufacturing methamphetamine and were included within the manufacturing charge. He claims that his convictions for possession of precursors and possession of methamphetamine in addition to his conviction for production or manufacture of methamphetamine violated his federal and state constitutional protections and his state statutory protection against double jeopardy. \u00b614 A district court\u2019s decision to deny a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis of double jeopardy presents a question of law that this Court reviews on appeal to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Beavers, </em>1999 MT 260, \u00b6 21, 296 Mont. 340, \u00b6 21, 987 P.2d 371, \u00b6 21 (citing <em>State v. Barker </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 85, 88, 858 P.2d 360, 362; <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>\u00b615 Becker concedes on appeal that his motion to dismiss in the District Court dealt exclusively with his federal constitutional rights and that he did not address the double jeopardy protections provided by the Montana Constitution or Montana\u2019s statutory protection against double jeopardy found at \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">Multiple charges. (1) When the same transaction may establish the commission of more than one offense, a person charged with the conduct may be prosecuted for each offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">(2) A <em>defendant may not, however, be convicted of more than one offense if:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\n<em>(a) one offense is included in the other;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">(b) one offense consists only of a conspiracy or other form of preparation to commit the other;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">(c) inconsistent findings of fact are required to establish the commission of the offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">(d) the offenses differ only in that one is defined to prohibit a specific instance of the conduct; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">(e) the offense is defined to prohibit a continuing course of conduct and the defendant\u2019s course of conduct was interrupted, unless the law provides that the specific periods of the conduct constitute separate offenses. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">\u00b616 Additionally, Becker concedes that he did not object on double jeopardy grounds in the lower court that the offense of possession of methamphetamine was included within the offense of production or manufacture of methamphetamine. Instead, his double jeopardy argument was based on the claim that the offense of possession of precursors was included within the offense of production or manufacture of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">\u00b617  The State argues that because Becker raised a statute-based double jeopardy theory for the first time on appeal, this Court should decline to address the new theory under the Court\u2019s discretionary power of plain error review or through Becker\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. We agree with the State that plain error review is inappropriate in this case, however, we conclude that it is appropriate to analyze this case under Becker\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">\u00b618 A criminal defendant is denied effective assistance of counsel if his counsel\u2019s conduct falls short of the range reasonably demanded in light of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and counsel\u2019s failure is prejudicial. <em>State v. Rose, </em>1998 MT 342, \u00b6 12, 292 Mont. 350, \u00b6 12, 972 P.2d 321, \u00b6 12 (citing <em>State v. Chastain </em>(1997), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>285 Mont. 61, 63, 947 P.2d 57, 58, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, 316 Mont. 198, 70 P.3d 738; <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674). Because claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions of law and fact, this Court uses <em>d\u00e9 novo </em>review. <em>State v. Turner, </em>2000 MT 270, \u00b6 47, 302 Mont. 69, \u00b6 47, 12 P.3d 934, \u00b6 47 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AYQ\">\u00b619 As Becker points out in his brief on appeal, the standard of care reasonably demanded of trial counsel required counsel to evaluate the statute under which his client was charged and advise Becker accordingly. <em>Kennedy v Maggio </em>(5th Cir. 1984), 725 F.2d 269, 270-72. \u201c \u2018[Although counsel need not be a fortune teller, he must be a reasonably competent legal historian. Though he need not see into the future, he must reasonably recall (or at least research) the past.../ \u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>725 F.2d at 272 (quoting <em>Cooks v. United States </em>(5th Cir. 1972), 461 F.2d 530, 532). <em>See also United States v. Streater </em>(D.C. Cir. 1995), 70 F.3d 1314, 1321 (counsel\u2019s erroneous advice on a critical point \u201ccannot be excused as a strategic or tactical judgment, but could have sprung only from a misunderstanding of the law.\u201d); <em>Hill v. Lockhart </em>(8th Cir. 1989), 877 F.2d 698, 703, <em>affirmed after rehearing at </em>894 F.2d 1009 (8th Cir. 1990), <em>cert, denied, </em>497 U.S. 1011, 110 S.Ct. 3258, 111 L.Ed.2d 767 (1990) (counsel failed \u201cto ascertain, through minimal research,\u201d the applicable statute in issue and to advise the client accordingly); <em>Howard v. State </em>(Ark. 1990), 783 S.W.2d 61, 62 (counsel rendered ineffective assistance when he advised his client based on a review of outdated statutes, and was unaware of the current statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b620  In the present case, Becker\u2019s trial counsel filed a motion to dismiss the precursor charge, but failed to include in the motion the charge of possession of dangerous drugs. Further, trial counsel relied only upon the <em>Blockburger </em>test and failed to recognize the protections provided by the Montana Constitution and particularly by \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA. Hence, we conclude that counsel\u2019s failure to include all of the relevant charges in his motion to dismiss and, in particular, to rely on the proper statutory grounds for dismissal, constitutes deficient performance under the first prong of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b621  As to the second prong, we conclude that Becker was indeed prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance. A criminal defendant must \u201cestablish only that there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6 19 <em>(citingStrickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068). Here, Becker would have been sentenced to a lesser term had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>counsel made the appropriate argument regarding the lesser-included offense under \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA, rather than under the <em>Blockburger </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b622 Previously, when considering whether an offense is included in another offense, this Court turned to the <em>Blockburger </em>test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">The applicable rule is that, where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\"><em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 304, 52 S.Ct. at 182. However, this Court determined in <em>State v. Beavers, </em>1999 MT 260, \u00b6 27, 296 Mont. 340, \u00b6 27, 987 P.2d 371, \u00b6 27, that the use of the <em>Blockburger </em>test is inappropriate in an included-offense analysis because Montana has statutorily defined what constitutes an included offense and <em>Blockburger </em>may unnecessarily confuse the issue. In Montana, an \u201cincluded offense\u201d means an offense that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">(a) is established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">(b) consists of an attempt to commit the offense charged or to commit an offense otherwise included in the offense charged; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">(c) differs from the offense charged only in the respect that a less serious injury or risk to the same person, property, or public interest or a lesser kind of culpability suffices to establish its commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Section 46-1-202(9), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">\u00b623 Because the production or manufacture of a dangerous drug cannot be a criminal act in and of itself until the drug is created, the State had to first prove that Becker or one of his codefendants possessed methamphetamine in order to convict Becker on the charge of producing or manufacturing that same methamphetamine. This Court considered a similar situation in <em>State v. Peterson </em>(1987), 227 Mont. 503, 741 P.2d 392. In that case, the defendant was convicted of possession of dangerous drugs and possession of dangerous drugs with intent to sell. Relying on \u00a7 46-11-502, MCA (renumbered as \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA, in 1991), we held that a defendant may not be convicted of both offenses if one offense is included within the other. <em>Peterson, </em>227 Mont. at 507, 741 P.2d at 395. We explained in <em>Peterson </em>that the offense of criminal possession of dangerous drugs with intent to sell requires proof of each relevant element of criminal possession along with the additional element of intent to sell. <em>Peterson, </em>227 Mont. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>507, 741 P.2d at 395. In like manner, in the case <em>subjudice, </em>the offense of criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs requires proof of each relevant element of criminal possession along with the additional element of production or manufacture of the dangerous drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b624  Therefore, we hold that, \u00a7\u00a7 46-1-202(9)(a) and 46-11-410(2)(a), MCA, read together, bar Becker\u2019s conviction for both criminal possession of dangerous drugs and criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs by accountability since the former is a lesser-included offense of the latter. The same cannot be said, however, for Becker\u2019s conviction for possession of precursors to dangerous drugs because a defendant who processes methamphetamine by cutting or diluting it with some inert ingredient commits the offense of criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs without necessarily possessing any of the chemical precursors listed in \u00a7 45-9-107, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AIP\">\u00b625  When a criminal defendant is improperly convicted of two offenses arising out of the same transaction, the remedy for the ensuing violation of double jeopardy is to reverse the conviction for the lesser-included offense only and to remand for re-sentencing. <em>State v. Peterson </em>(1987), 227 Mont. 511, 512-13, 744 P.2d 870, 870-71 (modifying earlier <em>Peterson </em>decision as to remand for new trial). Accordingly, we affirm Becker\u2019s convictions for criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs by accountability and criminal possession of precursors, and we reverse Becker\u2019s conviction for criminal possession of dangerous drugs. The sentence heretofore imposed by the District Court is vacated and the District Court is ordered to resentence the defendant solely on the convictions here affirmed, after notice and hearing with respect to the resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b626 <em>Whether Becker\u2019s sentence for criminal possession of dangerous drugs is twice the statutory maximum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u00b627 Because we determined in the previous issue that the charge of criminal possession of dangerous drugs is a lesser-included offense of the charge of criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs, we reversed Becker\u2019s conviction for criminal possession of dangerous drugs. Consequently, the issue of whether Becker was correctly sentenced for that charge is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">\u00b628 <em>Whether Becker\u2019s sentence for criminal production or manufacture </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>of dangerous drugs by accountability is illegal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b629 Becker argues that his ten-year sentence for criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs is illegal because \u00a7 45-9-110, MCA, the statute governing this offense, does not set forth a punishment for a first-time offense of production or manufacture of methamphetamine. Becker therefore maintains that no statutory authority existed for the ten-year sentence and the maximum sentence he could receive was six months incarceration in the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b630 This Court reviews criminal sentences only for legality-i.e., to determine whether the sentence is within the parameters provided by statute. <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\u00b631 The punishment for the offense of criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs is set forth in \u00a7 45-9-110, MCA. Subsection (2) of that statute provides for the punishment of persons convicted of producing or manufacturing certain narcotic drugs or opiates. Subsection (3) of that statute provides the punishment for persons convicted of producing or manufacturing dangerous drugs included in Schedule I of \u00a7 50-32-222, MCA, or Schedule II of \u00a7 50-32-224, MCA, who have prior convictions for producing or manufacturing Schedule I or Schedule II drugs. Methamphetamine is listed as a stimulant under Schedule II in \u00a7 50-32-224(3)(c), MCA. In the present case, the parties agreed that neither subsection (2) nor subsection (3) applied to Becker. The District Court determined that subsection (4) applied instead. That subsection provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE2\">A person convicted of criminal production or manufacture of marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol, or a dangerous drug not referred to in subsections (2) and (3) shall be imprisoned in the state prison for a term not to exceed 10 years and may be fined not more than $50,000 .... A person convicted under this subsection who has a prior conviction that has become final for criminal production or manufacture of a drug under this subsection shall be imprisoned in the state prison for a term not to exceed twice that authorized for a first offense under this subsection and may be fined not more than $100,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Section 45-9-110(4), MCA. Becker argues that since the dangerous drugs included in Schedule II (which include methamphetamine) are referred to in subsection (3), under the plain language of the statute, subsection (4) cannot apply to him. Becker therefore maintains that since the penalty for the offense of criminal production or manufacture of methamphetamine is not specified in \u00a7 45-9-110, MCA, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>provisions of \u00a7 46-18-212, MCA, apply. Section 46-18-212, MCA, provides that the court \u201cin imposing sentence upon an offender convicted of an offense for which no penalty is otherwise provided or if the offense is designated a misdemeanor and no penalty is otherwise provided,\u201d may sentence the offender to a term of no more than six months in the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b632 In its response to Becker\u2019s Sentencing Memorandum, the State argued that the phrase \u201cnot referred to in subsections (2) and (3)\u201d in \u00a7 45-9-110(4), MCA, related back to the word \u201cperson\u201d and not to the term \u201cdangerous drug.\u201d Since Becker was not a person referred to in subsections (2) and (3), inasmuch as he was not convicted of producing a narcotic and did not have any prior convictions under the statute, the penalty for his conviction would be that provided in subsection (4). Similarly, the District Court interpreted subsection (4) as a catch-all provision that specifies the penalty for those persons convicted under the statute whose penalty is not otherwise provided in subsections (2) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b633 While \u00a7 45-9-110, MCA, is not a model of clarity, we agree with the District Court and with the State that \u00a7 45-9-110(4), MCA, applies in this case. As the State argues on appeal, any other interpretation would lead to an absurd result because a first-time offender would be subject to only six months in jail while a second-time offender would be subject to a term of not less than twenty years nor more than life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b634 Nevertheless, even if Becker were correct that the penalty for producing methamphetamine is not specified in \u00a7 45-9-110(4), MCA, the default penalty statute would be \u00a7 46-18-213, MCA, not \u00a7 46-18-212, MCA, as Becker contends. A violation of \u00a7 46-9-110, MCA, carries penalties in excess of one year in prison and must therefore be considered a felony. Section 46-18-213, MCA, provides for a term often years in the state prison with respect to offenses designated as a felony where no penalty is otherwise provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b635  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in sentencing Becker to ten years in Montana State Prison for his conviction of accountability for criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\u00b636 That said, the dissent has raised several contentions that deserve a response. First, the dissent faults the Majority\u2019s Opinion for reviewing the merits of this case on direct appeal by way of Becker\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim rather than through postconviction relief. We agree with the dissent that, in most cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>when the record does not fully explain why counsel took a particular course of action, the matter is best-suited for postconviction relief because it may involve trial strategy or a tactical decision. However, we conclude that in the case before us on appeal, no trial strategy or tactical decision can excuse an error this fundamental.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b637 In <em>State v. Jefferson, </em>2003 MT 90, 315 Mont. 146, 69 P.3d 641, defendant entered a not guilty plea to the charge of attempted deliberate homicide at his arraignment. Defendant subsequently entered into a plea agreement wherein he agreed to plead guilty to one count of felony assault and the State agreed to amend the Information to drop the charge of attempted deliberate homicide. Defendant later withdrew his guilty plea on the felony assault charge and proceeded to trial on the charge of attempted deliberate homicide. <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-14. However, at trial, defense counsel admitted in both his opening statement and in his closing argument that defendant was guilty of felony assault. <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 45-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b638 We determined in <em>Jefferson </em>that counsel\u2019s remarks had the effect of entering a plea for defendant without his consent. <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 50. Hence, we held that because there was no plausible justification for counsel\u2019s conduct under the circumstances, counsel\u2019s admission could not be considered a trial strategy or tactical decision, and the issue was appropriate for review on direct appeal. <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u00b639 Similarly, in the instant case, there is no trial tactic or strategy that would permit defense counsel to allow his client to be charged and convicted of more crimes than are proper. Furthermore, if prosecutors in Montana are charging defendants with both criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs and criminal possession of those same dangerous drugs, then we need to address that issue and make sure the practice is stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\u00b640 Second, the dissent points out that defense counsel did raise a statute-based double jeopardy argument in the trial court when he cited to <em>State v. Tadewaldt </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 261, 922 P.2d 463, and <em>State v. Wells </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 337, 658 P.2d 381, in his brief in support of his motion to dismiss for violation of the prohibition against double jeopardy. The dissent then assumes that since defense counsel cited to these two cases, counsel must have been aware of the statutory provisions which govern the charging of offenses and that because counsel\u2019s reasons for not making an argument based upon \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA, are not spelled out in the record, the matter may not be reviewed on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\u00b641 On the contrary, defense counsel incorrectly cited <em>Tadewaldt </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the proposition that \u201c[t]he double jeopardy clause of the State of Montana provides greater protection than the U.S. constitution.\u201d What this Court actually said in <em>Tadewaldt </em>was that \u201c\u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, affords criminal defendants greater protection from double jeopardy than is provided under <em>Blockburger...\u201d Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont, at 268, 922 P.2d at 467. In a similar fashion, defense counsel did not rely on <em>Wells </em>for its analysis of \u00a7 46-11-502, MCA (later renumbered as \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA, the statute we relied on in this case regarding prohibiting multiple charges for lesser-included offenses). Because counsel completely missed that argument, it is not appropriate to assume, as the dissent does, that counsel was aware of the statutory provisions which govern the charging of offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b642 Third, the dissent points to this Court\u2019s discussion in <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 58, \u00b6 20, 30 P.3d 340, \u00b6 20, wherein we stated that \u201c[o]nly when the record will fully explain why counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense for the accused may this Court review the matter on direct appeal.\u201d However, this Court also stated in <em>White </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">[generally an alleged faitee to object to the introduction of evidence, or to object to the testimony of a witness, or object to prosecutorial misconduct at trial has been deemed record-based, and therefore appropriate for direct appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\"><em>White, </em>\u00b6 15. As we noted in our Opinion, defense counsel failed to object on double jeopardy grounds in the lower court that the offense of possession of methamphetamine was included within the offense of production or manufacture of methamphetamine. Instead, his double jeopardy argument was based on the claim that the offense of possession of precursors was included within the offense of production or manufacture of methamphetamine. Counsel\u2019s failure to object on the proper grounds is a matter of record as it is shown in his brief in support of his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\u00b643  Furthermore, whether counsel intentionally allowed Becker to be charged with both offenses or inadvertently allowed it, counsel\u2019s actions so clearly fell below the reasonable range of professional conduct required that there is no possible justification for them and neither an explanation in the record for counsel\u2019s actions nor a postconviction hearing to determine counsel\u2019s reasons for his actions is necessary. <em>See Jefferson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 49-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">\u00b644 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b402-9\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AuH\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b645 I dissent. I would affirm the conviction without prejudice to the defendant\u2019s right to pursue postconviction relief in regard to his claims, as required by the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b646 As the Court correctly notes, the defendant failed to raise his appellate issue before the District Court. There, he sought dismissal of a completely different charge. Although the Court properly concludes that the exercise of plain error review is inappropriate, it nonetheless undertakes review of the newly-raised issue by way of the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel argument. I respectfully submit that it is inappropriate to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\u00b647 The record is silent regarding why defense counsel raised the issues and formulated the arguments as he did in the District Court. Although he argued the <em>Blockburger </em>test, the record reflects that he also made reference to the Montana Constitution\u2019s greater double jeopardy protections and cited to <em>State v. Tadewaldt </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 261, 922 P.2d 463, which applied a statute-based double jeopardy analysis, and to <em>State v. Wells </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 337, 658 P.2d 381, which also referenced the charging statutes. Thus, the best assumption which can be made from the silent record is that counsel was aware of the statutory provisions which govern the charging of offenses. However, the reason he did not make an argument based upon \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA, is not indicated in the record and is therefore unknown<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"A2A\">\u00b648 \u201cAs we have stated on numerous previous occasion [sic], there is a strong presumption that counsel \u2018rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Notti, </em>2003 MT 296, \u00b6 6, 318 Mont. 146, \u00b6 6, 79 P.3d 289, \u00b6 6 (citing <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674). Further, and determinative here, \u201c \u2018a silent record cannot rebut the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>...Absent a complete record, </em>this Court will not speculate on counsel\u2019s alleged errors.\u2019 <em>\u201dNotti, </em>\u00b6 7 (quoting <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT 247, \u00b6 41, 317 Mont. 331, \u00b6 41, 77 P.3d 224, \u00b6 41) (emphasis added). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>There is no \u201ccomplete record\u201d here.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">We have repeatedly explained how this Court will determine whether an issue is record-based:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">Though not easily distilled into a formula, the definitive question that distinguishes and decides which actions are record and which are non-record, is why? In other words, if counsel fails to object to the admission of evidence, or fails to offer an opening statement, does the record fully explain <em>why </em>counsel took the particular course of action? If not, then the matter is best-suited for post-conviction proceedings which permit a further inquiry into whether the particular representation was ineffective. Only when the record will fully explain why counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense for the accused may this Court review the matter on direct appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-6\"><em>State v.

Here, the record does not reflect \u201cwhy\u201d counsel made the particular arguments he did and why he failed to make other arguments, and therefore, under our clear rule, the matter should not be reviewed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">\u00b649 The implication of the Court\u2019s opinion is that it believes that defense counsel was not fully aware of the applicable law and therefore erred in formulating his argument. However, we have specifically held that this kind of omission is a non-record issue which should be reserved for postconviction proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">As for those clearly non-record based areas of representation, this Court has identified counsel\u2019s failure to adequately investigate, or failure to prepare a defense, or <em>failure to familiarize him or herself with critical areas of the applicable law.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-9\"><em>White, </em>\u00b6 18 (emphasis added). We should follow our clear precedent. \u00b650 The Court has failed to properly apply the law. I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-7\"> The Court notes that the State filed an Amended Information six days prior to trial, adding the precursor possession charge. <em>See </em>\u00b6 9. Without further explanation, this statement may give the erroneous impression that defense counsel was rushed into making an incomplete argument. To the contrary, defense counsel requested a continuance of the trial \u201cso he can research the new charge that has been added to the Amended Information to see if there is a double jeopardy issue.\u201d Minute entry, 11/16/01. Defense counsel\u2019s request was granted and the trial was continued for that purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b404-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"ASFr\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">\u00b651 After going one way on the ineffective assistance claim at issue here, and then the other, I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion. Moreover, while I generally agree with the thrust of Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Rice\u2019s dissent, I disagree that we have clear precedent to follow at this point in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\u00b652 In my view, our jurisprudence has become somewhat scattery and occasionally downright inconsistent in the critically important and oft-reviewed ineffective assistance of counsel realm. This creates a mine field for all involved in direct appeals of criminal cases, as well as petitioners for postconviction relief, their counsel and the trial courts. I realize that a \u201cbright line\u201d test may not be altogether possible in cases such as these. In my view, however, it is important that we remain as consistent as possible in maintaining the distinction between record-based claims of ineffective assistance of counsel-which can be raised via direct appeal-and nonrecord-based claims which can be raised only in postconviction relief proceedings. For that reason, I set forth below a few of the problems in our case law in hopes that, in a future case, we will once again attempt to revisit this subject in a more global way. Doing so would be a service to all involved in the administration of criminal justice in Montana. To some extent, the inconsistencies to which I refer are illustrated in this case by Justice Rice\u2019s dissent and the Court\u2019s response to that dissent. Thus, I begin at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\u00b653 The dissent urges the Court to follow its clear precedents, including our 2001 decision in <em>White, </em>\u00b6 20, and probably dozens of others, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">the definitive question that distinguishes and decides which actions are record and which are non-record, is <em>why?... </em>Only when the record will fully explain why counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense for the accused may this Court review the matter on direct appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The dissent then cites to <em>White, </em>\u00b6 18, for the proposition that we have identified counsel\u2019s failure to be familiar with critical areas of the applicable law as a clearly nonrecord-based area of representation.</p>\n<p id=\"AiA\">\u00b654 The Court responds to the dissent\u2019s reliance on <em>White </em>by quoting the general statement in \u00b6 15 thereof that failures to object to certain matters are deemed record-based and, therefore, appropriate for direct appeal. In my view, the Court\u2019s response to the dissent in this regard presents far too narrow a reading of <em>White.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">\u00b655 Indeed, there can be no question that a counsel\u2019s failure to object is a record-based matter, since the fact of the lack of objection is readily discernable by reviewing the record. <em>See White, </em>\u00b6 15. The <em>White </em>Court proceeded immediately after that point, however, to observe that decisions as to the <em>timing </em>and <em>number </em>of objections lie within counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>tactical discretion, thereby generally requiring nonrecord-based information explaining the tactic and consequently barring the question from review on direct appeal. <em>See White, </em>\u00b6 16. In <em>White, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16 through 19, we farther discussed numerous other nonrecord matters not properly included in a direct appeal, ending at \u00b6 20, with the <em>why </em>distinction for whether a matter is or is not record-based. In other words, a failure to object is record-based, but the <em>reason </em>for a failure to object is not. Thus, the usual <em>why </em>distinction between record- and nonrecord-based matters arises. In my view, White-read in its entirety-supports the dissent\u2019s view that the issue before us is nonrecord-based and, therefore, must be raised in a postconviction relief proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u00b656 In response to the dissent, the Court also relies on <em>State v. Jefferson, </em>2003 MT 90, 315 Mont. 146, 69 P.3d 641, where counsel admitted in the opening statement and closing argument during his client\u2019s trial on the charge of attempted deliberate homicide, that the defendant was guilty of felony assault. We stated that the effect of counsel\u2019s statements was to enter a guilty plea without the defendant\u2019s consent, and no plausible justification could exist for such a decision. <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 50. Thus, we addressed the matter on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b657 Approximately a year after <em>Jefferson, </em>we decided <em>State v. Audet, </em>2004 MT 224, 322 Mont. 415, 96 P.3d 1144. There, the defendant proceeded to trial on misdemeanor resisting arrest and felony assault on a police officer charges. Counsel conceded in opening and closing statements that his client was not contesting the resisting arrest charge. <em>Audet, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-6. In addressing an ineffective assistance claim on that basis on direct appeal, we determined that, while the record confirmed counsel\u2019s admissions, the record did not set forth the reasons <em>why </em>counsel chose that course of conduct. Consequently, we were unable to determine on direct appeal whether counsel\u2019s decision fell outside the parameters of reasonable professional conduct. <em>See Audet, </em>\u00b6 12. Our only reference to <em>Jefferson in Audet </em>was a <em>See </em>cite indicating generally that cases exist where counsel\u2019s actions \u201cso clearly fall below the reasonable range of professional conduct required that neither an explanation for the action in the record or a post-conviction hearing is necessary to explain the reasons.\u201d <em>Audet, </em>\u00b6 14. We did not mention that <em>Jefferson </em>reached the opposite result under virtually identical facts; nor did we set forth any analysis distinguishing <em>Jefferson </em>from <em>Audet.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b658 These kinds of apparent inconsistencies in our case law on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>ineffective assistance of counsel are conceivably distinguishable on some tiny factual difference between the cases. On the face of the cases, however, no reasonably intelligent reader could ascertain whether counsel\u2019s admissions of the type addressed in <em>Jefferson </em>and <em>Audet </em>may or may not be raised on direct appeal as a record-based ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Indeed, in retrospect, I can no longer justify joining the Court\u2019s \u201cno plausible justification\u201d decision in <em>Jefferson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b659 Finally, in this regard, I highlight our opinion in <em>State v Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095. The Court does not discuss <em>Kougl, </em>but that case further illustrates the miasma we have created in our jurisprudence on ineffective assistance claims and whether they can or cannot be raised on direct appeal. There, we ultimately reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction on direct appeal, after concluding that the ineffective assistance claim relating to counsel\u2019s failure to request a jury instruction that accomplice testimony be viewed with distrust was properly before us, and that counsel could have had \u201cno plausible explanation\u201d for failing to request the instruction. <em>See Kougl, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21, 22, 24 and 27. We first relied on <em>White </em>for the proposition that counsel\u2019s failure to offer a particular jury instruction is generally not record-based. We went on, however, to determine that whether the reasons for defense counsel\u2019s failure to do so in <em>Kougl </em>were or were not of record \u201cis irrelevant,\u201d because \u201cthere could not be any legitimate reason for what counsel did.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b660 <em>Kougl, White, Jefferson and Audet </em>illustrate the mine field in our jurisprudence referenced above. How can appellate counsel ever know whether this Court will stay with the record versus nonrecord distinction? The answer is that counsel cannot know. The result is that good appellate counsel, for ethical reasons and to avoid later claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, will always raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal. The result of that step is that the Court will receive more and more such claims on direct appeal and, in every case, will be forced to proceed with an analysis of whether or not the matter is within the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d or whether some reason can be located to hold that trial counsel rendered deficient performance without ever allowing trial counsel the opportunity to be heard. At the bottom line, the case-by-case approach now gaining steam in our jurisprudence will soon overwhelm the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d and, consequently, weaken the requirement that an appellant must actually establish deficient performance to succeed on an ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>\u00b661 But the mischief will not stop there. In cases where no ineffective assistance claim is raised on direct appeal, district court judges addressing petitions for postconviction relief will struggle mightily to predict whether an ineffective assistance claim \u201ccould reasonably have been raised on direct appeal\u201d for purposes of determining whether the claim can be raised in the postconviction arena or is barred pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA. The number of appeals from trial court decisions in such proceedings necessarily will increase as well, and this Court will have few, if any, yardsticks for considering whether the claim was procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b662 With respect to the Court, and with full recognition that I joined in many of the cases which moved us away from at least a workable distinction between record-based and nonrecord-based matters, I cannot continue down this path. We have an obligation to provide guidance to the trial bench and practicing bar. We are doing just the opposite in our jurisprudence on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b663 I would hold that the ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the present case is not record-based. On that basis, I would dismiss that claim without prejudice to its being raised in a postconviction relief proceeding. I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
