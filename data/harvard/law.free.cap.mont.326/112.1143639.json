The District Court imposed sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>and entered judgment. Webster appeals, arguing that his counsel was ineffective in several respects. We conclude Webster\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be addressed without considering matters outside the record and, accordingly, this appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as whether Webster\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel may be raised on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u00b63 On the night of November 25, 2002, police officers for the City of Great Falls, Montana, responded to a report of suspicious activity in a hotel room. Webster, who had been staying in the room for two nights, was in the room when the officers arrived. During a search of the room, the officers found methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\u00b64 A police officer who testified at trial told the jury that when he and another officer knocked on the hotel room door and asked to enter, Webster allowed them in. The two officers who then entered the room both testified Webster gave them permission to look around and that they found a container of methamphetamine under the bed and a brown bag containing methamphetamine next to the bed. The officers testified that, at first, Webster denied owning either item; he later told them the drugs were his and he was using them.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">\u00b65 Webster testified at his trial. He told the jury that, minutes before the police officers knocked on his door, he had found a shaving bag containing the drugs and drug paraphernalia in the parking lot of the hotel and taken the bag back to his room. In response to his counsel\u2019s question as to what he intended to do with the bag, Webster said he was \u201cthinking of\u2019 throwing the bag back out the door. He also maintained the police officers forced their way into his hotel room and searched it without permission. At that point in the trial, Webster\u2019s attorney asked the court for a recess. Outside the presence of the jury and the prosecutor, counsel informed the court he believed Webster had committed perjury. He moved for a mistrial and asked to be allowed to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">\u00b66 After an overnight recess, the court denied defense counsel\u2019s motions. It explained to Webster that his options at that point were to continue the trial with his attorney or to continue <em>pro se. </em>Webster told the court he wanted his attorney to continue representing him, and his testimony then resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">\u00b67 On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Webster a series of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>questions concerning whether he gave the police officers permission to enter his hotel room. When Webster\u2019s responses to those questions conflicted with the officers\u2019 earlier testimony, the prosecutor asked Webster whether he was saying the officers were lying and Webster answered, \u201cYes.\u201d Webster\u2019s counsel did not object to this questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"ATn\">\u00b68 The jury found Webster guilty of the charges against him, and the District Court subsequently sentenced him and entered judgment. Webster appeals. He contends his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in connection with his own testimony and in failing to object to the prosecution\u2019s \u201cwere they lying\u201d questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u00b69 We analyze claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under the two-pronged test from <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. That test requires the defendant to establish that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>State v. Hendricks, </em>2003 MT 223, \u00b6 6, 317 Mont. 177, \u00b6 6, 75 P.3d 1268, \u00b6 6 (citations omitted). With regard to the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, there is a strong presumption that trial counsel\u2019s performance was based on sound trial strategy and falls within the broad range of reasonable professional conduct. <em>Hendricks, </em>\u00b6 7 (citation omitted). When the record is silent as to the reasoning behind counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient actions, we are unable to determine whether those actions were unreasonable, thereby overcoming the presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the reasonable range of professional conduct. As a result, when the record in a direct appeal is insufficient to determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, the issue is more appropriately brought in a petition for postconviction relief and the direct appeal must be dismissed. <em>Hendricks, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-11 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">\u00b610 May Webster\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel be raised on direct appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">\u00b611 Webster claims his counsel rendered ineffective assistance during both his direct and cross-examination. He contends his attorney should not have asked him what he intended to do with the bag containing drugs after he testified that he found it out in the parking lot. In addition, while acknowledging an attorney\u2019s duty to disclose criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>conduct which occurs during trial pursuant to Rule 3.3(a)(2) of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct, Webster contends his attorney breached the duty of client confidentiality by failing to take appropriate remedial steps before choosing to report peijury to the court. He asks us to adopt a new standard which would require his counsel, before reporting peijury, to meet with him to determine the scope of the allegedly false testimony and to ask him to give his testimony in narrative fashion, as suggested in Nix <em>v. Whiteside </em>(1986), 475 U.S. 157, 106 S.Ct. 988, 89 L.Ed.2d 123, and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u00b612 The District Court record does not reflect why defense counsel asked Webster what he intended to do with the drugs and drug paraphernalia. Nor does the record reveal counsel\u2019s litigation strategy about the defense theory or whether Webster went \u201coff-script\u201d and testified extemporaneously without his counsel\u2019s consent, resulting in counsel\u2019s report of peijury.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u00b613  The definitive question regarding which of counsel\u2019s actions are of record and which are not is \u201cwhy?\u201d If the record does not explain why counsel took a particular course of action, the matter is best suited for postconviction proceedings, which permit a further inquiry into whether representation was ineffective. <em>See, e.g., State v. Bateman, </em>2004 MT 281, \u00b6 23, 323 Mont. 280, \u00b6 23, 99 P.3d 656, \u00b6 23 (citations omitted); <em>State v. J.C., </em>2004 MT 75, \u00b6 25, 320 Mont. 411, \u00b6 25, 87 P.3d 501, \u00b6 25 (citations omitted); <em>State v. Turnsplenty, </em>2003 MT 159, \u00b6 17, 316 Mont. 275, \u00b6 17, 70 P.3d 1234, \u00b6 17 (citations omitted); <em>Soraich v. State, </em>2002 MT 187, \u00b6 22, 311 Mont. 90, \u00b6 22, 53 P.3d 878, \u00b6 22 (citations omitted). We conclude, therefore, that the question of whether Webster\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by asking him what he intended to do with the bag containing drugs, and then informing the court he believed Webster had committed peijury, is a matter which must be raised in a proceeding for postconviction relief, not on direct appeal. As a result, we also decline to consider the new standard advocated by Webster for appropriate remedial steps before counsel may report peijury to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u00b614 Webster also claims his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object when the prosecutor asked him, on cross-examination, if the police officers were lying. He contends these questions were improper because they were irrelevant and were asked only to make him look bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\u00b615 No Montana authority clearly establishes whether questioning a defendant about the truthfulness of other witnesses is proper; indeed, we have declined to establish a bright-line rule on the propriety of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>questions. <em>See State v. Hart, </em>2000 MT 332, \u00b6 43, 303 Mont. 71, \u00b6 43, 15 P.3d 917, \u00b6 43. Moreover, the use or non-use of objections may be purely tactical. <em>See, e.g., Phyle v. Leapley </em>(8th Cir. 1995), 66 F.3d 154, 159. The record before us does not reflect the reasons behind counsel\u2019s failure to object to the questioning by the prosecution. As a result, we conclude this claim cannot be raised on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u00b616 We dismiss this appeal without prejudice to the issues being raised in a postconviction relief proceeding.</p>\n<judges id=\"b142-5\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
