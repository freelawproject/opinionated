(Piper), Robert English (English), and Tom O\u2019Neill (O\u2019Neill). The plaintiff investors made various common law tort claims arising from the alleged mismanagement of their accounts created and maintained by Piper\u2019s branch office in Butte, Montana. O\u2019Neill, who was a securities broker in Piper\u2019s Butte office,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> allegedly took the actions that gave rise to the lawsuits, and English was O\u2019Neill\u2019s direct supervisor throughout this time. In response to the lawsuits, Piper filed motions to compel arbitration in each case, seeking to enforce \u201cpre-dispute\u201d arbitration clauses-that is, clauses in the account agreements which required any dispute be resolved by arbitration. Piper\u2019s motions to compel arbitration led to a series of hearings by a panel of three district court judges, who were sitting individually on the cases, but who sat era <em>banc </em>to hear evidence common to all 23 cases. In addition, individual hearings were held with respect to several of the individual plaintiffs. While Piper called common witnesses to testify, O\u2019Neill, in a prior discovery deposition, invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and did not offer testimony regarding the accounts at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">\u00b62 Harry Willems (Willems) is the plaintiff in this matter. On April 7,2004, the Second Judicial District Court, Silver Bow County, denied Piper\u2019s motion to compel arbitration of Willems\u2019s claims, and Piper appeals therefrom. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">\u00b63 The following issues are raised on appeal in regard to the District Court\u2019s denial of Piper\u2019s motion to compel:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>\u00b64 Did the District Court err in holding that the PAT Plus Agreements created a fiduciary duty between Piper and Willems that was breached by Piper?</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\">\u00b65 Did the District Court violate the Federal Arbitration Act and Montana law by holding the arbitration agreement to a different contractual standard when it concluded the PAT Plus Agreements were contracts of adhesion?</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err in applying the <em>Kloss </em>factors?</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err in holding that Willems failed to effectively waive his constitutional rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b68 Is the securities arbitration process, held before a self-regulatory organization overseen by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, fair and reasonable as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\u00b69 The District Court\u2019s order offered an extensive analysis of all issues raised by the parties. The District Court determined that the PAT Plus Agreements were contracts of adhesion; that Piper\u2019s prearbitration dispute provisions were unconscionable and not within plaintiffs\u2019 reasonable expectations; that Piper failed to demonstrate that plaintiffs voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived their constitutional rights to a jury trial and access to the court; Piper failed to demonstrate that plaintiffs received or reviewed the arbitration provision; and that a fiduciary duty was created by Piper\u2019s PAT Plus Agreements and breached by the defendants. We conclude that the issue pertaining to the fiduciary duty is determinative on appeal and therefore will not address the other issues, except as necessary to resolve the dispositive issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">\u00b610 In 1986, Willems retained O\u2019Neill as his broker and financial advisor to help him open a Self-Directed Individual Retirement Account (1986 IRA). Later that year, Willems opened a Joint Piper Automatic Transfer Account with his wife Marie Willems, which he later upgraded to a Co-Owner Piper Automatic Transfer Plus Account in 1995. On November 9, 1993, Willems opened a Co-Owner Piper Automatic Transfer Plus Account with his mother Bernice Willems. The 1993 and 1995 Piper Automatic Transfer Plus Account agreements hereinafter shall be collectively referred to as the \u201cPAT Plus Agreements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">\u00b611 Willems claims that O\u2019Neill, supervised by English, engaged in unlawful, unreasonable, and unethical conduct relating to the 1986 IRA, which did not contain a pre-dispute arbitration clause. Willems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>contests Piper\u2019s invocation of the PAT Plus Agreements\u2019 arbitration clauses because: (1) his claims are not based upon transactions in these accounts; and (2) Willems was informed that the PAT Plus Agreements were entirely separate and distinct from his 1986 IRA, and therefore had no affect on his 1986 IRA. Conversely, Piper explains that by signing the PAT Plus Agreements, Willems agreed to arbitrate disputes relating to <em>any </em>account he held with Piper, and notes the following language found in both PAT Plus Agreements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">You agree to arbitrate any disputes between Piper Jaffray and you. You specifically agree and recognize that all controversies which may arise between Piper Jaffray, its agents, representatives or employees and you concerning any transaction, account of the construction, performance or breach of this or any other agreement between us, whether entered into prior, on, or subsequent to the date hereof shall be determined by arbitration to the full extent provided by law. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Thus, it is the arbitration provisions, set forth in the PAT Plus Agreements and incorporating Willems\u2019s 1986 IRA, which are at issue herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u00b612 On January 24, 2003, Willems filed a complaint in the Second Judicial District Court against Piper, English, and O\u2019Neill alleging mismanagement of his 1986 IRA. On March 24, 2003, Piper filed a motion to compel arbitration based upon the provisions of the PAT Plus Agreements requiring arbitration of disputes in any of Willems\u2019s accounts. On July 9, August 12, and September 3, 2003, a panel of three district court judges sat <em>en bane </em>to hear evidence common to all 23 cases arising from the alleged misconduct of Piper\u2019s broker, O\u2019Neill. On April 7, 2004, the District Court denied Piper\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. Piper appeals therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">\u00b613 We review whether a district court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct in determining whether or not an issue is subject to arbitration under an existing agreement. <em>Iwen v. U.S. West Direct, </em>1999 MT 63, \u00b6 17, 293 Mont. 512, \u00b6 17, 977 P.2d 989, \u00b6 17. When a district court is asked to compel arbitration of a dispute, the threshold inquiry is whether the parties agreed to arbitrate. <em>Solle v. Western States Ins. Agency, </em>2000 MT 96, \u00b6 22, 299 Mont. 237, \u00b6 22, 999 P.2d 328, \u00b6 22. Because arbitration is a matter of contract, the rules of contract apply, and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>party has not agreed to submit. <em>Solle, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\">\u00b614 A fiduciary relationship is created whenever a broker has discretion to buy, sell, or otherwise control a client\u2019s account. <em>Chor v. Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood, Inc. </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 143, 153, 862 P.2d 26, 32. In determining the scope or extent of the fiduciary obligation, our review becomes highly fact intensive. <em>Moss v. Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., </em>2002 MT 129, \u00b6 35, 310 Mont. 123, \u00b6 35, 54 P.3d 1, \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b615 Did the District Court err in holding that the PAT Plus Agreements created a fiduciary duty between Piper and Willems that was breached by Piper?</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b616 In <em>Chor, </em>we held that \u00a7 30-10-301(1), MCA, creates an implied code of conduct for brokers, violations of which may constitute a breach of the duty that a broker owes to his customer. <em>Chor, </em>261 Mont, at 152, 862 P.2d at 31-32. We further held that in the absence of discretionary authority by a broker to buy and sell in a customer\u2019s account, no fiduciary relationship is created between the broker and the customer. <em>Chor, </em>261 Mont, at 153,862 P.2d at 32. <em>In Moss, </em>we inversely restated that principle, holding that \u201ca fiduciary relationship <em>is created </em>whenever a broker has discretion to buy and sell in the client\u2019s account.\u201d <em>Moss, </em>\u00b6 35. Thus, we begin our analysis by first determining whether the PAT Plus Agreements granted such discretion to Piper\u2019s brokers.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u00b617 Piper argues that the PAT Plus Agreements did not grant it discretion to make trades on behalf of its clients and therefore did not create a fiduciary duty. Piper contends the District Court improperly interpreted the following underlined contract provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">Customer\u2019s Orders Binding Until Notice of Death</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsF\">Upon your death or failure to comply with any part of this Agreement or whenever Piper Jaffray deems it necessary for its protection. Piner Jaffrav is authorized (but is not required) to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">- Cancel outstanding orders;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">- Purchase, sell, assign, receive and deliver all or any part of the securities held or carried for you: and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">- Close out short sales by purchase upon any exchange board or market or any public or private sale at Piper Jaffray\u2019s option.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">(Underlining added.) In particular, Piper claims that the phrase, \u201cwhenever Piper Jaffray deems it necessary for its protection,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>concerns Piper\u2019s rights upon a client\u2019s death or when a client is otherwise incapacitated. Piper makes note that upon the death or incapacity of a client, it must have a limited discretion over the client\u2019s accounts in case the securities decline in value so that it may ensure it is in compliance with certain federal requirements, but that this limited discretion is not sufficient to trigger discretion for purposes of creating a fiduciary duty. Thus, Piper urges this Court to not derive a \u201cbroad\u201d or \u201cunfettered\u201d grant of discretion from the middle of a provision that merely concerns Piper\u2019s rights upon the death or incapacitation of a client.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b6 18 Additionally, Piper notes that its Supervisory Procedures Manual provides that a client must execute additional documents if the client wishes to grant discretion to Piper. Piper claims that Willems did not execute the required documentation according to the procedures in the supervisory manual. Piper argues that the fact that Willems\u2019s claims include allegations that Piper made \u201cunauthorized transactions\u201d in his 1986 IRA, a nondiscretionary account, is additional evidence that Willems understood that Piper lacked discretion to independently authorize transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b619 Finally, Piper argues that <em>Kloss </em>does not control the outcome here for two reasons. First, Piper asserts that the brokerage account agreement in <em>Kloss </em>is distinguishable from the PAT Plus Agreements. Second, it argues that the <em>Kloss </em>holding that a broker has a fiduciary duty to disclose and explain the arbitration clause within the account agreement is \u201cin contrast to most statements of law.\u201d Piper contends that if a broker had discretion in handling an account, the broker\u2019s duties would not extend beyond financial management. Furthermore, Piper claims that brokers should not have the duty to read and explain arbitration clauses to clients since clients come to brokers for financial advice, not legal advice, and the broker may be engaging in the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u00b620 Piper\u2019s second <em>Kloss </em>argument is essentially an invitation to revisit and reverse our holding in <em>Kloss. </em>However, we see no error in the <em>Kloss </em>Court\u2019s analysis as to the fiduciary duty in this context, and therefore, we decline Piper\u2019s invitation to revisit that decision. We reject Piper\u2019s argument that such discretion does not create a fiduciary obligation to explain the arbitration provisions, or that such an obligation requires the broker to engage in the unauthorized practice of law. The obligation is one which accompanies the fiduciary relationship created when a broker accepts a customer\u2019s authorization to make transactions within the customer\u2019s account in the broker\u2019s own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\">\u00b621 Willems responds to Piper\u2019s first <em>Kloss </em>argument by arguing that the language highlighted in the PAT Plus Agreements is similar to the language in the <em>Kloss </em>agreement, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\">You may sell any or all property held in any of my accounts and cancel any open orders for the purchase or sale of any property without notice, in the event of my death or whenever in your discretion you consider it necessary for your protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"><em>Kloss, </em>\u00b6 36. We determined that this language granted discretion to the broker to buy and sell securities on behalf of the broker\u2019s client. <em>Kloss, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 36-37. Thus, Willems asserts the District Court properly concluded that the similar language in the PAT Plus Agreements likewise granted such discretion, thereby creating a fiduciary duty on behalf of the broker to explain the consequences of arbitration to clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u00b622  In spite of Piper\u2019s contention that it is required under federal law to have \u201climited discretion\u201d to make transactions on behalf of its clients to ensure compliance with certain federal requirements, the PAT Plus Agreements contain no provisions or explanations as to this \u201climitation\u201d or that the discretion granted in the agreement is effective only when securities decline in value. Moreover, the plain meaning of the following language- \u201cupon your death or failure to comply with any part of this Agreement or whenever Piper Jaffray deems it necessary for its protection\u2019-demonstrates that Piper retained broad authority to purchase, sell, assign, receive and deliver all or any part of the securities held by its clients. (Emphasis added.) Indeed, transactions could be made whenever Piper \u201cdeem[ed] it necessary\u201d for its own best interest. Thus, the District Court did not err in concluding that the PAT Plus Agreements granted Piper\u2019s brokers discretion to buy and sell securities, thereby creating a fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\u00b623 Piper contends that the District Court erroneously concluded that a fiduciary duty existed <em>before </em>Willems signed the PAT Plus Agreements. Piper explains that written contracts are only effective at delivery, and therefore a fiduciary duty, triggering an obligation to explain the arbitration provision, could not exist before the PAT Plus Agreements were signed. Willems responds that Piper\u2019s argument is misplaced in view of our holding in <em>Kloss. </em>Willems argues that when a fiduciary duty is created, even if it is created the very moment <em>after </em>the agreement is signed, a broker has a duty to advise its customers-pursuant to its duty of the finest loyalty-as to the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>of arbitration, or if the client may \u201copt out\u201d of arbitration by crossing out the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b624 In <em>Kloss, </em>an investor opened an account which contained a predispute arbitration clause. We concluded that, because the brokerage firm had discretion to buy and sell securities in the investor\u2019s account, a fiduciary relationship was created and the broker had an obligation to explain the effect of an arbitration clause. <em>Kloss, </em>\u00b6 37. Although we did not state that the obligation arose prior to the actual signing of the agreement, that was, by necessity, the effect of our holding. Entering an agreement which bestows discretion upon the broker requires that the customer be advised of the agreement\u2019s arbitration provision so that an informed decision to sign the agreement can be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b625  It is undisputed that Piper did not advise Willems as to the nature of the arbitration clause or that he had the option of crossing out certain provisions. Further, the District Court found, and Piper does not challenge on appeal, that Willems did not understand that by signing the PAT Plus Agreements he was in any way affecting his 1986 IRA. Therefore, in accordance with our holding in <em>Kloss, </em>we conclude the District Court did not err in holding that the PAT Plus Agreements created a fiduciary duty between Piper and Willems and that Piper breached its fiduciary duty when it failed to explain the consequences of the arbitration provision prior to the formation of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u00b626 Finally, Piper contends that, pursuant to the <em>Kloss </em>Court\u2019s determination that the analysis as to whether a fiduciary duty exists is \u201chighly fact intensive,\u201d the facts here are distinguishable from those in <em>Kloss. </em>It notes that, in <em>Kloss, </em>the broker had a regular practice of explaining key contract terms to the customer, and that this led the Court to conclude that the broker had a fiduciary duty to explain the arbitration provision to the customer. Piper thus reasons that the District Court improperly relied on <em>Kloss </em>to create a \u201cspecial legal standard\u201d regarding fiduciary duties applicable only to arbitration provisions and not to other contract provisions, in violation of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and United States Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\u00b627 We conclude that the District Court created no new special legal standards but instead properly applied Montana case law by relying on <em>Kloss. </em>\u201cThe FAA provides that an agreement to arbitrate is valid except where grounds exist at law or in equity to revoke the contract .... Montana law also requires the enforcement of predispute arbitration clauses \u2018except upon grounds that exist at law or in equity for the revocation of a contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kingston v. Ameritrade, Inc., </em>2000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>MT 269, \u00b6 13, 302 Mont. 90, \u00b6 13, 12 P.3d 929, \u00b6 13 (citing \u00a7 27-5-114(2), MCA). Though the brokerage firm in <em>Kloss </em>had a \u201cregular practice of explaining key contract terms,\u201d the enforceability of an arbitration provision is not dependent upon such an office custom or practice. The determination of the existence of a duty here is dependent upon all of the facts, and particularly, the extent of authority or discretion granted by the customer within the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"AlBa\">\u00b628  We affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Piper owed a fiduciary duty to explain the arbitration provision to Willems which was breached, and further, that the pre-dispute arbitration provisions in the PAT Plus Agreements are unenforceable.</p>\n<judges id=\"b137-3\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, WARNER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-12\"> At the time the lawsuits were filed, O\u2019Neill was no longer employed at Piper,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
