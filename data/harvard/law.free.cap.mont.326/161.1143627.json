The Twelfth Judicial District Court, Hill County, sentenced Johnson to the Department of Corrections for eight years, with five years suspended. Among other conditions of release to probation or parole, Johnson was ordered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>submit to DNA testing. He appeals the DNA testing requirement. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows: Is the Right to Privacy as guaranteed by Article II, Section 10, of the Montana Constitution violated when an incarcerated person convicted of non-violent felony offenses is ordered to submit a DNA sample pursuant to \u00a7 44-6-103, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b63 Johnson was charged with Burglary, Theft, Sexual Intercourse Without Consent, and Forgery by Common Scheme on May 7,2003. On September 4,2003, he entered into a plea agreement with the State in which he agreed to plead guilty to the Burglary, Theft, and Forgery by Common Scheme counts in exchange for a sentencing recommendation and the dismissal of the count of Sexual Intercourse Without Consent. The requirement to provide a DNA sample was not one of the provisions in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">\u00b64 On November 12,2003, Johnson was sentenced to the Department of Corrections for eight years, with five years suspended. The District Court also required that as a condition of probation or parole, Johnson would be required to submit to DNA testing pursuant to \u00a7 44-6-103, MCA (2003). Johnson appeals from this sentencing condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">\u00b65 We review a District Court\u2019s sentence for legality only. <em>State v. Eaton, </em>2004 MT 283, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 287, \u00b6 11, 99 P.3d 661, \u00b6 11 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">\u00b66 Is the Right to Privacy as guaranteed by Article II, Section 10, of the Montana Constitution violated when an incarcerated person convicted of non-violent felony offenses is ordered to submit a DNA sample pursuant to \u00a7 44-6-103, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">\u00b67 Johnson argues that it is unconstitutional to force someone convicted of and incarcerated for non-violent felony offenses to submit to DNA testing, as this violates his right to privacy as guaranteed by Article II, Section 10, of the Montana Constitution, as well as his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, as guaranteed by Article II, Section 11, of the Montana Constitution, and the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Amendment to the United States Constitution. Although Johnson also argued that requiring him to submit to DNA testing would be in violation of \u00a7 46-18-202(l)(e), MCA, he conceded in his Reply that such argument was not properly preserved for appeal. Thus, it will not be considered here.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b68 The State responds that Johnson failed to adequately preserve his argument that the DNA testing requirement constituted an unconstitutional search and seizure, and that this Court should not consider this argument on appeal. The State asserts that the sole relevant objection made by Johnson\u2019s counsel relative to the DNA test at his sentencing addressed privacy concerns, and not search and seizure. Johnson replies that the analysis of a violation against an individual\u2019s right to privacy implicates an argument against unreasonable searches and seizures, and that his right to privacy argument in his Brief to this Court was incorporated by reference into his search and seizure argument. He does not, however, refute the State\u2019s assertion that he did not object on the search and seizure grounds in the sentencing court. Thus, this argument is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b69 On the issue of whether the DNA test would violate Johnson\u2019s right to privacy, Johnson maintains, without citation, that the legislative history of \u00a7 44-6-103, MCA, shows that the primary justifications for the statute are: investigation and prosecution of crimes; providing accurate prosecutions; and preventing recidivism. Relying on <em>State v. Siegal </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 250, 934 P.2d 176, and <em>State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, 314 Mont. 434, 67 P.3d 207, he argues that these alleged justifications do not withstand scrutiny under Article II, Section 10, of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b610 The State responds that Johnson is a convicted felon and prisoner with little or no reasonable expectation of privacy, and both <em>Siegal </em>and <em>Martinez </em>are distinguishable, because both cases involved searches of private citizens, not incarcerated felons. The State notes that under \u00a7 44-6-103(1), MCA, a person convicted of a felony offense is required provide a biological sample for DNA testing, and that, pursuant to the definition found at \u00a7 44-6-101(7), MCA, a burglary is such a felony. Thus, the State concludes, Johnson\u2019s sentence falls within lawful parameters, and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b611  It is unclear to us whether Johnson intends his argument to be construed as a constitutional challenge to \u00a7 44-6-103, MCA. Assuming that he does, we cannot make such a determination on the basis of the abbreviated arguments before us. We review a district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>court\u2019s sentence for legality only. <em>Eaton, </em>\u00b6 11. Pursuant to \u00a7 44-6-103, MCA, a person convicted <em>of </em>a felony shall submit to DNA testing. Johnson was convicted of a crime which meets the definition of a \u201cfelony offense\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 44-6-101(7), MCA. Thus, his sentence is not illegal, and we decline to disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b612 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b190-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
