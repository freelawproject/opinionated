We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court impose restitution in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-242(1)(a) &amp; (b), and -244(1), MCA (2001)?</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in ordering Workman to make full restitution in the amount of $26,840.33?</p>\n<p id=\"b28-12\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b28-13\">\u00b65 In March 2002, Workman, with different accomplices, committed three burglaries in Billings, Montana. The first burglary occurred on March 4, 2002, when Workman and two accomplices, Tyson Heisler (Heisler) and Sundance Marshall (Marshall), unlawfully entered the home of Stephen Ball (Ball) and stole nine firearms, which Workman and his accomplices used in the other two burglaries. On March 15, 2002, Workman and Marshall, accompanied by Tyson Garza (Garza) unlawfully entered the home of Cynthia Foster (Foster) and stole numerous items of personal property. Then, on March 20, 2002, Workman, accompanied by Michael Brandon (Brandon) unlawfully entered the home of Duane and Terry Van Atta (Van Attas), and stole items of personal property. In total, the pecuniary loss suffered by all three victims was $35,771.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-14\">\u00b66 On March 27,2002, the State charged Workman with three counts of felony burglary in violation of \u00a7 45-6-204, MCA. The State charged Heisler, Marshall, and Garza with misdemeanor offenses related to their involvement in the burglaries, and Brandon entered a plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>agreement for misdemeanor deceptive practices. Brandon was ordered to pay restitution of $200.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b67 On October 17, 2002, Workman entered into a plea agreement. Under its terms, Workman pleaded guilty to all three counts, and the State recommended on Count I, a three- year deferred sentence, a $250.00 fine and restitution; on Count II, a three-year deferred sentence, a $250.00 fine and restitution; and on Count III, a one-year deferred sentence, a $250.00 fine and restitution. All three sentences were to run consecutively, for a total of seven years deferred, a $750.00 fine and restitution for all three burglaries. The parties stipulated that Workman owed restitution in the amount of $2,866.98 to Ball, $16,185.50 to Foster, and $7,787.85 to the Van Attas, totaling $26,840.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b68 On February 26, 2003, the District Court held a sentencing hearing. The court examined the presentence investigation (PSI) report, which detailed Workman\u2019s assets and debts, his current place of employment and salary, and the financial loss statements from all three victims listing the items stolen and their respective values, as well as insurance statements indicating the loss claimed by each victim. Workman\u2019s attorney argued that the court should not hold Workman jointly and severally responsible for the full amount of restitution, but only responsible for his proportionate share, which counsel argued was $10,234.76, the proportionate share as divided among all the defendants. Rejecting Workman\u2019s argument, the District Court sentenced Workman to six years at the Montana Department of Corrections, and ordered that Workman was jointly and severally responsible for restitution in the amount of $26,840.33. Workman appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s sentence imposed in a criminal case for legality only, confining our review to whether the sentence is within the parameters set by statute. <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 126, \u00b6 13, 321 Mont. 280, \u00b6 13, 90 P.3d 426, \u00b6 13. In reviewing a district court\u2019s findings of fact, including the amount of restitution, our standard of review is whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">\u00b610 Did the District Court impose restitution in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-242(l)(a) &amp; (b), and -244(1), MCA (2001). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u00b611 Workman argues that the District Court\u2019s imposition of full restitution was unlawful because the court did not adhere to the requirements established in \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-242(l)(a) &amp; (b), or -244(1), MCA (2001). However, as the State correctly notes, these provisions were amended in 2003 and were made to apply retroactively to offenders, such as Workman, whose restitution obligation was unpaid as of October 1, 2003, the effective date of the legislation. <em>See </em>Laws of Montana, Ch. 272, Sec. 10 (2003). Workman does not challenge the application of the 2003 amendments and offers no argument thereunder. Therefore, we will address his arguments in accordance with the 2003 versions.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">\u00b612 Workman first argues that the PSI report examined by the District Court contained inaccurate documentation as to his financial resources and future ability to pay restitution, and only contained conclusory statements by the victims as to their pecuniary losses in violation of the requirements established in \u00a7 46-18-242(l)(a) &amp; (b), MCA (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b613 Section 46-18-242, MCA (2001), provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-6\">(1) Whenever the court believes that a victim of the offense may have sustained a pecuniary loss as a result of the offense or whenever the prosecuting attorney requests, the court shall order the probation officer, restitution officer, or other designated person to include in the presentence investigation and report:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-7\">(a) documentation of the offender\u2019s financial resources and future ability to pay restitution; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-8\">(b) documentation of the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss, submitted by the victim or by the board of crime control if compensation for the victim\u2019s loss has been reimbursed by the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">\u00b614 Section 46-18-242(l)(a) &amp; (b), MCA (2003), provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-10\">(1) Whenever the court believes that a victim may have sustained a pecuniary loss or whenever the prosecuting attorney requests, the court shall order the probation officer, restitution officer, or other designated person to include in the presentence investigation and report:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-11\">(a) a list of the offender\u2019s assets; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-12\">(b) an affidavit that specifically describes the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss and the replacement value in dollars of the loss, submitted by the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-13\">\u00b615  While the 2001 version of \u00a7 46-18-242(l)(a) &amp; (b), (MCA), required district courts to consider a defendant\u2019s financial resources and future ability to pay before imposing a restitution obligation, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>2003 version of \u00a7 46-18-242(l)(a) &amp; (b), MCA, only requires that the PSI report contain information as to a defendant\u2019s assets, and an affidavit describing the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss and the replacement value in dollars of the loss, submitted by the victim. Thus, the District Court\u2019s order imposing restitution satisfied these provisions, as Workman\u2019s financial resources and his future ability to pay a restitution obligation were not considerations under \u00a7 46-18-242, MCA (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">\u00b616  Secondly, Workman argues that the District Court did not establish a payment schedule or set the amount of his installment payments, in violation of \u00a7 46-18-244(1), MCA (2001). Again, this provision was revised in 2003. Section 46-18-244(1), MCA (2003), provides that \u201c[t]he court shall specify the total amount of restitution that the offender shall pay,\u201d and does not require that the court establish a payment schedule or set the amount of the defendant\u2019s installment payments, as did the 2001 version of \u00a7 46-18-244(1), MCA. The PSI report examined by the District Court at the sentencing hearing indicated Workman\u2019s had no assets, and detailed the total pecuniary loss suffered by Workman\u2019s victims. The court then imposed restitution in the amount of $26,840.33 and further noted how the money was to be distributed between the victims and their representative insurers by the clerk of the court. Therefore, the District Court\u2019s imposition of restitution complied with \u00a7 46-18-244(1), MCA (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b617 Did the District Court err in ordering Workman to make full restitution in the amount of $26,840.33?</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b618 Workman challenges the District Court\u2019s order making him jointly and severally liable for the full amount of restitution for the property stolen and damaged during the commission of three burglaries. He asserts that the District Court erred when it did not proportion the pecuniary loss suffered to all the defendants involved in the burglaries, and argues his proportionate share is $10,234.76.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">\u00b619  The District Court\u2019s authority to impose the full amount of restitution on Workman for the entire pecuniary loss is derived from \u00a7 46-18-241(1), MCA (2003), which provides that \u201ca sentencing court shall, as part of the sentence, require an offender to make full restitution to any victim who has sustained a pecuniary loss, including a person suffering an economic loss.\u201d Furthermore, as the State correctly notes, whether one defendant in a crime should bear full responsibility for the pecuniary loss sustained, rather than a proportionate share divided among all co-defendants, is an issue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>follows the contours of civil law. Section 46-18-244(2), MCA (2001), provided that \u201c[t]he offender may assert any defenses that the offender could raise in a civil action for the loss sought to be compensated by the restitution order,\u201d and, consistent therewith, \u00a7 46-18-244(2), MCA (2003), provides that \u201c[i]n the proceeding for the determination of the amount of restitution, the offender may assert any defenses that the offender could raise in a civil action for the loss for which the victims seek compensation.\u201d However, Workman did not raise any civil law defenses available under the 2001 version of \u00a7 46-18-244(2), MCA, at the sentence hearing, nor does he raise any of the defenses available under the retroactive 2003 version of \u00a7 46-18-244(2), MCA. Indeed, Workman stipulated that he owed $26,840.33 in restitution for the loss suffered by the victims. Moreover, Workman argues the severity of the State\u2019s charges against his accomplices, the District Court\u2019s failure to consider his financial resources and future ability to pay and the court\u2019s failure to apportion the damages among his co-defendants. Nonetheless, the fate of Workman\u2019s accomplices is immaterial to the court\u2019s authority to impose full restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\u00b620  Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not err in imposing joint and several liability for the full restitution obligation on Workman for the pecuniary loss suffered by his victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b32-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
