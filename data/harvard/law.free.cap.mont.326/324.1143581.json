Pittman appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Pittman\u2019s motion for a change of venue?</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\u00b64 2. Were Pittman\u2019s rights to a fair trial and due process of law denied because all the witnesses against her were members of law enforcement?</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in admitting a videotape of Pittman at the detention center into evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Pittman\u2019s request for a lesser-included offense instruction on resisting arrest?</p>\n<p id=\"ARo\">\u00b67 5. Is the evidence sufficient to sustain Pittman\u2019s convictions of assault on a peace officer and attempted assault on a peace officer?</p>\n<p id=\"AM_\">\u00b68 6. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in sentencing Pittman to prison instead of to the custody of the Department of Public Health and Human Services?</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">\u00b69 Around 2 a.m. on January 27,2002, police officers responded to a report of a fight between two women-one of whom was Pittman-outside the 600 Lounge in Miles City, Montana. Pittman was arrested for disorderly conduct, and Officer Dan Davis transported her to the Miles City detention center in a patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">\u00b610 At the detention center, Pittman telephoned her mother, who agreed to come and bond Pittman out. After the two women visited in the community room at the detention center, however, Pittman\u2019s mother changed her mind and decided not to bond her daughter out. As Pittman\u2019s mother was leaving the detention center, Officer Bruce Bardon approached Pittman and directed her to return to the holding area of the jail. At that point, Pittman became combative and shouted obscenities. Captain Mike King helped Bardon regain control over Pittman, and Bardon and King, followed by a third officer, physically escorted her back to the holding area and persuaded her to sit in a chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">\u00b611 When the third officer left the room, Pittman stood up from her chair, turned around and threw the chair at King. The chair hit King\u2019s hand and broke a bone in one of his fingers. After throwing the chair at King, Pittman advanced toward him. King grabbed her right arm, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>placed her in an armlock and pushed her on top of a desk. Pittman kicked at King as he tried to restrain her. Other officers heard the commotion and helped King handcuff Pittman.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b612 One police officer recorded the ensuing series of events on the detention center\u2019s video camera. The officers asked Pittman to change into regulation orange pants and shirt, which she refused to do. Four officers restrained her while one of them dressed her in the pants. When they had finished, Pittman \u201creared up,\u201d spit in the face of Miles City Police Chief Lissa Power and tried to bite Power in the arm. Pittman did not succeed in biting through Power\u2019s sweatshirt. At that point, the officers abandoned any attempt to get Pittman into the orange shirt. Instead, they placed a spit mask on her to keep her from spitting on anyone else. One officer grabbed each of her limbs and they carried her to a cell. Throughout, Pittman yelled, screamed, kicked and fought, as recorded on the videotape later introduced into evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b613 The State of Montana filed six separate criminal charges against Pittman. She pled guilty to two misdemeanor charges in city court and was tried before a jury in District Court on the remaining four charges: felony assault on a peace officer for throwing the chair at King; felony attempted assault on a peace officer for attempting to bite Power; misdemeanor assault with a bodily fluid for spitting on Power; and misdemeanor obstructing a peace officer for struggling with the officers while they were getting her into the orange pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\u00b614 Prior to her trial, Pittman accused a Custer County Sheriffs Office detention officer of having sexual intercourse with her while she was awaiting trial as an inmate in the detention center. The Miles City Star newspaper reported her allegations and described her previous criminal record. Pittman moved for a change of trial venue based on that newspaper article. The District Court found there was no prejudicial publicity and denied Pittman\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\u00b615 After trial, the jury found Pittman guilty of all four charges against her. At the sentencing hearing, two expert witnesses testified about her mental health; one on her behalf and one on the State\u2019s behalf. The District Court sentenced Pittman to ten years in Montana State Women\u2019s Prison for assault on a peace officer and ten years for attempted assault on a peace officer, to be served concurrently. In addition, it sentenced her to a seven-year prison term for being a persistent felony offender, to be served consecutive to her concurrent ten-year sentences. Finally, the District Court sentenced Pittman to one year in jail for the offense of assault with bodily fluid and six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>months in jail for obstructing a police officer, both sentences to run concurrently with her ten-year felony sentences. Pittman appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u00b616 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Pittman\u2019s motion for a change of venue?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\u00b617  Pittman\u2019s motion for a change of venue was based on alleged prejudice from adverse pretrial publicity pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-203, MCA. A defendant seeking a change of venue due to prejudicial publicity must establish that the news reports were inflammatory and that they actually inflamed the prejudice of the community to an extent that a reasonable possibility exists that the defendant may not receive a fair trial. <em>State v. Hill, </em>2000 MT 308, \u00b6 51, 302 Mont. 415, \u00b6 51, 14 P.3d 1237, \u00b6 51 (citation omitted). We will reverse a district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion for change of venue only upon a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>Hill, </em>\u00b6 50 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\u00b618 On appeal, Pittman contends that the inclusion of her previous criminal record in the Miles City Star article, combined with the report of her allegations of a sexual relationship between herself and the detention officer, were of such an inflammatory nature that she could not receive a fair trial in Miles City or Custer County. She argues the article presented her in such a bad light that the jury would convict her based on the rumor of the relationship and her past criminal history, rather than on the evidence and testimony presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"A_g\">\u00b619  For purposes of the first element of the pretrial publicity test, we have defined inflammatory publicity as editorializing on the part of the media or a calculated attempt to prejudice public opinion against the defendant or to destroy the fairness of the pool from which the defendant\u2019s prospective jurors would be drawn. <em>See State v. Fuhrmann </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 396, 409, 925 P.2d 1162, 1170, <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735. Here, the newspaper article concerning Pittman was not inflammatory. It summarized the charges against her, her allegations at the evidentiary hearing regarding the detention officer and her prior criminal record. The information in the article was based entirely on information contained in District Court documents and testimony from the evidentiary hearing. The newspaper article did not editorialize about Pittman\u2019s guilt or innocence. We conclude Pittman has failed to establish that the newspaper article was inflammatory.</p>\n<p id=\"A1l\">\u00b620  Because <em>Hill </em>states the pretrial publicity test in the conjunctive-i.e., the news reports were inflammatory and they actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>inflamed the prejudice of the community-both elements must be established in order to require a change of venue. <em>See, e.g., Northwest Pub. v. Montana Dept, of Labor and Industry, Unemployment Ins. Div., Contributions Bureau </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 360, 363, 846 P.2d 1030, 1032. Having determined that Pittman failed to satisfy the first element of the test, we need not address the second element. We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Pittman\u2019s motion for a change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u00b621 Were Pittman\u2019s rights to a fair trial and due process of law denied because all the witnesses against her were members of law enforcement?</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b622 Pittman advances two lines of argument under this issue. Pointing out that the injuries sustained by the victims of her crimes would not support felony charges except for the fact that the victims were peace officers, she claims she was denied her right to due process and the \u201clevel playing field\u201d guaranteed under the Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution when lesser-included offenses were precluded because her victims were peace officers. She also claims she was deprived of her rights of due process and fair trial by the conduct of law enforcement personnel prior to trial, because King was present when she was interviewed by the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation in relation to other criminal charges and the State did not inform her in advance that he would be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\u00b623 Pittman did not raise her confrontation and due process argument in the District Court and, as a result, has waived appellate review of that claim. Section 46-20-104(2), MCA. Moreover, she advances no authority in support of her argument that the conduct of law enforcement personnel prior to trial violated her rights to due process and a fair trial, as is required for all appellate arguments under Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. For those reasons, we decline to address those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">\u00b624 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in admitting a videotape of Pittman at the detention center into evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">\u00b625 Relevant evidence is generally admissible. Rule 402, M.R.Evid. Relevant evidence may be excluded, however, if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or by needless presentation of cumulative evidence. Rule 403, M.R.Evid. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>standard of review of a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling is whether the district court has abused its discretion. <em>State v. McCaslin, </em>2004 MT 212, \u00b6 15, 322 Mont. 350, \u00b6 15, 96 P.3d 722, \u00b6 15 (citations omitted). \u00b626 Pittman contends the videotape evidence was cumulative because the same law enforcement officers who appeared in the video testified at trial. She also contends the video was inflammatory and prejudicial to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b627  The videotape clearly was instructive and corroborative. It presented the jury with the best evidence of whether Pittman committed three of the offenses with which the State charged her. The videotape allowed the jury to determine whether the officers were telling the truth about Pittman\u2019s conduct and was useful to aid the jury in evaluating Pittman\u2019s testimony that she could not remember biting Power, that she was not trying to hurt anyone, and that she was simply resisting arrest. On balance, we conclude the videotape did not constitute needless presentation of cumulative evidence. Moreover, probative evidence is often, if not always, prejudicial to a criminal defendant. <em>See State v. Southern, </em>1999 MT 94, \u00b6 66, 294 Mont. 225, \u00b6 66, 980 P.2d 3, \u00b6 66 (citation omitted). Given the probative value of the videotape, we cannot conclude its probity was substantially outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u00b628 We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the videotape into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\u00b629 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Pittman\u2019s request for a lesser-included offense instruction on resisting arrest? \u00b630 We review jury instructions to determine whether the instructions as a whole fully and fairly instruct the jury on the applicable law. A district court has broad discretion in formulating jury instructions, and our standard of review is whether the court abused that discretion. <em>State v. German, </em>2001 MT 156, \u00b6 10, 306 Mont. 92, \u00b6 10, 30 P.3d 360, \u00b6 10 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">\u00b631  A criminal defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser-included offense when any evidence in the record would permit the jury to find the defendant guilty of the lesser and acquit her of the greater offense. <em>See State v. Ostwald </em>(1979), 180 Mont. 530, 538, 591 P.2d 646, 651. Resisting arrest occurs when one prevents or attempts to prevent a peace office from effecting an arrest. Section 45-7-301, MCA. Pittman already was under arrest when she engaged in the acts at the detention center which are the bases of the charges of assault on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>a police officer and attempted assault on a police officer. Therefore, no evidence in the record would permit the jury to find her guilty of the lesser-included offense of resisting arrest and acquit her of either or both of the two felony offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b632 We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Pittman\u2019s request for a lesser-included offense instruction on resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">ISSUE 5</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b633 Is the evidence sufficient to sustain Pittman\u2019s convictions of assault on a peace officer and attempted assault on a peace officer? \u00b634 The standard of review for the sufficiency of evidence on appeal of a criminal conviction is whether, when viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. McCarthy, </em>2004 MT 312, \u00b6 46, 324 Mont. 1, \u00b6 46, 101 P.3d 288, \u00b6 46 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\u00b635 Purposely or knowingly causing bodily injury to a peace officer constitutes assault on a peace officer. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-210, MCA. Here, King was the victim in the charge of assault on a peace officer. He testified Pittman stood up from her chair and threw the chair at him, he deflected the chair with his right hand and it hit him in his torso and leg area. He also testified he experienced pain when Pittman hit him with the chair. An x-ray revealed that his finger was broken and he told the jury the injury was painful.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">\u00b636 Attempted assault on a peace officer is the commission of any act which constitutes a material step toward the offense of assault on a peace officer by a person acting with the purpose to commit the offense of assault on a peace officer. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-4-103, MCA. King testified that Pittman spit in Power\u2019s face and attempted to bite her. Power testified that, after the officers changed Pittman into the orange pants, Pittman \u201creared up,\u201d spit in her face and tried to bite her upper left arm. Power explained that, while Pittman bit her sweatshirt, Pittman did not contact her skin or cause an injury. Power\u2019s and King\u2019s testimony was partially corroborated by the videotape, which showed Pittman lunging at Power\u2019s face and arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">\u00b637  Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude sufficient evidence supported Pittman\u2019s convictions of assault on a peace officer and attempted assault on a peace officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>ISSUE 6</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b638 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in sentencing Pittman to prison instead of to the custody of the Department of Public Health and Human Services?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b639 Section 46-14-101, MCA, requires the sentencing court to consider a defendant\u2019s mental disease or defect, using information gained from an examination of the defendant, in order to determine whether the defendant was, at the time she committed the offense, able to appreciate the criminality of her behavior or conform her behavior to the requirements of the law. Pittman contends the District Court failed to properly consider the evaluation her expert, clinical psychologist Dr. F. Tom Peterson, conducted shortly before her sentencing hearing. She claims that, in light of Peterson\u2019s testimony, the court abused its discretion and erred in sentencing her to prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b640 Peterson testified at the sentencing hearing. He stated Pittman was mentally ill. According to Peterson, Pittman\u2019s mental illness resulted in a mental disorder involving impaired thinking and mood and substantial behavior impairment. He opined that, at the time she committed the offenses of which she was convicted, she was not able to conform her behavior to the requirements of the law. He recommended she receive medication, psychotherapy and intensive substance abuse treatment to enable her to conform her conduct to the rules of society.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u00b641 Dr. William Stratford, a psychiatrist, also examined Pittman, and testified on the State\u2019s behalf at her sentencing hearing. Stratford examined Pittman over a two-day period and reviewed records dating back to 1989 of her juvenile and adult criminal history and her psychiatric history. Stratford testified that Pittman suffers from a severe personality disorder and has a longstanding drug and alcohol abuse history. He opined that she had the capacity to act with knowledge and purpose at the time of the offenses. He further testified that, in his opinion, Pittman\u2019s ability to conform her conduct to the requirements of law was minimized due to voluntary ingestion of drugs and alcohol, in combination with \u201ca florid personality disorder,\u201d rather than because of psychosis or mental disease. He recommended that the District Court sentence Pittman to the Montana Women\u2019s Prison and that she participate in a prison chemical dependency program, undergo mental health therapy and be medicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">\u00b642  Pittman essentially argues that the District Court should have accepted Peterson\u2019s opinion instead of Stratford\u2019s. The weight and credibility of evidence are within the province of the finder of fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>whose determination we will not disturb on appeal. <em>State v. Gilmore, </em>2004 MT 363, \u00b6 18, 324 Mont. 488, \u00b6 18, 104 P.3d 1051, \u00b6 18. Based on those factors, the District Court accepted Stratford\u2019s evaluation of Pittman and rejected Peterson\u2019s. Because the court\u2019s resolution of the conflict between the two opinions is supported by the record, we will not disturb it. <em>See State v. Collier </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 46, 61, 919 P.2d 376, 386. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Pittman to prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b643 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b359-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
