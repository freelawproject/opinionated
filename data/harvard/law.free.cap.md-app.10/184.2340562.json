State, </em>5 Md. App. 222. Although the taking of such evidence in the presence of a jury is not a commendable practice, we have held that where the statements were found to be admissible by the presiding judge, no reversible error was committed. <em>Dennis v. Warden, </em>6 Md. App. 295. While it appears that the first part of appellant\u2019s statements did come into evidence in the presence of the jury, there was no request by counsel for the defense that the jury be excluded and the court did exclude the jury as soon as it became apparent that the admission of appellant\u2019s statements was to be contested. Moreover, the trial judge found the statements to be admissible. Under these circumstances, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">It is next contended that the court erred in ruling that the statements were admissible. We disagree. Officer Michael W. Arnetta testified that on May 22, 1969, at approximately 6:30 p.m., he received a call over the police radio \u201cof an injured woman at 8401 Liberty Road.\u201d Upon his arrival there he was met by a fellow officer who, when asked by Officer Arnetta \u201cWhat happened?\u201d, replied: \u201c T don\u2019t know\u2019; that the ambulance had already taken the woman from the cellar to the hospital.\u201d Officer Arnetta testified that he then went into the bedroom of the house, found the appellant lying on the bed and \u201cI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>asked Mr. Bernos what happened?\u201d According to the officer, appellant \u201creplied that he had an argument with his wife Frances Patricia Murphy,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the previous day and she went down to the basement and locked the door, remaining all night. * * * Mr. Bernos then went to the basement also and * * * there was a struggle and in the struggle the gun went off. When I learned that a gun was used to injure Mrs. Murphy I asked permission to use the phone in the bedroom to summon a sergeant.\u201d According to the transcript of testimony, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">\u201cQ. Did you call your sergeant at that time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">Q. And, what if anything took place while you were making the telephone call ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">A. While I was on the phone, Dr. Bernos was still talking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">Q. Were you talking to him or was he just talking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">A. He was just talking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-11\">Q. What, if anything, did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-12\">\u201cA. That he tried to kiss his wife but there was no response. That he removed the gun from his back pocket and pointed it at her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-13\">Q. Did he say anything further ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-14\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-15\">Q. At this point, did you complete your telephone conversation ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-16\">A. Yes, I did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-17\">The trial judge ruled, and from our review of the evidence we cannot disagree, that the appellant\u2019s statements were not the result of a custodial interrogation within the ambit of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436, as contended by the appellant then and as he contends in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>appeal. A .\u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d within the meaning of <em>Miranda </em>is \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody of otherwise deprived of his freedom in any significant way.\u201d As this Court indicated in <em>Gandio and Bucci v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 455, 460, the evils which <em>Miranda </em>sought to avoid were the questioning of an individual in a hostile atmosphere, such as the \u201cisolated setting in the privacy of an interrogation room in a police station\u201d and having the individual\u2019s will overborne by \u201ctechniques of persuasion\u201d employed by police.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">It is true that the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Orozco v. Texas, </em>394 U. S. 324, held that the questioning of an individual in his bedroom by four police officers was encompassed by the strictures of <em>Miranda </em>but in the factual posture there, unlike here, \u201cpetitioner was under arrest and not free to leave when he was questioned * * *.\u201d In the case at bar, when the appellant was asked the question, \u201cwhat happened?\u201d, he was not under arrest or restraint. According to the officer, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know a crime had been committed at this time.\u201d Under these circumstances we cannot find that appellant\u2019s statements to the officer were the result of a \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d as defined in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, supra. </em>See <em>Duffy v. State, </em>243 Md. 425; <em>Simms v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 160; <em>Morgan v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">We find no merit in appellant\u2019s next contention that the trial judge erred \u201cin allowing the prosecuting attorney to question Officer Michael W. Arnetta on redirect examination as to certain portions of the official police investigation report * * The officer had noted on cross-examination that his \u201cpolice report\u201d erroneously reflected that certain statements were made by appellant after the' officer had \u201chung the phone up\u201d and that, in fact, the statements were made while he \u201cwas still on the phone.\u201d On redirect examination by the State, and over objection by defense counsel, the officer was permitted to read portions of the police report containing statements by appellant.' Ordinarily, the scope of cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>as well as redirect examination is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Hall v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 356, 363; <em>Scott v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 705, 708. We find no abuse of that discretion under the circumstances here. The officer had been questioned about a particular part of the report on cross-examination and we see no harm in permitting questions on redirect examination concerning other parts of the report, particularly since the facts brought out were, in substance, already before the jury through previous testimony. See <em>Fisher Body Division v. Alston, </em>252 Md. 51, 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">It is next contended that the trial judge erred in advising appellant, in the presence of the jury, of his constitutional right not to testify. No objection was made to this procedure at trial and the question is not properly before us. Maryland Rule 1085. Although we find that appellant was not subjected to any prejudice as a result of the procedure followed by the trial judge in this instance, we are of the opinion that when an accused is advised of his constitutional right to decline to testify, such advice should be given out of the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Appellant finally contends that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury on the question of the voluntariness of appellant\u2019s statements. No request for such an instruction was made by appellant and no exceptions were taken to the instructions as given. Accordingly, the issue has not been preserved for review by this Court. Md. Rules 756 f, g, and 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\n<em>Appellant to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-18\">. It appears that Miss Murphy was not his wife hut formerly a maid in his home at a time when he and his lawful wife were living together.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
