J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AG5Y\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">On October 17, 1969, Leigh Ann Hamill, age 17, a boarding student at a private high school in Cecil County, sold two bags of marihuana to an undercover police officer, Trooper Tommy L. Bays of the Maryland State Police, as a result of which Bays petitioned the court to find Leigh a delinquent child under Maryland Code (1969 Supp.) Article 26, Sections 70 through 70-26. At the juvenile hearing held January 30, 1970, Leigh, through her counsel, advised the court that the facts in the juvenile petition would not be contested. On this foundation the court found Leigh a delinquent child. It then proceeded to consider the appropriate disposition to be made in the case, and Leigh was called to testify in this connection. She stated that she had the marihuana secluded in her room at school; that she had smoked it on a number of occasions, usually with friends; that because the school administrators were searching rooms, she decided to rid herself of the marihuana; that her roommate told her that she had a friend who wanted to buy some marihuana ; that a meeting was arranged by the roommate on the school campus and she sold the marihuana to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>roommate\u2019s friend, not knowing who he was'. Leigh testified that she had offered to give the marihuana to the man; that she had never sold marihuana before; that she realized it was against the law to possess marihuana; and that she tried LSD on two occasions but did not like. it.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Upon completion of Leigh\u2019s testimony, the juvenile judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">\u201cWell, I do not know whether or not I am going to confine this girl or not. It is going to depend on my confirmation when I talk to Of-' ficer Bays. If she is telling the truth about her dealings with Officer Bays, that will be'one thing. If she is lying, that will be something else</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Trooper Bays then testified. He confirmed most of Leigh\u2019s testimony but denied that she offered to give him the marihuana without payment. He stated that Leigh wanted to sell it and that she had set the price, which he paid; and that she insinuated that she might have additional \u201cstuff\u201d (marihuana) for future sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Leigh\u2019s father testified, and acknowledged that his daughter was a problem. He said that he and his wife had tried for several years to \u201creach\u201d Leigh and \u201cshow her what is right\u201d; that since her arrest her conduct had been exemplary and her behavior had greatly improved. Mr. Hamill conceded \u201cwe have a long ways to go.\u201d He was, however, confident that Leigh could be rehabilitated \u201cwithout sending her away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">The report of the Juvenile Probation Department, received in evidence, disclosed in general that Leigh\u2019s parents were religious, financially secure, lived in a nice home, with no children other than Leigh living with them (one boy being away in the Marine Corps) ; that Mr. Hamill was a strict disciplinarian \u201cwith little show of outward emotion\u201d; that Leigh \u201cfeels that her parents have undue expectations of her and that her father particularly is unwilling to bend\u201d; that a \u201clack of communication\u201d existed between Leigh and her family; and that the family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>had sought psychiatric and psychological help for Leigh. The report noted that Leigh seemed \u201cmore remorseful at having been caught selling the drug than in having used it occasionally.\u201d It concluded by offering the opinion that Leigh \u201chas learned a lesson from this experience and will not be before the Court again,\u201d and that the family \u201cshould receive family counseling as had been previously sought out.\u201d The record further disclosed that as a result of her marihuana sale to Trooper Bays, Leigh was asked to and did leave school in November of 1969; that she then went to work as a clerk with an insurance company and in that capacity worked for several months prior to her juvenile hearing; that she also attended school, several nights weekly, to obtain her high school diploma; and that she hoped to pursue a career in commercial art or interior decorating.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Upon completion of closing arguments of counsel, the court rendered its disposition, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">\u201cThe court certainly has some grave responsibilities in cases of this sort, from the standpoint of all elements of society that are involved, the community, the children, the girl that is charged with being delinquent here, the parents, all of these things have to be considered. The evidence in this case is that this girl of superior intelligence \u2014 incidentally, who should know if anyone should know better \u2014 has sold marijuana in one of the schools of our county while a member of one of the schools. The evidence is uncontradicted and undisputed that she had an intimation at least that she would be getting some more stuff in, which another deal might be arranged, which indicates more than just a single incident. The Court realizes full well that it is a calculated risk to commit a girl of this age and that there is a possibility of danger to her and to her future; but there is certainly a greater danger to society and that danger is so great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>that the court believes that the risk must be taken; and therefore disposition of this case is that this girl, Leigh Ann Hamill, be committed to the Montrose School for Girls for an indefinite period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">On appeal from this disposition, appellant Hamill contends that (1) the court erroneously disposed of the matter solely on the basis of the offense without regard to her rehabilitative needs, and (2) that the court erred in conducting its own examination of a witness out of the presence of appellant and her counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The law of this State governing juvenile causes and delinquent children was substantially revised by Chapter 432 of the Acts of 1969. The purposes of the Act were plainly outlined, in part, as follows (Article 26, Section 70) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">\u201c(1) To provide for the care, protection and wholesome mental and physical development of children coming within the provisions of this subtitle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">(2) To remove from children committing delinquent acts the taint of criminality and the consequences of criminal behavior, and to substitute therefor a program of treatment, training, and rehabilitation consistent with the protection of the public interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">(3) To place a child in a wholesome family environment whenever possible;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">(4) To separate a child from his parents only when necessary for his welfare or in the interests of public safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">By so providing it is clear that the Legislature intended no departure in philosophy from that underlying previous juvenile court enactments in Maryland, as interpreted by the Court of Appeals, <em>viz., </em>that juvenile proceedings are of a special nature designed to meet the problems peculiar to the adolescent <em>(In re Fletcher, </em>251 Md. 520) ; that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>proceedings of a juvenile court are not criminal in nature and its dispositions are not punishment for crime <em>(In The Matter of Cromwell, </em>232 Md. 409); that the juvenile law has as its underlying concept the protection of the juvenile, so that judges, in making dispositions in juvenile cases, think not in terms of guilt, but of the child\u2019s need for protection or rehabilitation <em>(In re Johnson, </em>254 Md. 517); that the juvenile act does not contemplate the punishment of children where they are found to be delinquent, but rather an attempt to correct and rehabilitate them in \u201ca wholesome family environment whenever possible,\u201d although rehabilitation may have to be sought in some instances in an institution <em>(Moquin v. State, </em>216 Md. 524).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Under Section 70-1 (y) of the present juvenile law, the disposition hearing held following an adjudication of delinquency is \u201cto determine (1) whether the child is in need of supervision, treatment, or rehabilitation; and if so (2) the nature of the supervision, treatment, or rehabilitation.\u201d Under Section 70-19, the juvenile judge is enjoined to \u201cmake disposition as most suited to the physical, mental, and moral welfare of the child.\u201d These principles must be applied in light of the purposes of the juvenile law, as set forth in Section 70 (heretofore outlined), <em>viz., </em>that the juvenile court is to make disposition so as to provide for the care, protection, and wholesome mental and physical development of the child; by a program of treatment, training and rehabilitation \u201cconsistent with the protection of the public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Against such a legislative and judicial background, it is altogether clear that the <em>mere </em>fact of delinquency, without more, ordinarily does not justify the taking of the child from his parents and his commitment to a State training school. Because the Legislature has indicated its preference that a delinquent child be placed in the care, custody, and control of individuals rather than an institution whenever consistent with the purposes underlying the juvenile law, a commitment to a training school in a case where the parents would seem able and willing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>to undertake the rehabilitation of the delinquent child would be iihproper. <em>See Cantu v. State, </em>207 S.W.2d 901 (Tex.) ; <em>In re Walter, </em>172 N.W.2d 603 (N.D.); <em>Berry v. Superior Court, </em>245 P. 409 (Wash.); 47 Am.Jur.2d <em>Juveniles. and Delinquent and Dependent Children, </em>Section 30; Annotations, 45 A.L.R. 1533 and 85 A.L.R. 1099. Of course; where the evidence at the disposition hearing shows that the parents, no matter how well motivated or intentioried; are incapable, unwilling, or unable to control or rehabilitate their delinquent child, a commitment to the training school may be necessary for the \u201cwelfare [of the delinquent] or in the interests of public safety\u201d (Section 70(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Maryland Rule 913 provides that if the disposition hearing results in \u201cplacement of the child outside his home, the court shall * * * file with the clerk a brief statement of the reasons why such placement is necessary.\u201d In compliance with this Rule, the juvenile judge stated his belief that the delinquent\u2019s conduct in selling the marihuana to Trooper Bays, and the \u201cintimation\u201d that she would make like sales in the future, was such that, balancing the interests of the child against the danger to society caused by her delinquent conduct, the commitment was deemed necessary. It is not apparent that the juvenile judge, in so concluding, gave proper weight to the testimony of the father and the opinion of the juvenile probation department that it seemed unlikely that Leigh would offend again. On the cold record before us, there is nothing that would seem, to indicate, nor is there anything to suggest that Leigh\u2019s physical, mental, and moral welfare would be served by separating her from her parents and committing her to the training school. <em>Cf. In The Matter of Cromwell, supra, </em>involving indifferent parents and physical danger to the child unless confined in a juvenile institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The matter of disposition in a juvenile case is committed to the sound discretion of the juvenile judge, to be disturbed on appeal only upon a finding that such discretion has been abused. <em>In The Matter of Cromwell, su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number><em>pra. </em>We find evidence of an abuse of discretion in failing to weigh the evidence as to probable rehabilitation outside an institution and remand the case without affirmance or reversal for further consideration by the juvenile judge. In the course of such reconsideration, it may be proper that the judge review Leigh\u2019s conduct since her original disposition hearing, as well as the efforts made by her parents during this interim period to bring about her rehabilitation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">\n<em>Case remanded without affirmance or reversal for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion; costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-11\">. In view of our disposition of the appeal, it will not be necessary to consider appellant\u2019s contention that it was improper for the juvenile judge to confer privately with Trooper Bays prior to rendering his decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
