The court denied the motions. Appellant thereafter filed the instant appeal, claiming that the court\u2019s refusal to grant him a jury trial was a denial of his absolute constitutional right to trial by jury. The State moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that there is no absolute constitutional right to a jury trial in a criminal contempt proceeding and consequently the order appealed from was only interlocutory in nature and as such not immediately reviewable. Briefs were filed with us by the parties and we heard oral argument on the State\u2019s motion to dismiss. In the circumstances of this case, we hold that appellant does not have an absolute constitutional right, either State or federal, to a jury trial and, accordingly, dismiss the appeal. <em>See Raimondi v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In denying appellant\u2019s motion for a jury trial, the court below held that there is no federal constitutional right to a jury trial in a criminal case, including cases of criminal contempt, where the offense charged is a \u201cpetty\u201d one, <em>i.e., </em>an offense punishable by not more than six months imprisonment and a $500.00 fine. The court concluded that where, as in Maryland, \u201cno maximum penalty is set for contempt, a Court may hear the case without a jury provided it does not impose a penalty in excess of six months in jail and a $500.00 fine.\u201d By its decision denying appellant\u2019s motion for a jury trial, the court recognized that it had placed itself \u201cin the position of taking at least a peripheral view of the case, and deciding, before hearing it, whether the offense is serious or petty\u201d; and that in so doing it had concluded that the offense was a \u201cpetty\u201d one not entitling the appellant to a jury trial. In support of its position, the court relied upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Dyke v. Taylor Implement Co., </em>391 U. S. 216; <em>Bloom v. Illinois, </em>391 U. S. 194; <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U. S. 145, and <em>Cheff v. Schnackenberg, </em>384 U. S. 373. These cases clearly support the court\u2019s position, as does the Supreme Court\u2019s more recent ruling on the question in <em>Frank v. United States, </em>395 U. S. 147, decided May 19, 1969. <em>See also Sheets v. City of Hagerstown, </em>204 Md. 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Appellant forcefully asserts that the charge against him cannot properly be considered a \u201cpetty\u201d offense because, as a family man, more than sixty years of age, the stigma of a six months sentence and a $500.00 fine as to him \u201cwould spell ruin, financial, social and psychological,\u201d particularly in that as a newspaper editor his \u201cveracity, honesty and obedience to the law is as much his stock in trade as is his publication.\u201d The difficulty with appellant\u2019s position is that in none of its rulings on the question has the Supreme Court considered the likely impact on the individual of a sentence of six months or less as an appropriate guidepost by which to determine, for constitutional purposes, whether the offense was a \u201cpetty\u201d one.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed; appellant to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-13\">. The Rule generally prohibits the taking of photographs within any of the courtrooms, or within the courthouse itself \u201cwhen court officials or parties litigant, counsel, jurors, witnesses or others connected with scheduled pending court or Grand Jury proceedings \u00e1re present;\u201d The- photograph in question was of witnesses. and lawyers involved in a criminal case, and was taken during recess of court on, the first floor of the courthouse in an area well removed' from the courtroom.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
