(2nd count), and disorderly conduct (3rd count). The first two counts of Indictment No. 10,133 charged Shedrick with assault with intent to murder, and assault and battery upon Beckwith; while the first two counts of Indictment No. 10,114 charged Beckwith with assault with intent to murder, and assault and battery upon Shedrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">The cases were consolidated for trial and a joint trial was held in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County with a jury. At the close of all the evidence the trial court granted a motion for judgment of acquittal as to the first count of each indictment, and the jury found each appellant guilty of assault and battery under the second count. Each appellant was sentenced to the Montgomery County Detention Center for a period of one (1) year.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Detective Sergeant Hardesty of the Montgomery County Police testified that he responded to a call to the emergency room of Suburban Hospital at 7:30 p.m. on the evening of February 22, 1969, with reference to two subjects who had just been admitted. On arrival he saw both appellants lying on litters, undergoing treatment. After Shedrick had been treated, at approximately 8:30 p.m., Hardesty proceeded to take a statement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from this appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Although appellants raise several different questions in their separate appeals, we find it necessary, for purposes of disposition, to discuss only whether the statement was properly admissible against (1) Shedrick or (2) Beckwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">I \u2014 APPELLANT SHEDRICK</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">When appellant Shedrick made his statement in the hospital, the detectives did not fully advise him of his constitutional rights as required by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436. This fact is indicated in the record <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>the State concedes it.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The State argues, however, that <em>Miranda </em>is not applicable here for three reasons. First, the State alleges that the appellant was neither \u201cin custody\u201d nor was he \u201cotherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way\u201d as required by the language of <em>Miranda. </em>Secondly, the State contends that Shedrick\u2019s oral statement was made voluntarily without inducements rather than in response to questioning as is also required by <em>Miranda. </em>Thirdly, the State argues in the alternative, that the trial court was correct in admitting the statement under the theory that it was part of the <em>res gestae. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The <em>Miranda </em>decision held that \u201cthe prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d 384 U. S. at 444. See also <em>Myers v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">According to <em>Miranda, </em>a statement is inadmissible, without proper warnings, as a product of custodial interrogation if it is made in response to \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officials\u201d while the accused is \u201cdeprived of his freedom in any significant way.\u201d 384 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>U. S. at 444. We find both of these requisite circumstances to be present in the instant case. The specific reach of the term \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d was explored in <em>Gaudio v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 455. We found the term to be applicable to a number of situations, among them,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-4\">(1) the holding of a defendant incommunicado in an isolated setting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">(2) surrounding him with antagonistic forces;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">(3) subjecting him to techniques of persuasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">1 Md. App. at 468.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">These situations effectively deprive a defendant of his \u201cfreedom of action\u201d even if they are only apparent to the person questioned or making a statement. We noted in <em>Myers v. State, supra, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-10\">\u201c* * * \u2018[T]he custody requirement of <em>Miranda </em>does not depend on the subjective intent of the law enforcement officer-interrogator but upon whether the suspect is physically deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way or is placed in a situation in which he reasonably believes that his freedom of action or movement is restricted by such interrogation.\u2019 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-11\">3 Md. App. at 537.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">The record reveals that appellant Shedrick made his statement in the presence of two detectives in a small separate room immediately adjacent to the emergency room. At the time of his statement Shedrick was aware of the seriousness of Beckwith\u2019s condition, including the fact that the latter was unconscious, was being fed intravenously and might possibly die. The gravity of the situation was accentuated by the partial and imperfect <em>Miranda </em>warnings given by Detective Hardesty. Under these circumstances we find that Shedrick was effectively deprived of his freedom of action and a \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d situation existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">A voluntary utterance is one made without any prod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>ding or inducement of any kind by the officer to whom it is made. <em>Blevins v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 708, 711. If a statement is voluntary, it will not be considered made in response to Questioning initiated by the State and, therefore, it is. not within the protective scope of <em>Miranda. </em>But Detective .Hardesty\u2019s testimony that Shedrick \u201cwanted to talk\u201d does not make the latter\u2019s statement voluntary under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The detectives and Shedrick were equally aware of the apparently grave condition of Beckwith, the causal linkage of that condition to Shedrick, and the legal consequences stemming from this implication. This is indicated by the exculpatory nature (as to who was the aggressor) of Shedrick\u2019s statement. Under such circumstances we cannot say that the statement was freely or voluntarily given. We find that appellant\u2019s statement was made in response to questioning initiated during a custodial interrogation. Since the proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not given, the statement should have been held inadmissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The trial court admitted the statement under the theory that it was covered by the <em>res gestae </em>exception to the hearsay rule. We find that since the interrogation was a custodial interrogation it could not be admissible under the <em>res gestae </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Appellant Shedrick\u2019s statement was a product of custodial interrogation and the proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">II \u2014 APPELLANT BECKWITH</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Appellant Beckwith argues that Shedrick\u2019s statement was inadmissible in his case. The trial court held that the statement was admissible against Beckwith under the principles of <em>res gestae. </em>We disagree, since we have found for reasons stated above, that the statement as uttered by appellant Shedrick was not admissible as a <em>res gestae </em>statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">In the alternative, the State argues that Shedrick\u2019s statement might still be used in Beckwith\u2019s case in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>\u201cmanner of a volunteered statement, since such a statement does not violate the rules set forth in <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>891 U. S. 123, as it was not the statement of one codefendant used against another or at the most was harmless error.\u201d Bruton held that the admission of a codefendant\u2019s confession (whether or not admissible against the declarant) which implicated a defendant at a joint trial constituted prejudicial error since it violated petitioner\u2019s right of cross-examination secured by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment. The court reasoned that there was a \u201csubstantial risk that the jury, despite instructions to the contrary, looked to the incriminating extrajudicial statements in determining petitioner\u2019s guilt.\u201d 391 U. S. at 126. Whether or not Shedrick\u2019s statement may be considered a \u201cconfession\u201d or a \u201cdefense\u201d in terms of his participation in the altercation, it clearly implicates Beckwith as the instigator of the assault, and in this incriminating context it is within the exclusionary scope of <em>Bruton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Citing our holding in <em>Sutton v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 285, 297, the State argues that even if the admission of Shed-rick\u2019s statement against Beckwith was a <em>Bruton </em>error, it is still admissible since such an error is properly considered harmless where the other evidence is overwhelming. We had no difficulty in <em>Sutton </em>in concluding beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement of one defendant did not contribute to the conviction of the others (8 Md. App. at 298) because in that case there was independent real evidence supporting the convictions. But in the instant case, as in <em>Bruton, </em>we find no independent evidence sufficient to support the conviction of Beckwith without the admission of Shedrick\u2019s statement. Here, as in <em>Bruton, </em>Shedrick did not testify and thus Beckwith was denied his constitutional right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We find therefore that Shedrick\u2019s statement as against Beckwith\u2019s interests is neither admissible under a <em>res gestae </em>theory, as the trial court concluded, nor as an exception to the <em>Bruton </em>holding as \u201charmless error\u201d, as urged by the State. Since Shedrick\u2019s statement was inad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>missible against Shedrick and also inadmissible against Beckwith, we must reverse each conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">\n<em>In Indictment No. 10,133, judgment reversed as to Shedrick, and case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\n<em>In Indictment No.' 10,1 Ilf, judgment reversed as to Beckwith, and case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-7\">.

At that time Mr. Beckwith drove up in his vehicle. He stated to him that he wanted to talk to him. Mr. Beck-with he pulled his vehicle in front of Mr. Shedrick\u2019s car. Mr. Shed-rick got out of his vehicle, walked up and got inside of Mr. Beck-with\u2019s. At this time Mr. Beckwith got out of his side and went around to the side that Mr. Shedrick was on. Mr. Shedrick got out of the car at that time. He stated that Beckwith told him that he did not want him around anymore and he [Beckwith] pulled his gun from his [Beckwith\u2019s] belt .... and started hitting him [Shedrick] on the head with the gun. He stated at that time \u2014 I [Shedrick] tried to talk to him .... and during the fight he [Shedrick] was able to get back to his car, where he removed his pocket knife.
