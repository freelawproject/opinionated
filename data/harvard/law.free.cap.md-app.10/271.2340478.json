I got out of the car and pushed it around the corner. While pushing the car I struck another car in the rear, I believe it was a 1968 yellow Buick or Pontiac. After doing this I got out of the car, the owner of the car got out, and we Disscuss it. I told him that I didn\u2019t see Any damage done to the car but If there was any I would fix it, Becaused I work at John McCullough\u2019s Auto Repair. And that I would take him to see My boss and verify if any damage had been done, and I would fix it. After me and him settled this some fellow came out of a house where a woman was standing wearing a white dress. He asked me for my identification. I told Him buddy me and this man got it straightened out. He said Nigger what do you mean you\u2019ve got this straightened out this is my car. Then he said I\u2019m Going to bet your ass. He then struck Me in the face with his fist. I saw something in his hand, but I don\u2019t know what it was. When he swing at me I pulled a Screwdriver from my pocket and stabbed him but I don\u2019t know Where. And I then watch him till he fell. I then got Lucille out of the car [a girl in the car being pushed by Dixon] and walked down Broadway to Eager and went home.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Dixon urges that his conviction of manslaughter by a jury in the Criminal Court of Baltimore should be reversed. He claims he is not culpable because the circumstances of the homicide make \u201ca classic case of excusable self-defense,\u201d advancing this argument under the sole question presented \u2014 was the evidence sufficient to sustain the conviction. Our function is to determine whether the lower court erred in denying Dixon\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal by applying the test set out in <em>Williams v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 450. Accepting that Dixon became engaged in a sudden affray or combat, we have no difficulty in determining, even on Dixon\u2019s version of the affair, that the jury could have found that he did not necessarily, or under reasonably apparent necessity, kill McCullum by use of force which was not unreasonable or excessive to save himself from death or great bodily harm after retreating as far as he could with safety. See <em>Thomas v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 94. Thus the court did not err in allowing the case to go to the jury and the jury\u2019s finding that Dixon was culpable may not be disturbed. Nor may we disturb the jury\u2019s determination that the crime committed by Dixon was manslaughter. By their verdict they obviously found that Dixon had killed without malice, see <em>Lindsay v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 100, and we feel that the \u201cRule of Provocation\u201d may have been properly invoked by the jury. We think the evidence was sufficient in law for the jury to find that the killing was intentional but upon provocation (the battery committed by the deceased), in a sudden heat of passion with a causal connection between the provocation, the passion, and the fatal act. See <em>Whitehead v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 7. We note that \u201c[t]o be adequate it is not necessary that the provocation would cause a reasonable man to commit intentional homicide but only that it would so inflame his passion as to tend to cause him for the moment to act from passion rather than reason \u2014 that is to tend for the moment to deprive a reasonable man of self control.\u201d Perkins, <em>Criminal Law, </em>2nd Ed., p. 55.
