We affirmed the order denying the motion, holding that the delay from indictment to trial was less than substantial and that appellant had not shown a strong possibility of prejudice. <em>Brown v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 141, decided 26 April 1968. Mandate issued and was received by the lower court 10 June 1968. On 7 August 1968 he filed another motion to dismiss the indictments for lack of a speedy trial. At the hearing thereon he produced no evidence, testimonial or otherwise, which showed he had suffered actual or possible prejudice from any further delay in trial. The motion was denied by order of 23 September 1968 of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. An appeal was again noted and argued before this Court. By opinion decided 12 June, <em>Brown v. State, </em>No. 142, September Term, 1968, unreported, we affirmed the order of the lower court, finding that the right to a speedy trial had not been denied and that the provisions of the Intrastate Detainer Act, Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 616S, in the circumstances, did not entitle him to a dismissal of the indictments. Mandate issued and was received by the lower court on 15 July 1969. On 22 August appellant filed a petition for employment of a private investigator, stating that trial had been set for 10 September. By order the same date the lower court authorized the employment of a private investigator as requested. On 11 September the indictment came on for trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Appellant was tried before a jury, found guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. He appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Appellant again asserts that he was denied a speedy trial. Our opinions on appeal from the two previous denials of motions to dismiss the indictments have adjudicated that appellant was not denied a speedy trial as of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>23 September 1968. Thereafter any delay in trial until 15 July 1969 was due to the appeal initiated by appellant and was not chargeable in any way to the prosecution. Delay from 15 July 1969 to the date trial was actually had was not a delay of constitutional dimension. Further appellant did not demand trial on a date earlier than that set on our remand and it is apparent from his petition to employ a private investigator that he would not have been prepared for trial before the date set in any event. We hold that appellant\u2019s right to a speedy trial was not denied by the trial had on 11 September 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Richard Leroy Greene, age 17 years, worked at the Scot Gas Station on North Point Blvd. near Wise Avenue in Baltimore County. He was the only employee there on 4 May 1965. About 4:45 P.M. when the manager of the station returned from a meeting in Washington, the station was open \u2014 the oil racks and credit machine were outside and the gas pumps were turned on \u2014 but the door to the station office was locked. Unlocking the door he found Greene on the floor between a safe and a desk. There was a bullet hole in the back of Greene\u2019s head and he was dead. About $37 had been stolen from the safe. The Medical Examiner classified the death as homicide; the manner of death was a gunshot wound in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Alvin A. Winship, called by the State, testified that he was in the Scot Station shortly after noon on 4 May 1965. His car was serviced and he bought some crackers and cigarettes inside the station. While inside the station a man came from the \u201clubritoreum\u201d and \u201clooked over the window with his leg up on the window sill and I passed him on the way out.\u201d He was white, \u201cyoung, curly hair or that type of profile, and thin face as opposed to a heavyset individual.\u201d That person was in the station when Winship left. The transcript reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">\u201c (by Assistant State\u2019s Attorney):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alx\">Q. Mr. Winship, I have visited you at your home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>the other evening, Monday evening of this week?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">Q. I showed you some pictures, did I not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">Q. Prior to showing you those pictures, did I in any way point out any picture to you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">Q. Did I in any way do anything to influence you in looking at those pictures ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">A. You asked me to look at the pictures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-12\">Q. And did you look at the pictures ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-13\">A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-14\">Q. What if anything did you do as a result of looking at the pictures ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-15\">A. Then you asked me if there was anyone in particular that I could recognize and I couldn\u2019t identify anyone from the pictures. However, if I had to choose a face from the choice, I\u2019d choose a face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-16\">Q. You didn\u2019t say that was the face ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-17\">A. I can\u2019t. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-18\">MR. SUTLEY: (defense counsel) Objection to any more testimony on this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-19\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know what the testimony will be. I would be prematurely ruling on the objection, Mr. Sutley. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-20\">Q. Mr. Winship, I show you a group of pictures and ask if these are the same pictures that I showed Monday evening ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-21\">A. Uh-huh. In my opinion it is this picture.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-22\">The State introduced \u201cthis one proof\u201d, appellant objected and the objection was overruled. On cross-examination it was elicited that Winship was shown five pictures and out of them the one introduced in evidence was \u201cthe most likely to resemble the person\u201d he saw in the gas station but \u201cI cannot make a positive identification.\u201d Appellant claims the admission of the photograph over his objection was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Whether or not a witness made a judicial identification of an accused, he may testify as to an extrajudicial identification made by him. If the extrajudicial identification is by a viewing of photographs, evidence as to it is admissible if the identification procedure was legal, that is not so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. When so admitted it is substantive proof of identity. See <em>Holmes v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 253. When such evidence is challenged, the burden is on the defendant to show <em>prima facie </em>that the viewing procedure was illegal and if he does so the burden shifts to the State to show by clear and convincing evidence that it was legal. See <em>Smith and Samuels v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 59. We see nothing in the record here compelling the conclusion that the photographic viewing procedure was illegal. Evidence that the witness identified a photograph of appellant as being that \u201cmost likely to resemble\u201d the man he saw in the gas station was admissible for what it was worth. The lack of a positive identification did not render it inadmissible but the weight to be given it was for the jury. <em>Hernandez v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 355, 363-364. Evidence that the witness had selected a photograph as most likely to resemble appellant being admissible, it was not error to place the photograph selected before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Edwin Leroy Randall and George Wesley Johnson, Jr. were called to testify on behalf of the State. Randall was obviously a reluctant witness but it was elicited from him that he met appellant when each was in the \u201cAnne Arundel County\u201d jail in May 1965; he had not known him before. They were incarcerated on the same tier but in different cells. Appellant said he was in for a service station holdup. \u201cI think he was supposed to have loaded the gun up. * * * Gave it to Montgomery * * * that is when Montgomery held a man up and the man gave him money and he is supposed to have shot the man.\u201d On cross-examination Randall said appellant never denied that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>was at the scene of the crime. Johnson said he met appellant when both were inmates on the same cell block in the \u201cAnnapolis County\u201d jail the latter part of May 1965. Montgomery was also there. \u201cThey had just come back, Brown and <em>Montgomery </em>had just come back from a lineup. * * * Montgomery said he didn\u2019t understand how he got picked out in the lineup because when he shot this kid, there wasn\u2019t anyone around \u2014 and Brown said \u2014 yes, he couldn\u2019t figure it out because he loaded the gun in the bathroom * * * Mr. Brown was saying that he was sure that they wouldn\u2019t find the gun. It was a twenty-two snub-nosed revolver that he had thrown in the Patuxent River and Mr. Montgomery checked him and said, it wasn\u2019t the Patuxent River, it was the Patapsco River in Westport.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Appellant contends that neither the testimony of Randall or Johnson was admissible because it was so vague and inconclusive as to be irrelevant \u2014 that its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. We do not agree. The court is vested with sound discretion with regard to the reception or rejection of evidence. <em>Tomolillo v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 711, 716. <em>Stewart v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 309, 317. There was reasonable probability that the robbery discussed by appellant and Montgomery was connected with the offense for which appellant was on trial. We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting it. It was the jury\u2019s function to weigh the evidence and determine the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Bieber v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Corporal Armand C. Elliott of the Baltimore County Police Department was called to testify in behalf of the State.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On 27 May 1965 he was assigned \u201cto go to the Ferndale Police Station and be processed and from there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>go to the Annapolis jail to investigate a homicide.\u201d At Ferndale he was fingerprinted and photographed. He was then handcuffed and taken to the Annapolis jail with \u201cother prisoners.\u201d He was placed in the A tier.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant was in that tier. About an hour later he, appellant, Montgomery and other prisoners were transferred to the \u201cD side\u201d of the jail. \u201cAs we were walking up the tier to the D side, * * * the subject Montgomery, he came rushing down here and he brushed past me and came up to Mr. Brown here * * * He put his arm around him, very excited, and grabbed him by the * * * hand, real excited, and grabbed his hand and pulled him into cell number four. * * * I followed them right in, straight behind them and went up to the cell and just stood by myself by the cell door because there is a long tier on the D side. And the doors were open, you see. * * * It is a small area, closer than what was on A section. I stood by the door and I glanced at the cell again and I saw Montgomery still holding Brown\u2019s hand and he was talking very excitedly.\u201d Elliott was asked by the State how far he was from Brown and Montgomery. \u201cI would say about two feet, there sits a little sort of a cot at the door, right there, and the cot runs along the wall and they were sitting right here and I was right outside the door, sitting there. * * * I heard Montgomery say \u2018Look, Dave, listen to me now, did you tell them anything about the filling station over in Dundalk?\u2019 David Brown stated, \u2018No, I ain\u2019t said nothing to nobody.\u2019 And Montgomery said, \u2018Man, now keep your mouth shut and we won\u2019t have nothing to worry about and don\u2019t say anything about being at that filling station on North Point Road, the only guys we have to worry about is that colored guy I was fussing with and that white-haired guy.\u2019 Montgomery further stated to David Brown, \u2018You were standing over near the desk and he was in the middle of the floor; he couldn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>see behind the desk.\u2019 And David Brown said, \u2018Man I didn\u2019t know you were going to shoot the guy, you did it so quick [pow] and it was all over.\u2019 Montgomery sort of shouted, \u2018Well, he jumped at me, didn\u2019t he?\u2019 And David Brown said, \u2018Yes, he did jump at you, but what about that white-haired guy, he could have been around back somewhere?\u2019 Montgomery stated, \u2018Naw, they just brought that guy around because he must have saw us somewhere near the filling station.\u2019 David Brown said, \u2018Now, I remember where he could have been, remember when we left the station, you said you wanted to go to a rest-room and we stopped at the Avon or Savon station, well, that white-haired guy must have been around there.\u2019 Montgomery said, \u2018Well, Dave, just keep your mouth shut and you won\u2019t have nothing to worry about. Now, here\u2019s the way we will work it.\u2019 Montgomery stated, \u2018You remember that guy named Earl.\u2019 David Brown stated, \u2018No, I can\u2019t place the guy.\u2019 Montgomery stated, \u2018You remember him, he has a lot of hair and wears it down front just like you and same size and everything. Now I\u2019ll tell them he was with me at the filling station and I\u2019ll take the blame for everything, both robberies and also the stolen truck.\u2019 David Brown said, \u2018How are you going to tell them you hot-wired the truck, you don\u2019t know anything about hot wiring and when that D.A. gets you on the stand, he\u2019ll trip you up. Now let me tell you how it\u2019s done. You take a hot wire put it in back of the coil or switch.\u2019 Montgomery stated, \u2018Yes, sure, we will get to that later, the main thing is that one of us gets out of here, because you are more good to me on the outside than in here, even if I get twenty years for it. Now do like I said and I\u2019ll take all the weight.\u2019 David Brown says, \u2018Suppose something goes wrong?\u2019 Montgomery said, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll tell them the detectives hit me in the mouth and keep on my back until I had to tell, and I\u2019ll tell them I didn\u2019t mean to shoot him or I was drinking, but you tell you were at your aunt\u2019s house and I\u2019ll tell them Earl was with me at the filling station on North Point Road, because they will try me in a Dundalk Court.\u2019 David Brown stated, \u2018No, man, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>for something like that, you have to go to a place called Towson and you better hope you don\u2019t go before a judge named Turnbull. Man, he\u2019s rough.\u2019 By this time, there were about \u00e9ighteen other male prisoners in.the whole cell block. While this conversation was taking place, they couldn\u2019t, all of them, they couldn\u2019t hear what was going on. They were talking real loud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Appellant contends that Elliott\u2019s testimony, .was admitted in error. He argues that the conversation overheard by Elliott was not \u201cvoluntarily made\u201d because Brown was not aware of \u201cthe eavesdropping policeman.\u201d Thus he invokes his right under the Fifth Amendment not to be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. There have been sharply different views within the Supreme Court as to the ultimate reach of the Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination. \u201cBut\u201d, as the Court observed in <em>Hoffa v. United States, </em>385 U. S. 293, at 303-304, \u201csince at least as long ago as 1807, when Chief Justice Marshall first gave attention to the matter in the trial of Aaron Burr,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> all have agreed that a necessary element of compulsory self-incrimination is some kind of compulsion.\u201d Here it is clear that the incriminating statements were not the product of any sort of coercion, legal or factual, physical or psychological. The conversations of Brown and Montgomery were wholly voluntary. Nothing said by either was prompted, inspired or solicited by Elliott nor was it caused by or the result of any questioning of either by the officer. On the contrary the evidence is that he never even spoke to them. They simply talked without threat, promise or inducement on the part of the authorities in such circumstances that what they said could be overheard. Elliott, in a position to overhear, was under no obligation to close his ears. As the Court said in <em>Hoff a, supra, </em>at 303, quoting with approval the words of the dissenting opinion in <em>Lopez v. United States, </em>373 U. S. 427, at 465 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>. \u201cThe risk of being overheard by an eavesdropper or betrayed by an informer or deceived as to the identity of one with whom one deals is probably inherent in the conditions of human society. It is the kind of risk we necessarily assume whenever we speak.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">We hold that the receipt of Elliott\u2019s testimony with regard to the conversations of Brown and Montgomery did not violate the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. See <em>Jefferson v. State, </em>228 Md. 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Appellant does not specifically claim a violation of the Fourth Amendment and we do not think that Amendment was violated. Although the Fourth Amendment can be violated by guileful as well as by forcible intrusions, <em>Gouled v. United, States, </em>255 U. S. 298, what it protects is \u201cthe security a man relies upon when he places himself or his property within a constitutionally protected area, be it his home or his office, his hotel room or his automobile. There he is protected from unwarranted governmental intrusion.\u201d <em>Hoffa, supra, </em>at 301.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6While the protections of the Fourth Amendment are not limited to tangibles, but can extend as well in certain circumstances, to oral statements, see <em>Silverman v. United States, </em>365 U. S. 505,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> they were not violated here because there was no unconstitutional intrusion by Elliott into the area. Even if the cell into which Brown and Montgomery went to converse be considered a constitutionally protected area, Elliott did not intrude therein physically and there was no electronic bugging. Nor was he in any sense a trespasser by his position in the tier aisle when he overheard the conversations. The Supreme Court said in <em>Hoffa, </em>at 302: \u201cNeither this Court nor any member of it has ever expressed the view that the Fourth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>protects a wrongdoer\u2019s misplaced belief that a person to whom he voluntarily confides his wrongdoing will not reveal it.\u201d Certainly then, it cannot protect the wrongdoer voluntarily confiding his wrongdoing in such a manner that he can be overheard by a third person legally in a position to overhear. See also <em>Lewis v. United States, </em>385 U. S. 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Appellant does not contend that the actions of the authorities violated due process of law. However, we call attention to <em>People v. Lopez, </em>384 P. 2d 16 (S. Ct. Cal., 1963) in which it was held that there was no violation of due process in the absence of coercion, invasion of privacy and inducement, in placing a certain prisoner, formerly known to the defendant, and the defendant in the same cell, and permitting such prisoner to testify as to his conversations with the defendant. The court observed, at 30: \u201cExcept only insofar as concerns consultation with his attorney in a room designated for that purpose, a prisoner has no right of privacy in a jail. (People v. Morgan (1961) 197 Cal. App. 2d 90, 93 [3], 16 Cal. Rptr. 838, cert. den. 370 U. S. 965, 82 S. Ct. 1606, 8 L. Ed. 2d 830.)\u201d See <em>Stewart v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 309; <em>Smith v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 297; <em>McClelland v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">We find that Elliott\u2019s actions did not violate any constitutional rights of appellant. We hold that the lower court did not err in permitting Elliott to testify as to the conversations between appellant and Montgomery.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Appellant claims error in the refusal of the lower court to grant his request for eight instructions. We find no error; the requested instructions were either fairly covered in the instructions actually given or did not correctly state the law applicable on the facts. Maryland Rule 756 b.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">(1) <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U. S. 123 did not preclude the admission of the conversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>tions between. Montgomery and appellant. Statements made in the conversations here were not the product of interrogation by the authorities; the statements held inadmissible in <em>Bruton </em>were obtained by custodial interrogation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">(2) There was evidence of premeditation in the murder. The statements that the victim was shot during the robbery after he jumped at Montgomery would tend to show premeditation, as would the loading of the gun before the robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">(8) There being evidence of premeditation the jury were not restricted in finding murder in the first degree to a determination that it was committed in the perpetration of a robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">(4) The general rule is that an extrajudicial statement of an accused does not warrant a conviction unless there is also independent evidence to establish the <em>corpus delicti. </em>This independent evidence need not establish, by itself, the truth of the <em>corpus delicti </em>beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance of proof, but any facts and circumstances that are substantial in nature and fortify the truth of the statement are sufficient to support a conviction. <em>Koprivich v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 147, 153-154. Such facts and circumstances here were that the victim was found near a safe from which money had been stolen, dead of a gunshot wound in the head with no weapon present. A request that the jury be instructed that \u201cthe law of Maryland requires more evidence than the mere admission of an accused in order to sustain a conviction\u201d neither correctly stated the applicable law nor was it appropriate on the facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>(5) That the jury could not convict appellant \u2022of-murder in the first degree if they found . that the only evidence tending to establish . \u25a0 a robbery was by way of the alleged state- - ments of appellant was not proper in the light of evidence from which the jury could \u25a0 : find that the murder was premeditated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">(6) The court correctly instructed the jury as . to burden of proof and cautioned them to consider all the evidence and accept and act . on that part they believed to be true and reject and not act on that part they believed .. to be untrue. If a statement of an accused us - properly admissible it may be weighed ; by-the jury as any other evidence. It was \u2022\"'\u25a0not error to refuse an instruction that \u201cthe law requires out-of-court admissions alleged .to have been made by an accused * * * to be weighed with great care due to their in- \u2022 \u25a0 -herent lack of trustworthiness.\u201d We do not \u25a0 \u2022 construe <em>Thomas v. State, </em>186 Md. 446 to \u2022 : 1 compel the giving of such a charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">(7:) .and (8) These requested instructions concerned the rule as to denial or repudiation by an accused of statements made by another person in his presence. Here appellant did not stand mute or deny statements made .. by Montgomery but rather made inculpatory statements of his own in substantial agreement. The instructions sought were not proper on the evidence. In any event . had appellant simply stood mute in the face of Montgomery\u2019s statements concerning the crime the rule set out in <em>Ewell v. State, </em>228 Md. 615 would be applicable to permit his conduct to be received as an admission he \u25a0 . .believed the statements to be true. Neither v... the qualification of the rule as discussed in <em>Barnes v. State, </em>1 Md. 123 nor the holdings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436 would control as here the statements were not made by any questioning initiated by a law enforcement official.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Appellant contends that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the conviction. Upon the findings of the Medical Examiner and evidence adduced by the testimony of the manager of the filling station, Winship, Randall, Johnson and Elliott the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Greene was murdered, that the murder was in the first degree, either as wilful, deliberate and premeditated, Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 407 or as committed in the perpetration of a robbery, \u00a7 410, and that appellant was a principal in its commission.
