Conley for leave to appeal from an order filed by Judge George B. Rasin, Jr., presiding in the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County denying relief sought by applicant\u2019s first petition under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act. The application is remanded to the hearing eourt for additional findings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u25a0 Applicant,, convicted of escape, raises two contentions in his application: (1) the hearing judge failed to allow \u00bfvidence and make findings on applicant\u2019s contention concerning bias1 of the trial judge and (2) the hearing judge improperly determined that applicant\u2019s trial counsel was not accountable for the failure to file an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">As to the. first contention, the record shows the hearing judge refused to allow evidence and did not make.findings-on the contention that applicant\u2019s trial counsel incompetently allowed him to be tried by a prejudiced judge. If applicant can prove that he was denied genuine and effective representation of counsel due to counsel\u2019s failure to object t\u00f3 the trial judge\u2019s bias or if applicant can prove that the trial judge was in fact prejudiced, he would be entitled to relief. See <em>Dailey v. Warden, </em>3 Md. App. 425, 239 A. 2d 778. It is, of course, the hearing judge\u2019s responsibility in a post conviction proceeding to make findings of fact on all contentions raised. <em>Shelton v. Warden, </em>4 Md. App. 368, 242 A. 2d 806, and Md. Rule BK 45(b). We will, therefore, remand the case for proper disposal of this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">As to..the second contention, that the failure to file an appeal was chargeable to applicant\u2019s trial counsel, the hearing judge heard extensive evidence from both the applicant and his trial counsel. We see no reason to disturb the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that trial counsel complied fully with the requirements of Md. Rule 719, and was not chargeable for the failure to file an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AtoE\">\n<em>Application remanded for further hearings consistent' with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
