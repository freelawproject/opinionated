Mackall Childs in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, dated May 12,1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-15\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AbJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>MEMORANDUM OF </em>OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The petitioner, Gus Merchant, an inmate of the. Maryland Penitentiary serving a commuted sentence., of death for rape, seeks relief under the Uniform Post : Conviction Procedure Act, Article 27, Section 645A, <em>et s'eq. </em>of the Maryland Code. A hearing on this, the petitioner\u2019s first post conviction petition, was held on April' 1, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">On October 9,1957, the petitioner, a negro laborer, was tried before Judges Benjamin Michaelson and Matthew Evans, sitting without a jury, and found guilty of the rape .of a white Glen Burnie housewife. One week later he was sentenced to death by the administration of lethal gas. Following an unsuccessful appeal, <em>Merchant v. State, </em>217 Md. 61, Governor McKeldin commuted the petitioner\u2019s sentence to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">At his trial, the petitioner was represented by court appointed counsel, Noah A. Hillman, Esquire, an experienced and respected member of the bar, who was assisted by a younger associate, John A. Blondell, Esquire, who made investigations and represented the petitioner at the sentencing. The petitioner\u2019s defense asserted by' counsel throughout the trial consisted primarily of an. attack on the voluntariness of the \u201cconfession\u201d given by Merchant to the police. The petitioner was thoroughly advised of his right to testify or remain silent at his trial and did not testify in his own behalf even though he had persistently maintained in his statement and to his attorneys at all times prior to his conviction, that the victim had consented to the intercourse. No attempt was. made by counsel to develop this defense or to conduct any investigation into the reputation of the prosecutrix. On the appeal after conviction Merchant\u2019s counsel again raised the issues of the voluntariness of the confession, the insufficiency of the evidence, and the excessiveness oi the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">In this petition, the petitioner makes the following allegations :</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">1. That he was denied due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">2. That the \u201cconfession\u201d was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>3. That the court failed to scrutinize the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">4. That the defendant was denied the right to testify in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">5. That evidence was suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">6. That adverse publicity prejudiced his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">7. That the petitioner was denied his constitutional right to have genuine and effective representation by counsel for his defense in that the petitioner\u2019s court appointed attorneys who, as a result of prejudging the petitioner\u2019s guilt, failed to pursue the defense of consent or make an appropriate investigation into the reputation of the prosecutrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">The petitioner\u2019s present court-appointed attorney waived final argument on all contentions save the allegation as to incompetency of counsel. However, this court in event of appeal must make a finding on each ground asserted. Rule BK45b; <em>Farrell v. Warden, </em>241 Md. 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">The bare allegation of denial of due process is not sufficient to sustain post conviction relief. <em>Austin v. Director, </em>237 Md. 314; <em>Briscoe v. Warden, </em>3 Md. App. 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">THE \u201cCONFESSION\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-15\">This allegation that the confession was involuntary was finally determined by the Court of Appeals in petitioner\u2019s appeal, <em>Merchant v. State, supra, </em>and may not be relitigated in post conviction proceedings. <em>Meadows v. Warden, </em>243 Md. 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-16\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b567-17\">FAILURE OF COURT TO SCRUTINIZE THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b567-18\">Sufficiency of the evidence may not be reviewed in a post conviction case. <em>Austin v. Director, supra; Johnson v. Director, </em>243 Md. 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">DENIAL OF RIGHT TO TESTIFY</p>\n<p id=\"Arrg\">The court finds that after the State had rested its case, counsel and petitioner engaged in a lengthy discussion as to whether or not Merchant would testify in his own behalf and the decision not to testify was that of Merchant.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">SUPPRESSION OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"ACHB\">See explanation for rejecting first contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">PREJUDICIAL PUBLICITY</p>\n<p id=\"AcJ\">The court found no evidence of unduly prejudicial pretrial publicity. The only reference of talk of lynching was contained in Judge Michaelson\u2019s dissertation prior to sentencing. Moreover, this was a court trial and there was no showing whatsoever that the two judges hearing the case had been influenced by any pretrial publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">DENIAL OF EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATION</p>\n<p id=\"ArL\">It is well-established that in a post conviction hearing a petitioner is not precluded from raising the issue of incompetency of counsel because he failed to raise the issue at trial or pursue it on appeal. <em>Sample v. Warden, </em>6 Md. App. 103, 107; <em>O\u2019Connor v. Warden, </em>6 Md. App. 590, 594. Therefore, this petitioner is entitled to have this allegation considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">The test for determining incompetency of counsel for purposes of habeas corpus and post conviction review which obtained at the time of the petitioner\u2019s original trial appears to have been whether there existed at the trial (1) bad faith, (2) fraud, (3) collusion with the State on the part of defense counsel, or (4) such incompetency as would make the trial a farce. <em>Slater v. Warden, </em>241 Md. 668. More recently, the test has been whether under all the circumstances of the particular case the pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>titioner was afforded genuine and effective representation. <em>Hyde v. Warden, </em>235 Md. 641. <em>Slater, supra, </em>also appears to hold that a post conviction petitioner is entitled to have applied the test which obtains at the time of his post conviction petition and not the test which obtained at the time of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Mere errors in trial tactics are not sufficient to constitute incompetency of counsel. <em>Hall v. Warden, </em>224 Md. 662, 665; <em>Gullion v. Warden, </em>3 Md. App. 263, 265; <em>Henry v. Mississippi, </em>379 U. S. 443, 13 L.Ed.2d 408. Furthermore, failure to raise an available defense at trial does not, in itself, constitute incompetency of counsel. Annotation at 74 A.L.R.2d 1390, 1449.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The prosecuting witness testified that on the morning of July 25, 1957 she had prepared her husband\u2019s breakfast and he had left for work at 5:30 A.M. She shut the door and locked it, cleaned the table, straightened the kitchen, and looked at her sleeping children, ten and twelve years of age. She then stated she went back to bed and was asleep when the defendant jumped on top of her in bed, threatened her with a knife, and demanded sexual intercourse. She related several involved conversations with the intruder who is alleged to have had a knife in his hand. After having relations with her, he is alleged to have demanded five dollars for bus fare. She gave him eleven dollars and continued to converse with him while fixing herself a cup of coffee.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">After his departure she fixed breakfast for her two boys, cleansed herself, dressed, made the bed, and went next door to her sister\u2019s home where she reported she had been raped.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Meanwhile, the petitioner, only a short distance from the prosecutrix\u2019s home, engaged in conversation with Mr. and Mrs. Jesse Quarles and paid Quarles $1.90 for a previous loan and transportation to work. He then went to a nearby liquor store and bought a small bottle of wine. From thence he went to the home of his mother-in-law where he paid her $8.00. It was there later in the same day that the police found him hiding in a clothes closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>That evening after several hours of intermittent questioning, Merchant asked the interrogating officer if it would be easier on him if he told the truth. The policeman responded that he would make no promises, \u2014 \u201cbut the truth hurts ho one.\u201d Thereupon, Merchant proceeded to give a statement which was exculpatory in nature wherein h\u00bf admitted having intercourse with the prosecuting witness, but stated it was voluntary on her part. See <em>Merchant v. State, supra, </em>pages 68-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Messrs. Hillman and Blondell entered their appearances for the petitioner on October 5th, 1957. While Merchant at the hearing complained that counsel did not visit him often enough, he did state that he saw them twice before the arraignment on September 24th. He stated that he wanted a jury trial, but Mr. Blondell decided on a court trial and that Mr. Hillman suggested he plead guilty and throw himself on the mercy of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The court is of the opinion, and so finds, that defense counsel were conscientious, attentive, and thorough insofar as <em>their </em>theory of the case was concerned. The court believes Mr. Blondell in his statement that he visited Merchant at least twelve times before the trial, and personally checked the stories of all persons whose names were given him by his client to determine whether or not they would be helpful in his case as witnesses. Mr. Blondell has, since this case, had extensive criminal law practice both in a prosecutorial and defense capacity and testified that in reviewing the procedure in the case he would not in the light of his experience, since acquired, try the case in a different manner. Mr. Hillman\u2019s established reputation as an experienced and ethical practitioner needs no embellishment from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">However, the following colloquy took place during Mr. Hillman\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">\n<em>Mr. Hillman:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\"><em>Oh Direct Examination by Mr. Weathersbee </em>(State\u2019s Attorney)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">Q. In regard to the confession, what if any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>thing, did the defendant Merchant before trial on the conferences of the third, seventh, and eighth say to you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">A. I recollect this. I believe that at some point he told us that intercourse was voluntary. <em>Which I didn\u2019t believe. </em>(Italics by the Court) And on two occasions, either the first visit and the last, or the second and the last, he was told in no uncertain terms that <em>he would have to come wp with some sort of an alibi that sounded better than that, </em>that this woman consented to have intercourse with him, in her home, in her bed. He was told that !</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">Q. By whom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">A. By me. I don\u2019t know whether Mr. Blondell told him anything, but I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">Q. Why did you say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">A. Because it didn\u2019t make sense. Here was a married woman, of a different race, in her own home, in bed, in the early morning, and he wanted us to believe, and have a court or a jury believe, that he came into that home and had intercourse with her voluntarily. <em>We didn\u2019t believe it, or 1 didn\u2019t. </em>I don\u2019t know what Mr. Blondell believed, <em>but I didn\u2019t. </em>And 1 believed that he would have had to have an alibi or a stronger defense than to say that she had intercourse with him voluntarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">\n<em>On Cross Examination by Mr. Stack</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-11\">Q. Did you feel that you were adequately prepared for the case, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-12\">A. I didn\u2019t think the case was complicated. I thought it was a simple case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-13\">Q. You mean because you believed the man to be guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-14\">A. No, not that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-15\">Q. Well, you stated that you did not believe his story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>A. <em>We didn\u2019t; we couldn\u2019t </em>\u2014 I <em>could not accept the story </em>that he went into this home and had intercourse with this woman of a different race and that she voluntarily consented. It didn\u2019t set right; there had to be something else to it, that\u2019s what I mean. And so he was importuned to give us another \u2014 at first, if I recollect, he denied it \u2014 then came around to the idea that she agreed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">Q. Was a background investigation made of Mrs. \u2014 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">A. No, I didn\u2019t; whether Mr. Blondell did, I don\u2019t know,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">Q. Did you at any time attempt to ascertain whether or not Mrs. \u2014 volunteered to have intercourse with Gus Merchant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-10\">\n<em>On Examination by the Court</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-11\">Q. Mr. Hillman, were you aware that your client had given a statement prior to the trial, to the police ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-13\">Q. And were you able to ascertain what the statement contained?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-14\">A. No. I don\u2019t recollect that we did \u2014 may be Mr. Blondell has this recollection, because he has notes I\u2019m sure because he made certain independent \u2014 .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-15\">Q. Did you try to ascertain from the defendant himself what he told the police ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-16\">A. Oh, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-17\">Q. And do you recall just what he had told the police as far as he related it to you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-18\">A. I\u2019d have to stretch my imagination widely to recall now what he told me, except that I can say that as to this, as I told Your Honor, that the story that he told us, I\u2019m sure that on two occasions I told him a couple of times to come up with a better story than that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>\n<em>Mr. Blondell:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">\n<em>On Direct Examination by Mr. Weathersbee</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">Q. Do you recall prior to trial having observed the statement that Mr. Merchant gave to the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">A. Prior to trial, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">Q. How did you obtain that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">A. From the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office, and I could be wrong, but I am sure that we went over that statement with Gus prior to trial. I am practically sure of it, because we had a very heart-to-heart talk over the statement that he gave, <em>and he stuck to it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-11\">\n<em>On Cross-Examination by Mr. Stack</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-12\">Q. At any time, in your recollection, did Gus Merchant deviate from his statement that he had not raped that woman ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-13\">A. Did he ever deviate ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-14\">Q. Did he ever profess. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-15\">A. <em>His story from the very beginning '\u00a1to the end was that it was by consent, from the very beginning.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-16\">Q. As stated in the statement he gave to the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-17\">A. That\u2019s right, he stuck with that statement from the beginning to the end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-18\">Q. Did you spend any time in investigation attempting to verify that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-19\">A. No, I didn\u2019t attempt to talk to the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-20\">Q. Did you talk with the victim\u2019s sister ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-21\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-22\">Q. Did you talk with the victim\u2019s husband?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-23\">A. Oh, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-24\">Q. You did nothing to check out this statement, check it out to see if it were true ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-25\">A. <em>Gus Merchant insisted that it was true.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-26\">Q. Did you do anything to verify or to confirm in your own mind whether or not this statement was true ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>A. Well, other than to check up on. wheie he was and what these other people or at least talk to them, no, I didn\u2019t do anything else to '. verify as to what he said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">\u201cThe criminal statute of this state, although fixing the penalties, does not define the crime of rape. See Code (1957) Art. 27, \u00a7 461. However1, the law writers generally define common law rape as the act of a man having unlawful carnal knowledge of a female over the age of ten years by force without the consent and against the will of the victim. Hochheimer, <em>Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 47 (1911); 1 Wharton, <em>Criminal Law and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 300 (1957) ; 44 Am. Jur., <em>Rape, % 2; </em>75 C.J.S., <em>Rape, </em>\u00a7 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">\u201cForce is an essential element of the ciime and to justify a conviction, the evidence must warrant a conclusion either that the victim resisted and her resistance was overcome by forc\u00e9 or that she was prevented from resisting by threats to her safety. But no particular amount of force, either actual or constructive, is required to constitute rape. Necessarily that fact must depend upon the prevailing circumstances. As in this case force may exist without violence. If the acts and threats of the defendant were reasonably calculated to create in the mind of the victim \u2014 having regard to the circumstances in which she was placed \u2014 a real apprehension, due to fear, of imminent bodily harm, serious enough to impair or overcome her will to resist, then such acts and threats are the equivalent to force. <em>State v. Thompson, </em>227 N. C. 19, 40 S.E.2d 620 (1946). See also <em>State v. Dill, </em>3 Terry 533, 40 A. 2d. 443 (Del. 1944) ; 75 C.J.S., <em>Rape, </em>\u00a7 12b; 44 Am. Jur., <em>Rape, </em>\u00a7 5. Cf. <em>Selvage v. State, </em>148 Neb. 409, 27 N.W.2d 636 (1947).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-12\">\u201cWith respect to the presence or absence of the element of consent, it is true, of course, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>however reluctantly given, consent to the act at any time prior to penetration deprives the subsequent intercourse of its criminal character. There is, however, a wide difference between consent and a submission to the act. Consent may involve submission, but submission does not necessarily imply consent. Furthermore, submission to a compelling force, or as a result of being put in fear, is not consent.\u201d <em>Hazel v. State, </em>221 Md. 464.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">It will be noted that Merchant made his admission prior to consulting with counsel (eleven years prior to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436) and although he consistently maintained that there was consent, it was never brought before the court for consideration even after the admission was introduced into evidence at the trial. Of course, no one can now hazard a supposition as to what effect this defense may have had upon the court, nevertheless, the following facts do warrant consideration:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">1. PROSECUTRIX\u2019S BEHAVIOR FOLLOWING THE CRIME: The woman did not call the police or her husband immediately after the crime, but instead, cooked the children\u2019s breakfast, changed the bed sheets, and put them in the clothes hamper; took off her nightgown and put it in her bureau drawer, changed her clothes, and washed herself before going over to her sister\u2019s to report the rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">2. THE DEFENDANT\u2019S BEHAVIOR FOLLOWING THE CRIME: After leaving the prosecutrix\u2019s house, the defendant did not behave as if he felt in any danger of being apprehended for the commission of a crime: he stopped and talked with the Quarles near the victim\u2019s house and these persons noticed nothing unusual about his behavior; he distributed the money received from the woman to persons living in the immediate neighborhood immediately after the crime; and he failed to flee or secret himself until the police surrounded his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">3. THE KNIFE: The fact that the police found a common kitchen knife, in the defendant\u2019s china closet does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>not in itself significantly inculpate the defendant. The alleged victim claimed the knife was hers, the defendant that it was his. He admitted that he had it in the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">4. SIGNS OF VIOLENCE: There were no signs of a struggle or of torn clothes. Although the prosecutrix stated that the rapist was \u201crough\u201d and that he \u201churt\u201d her, the doctor reported his examination was \u201cabsolutely negative\u201d (T-ll) as to evidences of violence or of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">5. OUTCRIES: The woman\u2019s protestations, which she characterized as \u201ckind of loud,\u201d failed to awake her children asleep in the next room.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">6. DEFENDANT\u2019S BACKGROUND: The court may have pondered the probability that the defendant, a married man with two children, with no prior criminal record or record of mental instability, and with an honorable discharge from the army, would risk conviction of a capital crime by selecting a victim who could easily identify him since they had spoken to one another over the backyard fence on at least two occasions (T-89, 90) as he passed by her house on his way to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">7. EXCULPATORY STATEMENT TO POLICE: The defendant, described as being of below-normal intelligence and with only an 11th grade education, although he had been in custody for twelve hours and by the State\u2019s own admission subjected to at least six and one-half hours of interrogation without benefit of counsel, gave to the police a statement in which he maintained, as he continued to maintain until and after his conviction, that he had had intercourse with the prosecutrix with her consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">8. MONEY GIVEN DEFENDANT: The prosecutrix\u2019s behavior is somewhat questionable when she gave the defendant more money than she stated he had demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">9. PROSECUTRIX\u2019S TESTIMONY: The woman testified that the rapist\u2019s face was at all times during the crime and prior to his departure covered by a pillow slip (T-82, T-X-23) which she three times described as cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>ing Ms face from the nose up (T-46, T-X-ll, T-X-22), and once from the nose down (T-24); and yet, after the rape, while she sat at the kitchen table and drank a cup of coffee, the defendant \u201ckept staring at me all the whole time, standing by the door\u201d (T-58).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">10. DEFENDANT\u2019S SPEECH IMPEDIMENT: The prosecutrix failed to mention, during the rather extensive conversations which she testified took place between her and the rapist, that the defendant had a very pronounced speech impediment.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">11. MEANS OF ENTRY: The victim testified that she closed and locked the door, yet no testimony was offered as to any breaking and entering on the part of the accused. His access to the house was completely unaccounted for.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">It would seem to the undersigned that presented with the above-listed facts and circumstances, a court might properly have entertained the probability that the accused may have been telling the truth when he stated that the prosecutrix had consented to the intercourse, even though an investigation into the prosecutrix\u2019s background may have revealed nothing which would have contributed to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Would the fact that defendant\u2019s counsel refused to believe his story and thereby failed to present it to the court deprive the petitioner of effective representation in a constitutional sense?</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">The American Bar Association, Canons of Professional Ethics, Canon 5, defines the duty of counsel for a criminal defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">\u201cIt is the right of the lawyer to undertake the defense of a person accused of a crime, <em>regardless of his personal opinion as to the guilt </em>of the accused; otherwise innocent persons, victims of suspicious circumstances, might be denied proper defense. Having undertaken such defense, the lawyer is bound by all fair and honorable means, to present every defense that the law of the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>permits, to the end that no person may be deprived' of life, liberty, but by due process of law:\u201d \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">That the representation of <em>a </em>defendant charged with rape properly includes an investigation of the reputation of the prosecutrix has long been recognized by the courts. In <em>Powell v. Alabama, </em>287 U. S. 45, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932), where the Supreme Court reversed the state trial court\u2019s conviction of the \u201cScotsboro Boys\u201d because of the denial of the right to counsel in a rape case where the court proceeded to try the defendants six days after indictment without' allowing counsel adequate time for preparation, the court said (page 165 of 77 L. Ed.) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">\u201cIt is not enough that counsel thus precipitated into the case thought there was no defense and exercised their best judgment in proceeding to trial without preparation. Neither they nor the court could say what a prompt and thorough-going investigation might disclose as to the facts. No attempt was made to investigate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">In <em>Smallwood v. Warden, </em>205 F. Supp. 325 (1962) the Fourth Circuit District Court reversed the May 1957 rape conviction of a St. Mary\u2019s County (Maryland) defendant who had told his counsel that the victim had consented and that there was a witness, a taxicab driver, who could testify as to the victim\u2019s promiscuity. His counsel failed to pursue the defense of consent or make any investigations into the reputation of the prosecutrix. The court held that these facts indicated representation of such low caliber as to amount to no representation. Thus, the guarantee\"\u2019of. due process had been violated. The court based its holding on the fact that the defendant\u2019s court-appointed'attorney (at page 329) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">\u201cdid not believe what his client told him and took no steps to check the story or develop the available defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Coles v. Peyton, </em>389 F. 2d 224 (1968), the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a Virginia rape conviction where the defendant\u2019s court-appointed attorney failed to develop the defense of consent or investigate the reputation of the prosecutrix after the defendant had told his attorney that he was under the impression that he was having intercourse with a common prostitute. That court set forth the principles which should guide a court-appointed attorney in his representation of an indigent defendant (page 226) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">\u201cThe principles may be simply stated: Counsel for an indigent defendant. . . must confer with his client without undue delay and as often as necessary, to advise him of his rig\u2019hts and to elicit matters of defense or to ascertain that potential defenses are unavailable. Counsel must conduct appropriate investigations, both factual and legal, to determine if matters of defense can be developed, and to allow himself enough time for reflection and preparation for trial. An omission or failure to abide by these requirements constitutes a denial of effective representation of counsel unless the state, on which is cast the burden of proof once a violation of these precepts is shown, can establish lack of prejudice thereby.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\"><em>Johns v. Smyth, </em>176 F. Supp. 949 (D. C., 1959) a habeas corpus proceeding reviewing a 1942 first degree murder conviction by a Virginia State Court makes a distinction between mere errors in trial tactics and behavior by an attorney amounting to ineffective representation. In that case the defendant and the victim were inmates in a Virginia penitentiary. Johns maintained that he killed the victim after the victim had suggested an unnatural sex act. The State\u2019s evidence pointed to other motives. The court gave instructions only as to first and second degree murder, despite the possibility of a manslaughter verdict. The defendant\u2019s court-appointed attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>ney failed to submit instructions covering manslaughter and failed to argue the case to the jury. The attorney explained his failure to pursue the alleged suggestion by the victim in mitigation of the homicide because he \u2014 \u201ccould not conscientiously argue to the jury that (the defendant) should be acquitted\u201d (page 953). The District Court, in reversing, held that the trial had the earmarks of an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding and that the defendant\u2019s attorney was so prejudiced and convinced of his client\u2019s guilt that he was unable to give his client his undivided allegiance and faithful service. The court stated that while the attorney\u2019s actions could be, and ordinarily would be, interpreted as trial tactics, his own admission that his behavior was motivated by his conscience which would not permit him to adopt certain customary trial procedures, caused his actions to enter the field of incompetency and thus the defendant was denied due process of law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">\u201cIt sustains rather than derogates against our profession if counsel presents the contentions of his client as such, even though he does not personally underwrite them as his own. It may not be according an indigent defendant his right to counsel or the equal protection of the laws to tell counsel generally as we do in the Canons of Professional Ethics, that it is improper to express in argument a personal opinion concerning a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, and yet to expect counsel to deny his client access to the independent judgment of the court by reason of counsel\u2019s own expressed belief that his client\u2019s contention does not possess sufficient merit to justify hearing.\u201d <em>Gallegos v. Turner, </em>256 F. Supp. 670, 676-677 footnote 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">\u201cA lawyer\u2019s job is to represent and defend his client in spite of his own feeling with respect to his client\u2019s guilt or innocence, \u2014 otherwise and simultaneously, he would don the robe of judge and claim membership on the jury, whereas he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>is but liason between. \u2014 There have been many-honest strategems less plausible than that employed here that seemed idiotic at the time to a bystander, but which resulted in arrival at the truth and the acquittal of an innocent.\u201d <em>State v. Dennis, </em>385 P. 2d 152.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The undersigned finds that the petitioner\u2019s counsel in prejudging their client\u2019s guilt failed as a consequence to pursue the defense of consent or to make an investigation into the reputation of the prosecutrix and that their belief in the improbability, if not the impossibility, of a white housewife consenting to intercourse with a negro laborer in her own home while her children slept in the adjoining room is the equivalent of the attorney\u2019s \u201cconscience\u201d in <em>Johns </em>and thus removes the petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s conduct of the defense from the realm of trial tactics and places it in the category of ineffective representation in a constitutional sense. Counsel appear to have fallen into the trap of confusing their duty to defend an accused with their duty to advise a defendant in a civil action and thereby allowed their sense of probability of success to blind them to the possibilty of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Significantly, the trial court, prior to pronouncing its sentence of death by the administration of lethal gas stated, <em>inter alia, </em>the following reasons for the sentence which it had decided to impose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\u201c. . . .Nowhere has (the Court) been able to find anything that is sometimes prevalent in some other cases of similar nature, and that is, something which would <em>mitigate the gravity of the offense to the extent that there was no invitation, or some contact, or some set of circumstances ivhich minimize the effect of an act of this kind. . .Sometimes in some of these cases, the woman may by her conduct indicate to a man that there may be an approach. </em>This is a different case. . .The evidence against him was analyzed and analyzed to the best interest of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>concerned. Had there been any doubt, irrespective of the effect of the act in this case, any reasonable doubt, he would have been given the benefit of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">It seems not improbable that had the petitioner\u2019s counsel asserted at the trial and at the sentencing, the petitioner\u2019s insistence on the victim\u2019s consent, the facts and circumstances listed above could have supported this defense. in the minds of the triers of fact. The sentencing judges, in view of the reasons given for imposing the death penalty, may have pronounced a much milder sentence or made an acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Order</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The- court having found that the petitioner in his original trial was denied his constitutional right to effective representation of counsel, it is ORDERED this 12th day of May, 1970, by the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County that the State\u2019s Attorney for said County within thirty days from date hereof either note an appeal to the Court of \u25a0 Special Appeals from the finding of this court or indicate his intention to retry the petitioner. In the event of either action on the part of the State\u2019s Attorney for Anne Arundel County, petitioner will be given leave to apply for his release on bail pending the outcome. However, should the State\u2019s Attorney fail to take either course of action within thirty days, the petitioner shall thereupon'be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">E.
