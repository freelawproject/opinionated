Smith, Sr., rendered by a jury in the Circuit Court for Harford County, and the sentence of 10 years imposed thereon are affirmed. His conviction of assaulting and beating Mr. Smith and the consecutive sentence of 5 years imposed thereon are vacated; in the circumstances here the offense of assault and battery merged into the conviction of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">\n<em>MERGER OF OFFENSES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">Robbery, a common law offense in Maryland, is grand or petit larceny from the person of another by violence.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The violence may be actual as by the application of physical force or constructive as by the putting in fear. It is only in the absence of actual violence that putting in fear is required. Conversely, if actual violence accompanies the larceny, it is not necessary that the victim be placed in fear. <em>Giles v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 721, 723. See <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 598, 603, note 2. To constitute robbery, the actual or constructive violence must precede or accompany the larceny. <em>Cooper v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 478, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>480. See <em>Douglas v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 647, 653. \u201cBlackstone, to emphasize that for robbery the larceny must be accomplished by violence or intimidation, said: \u2018for if one privately steals sixpence from the person of another, and afterwards keeps it by putting him in fear, this is no robbery, for the fear is subsequent * * \u201d <em>Perkins on Criminal Law, </em>2d Ed., p. 283, quoting 4 Bl. Comm. 242. So if the two transactions are essentially distinct\u2014 if subsequent to the larceny the owner should come upon the thief and be prevented from retaking his property by violence, the thief would be guilty of larceny and assault, but not robbery. In other words if the violence, actual or constructive, is part of the <em>res gestae </em>of the larceny the offense is elevated to the category of robbery. Id., at 284. See <em>Clark &amp; Marshall, Law of Crimes, </em>7th Ed., \u00a7 12.13, pp. 890-891; 2 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure </em>(Anderson), \u00a7 559, pp. 263-265.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">This Court has consistently applied the modern doctrine of merger of offenses, the test being whether one crime necessarily involves the other. <em>Chittum v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 205. So if an accused is convicted of both the robbery and the assault and battery of a person and the proof of the assault and battery was necessary to establish the force required to constitute robbery the assault and battery would merge into the robbery. We recognize that a person should not be twice punished for the same acts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This would come to pass if the assault and battery were part of the <em>res gestae </em>of the larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Howard M. Smith, Sr., \u201ca retired government agent,\u201d helped his wife operate a \u201clittle grocery store\u201d located on the premises in which they lived in Havre de Grace. On 29 July 1968, about 5:30 P.M., his wife was in the kitchen with a neighbor and he was reading a paper in the living room. The opening of the door to the store activated a device which sounded a buzzer in the kitchen. Smith heard the buzzer \u201cgo off\u201d and went into the store. At first he did not see anyone \u2014 \u201cas a rule some of the smaller kids, they hide in back of the counter\u201d \u2014 so he walked back of the counter toward the cash register. He saw two people. One \u201cwas creeping out there\u201d towards the store entrance. The other was \u201cstooped down\u201d in front of the cash register and he \u201craised up and conked me.\u201d Smith was hit twice about the head with what appeared to be a piece of garden hose stuffed with lead. He was knocked unconscious by the blows and the next thing he remembered was being in the hospital. \u201cMy both jaws were broken and I couldn\u2019t see, couldn\u2019t swallow.\u201d He spent three weeks in the hospital. Over $200 was stolen. Mrs. Smith went into the store from the kitchen when she heard the continuous buzzing of the warning device. Her husband was on the floor unconscious; the robbers had fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">We find this evidence sufficient in law to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>of the robbery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We so find because we believe that it was a rational inference that the assault on Smith and the beating of him constituted the violence which accompanied the larceny of the money and elevated the offense to robbery. This was the only assault and battery of Smith shown, and it was necessarily part of the <em>res gestae </em>of the larceny. Therefore upon conviction of the robbery, the assault and battery merged therein and the judgment under the 5th count of the indictment must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>be vacated. The result is that appellant is subject to a term of imprisonment of 10 years rather than 15 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\n<em>EVIDENCE OF IDENTIFICATION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Smith made a positive judicial identification of appellant as the felon who struck him. This evidence came in without challenge. On cross-examination it was elicited that he had made an identification of appellant from photographs shown him by the police while he was in the hospital. He said he only remembered seeing three pictures of the three people who were involved but he remarked that \u201cI was just under the dope that they gave me for pain and I really never paid too much attention to them.\u201d On re-direct examination he said that he knew that appellant was the one who hit him and that there was no question at all about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Appellant called Sergeant Warner L. Taylor, of the Police Department in Havre de Grace. The officer said he did not show Smith photographs in the hospital but did show them to him on 4 September 1968. There were six photographs. \u201cI showed him the photographs all at one time and he picked number one photograph as the \u2014 he said that that was the one that beat him. The subject\u2019s name on the photograph was Douglas McAndrew Brooks. He picked out photograph number six as the one that took the money from the cash register. Number six photograph was Ronald Gray. * * * I picked photographs out that were fairly close together.\u201d He obtained them from the police files and we think it obvious when he said he picked out those \u201cthat were fairly close together\u201d that he meant those which depicted men who resembled each other. The officer described Smith\u2019s appearance in September: \u201cHe was still in a considerable amount of pain. Both sides of his jaw was still wired up at that time. A considerable amount of swelling had went down in his face, but his eyes were still \u2014 he gave the appearance of a severe beating.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On further examination of the officer it was clearly brought out that Smith had identified ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>pellant as being in the store when the robbery was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Appellant now contends that the in-court identification of him by Smith was inadmissible because it was tainted by an illegal photographic identification procedure and because the State was unable \u201cto reconstruct the original photographic identification.\u201d Not only was there no pre-trial motion to suppress the evidence now challenged and no objection when it was received, but there was no motion to strike it when it became apparent' that there had been an extrajudicial identification from photographs. Therefore the question of the admissibility of the judicial identification is not before us. And there is no question presented as to admissibility of any extrajudicial identification since this was not introduced by the State as corroborative of the judicial identification or as independent substantive evidence of identification. See <em>Smith and Samuels v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 59. That there had been an extrajudicial identification was properly brought out by appellant, but the facts and circumstances concerning it went only to the credibility of the identifying witness and to the weight of his judicial identification rather than its admissibility. The credibility of the witness and the weight to be given his judicial identification were matters for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Appellant did not make an issue below of the fact that the photographs had been lost. Not tried and decided below on the question of the admissibility of the judicial identification, the matter is not before us on appeal. Maryland Rule 1085. However, in the circumstances, we do not think that the loss of the photographs would compel the exclusion of the judicial identification. The evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>dence adduced indicated that the photographic viewing procedure was not so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification and that it was legally conducted. And it may be, although we need not decide it, that the judicial identification was shown to have a source independent of the extrajudicial viewing in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\n<em>THE ADMISSION OF THE STATEMENT OF A WITNESS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Appellant was jointly indicted with one Oran Thomas. He was separately tried and found not guilty at a bench trial had prior to the trial of appellant. At appellant\u2019s trial he was called to testify on behalf of the State. He said he went to Smith\u2019s store with appellant and a Ronnie Sconion on 29 July 1968 about 5:30 P.M. Sconion and appellant went in the store. He did not know why they went in the store and he left before they came out, going to the Duck \u2014 \u201cThe Duck in Youth Club on Revolution Street.\u201d Appellant and Sconion came to the Club and then the three of them went to Aberdeen by bus and caught a cab to Perryman where Sconion lived. They went to a shack in the woods and \u201cwe just counted the money.\u201d Thomas did not get any. Then they went to Sconion\u2019s house, remained about 25 minutes and went back to Havre de Grace. They went to a shed back of \u201cthis church\u201d and hid some money. Thomas went home and was picked up by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Sergeant Taylor testified for the State prior to the testimony of Thomas. He said he talked to Thomas. What Thomas said was not elicited by the State. On cross-examination defense counsel probed into the circumstances of the talk with Thomas. It was brought out on his inquiry that the officer talked to Thomas alone and later in the presence of Thomas\u2019 father; that before the father\u2019s arrival he denied being involved at all and continued to assert in the presence of his father that he knew nothing about what happened. There came a time, that same night, however, when he did admit being involved in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>crime, admitting the participation of three boys, including himself. On re-direct examination the officer testified without objection that Thomas admitted being involved in the crime and that he gave a written statement. He identified a document shown him by the State as the statement given, said that he asked the questions and that they were answered by Thomas and that the statement was the basis that he had that Thomas admitted being involved. The State offered the statement, apparently with respect to Thomas\u2019 involvement in the crime, the prosecutor stating, \u201cI think it\u2019s a matter of interpretation which is up to the jury to decide.\u201d Appellant objected to it. The objection was overruled and the statement was admitted. It was read to the jury. The prosecutor asked Taylor, \u201cThis is the basis that you say he confessed to it.\u201d Taylor answered, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Appellant was clearly attempting to attack Thomas\u2019 credibility by eliciting from Taylor on cross-examination that Thomas admitted being involved in the crime. Appellant, having brought up the issue, could not then object to the introduction of the statement made by Thomas on which Taylor based his assertion that Thomas admitted being involved. We agree that it was for the jury to decide in weighing the evidence and determining Thomas\u2019 credibility whether or not Thomas admitted being involved in the crime. The best evidence of what he admitted was what he said and the best evidence of what he said was the statement signed by him. We point out that Thomas was ultimately called by the State, testified without objection in substance to what was contained in the statement and was cross-examined at length by appellant. We find no reversible error in the admission of the statement. See <em>Shotkosky v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 492; <em>Sutton v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 285. Compare <em>Bruton vUnited States, </em>391 U. S. 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\n<em>THE ADMISSION OF TANGIBLE EVIDENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AElr\">As part of its case the State introduced over objection a straight razor found at the scene of the crime by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>investigating officers. It was adduced that the razor was not the property of Smith. He said he had not seen it before the trial and Mrs. Smith said she had not seen it prior to the crime. We find it was admissible not only as a part of the crime scene but because of its probative value in establishing appellant\u2019s criminal agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The Ronnie Sconion said by Thomas to have entered the store with appellant was Ronald Edward Sconion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He was called to testify on behalf of the State. He described the commission of the crime succinctly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201cWell, me and Ronnie [Gray] come up behind the counter and Ronnie just hit the man and I went in the cash register and took the money and I told him to come on and we left and ran out of the store.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">He was shown the razor by the prosecutor and was asked if he could identify it. He said: \u201cThat looks like I seen it before. I don\u2019t know for sure if it\u2019s the same one.\u201d He had seen it before \u201cdown the park * * * My brother had it first * * * And then Ronnie [Gray] asked to see it and then I guess he forgot to give it back to my brother or my brother forgot to ask him or something.\u201d The real test of admissibility is the connection of the fact proved with the offense charged, as evidence which has a natural tendency to establish the fact at issue should be admitted. <em>Stewart v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 309, 317. As to the question of the connection between the defendant and the evidence, probability is the only requirement, and if there is any doubt, it goes to the weight and not to the admissibility of the evidence. <em>Hebb v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 145. The razor went directly to a main issue, the criminal agency of appellant, and was relevant and material. In any event even the admission in evidence of any fact collateral to the main issue is ordinarily within the discretion of the trial court and all reasonable presumptions necessary to uphold its rulings will be indulged. <em>Stewart </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number><em>v. State, supra, </em>at 317. We hold that the lower court did not err in admitting the razor.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\n<em>THE RECORD TRANSMITTED ON APPEAL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJBq\">In preparation for trial the prosecutor requested Sergeant Taylor to prepare \u201ca plan showing the layout of the store.\u201d It was not to scale and merely represented \u201cthe general location of the various things in the store on the one side and the streets on the other\u201d as of 29 July 1968. It was admitted in evidence expressly without objection and referred to from time to time in the examination of the witnesses. The index to the record sent to us states that this exhibit was \u201cRETAINED.\u201d Appellant claims that he has been \u201cprecluded from full and meaningful review of his trial and conviction\u201d because this exhibit was not transmitted with the record. We have held that it is the responsibility of the appellant to include in the record a transcript of all the testimony, Rule 1026 c 2, as well as all other matters and issues which he desires this Court to review on appeal. <em>White v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 51, 54. See <em>Johnson v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 327, 333-334; <em>Anderson v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 532, 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In any event we can declare that we were in nowise hindered in our consideration of the questions presented on appeal by the absence of the exhibit omitted. We hold the failure to include it with the record is not ground for reversal in the circumstances.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\n<em>As to indictment no. 3502: Judgment under third count (robbery) affirmed;</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\n<em>Judgment under fifth count (assault and battery) vacated, the offense thereunder merging into the conviction under the third count.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\n<em>APPENDIX A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\n<em>SUBJECT OR SUBJECT NOT UNDER ARREST</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AS1r\">I, Oran Thomas, make the following statement freely and voluntarily to Cpl W.
