Hendren was elected sergeant of the city of Norfolk, for three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>years; and on the 29th of the same month he executed his official bond in the penalty of $30,000, that being the amount fixed by the court; with J. Hendren, J. Hardy Hendren and three others as his sureties. The condition of the bond reciting that Hendren had been elected sergeant of the city of Norfolk for the term of three years, provides that if he shall faithfully discharge the duties of his said office, *then the obligation to be void; else to remain in full force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-6\">On the 29th of December 1855, the justices having been summoned and a majority of them being present, for the purpose of examining into the official bond of Wm. T. Hendren, sergeant of the city, for the faithful discharge of the duties of his office, it was ordered that said Hendren, at the next term of the court, execute a new bond in the penalty of $60,000, with security for the due and faithful discharge of the duties of his office as sergeant. And on the 29th of January 1856 he executed the bond with Thomas J. Corprew and seven others, as his sureties, with the same condition as the \u00abfirst bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-7\">On the 21st of November 1855 the estate of Mary Boyle was committed to Hendren, the sergeant, for administration; and he settled his account before the court of probate, which showed a balance of $514.99 in his hands on the 21st of November 1856.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-8\">In 1870 Ann Boyle and others, the next of kin and distributees of Mary Boyle, deceased, filed their bill in the Corporation court of Norfolk against the administrator of Hendren, and his sureties in both his bonds, setting out the foregoing facts; stating that Hendren died leaving no estate for the payment of his debts, and praying for the payment of the said sum of $514.99, with interest, by the defendants, or such of them as the court might decide to be legally liable therefor; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-9\">Thomas J. Corprew and some others of the sureties in the second bond of Hendren, answered, and denied their liability, on the grounds: first, that the second bond was executed without authority of law, and therefore null and void; and, second, that all the moneys received by Hendren was received by him before the *second bond was required by the court or executed by the sureties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-11\">It appears from the account settled before the court of probate, that all the moneys received by Hendren on account of Mary Boyle\u2019s estate, was received on or prior to the 5th of December 1855; though the principal payments by him were between that date and February 11th, 1856.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-12\">The final decree in the cause was made on the 17th of June 1871, when the court held that the sureties in both bonds were liable for the amount due by Hendren the sergeant, and decreed that they should pay to the plaintiffs the sum of $514.99, with interest from the 21st of November 1856 till paid, and their costs.

T. Hendren, sergeant of the city of Norfolk, and his sureties, on the 29th January 1856, is a valid bond; and 2d, if valid, whether the sureties in said bond are equally bound with the sureties in' a former bond executed by said Hendren as sergeant, on the 29th June 1854, for moneys which came into his hands belonging to the appellees, in December 1855.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-18\">Chapter 49, section 2, of the Code 1860, contains the following provision: \"From every person elected sheriff of any county or corporation, and from every *sergeant of a corporation who is the collector of taxes assessed therein, the court of such county or corporation shall take bond in such penalty as it may deem sufficient; not less than thirty thousand nor more than ninety thousand dollars: provided, that the penalty of the bond of the sheriff of the city of Richmond shall be not less than five hundred thousand dollars.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b105-21\">It appears that Wm. T. Hendren was elected sergeant of the city of Norfolk on the 24th June 1854, and on the 29th June 1854 entered into and acknowledged a bond in the penalty of thirty thousand dollars, before the corporation court of said city, with certain securities therein named, conditioned according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-22\">On the 26th day of December 1855, the following order was entered in the said Corporation court of the city of Norfolk: \u201cIt appearing to the satisfaction of the court, that the order made on the 26th instant, directing that all the acting justices of the city be summoned to attend court to-day, for the purpose of examining into the official bond of Wm. T. Hendren, sergeant of this city, for the due and faithful discharge of the duties of his office of sergeant as aforesaid, has been duly executed, a majority of the justices being present, and the matter being duly considered; and the court being of opinion that the bond heretofore given by the said Wm. T. Hendren, as sergeant as aforesaid, was in a sum insufficient, it is ordered, that the said Wm. T. Hendren, sergeant as aforesaid, at the next term of the court, execute a new bond, in the penalty of $60,000, with security for the due and faithful discharge of the duties of his office as sergeant as aforesaid.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b105-23\">It is insisted by the learned counsel for the appellants, that this action of the Corporation court was without authority of law; and that the Court having before fixed the penalty of the bond at the sum of $30,000, *and the sergeant having executed that bond with security as required, the powers of the court were exhausted in that act; and having once exercised its jurisdiction, is functus officio as to that matter: that, therefore, the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>bond executed by Hendren and his securities, in conformity with the above order, is of no validity whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">It requires but a slight consideration to see that such a construction of the statute referred to would lead to the most inconvenient and disastrous results. The term of office is three years. Suppose it should happen, as it often may, that after the penalty is fixed and the bond given, there is a material change in the condition of things: the court finds that the public levies have doubled or quadrupled, or that large sums of money are to be raised by executions ; and these public levies and other moneys which will come into the hands of the sergeant, exceed in amount the penalty of the bond given: Or, suppose it turns out that the court has been imposed upon and deceived as to the sureties offered by the sergeant, and they prove to be men of straw, that both sergeant and sureties have all become insolvent; yet, according to the theory of the appellants\u2019 counsel the court is powerless to act, because it has exhausted its jurisdiction by taking one bond; though the penalty be entirely insufficient, or the securities utterly insolvent: and thus the revenues of the corporation must be squandered, the money of creditors lost, and the estates of dead men wasted, because the bond affords no remedy for their protection. A construction fraught with so great mischief, ought not to be given, unless the law speaks a plain and unmistakable mandate. In the absence of prohibitory language in the statute, such a construction ought not to prevail. But there is no such prohibitory language in the statute. It declares that the *county or corporation court \u201cshall take bond in such penalty as it may deem sufficient, not less than thirty thousand nor more than ninety thousand. \u2019 \u2019 The only limit on the power of the court is, that the penalty of the bond shall not be more than ninety thousand dollars, nor less than thirty thousand dollars. Between these two amounts any amount which the court may deem sufficient shall be the penalty of the bond. Nor is there anything in this section, or elsewhere, which declares, that this discretion as to the amount within certain limits, shall be exercised only once during the term of office of the sergeant. What might be deemed a sufficient penalty at the commencement of the office might well be deemed insufficient a year after-wards. In. this case, on the 29th day of June 1854, the Corporation court of Norfolk deemed sufficient a bond in the penalty of $30,000. Afterwards, jn December 1855, that penalty was deemed insufficient, and a bond in the penalty of $60,000 was required. We must presume that after the lapse of eighteen months there was some reason known to the court, why the penalty should be increased. It was done upon full notice, after summoning all the acting justices of the city, \u201cfor the. purpose (as expressed in the order) of examining into the official bond of Wm. T. Hendren; and the matter being duly considered, and the court being of opinion that the bond heretofore given by said Wm. T. Hendren as sergeant, &amp;c., was in a sum insufficient, it is ordered, &amp;c. \u201d Now upon what principles of construction can it be maintained, that the fact, that on the 29th June 1854, the court \u201cdeemed\u201d the penalty of the bond fixed at $30,000 sufficient, could restrict the power of the court on the 29th of December 1855, when for satisfactory reasons it \u201cdeemed\u201d that penalty insufficient? I think it is clear, that from the very necessity of the case, as *well as upon a fair and reasonable interpretation of the legislative will expressed in the statute, the court had the authority from time to time, upon proper cause shown, to increase the penalty of the bond to any amount not exceeding $90,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The second bond executed by Hendren and his sureties, being a valid bond, under the 2d section, chap. 49, Code 1860, it only remains to enquire which of the sureties are liable for the amount in controversy in this suit; whether the sureties in the first bond or those in the second bond, or both. The court below held that all the sureties in both bonds were equally liable. In this opinioni I fully concur. It is a maxim adopted by courts of equity in regard to co-sureties, that equality is equity among persons standing in the same situation. It is well settled that, if different persons are sureties for the same debt, or for the performance of the same duties, each will be made, in equity, to contribute, though they be bound by different bonds, and though they knew nothing at the time of the obligations of each other. 1 Lead. Cases in Equity, (edition of 1859,) p. 131, Note, and cases there cited. See also Harrison v. Lane, 5 Leigh, 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">In the case before us, the sureties in each bond are bound for the same obligations, for the performance of the same duties on the part of their principal. The condition of each bond is precisely the same. That condition is, that Wm. T. Hendren, who was duly elected on the 24th day of June 1854 sergeant of the city of Norfolk, \u201cshall faithfully discharge the duties of his said office.\u201d The breach of duty in this case was his failure to pay over to the appellees moneys which came into his hands as such sergeant. For this all of his sureties are equally bound. It does not alter the case or change their liability, that the money came into his hands, before the ^second bond was given. It was properly in his hands; it was his right and duty to receive it; and he received it about twenty days before the second bond was given. The breach of his obligation was, in not paying it over to the parties entitled to receive it; and it is for this that all of his sureties are alike and equally responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">The claim for contribution among co-sureties is founded not upon contract, but upon a principle of natural justice and equity. This principle has been uniformly declared by the courts of England and this country since the leading case of Deering v. Earl of Winchelsea, 1 Cox\u2019s R. 308, decided in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>1787 and followed ever since. That case is exactly in point here. Thomas Denny was appointed collector of duties belonging to the customs ; and it became necessary, upon his appointment, to enter into bonds to the Crown, with three securities, for the due performance of his office; the same obligation as in the case before us. Three separate bonds were executed with different sureties. One of them to which Sir Edward Denny was security, was put in suit by the Crown, for certain default on the part of Thomas Deering the principal, and judgment recovered for \u00bf3,883. Sir Edward Denny filed his bill against the Earl of Winchelsea, and Sir John Rand, the sureties in the other two bonds, claiming from them a contribution towards the sum so recovered against him. It was held that where sureties are bound by different instruments, but for the same principal, and the same engagement, they shall contribute. Eord Chief Baron Eyre said \u201ccontribution between co-sureties is bottomed and fixed on general principles of justice, and does not spring from contract. \u201d * * * \u201cIt is clear that one surety may compel a contribution from *another towards payment of a debt for which they are jointly bound. On what principle? Can it be necessary to resort to the circumstance of a joint bond? What if they are jointly and severally bound? What difference does it make if they are severally bound and bjT different instruments, but for the same principal, and the same engagement? In all these cases the sureties have a common interest and a common burthen; they are joined by the common end and purpose of their several obligations, as much as if they were joined in one and the same instrument.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">This may be considered as the settled doctrine of courts of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Nor is the case of Harrison v. Lane, 5 Leigh, 414, cited by the counsel for the appellee, at all in opposition to this view; but expressly affirms the principle I have asserted. The decision in that case, turned upon an endorsement which was made on the second bond limiting the liability of the sureties; and which was considered by the court as a part of the bond itself. Both Judge Cabell and Judge Carr, as well as President Tucker, (all of whom delivered opinions in the case), recognize distinctly the principle laid down in Deering v. Earl of Winchelsea ; for they all say, in substance, that in the case before them, if the sureties in the second bond were bound for the same thing for which the sureties in the first bond were bound, they would be liable for contribution, although their engagement was made at a subsequent time and by a different instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Upon the whole case I am of opinion that the decree of the Corporation court of the city of Norfolk should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AyU\">*Moncure P., Anderson and Staples Js., concurred in the opinion of Christian J.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">Bouldin J., dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
