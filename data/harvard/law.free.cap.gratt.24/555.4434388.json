The offence for which she \"was prosecuted is declared by the Code, chapter 192, section 14, as amended and reenacted, *first by the act passed February 20, 1866, Acts of 1865-6, p. 89, chap. 23, and again by the act passed March 1, 1867, acts of 1866-67, p. 709, chap. 283, which is in these words :</p>\n<p id=\"b194-17\">\u201c\u00a7 14. If any person steal from the person of another money or. other thing, of the value of five dollars or more, he shall be guilty of grand larceny, and be confined in the penitentiary for a period not less than five nor more than ten years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-18\">The indictment strictly pursued the terms of the statute, and was. good in form and substance. It charged the larceny of divers notes of the national currency of, the United States, .the same being United States treasury notes, the number and.denomination of which were to the grand . jurors unknown, for the payment of divers sums of money, in the whole amounting to the sum of six dollars, and of the value of six dollars; and divers other notes, &amp;c. (describing them differently), the property and notes of one Alfred Jasper, the said sum of six dollars, &amp;c., being then and there due and unsatisfied to the said Alfred Jasper, from the person and against the will of the said Alfred Jasper.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-21\">The jury found the accused guilty, and ascertained the term of her confinement in the penitentiary at five years. She moved the court to set aside the verdict and grant her a new trial, upon the ground that the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence; which motion the court overruled; and she excepted to the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-22\">The facts proved on the trial are certified in the bill of exceptions, and are as follows: \u201cThat Alfred Jasper was standing upon Cary street, in the city of Richmond, and was holding some money, six dollars, in his open hand, and was counting it, and that Mahala Johnson, the prisoner, came by and took the money out of his hand *and walked off; he asked her for it and several times begged her to return it to him as she walked off; that no force beyond what was necessary to withdraw the money was used; and that finding she would not return the money, and wishing to keep the peace, he went immediately to the station-house near by and got a warrant for her arrest, which was shortly afterwards executed upon the prisoner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-25\">The only error in the judgment assigned in the petition for a writ of error is, that, by the laws of Virginia, the offence of which the prisoner stands convicted cannot be considered larceny from the person. \u201cFor in this State\u201d (she proceeds to say in her petition) \u201cthat offence is divided into two classes, viz: \u2018privately stealing,\u2019 and \u2018open and violent assault, commonly called robbery. \u2019 And your petitioner is advised that the statute under which she was indicted was not designed for such cases as the one of which she was convicted, but for the cases of those commonly known as \u2018pickpockets,\u2019 who properly come under the first class mentioned, i. e., \u2018privately stealing.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-26\">There is no such offence known to the law of Virginia as \u201cprivate\u201d stealing, from the person of another or otherwise. The law makes no distinction between private and public stealing, except that robbery must, of necessity, be committed publicly. But it is not pretended that the offence in this case was robbery, and therefore nothing further need be said here as to the nature of that crime. There is nothing in our law on the subject of \u201cpickpockets.\u201d The \u2019aw on which this prosecution is founded uses plain language: \"If any person steal from the person of another money or other thing,\" &amp;c. The charge here is in the very words of the statute, of stealing \u2018 \u2018from the person of another,\u201d and the proof corresponds literally with this charge in regard to stealing from the person of *another. It is, that money to the amount and value of six dollars, belonging to the pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>ecutor, and in his hands, was, by the prisoner, taken therefrom and carried away. Whether she did it animo furandi or not was a question which belonged to the jury, and they decided it against the prisoner, and the court below refused to set aside their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">There is a similar statute to ours in Massachusetts against \u201cstealing from the person of another,\u201d from which, probably, our statute was taken, in defining the offence. That statute was construed by the Supreme court of that State in the Commonwealth v. Dimond, 3 Cush. R., 235, in which it was held, that \u201cto constitute the offence of larceny \u2018by stealing from the person,\u2019 within the Rev. Sts., c. 126, \u00a7 16, it is not necessary that the taking should be either openly or violently, or privily and fraudulently; but if it be with the knowledge, though without the dissent or resistance of the owner, the offence is equally committed, provided the taking be with an intention, on the part of the offender, to deprive the owner of his property.\u201d Shaw, C. J., delivered the opinion of the court in that case, in which \u201cit was argued that the act of the defendant, although admitted to be a larceny, is not a stealing from the person, within the meaning of the statute, and that, to make it a stealing from the person, it must either be done openly and against the consent of the party, or privily and without his knowledge. But it must be considered, \u201d said the Chief Justice, \u201cthat the law is somewhat altered in terms in the revised statutes, from the pre-existing law in the statute of 1804, c. 143, \u00a7 8, in which the words are: \u2018larceny from the person of another, either openly and violently, or privily a nd fraudulently, \u2019 implying that the act must be the one or the other. The language of the Revised Statutes, c. 126, <em>\u00a7 </em>16, is simply: \u2018larceny by stealing from the person *of another. \u2019 The case is within the letter of the present statute, and the court are of opinion that it is equally within its spirit and purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">That case goes further than ours in support of the view which we have presented; for there the old statute on the subject had been different in its terms, and it was argued that while the terms were altered the substance was not intended to be changed. If this case had occurred under the Massachusetts law no question would have been raised as to its coming within the statute, as the offence here was committed openly and against the consent of the party. The great question in that case was, whether the act could be said to be done against the consent of the owner, when the evidence only was that he did not express any assent or dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">But this very question has already, in effect, been decided by this court, in refusing a writ of error to a judgment which was rendered by the Corporation court for the city of Lynchburg on the 12th day of April 1873, in the case of the Commonwealth against Hardwicke. The accused in that' case was indicted under the statute in question for grand larceny in stealing a five-dollar note, the property of John Brooks, from the person of the said John Brooks, and was found guilty. A motion was made to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial; which was overruled, and a bill of exceptions was taken to the opinion of the court. It appeared from the facts proved on the trial, which were certified in the bill, that while the said Brooks was holding in his hand a five-dollar note which he was showing to the accused, the latter seized it and ran off with it; that the said Birookd pursued the prisoner, and with the aid of a policeman, whom he happened to meet in the street, he captured the accused and re-covered the money. The accused applied *to this court for a writ of error to the judgment; and the principal error assigned in his petition was, that the offence proved was not such -a one as the statute contemplated, it being contended that the statute was intended to apply only to pickpockets or to those who steal from the person of another secretly. But this court unanimously refused to grant a writ of error in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">If, therefore, the error assigned in the petition were the only ground for reversing the judgment we would have to affirm it. But, after this case had been submitted to the decision of the court upon the petition, the counsel for the plaintiff in error appeared in court, and in the presence of the attorney-general, assigned, ore tenus, an additional error in the judgment, viz: that the subject charged in the indictment to have been stolen consists of United States treasury notes and National Bank notes, whereas the subject stolen, as described in the certificate of facts contained in the bill of exceptions, was money, six dollars; it not appearing from the said certificate that-the said money was such money as is described in the indictment; and, therefore, the jury were not warranted by the facts proved in finding a verdict against the prisoner. We have considered this additional assignment of error, and think it ought to be sustained. It is very probable that the money referred to in the certificate of facts was not specie, but consisted of such notes as are described in the indictment; and that the omission to certify that fact proceeded from a mere oversight, arising from an idea of the court that the only object of the prisoner in taking the bill of exceptions was to bring up to this court for decision the question presented by the petition for a writ of error. However that may be, the bill of exceptions purports to contain a certificate of all the facts proved on the trial; and we can look only to *that certificate to ascertain what facts were so proved. Looking to that certificate for the facts, it does not appear that the offence proved by the evidence was the same offence charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">We are therefore of opinion that upon that ground the court below ought to have set aside the verdict and granted a new trial, and that for not having done so the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>judgment is erroneous and ought to be reversed, the verdict set aside, and the cause remanded for a new trial to lie had therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The judgment was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AUs\">The court is of opinion, for reasons stated in writing and filed with the record, that to constitute the offence of grand larceny in stealing from the person of another money or other thing of the value of five dollars or more, created by the Code, chapter 192, section 14, as amended and re-enacted, first by the act passed February 20, 1866 (Acts of 1865-6, p. 89, chap. 23), and again by act passed March 1, 1867 (Acts of 1866-7, p. 709, chap. 283), it is not necessary that the thing shall be stolen privately. But the court is further of opinion that as it does not appear from the facts certified in the bill of exceptions, that the subject proved to have been stolen by the plaintiff in error from the person of another in this case consisted of United States treasury notes or national bank notes, which are the subject charged in the indictment to have been stolen, there is an apparent variance between the allegata and the probata, and the judgment is, on that ground, erroneous. Therefore it is considered that the same be reversed and annulled; and it is ordered that the verdict of the jury be set aside and the cause remanded for a new trial to be had therein.</p>\n<p id=\"AW8\">*Which is ordered to be certified- to the said Hustings court of the city of Richmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">LARCENY.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">I.

Com. v. Gaines, 2 Va. Cas. 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-22\">Offence Committed in Another County.\u2014All the writers at common law, lay it down, that, if goods be stolen in one county, and carried into another, the offender may be indicted in either, because the offence is complete in both.

Com., 1 Rob. 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-27\">Allegation of Jurisdiction.\u2014It is error for the circuit court to refuse to set aside the verdict of the jury when there is no evidence in the record showing the offense was committed within its jurisdiction. Hoover v. State, 1 W. Va. 336; Va. Code 1887, \u00a7 3999; W. Va. Code 1899, ch. 158, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-28\">Jurisdiction of Corporation Courts.\u2014Corporation courts, in cities or towns containing a population of five thousand, have the same jurisdiction, by act of assembly approved April 2, 1870, to try offences committed within their respective limits, that either the circuit or county courts have to try offences within their jurisdiction. Nor was this power taken away by act of April 2, 1873, to regulate jurisdiction of county and circuit courts. Dull v. Com., 25 Gratt. 965-86. (1875.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-29\">Under 1 Rev. Code, p. 246, ch. 71, \u00a7 7, a county or corporation court had no jurisdiction to try an indictment for petit larceny which alleged a previous conviction for a similar offence. Rider v.

Code 1849; Thomas v. Com., 22 Gratt. 912; Va. Code. 1887, \u00a7 3907; Miller v. Com., 88 Va. 618, 14 S. E. Rep. 161; Brown v. Epps, 91 Va. 726, 21 S. E. Rep. 119; Wolverton v.

FORM OF INDICTMENT.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-33\">Idem Sonans.\u2014Whether or not two or more names are <em>idem </em>sonans, may be determined by the court upon amere comparison, where the issue is free from doubt; but the modem and approved practice is to submit the question to a jury wherever there is doubt on the question. In this case \u201cBolen\u201d was held <em>idem sonans </em>with \u201cBolden.\" Pitsnogle v. Com., 91 Va. 808, 22 S. E. Rep. 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-34\">Consent.\u2014An indictment for taking and removing a slave from one county to another, with intent to defraud the owner,should state thatsuch taking and removing was without the consent of the owner. Com. v. Peas, 2 Gratt. 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-35\">Misjoinder.\u2014It is not error on an indictment for larceny, to state the incidental circumstances of the crime in various ways to meet the varying phases of proof. Nor will the court in such case compel the prosecutor to elect a single count on which to try the prisoner. Dowdy v. Com., 9 Gratt. 727; Hausenfluck v. Com., 85 Va. 702, 8 S. E. Rep. 683; Anthony v. Com., 88 Va. 847, 14 S. E. Rep. 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Obtaining money or other property by false pretences with intent to defraud is made larceny by statute, if the property so obtained may be the subject of larceny: and it is. therefore, not misjoinder to add such a count to a count for simple larceny. Anthony v. Com., 88 Va. 847, 14 S. E. Rep. 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Where several articles of property are stolen at the same time and place, though the stolen goods belong to different persons, the stealing is regarded as one transaction, and, therefore, as one offence which may be charged in a single count. Alexander v. Com., 90 Va. 809. 20 S. E. Rep. 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">It was not misjoinder for an indictment to charge in one count a conspiracy to commit larceny and in another count charge the larceny in accordance with the conspiracy. Anthony v. Com., 88 Va. 847, 14 S. E. Rep. 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Conclusion of Indictment. \u2014 Where the statute neither creates the offence, nor adds a new penalty, but only takes away some benefit which the common law allowed the prisoner the indictment need not conclude <em>\u201ccontra formam </em>statuti.\" Certainly such omission is cured after verdict by the statute of jeofails. Chiles v. Com., 2 Va. Cas. 260; Va. Code 1887, \u00a7 3999; Va. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 26; W. Va. Const., art. II. \u00a7 8; Lemons v. State. 4 W.

Cas. 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">False Pretences.\u2014 An indictment for obtaining money under false pretences, which by Va. Code 1860. p. 796, \u00a7 49 (Va. Code 1887, \u00a7 3722) is made larceny, may either be for larceny generally, or for the specific acts which this statute says shall be deemed larceny. Leftwich v. Com., 20 Gratt. 716; Duff v.

Com., 24 Gratt. 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Removal of Goods Distrained.\u2014An indictment for fraudulently removing goods which have been levied on or distrained, which by Va. Code 1887, \u00a7 3712, is made larceny, may either be for larceny generally or in terms of the statute or language equivalent thereto. Duff v. Com., 92 Va. 769, 23 S. E. Rep. 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">Offence Felonious.-Where a felony is charged the indictment should state that the offence was committed feloniously. Barker v. Com., 2 Va. Cas. 122; Dull v. Com., 25 Gratt. 965: State v. Vest, 21 W. Va. 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">Description of Property.\u2014In an indictment under the statute making writings and papers of value the subject of larceny, a description of the papers by the name and designation by which they are usually known, and which properly avers the value thereof, is sufficient. Fredrick v. State, 3 W. Va. 695; Pollard's Supp. 1900, \u00a7 3994.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">A description of bank notes which merely states that they were bank notes current within the United States, was held sufficient. Com. v. Moseley, 2 Va. Cas. 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">But an indictment for obtaining \u201cUnited States currency\u201d by false pretences is not sufficient. There is no law making the stealing of \u201cUnited States currency,\u201d <em>eo </em>nomine, larceny. Such an indictment is too vague. Leftwich v. Com., 20 Gratt. 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-15\">Under act Feb. 28, 1874, amending \u00a7 6 ch. 201, of Code of 1873, an indictment charging the larceny of \u201cUnited States currency\u201d is sufficient. Dull v. Com., 25 Gratt. 965-974; Va. Code 1887, \u00a7 3994.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-16\">In an indictment for stealing certain notes \u201cpurporting on their faces to be, and being notes of banks chartered, etc..\u201d held. the words \u201cand being notes of banks chartered\u201d may be rejected as surplusage, and no proof of such charter is necessary. Pomeroy v. Com., 2 Va. Cas. 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-18\">A charge of larceny of certain paper, of the value of one hundred and ten dollars, without further description thereof is too indefinite. Robinson v. Com., 32 Gratt. 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-19\">Value.\u2014Under the statute making bank notes the subject of larceny no value need be shown. The statute now provides that they shall be deemed to be of the value expressed on their face. Adams v. Com., 23 Gratt. 949; Whalen v. Com., 90 Va. 544, 19 S. E. Rep. 182; Va.

Rep. 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-21\">The substitution of the word \u201cprice\u201d for \u201cvalue\u201d is not fatal to an indictment for larceny. The object of stating the value is merely to determine the grade of the offence, and either is sufficient to give the accused notice of the charge preferred against him State v. Sparks, 30 W. Va. 101, 3 S. E. Rep. 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-22\">III. TAKING AND ASPORTATION.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-23\">In any simple larceny there must be a <em>felonious </em>and complete severance of the property from the possession of the owner thereof, and the thief must have had, at least for an instant of time, complete and absolute control and possession of the stolen property; but where the property has been feloniously taken, the slightest removal, even if it be but a hair\u2019s breadth, with intent to steal the same, is sufficient. State v. Chambers, <em>22 W. </em>Va. 799; Whalen v. Com., 90 Va. 544, 19 S. E. Rep. 182; Wolverton v. Com., 75 Va. 909; Barker v. Com., <em>2 </em>Va. Cas. 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-24\">If by fraud or device the owner (not intending to part with his right) be induced to place his property in the hands of another, who acquires possession with a felonious intent to convert it to his own use, the \u201ctaking\u201d and trespass are such as are required to complete the offence of larceny.

Com., 24 Gratt. 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-25\">It must be shown that the original taking was felonious, but the jury has a right to infer from all the facts and circumstances of the case, the felonious intent in the original taking.

Tanner v. Com., 14 Gratt. 635; Perrin v. Com., 87 Va. 554, 13 S. E. Rep. 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-28\">Bond. \u2014An obligor who obtains possession of his bond by fraud <em>Uteri causa, </em>is guilty of the larceny thereof.

OWNER.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The record of the <em>emminino </em>court need not show that the goods stolen were the property of any person. An <em>indictment </em>should, however, give the name of the owner or \u00e1tate that the goods belong to a person or persons to the jurors unknown; and a statement defective in this respect is not cured by the statute of jeofails. Halkem v. Com., 2 Va. Cas. 4; Mabry v. Com., 2 Va. Cas. 396; Barker v. Com., 2 Va. Cas. 122; Dowdy v. Com., 9 Gratt. 727; Com. v. Moseley, 2 Va.

Thompson v. Com., 2 Va. Cas. 135; Angel v. Com., 2 Va. Cas. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">An indictment for the larceny of a slave, of the goods and chattels of E. E. and out of the possession .of the said E. E. was held not sufficient, it appearing that the slave was hired to B and at the time of the larceny in the actual possession of B. Com. v. Williams, 1 Va. Cas. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">Capacity of Owner.\u2014On an indictment for larceny of property belonging to the President, Director and Go. of the Farmers\u2019 of Virginia, the court, after verdict, is bound to presume, that on the trial the capacity of this company to hold property <em>i. e., </em>the corporate existence, was proved to the jury, or admitted by the prisoner. Lithgow v. Com., 2 Va.Cas. 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">Evidence of Ownership.\u2014Upon an indictment for stealing a horse, it is entirely competent for the commonwealth to establish the ownership of the animal by the son in the absence of the father from the state.

Awas indicted for larceny of a check given in payment of one of the warrants. <em>Held, </em>since there was sufficient money to A\u2019s credit to pay. that warrant and all registered before it, that A could not be convicted of the larceny charged. Anable v. Com., 24 Gratt. 563,</p>\n<p id=\"b198-17\">VI. EVIDENCE.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-18\">Other Offences.\u2014On indictment for stealing a watch, proof of the theft of a clock is inadmissible.

Com., 32 Gratt. 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-19\">Res Gestas.\u2014On indictment for larceny the commonwealth may prove the presence of the prisoner in the hotel on the night in question, and his acts and conduct therein, not for the purpose of establishing another distinct felony, but as a part of the whole transaction.

Code 1887, \u00a7 3714) an indictment charging the prisoner with receiving a horse, knowing it to have been feloniously stolen, is sufficient to sustain a conviction for the larceny of said animal. Price v. Com., 21 Gratt. 846; Hey v. Com., 32 Gratt. 946; See Va. Code 1887, \u00a7\u00a7 3402, 3712; Pollard\u2019s Supp., \u00a7\u00a7 3715, 3719a.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-21\">In Rutherford v.

Rep. 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-25\">Insanity.\u2014On indictment for larceny the plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d puts the prisoner\u2019s sanity in issue. If at the time of the trial there is reasonable ground to doubt the prisoner\u2019s sanity the trial should be suspended until this question is determined. Gruber v. State, 3 W. Va. 699; Va. Code 1887, \u00a7 4031; W. Va. Code 1899, ch. 159, p. 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-26\">Possession of Evidence.\u2014The mere possession of goods which had been actually lost does not furnish any conclusive or <em>prima facie </em>proof of guilt; of itself it does not raise the suspicion of guilt.

Com., 8 Leigh 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">General Verdict.\u2014A general verdict on an indictment for a misdemeanor Is not a conviction of a felony though the offence is charged to have been done \u201cfeloniously.\u201d The word \u201cfeloniously\u201d in such case is only used to characterize the intent with which the taking and carrying away were done.

Rep. 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">Punishment for Horse Stealing.\u2014Under acts of 1865-6, p. 88, the minimum punishment for horse stealing was five years.
