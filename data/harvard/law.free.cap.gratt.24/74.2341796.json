The plaintiff in a canse is not a competent witness under the statute, to prove the acts and declarations of a deceased person, under whom the defendants claim.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b90-11\">2. But when the question is whether the acts of such deceased person, in building a dam across a stream, injured the land of the plaintiff, the plaintiff is competent to prove the condition of his land, the character of the stream doing the injury, the effect of the dam on the stream and on the adjacent lands of the plaintiff, and other independent facts, as to which his testimony, if untrue, could be rebutted by others, as readily as by the deceased.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b90-13\">3. The plaintiff\u2019s deposition having been taken, and the defendants having cross-examined him, they can not have the questions and answers on cross-examination, struck out, though they may refer to the acts and declarations of a deceased person, under whom the defendants claim.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b90-15\">4. In an action by F against B for injury to his land by B\u2019s continuing a, dam across a stream which had been erected by a previous owner, the defence of B, is, that of adversary possession by him and those under whom he claims for more than twenty years. To rebut the presumption arising from the possession, F may prove what passed between his agent and M, a former occupant of the premises of B, showing that the agent of B denied the right of M to raise the dam, and that M asked it as a privilege for a short time.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b90-17\">5. Proof of adversary possession for twenty years, such as would create the presumption of a grant, is only presumptive and not conclusive, and may be rebutted by evidence showing that the adversary use and enjoyment relied on, was not acquiesced in, but the right thereto was contested; and any evidence tending to show such resistance, is proper evidence to rebut the presumption.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>6. A witness for the defendant who had been examined on a former trial of the cause, not being able to be present when the case is again tried, sends a written statement of what his evidence would be if he was present, and this is introduced in evidence by the defendant with the consent of the plaintiff. The defendant will not be allowed to prove that the witness has omitted one material fact, testified to by him on his former examination.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b91-4\">7. To rebut the defendant\u2019s evidence of adversary possession for twenty years, under such circumstances as would give him a prescriptive right to a dam across a stream, the record of a suit by the plaintiff against the administrator of a former owner of the premises, under whom the defendant claims, brought within twenty years from the date of the raising of the dam, for the injury sustained by the same, and in which the plaintiff recovered damages, is competent evidence for the plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b91-6\">8. Instructions asked by the plaintiff based upon the assumption that there can be no legal dam across a water-course unless established by legal proceedings under the act of assembly, ignoring entirely rights acquired by actual grant, by permission and by presumptive right derived from long use and enjoyment, where there is any evidence in respect to such rights, were properly refused.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b91-8\">9. The fact that a dam was built in 1824 by G, and that from that time he and those claiming undej?'him have claimed and held the possession and use thereof and of the water power on the stream afforded by said dam and used in working the mill for the use of which it was built, adversely and uninterruptedly as to the plaintiff and those under whom he claims, for twenty years from the building of the dam, is not conclusive of the right of the defendant to continue said possession and use of said dam and mill; but is only presumptive, and may be rebutted bv circumstances.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b91-10\">10. In 1824 G built a dam across H river, and that did the land of F on H, above the dam, no injury. But in 1845 G raised his dam ; and that did injure the land of F. F suesB who claims under G, for continuing the dam to the injury of his land, and in his declaration recites that G erected the dam without authority of law. Under this declaration F may prove that the dam was raised in 1845, and the injury to his land done by raising it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>In May 1866 Lewis Y. Field brought an action on the ease in the Circuit court of Culpeper, against John Brown and F. T. Brown. The declaration recited that whereas the plaintiff, on the-day of-, 1850, and long before that time, and ever since, was and is the owner of a tract of land of about seven hundred acres, bordering on Hazle river in said county; and one George Ficklin, now deceased, the former owner of the land on said river, just below the lands of the plaintiff, upon which there was a mill seat, erected across the bed of the river a dam-feet in height, and a long abutment on the east side of said river, of-feet in height, without authority of law, and greatly to the injury of the land of the plaintiff, so that the water of the said river was thrown back upon the lands of the plaintiff, whereby the said lands were much debased in value, and some portions of thorn utterly destroyed: And whereas the said defendants, after the erection of the said dam as aforesaid, possessed themselves of the said mill-seat under a claim of title from the heirs at law of the said George Ficklin, dec\u2019d, and have continued the said dam and abutment across the bed of the said river, greatly to the injury of the lands of said plaintiff and the health of his family residing thereon; and the said plaintiff\u2019, after-wards, to wit: on the 6th day of April 1863, notified the said defendants of the illegality of the said obstructions to the water of said river, and required them to remove the same. Nevertheless, the said defendants, well knowing the premises, and having been duly notified in writing, to remove the said obstructions, to wit: on, &amp;c., as appears by a copy of said notice filed herewith, did not remove the same; but intending to injure the plaintiff in the health of his family residing upon said tract of land, and to debase the value of the land, and to destroy the same by refluent water, saturation^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>sobbing, &amp;c., continued the said dam and abutment across the bed and upon the bank of said river, and failed and refused to remove the same: In consequence of which the said plaintiff says be is injured and bath sustained damages to the amount of $5,000. And, therefore, be sues.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-5\">Issue was made up on the plea of \u201cnot guiltyand two trials of the cause were bad in the Circuit court of Culpeper, in 1868, when the juries failed to agree: And the cause was then removed to the Circuit court of Madison county; where it came on again to be tried at a special term of the coui\u2019t held in August 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-6\">In the progress of the trial, it being proved that the plaintiff was old and unable to attend the court, his deposition was offered in evidence on bis behalf. It shows that be was examined for the plaintiff, and then cross-examined by the defendants\u2019 counsel. Upon its being offered in evidence, the defendants excepted to the questions and answers from No. 6 to Ho 20, both inclusive, and to No. 22, and to the last paragraph of the answer Ho. 21, and to the questions and answers Nos. 8, 9, 10, 11 &amp; 12, upon the cross-examination, upon the ground that- George Uicklin, under whom the defendants claimed title, was then dead, and was alive at the time referred to in said questions and answers, and was then the owner of said dam aud mill, and was one of the original parties to the transaction which was the subject of investigation in this suit; and the witness was the plaintiff. And the court sustained the exceptions as to the questions and answers in chief Nos. 6 to 12, and also, Nos. 15, 20, and 22; and to all excepted to asked and answered on the cross examination, and overruled the exception as to Nos. 16, 17, 18, 19 and the last paragraph of the answer to question No. 21. And as to the question and answer 13, the coui\u2019t sustained the exception as to so much of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>question as referred to effects of the present dam, upon the old dam, and to so much of the answer as responded thereto in the following words: \u201c The old dam was submerged by the water from the new dam:\u201d and refused to allow said questions and answers to be read in evidence to the jury. To this opinion of the court both the plaintiff and the defendants excepted. This was the plaintiff\u2019s first exception, and the third of the defendants. \u25a0 Of these questions and answers see the opinion of Judge Bouldin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-10\">In the further progress of the trial the plaintiff introduced Henry S. Field, his son, as a witness, who, during his examination, stated that George Ficklin died in 1852, and after his death one Jamps Mozingo rented the mill; and after stating that he was the agent of his father, and that on one occasion he saw Mozingo,'with several hands, engaged in putting a log about ten or twelve inches thick upon the comb of the dam, and that he forbade him to do it, he was proceeding to state what further passed in conversation between him and Mozingo, at that time, about putting on said log; but the defendants objected to the evidence, and the court sustained the objection. The plaintiff then asked the following question of the witness: At the time referred to, did said Mozingo claim it as a right to put said log across said dam, or simply ask it as a privilege for a short time ? To which question the defendants objected, and moved the court to exclude it: which motion the court sustained. And the plaintiff excepted to both the rulings of the court. This is the plaintiff\u2019s second exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-11\">A witness, Fayette Mauzy, had been examined as a witness by the defendant at a former trial of the cause; and not being able to attend this trial, he sent a certificate of the facts he would prove if he was present, and to prevent a continuance of the cause the plaintiff had con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>sented that the certificate should be read as evidence; which was done; and the defendants then asked to be allowed to examine D. H. Grimsley, one of their counsel, to prove that the said certificate failed to state'one or more facts which Mauzy had deposed to on a previous trial of the case, when examined in person, and which were regarded by the defendants counsel as material for their defence, and to prove what those facts were. To this the plaintiff objected: but complaint of Mauzy\u2019s absence having been frequently made by the defendants, and the said certificate having been frequently alluded to in remarks by counsel upon both sides, in the presence of the jury, the court overruled the plaintiff\u2019s objection in part; and allowed the said Grimsley to prove that the said certificate did not contain one fact deposed to by Mauzy on the previous trial which the defendant\u2019s counsel regarded as material; but refused to allow any enquiry or answer to prove what that fact was. And the plaintiff again excepted. This is his sixth exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-10\">For the purpose of rebutting the testimony introduced by the defendants, tending to prove a prescriptive right to their dam at Gastleton, they having acquired their title from Hobson and Smith, grantees of A. J. Coons and wife, who were heirs at law of Ficklin, the plaintiff offered in evidence the record of the suit of Field v. Ficklin\u2019s adm\u2019r. This was an action on the case in the Circuit court of Rappahannock county, brought by Lewis Y. Field, the plaintiff in the present suit, against Thomas Hill, jr., adm\u2019r of George Ficklin, deceased, to recover damages for the injury to his lands by the same dam ; and in which there was a judgment in favour of the plaintiff. To the introduction of this record as evidence, the defendants objected, on the ground that the record of a suit, or judgment against an administrator was not evidence against an heir or those who are privies to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>heirs, and moved the court to exclude it: which motion the court sustained. And the plaintiff again excepted. is his seventh exception. r</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEC\">After the court had refused to permit the record of the suit of Field v. Ficklin\u2019s adm\u2019r to be introduced as evidence, the plaintiff, called James J. Field, for the purpose of rebutting the testimony of the defendants, tending to prove title by prescription. He proved that he was a practising lawer, resident at Culpeper C. H: And he was then asked by the plaintiff \u201c if he had or had not instituted a suit in the Circuit court of Culpeper for the plaintiff, against A. J. Coons, under whom the defendants claim, to recover damages for continuing the dam in the Hazle river at Castleton; and if so, when said suit was instituted.\u201d To this question the defendants objected, on the ground that a copy of the record of said suit should be produced as the best evidence. But the court overruled the objection, and allowed the question to be asked and answered: the answer being-that he did, as attorney of the plaintiff, in the year 1856 or \u201957, institute suit against A. J. Coons, in the Circuit court of Culpeper; and that the suit was still pending.. And the defendants excepted. This is their fourth exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-10\">After the evidence and arguments of counsel had been fully heard, the plaintiff asked for five instructions,, and the defendants asked for three. But the court refused to give any of the instructions asked for by the-plaintiff', and refused to give the first and third asked for by the defendant; but gave the second, and also gave an additional instruction. All these instructions are set-out at length in the opinion of the court. The plaintiff,, thereupon, excepted to the opinion of the court: and on his motion the court certified the facts and evidence to* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u25a0which the instructions referred. This is the plaintiff\u2019s eighth exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-4\">The material facts and evidence are as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-5\">The plaintiff\u2019 was the owner of a tract of land on Hazle river, in Culpeper county, which he inherited from his father, and has resided thereon ever since about the year 1833. His father had owned and occupied the same for a great many years previous to 1833. This tract contained -acres, the lower end of which was about-feet above the Castleton mills. Of the plaintiff\u2019s low grounds on this tract about-acres were seriously injured by water. The defendants were the owners of the Castleton mills, having derived title to them through intermediate conveyances from A. J. Coons and wife; the wife having inherited them from her father George Ficklin. About two hundred and forty-one yards above the present site of the Castleton dam, there was an old dam which was used to work a tub grist-mill and sawmill: This old dam was built probably before 1806. George Ficklin owned these mills and dam, and about the year 1822, 1823 or 1824, removed the same to the site of the Castleton mills, and then elevated the dam above the level of the old <em>one; </em>and he continued to use and enjoy uninterrupted and exclusive possession of the Castleton mills and dam until his death in 1852. About the year 1845 or 1846 he repaired the dam, and raised the level about two feet. The defendants adduced no evidence to show any authority from the courts or the Legislature of Virginia authorizing the original construction of the dam or any alteration in the location or height thereof; but they introduced in evidence the certificate of Fayette Mauzy,. the clerk of the county court of Culpeper, that the minute books of the county court, from the beginning of the county in 1749 down to the 4th of 1798, were all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>and that all the papers in suits, motions, &amp;e., usually filed away in bundles labeled \u201cjudgments,\u201d according to the custom of the office, were all destroyed during the war to a much later date than July 1798. The clerk had an impression, not very distinct, that before the late war and while the suit of Field v. Ficklin\u2019s adm\u2019r, about the same matter of controversy, was depending in Rappahannock county, he was called upon by some one interested to examine for an order of court and proceedings to establish the dam of the mill now owned by the defendants, and was not able to find any such order or proceedings, if any such did exist. He stated further, that in indexing the minute books of the office it was the custom to index an application for a mill in the name of the applicant only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-10\">Much testimony was adduced before the jury from many witnesses, on both sides, respecting the amount and extent of the injury of which the plaintiff complains and the cause of it, showing the locatio n of the adjoining hills, the elevation of the lands above the level of the dam, the means which had been employed by the plaintiff to drain his lands and carry off the water from the hills above. It was proved by the plaintiff that his low grounds were more liable to overflow from freshets than the lands above him and the lands below the dam, and that this was the natural consequence of his proximity to the dam.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-11\">It also appeared that his damages were comparatively small, and no specific damages were proved, until after the repair of the dam by Ficklin in 1845 or 1846; but that since then the lands had been seriously injured, and their productiveness greatly diminished.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-12\">Before the trial a report with a map and survey of the grounds was made, under an order of the court, by A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Tutt, a surveyor and engineer, and is referred to in the instructions asked for by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AK1\">There was a verdict and judgment for the defendants: and Field thereupon applied to a judge of this court for a <em>supersedeas; </em>which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-5\"><em>Field </em>and <em>Gray, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-6\"><em>Forbes, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b99-7\">Bouldin, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AdU\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">This case is before us on a writ of error to a judgment of the Circuit court of Madison county, at a special term thereof,'held in August 1870, in an action on the case brought by the appellant against the appellees, to recover damages for injury alleged by the appellant to have been done to his land by a dam alleged by him to have been illegally erected across the stream below, by one Geoi\u2019ge Ficklin, under whom the appellees claim, and continued by said appellees down to the institution of the suit; and the single defence was, that the defendants were protected in their alleged right to continue said dam by lapse of time. It very plainly appeared that the dam was not erected under any order of court; and the right set up under an adversary use of the easement for more than twenty years constituted the entire defence. The injury to the land of the plaintiff was plainly proved. The land was sobbed and rendered unfit for cultivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Under the rulings of the court, some of which were excepted to on both sides, the jury rendered a verdict of not guilty, which was approved by the court; and a judgment rendered for the defendants; and the case comes before this court on a writ of error and <em>supersedeas </em>to that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">The deposition of the appellant Field was taken, to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>rea&lt;^\u2019 <em>^ene esse&gt; </em>and the first error assigned was to the exclusion by the court of certain questions and answers in that deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"Aon\">The defendants moved to exclude the questions and answers 011 the examination in chief from the 6th to the 20th inclusive, the 22d and the last paragraph of the 21st; and also questions from 8 to 12 inclusive on cross-examination, and the answers thereto, upon the ground that George Ficklin, under whom defendants claim, is now dead, but was alive at the period referred to in the questions, and was a party to the transaction which' was the subject of investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The court sustained the exceptions to all the questions and answers aforesaid, except to the answers to the 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th questions in chief, to the last paragraph of the 21st, and to a portion of the 13th. And this ruling formed the subject of the appellant\u2019s first exception. The defendants excepted to the same ruling, because the court did not sustain <em>all </em>their exceptions. These exceptions, on both sides, are embraced in the first bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">This court is of opinion that there was no error in excluding the 6th, 7th, 8th, 10th and 12th questions and answers in chief. These related to the acts and declarations of Ficklin; and he being dead, it was not competent to prove them by the appellant. But we are of opinion that the Circuit court erred in sustaining the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the other questions and answers in chief or any part thereof. The questions and answers did not relate to declarations of Ficklin to conversations between him and the appellant Field, or to transactions between them. They had reference to the condition of the appellant\u2019s land, the character of the stream, the effect of the dam on the stream and adjacent land of appellant, and other independent facts, as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>which his testimony, if untrue, could be rebutted by others as readily as by Ficklin. Such testimony does not come within the principle on which the exclusion was asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\">The court is further of opinion, that the court below erred in excluding, on the motion of the defendants, the appellants\u2019 answers to their own questions from 8 to 12 inclusive, on the cross-examination. There is, perhaps, but one of these questions, No. 8, that would have come within the rule of exclusion, had it been propounded by the appellant. That question seems to have been based on something appellant had at some time said, or was supposed to have said, but which he certainly had not proved as a witness; and whilst he could not legally prove such fact, Ficklin being dead, it was certainly competent to the defendants, claiming under Ficklin, to call for it from him. This they have done; and there would seem to be no propriety in excluding, at their motion, the answers to that and the other questions aforesaid, propounded by themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">The next error assigned by the appellant, is to the exclusion of the testimony of Henry S. Field, as set forth in the second bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">It appears that after the death of Ficklin, one <em>Mozingo </em>rented the mill; and in the last year of his tenancy, 1856, H. S. Field, a son of the appellant, who attended to his business, heard a knocking at the dam, and found Mozingo fastening on the comb of the dam a log about ten or twelve inches thick. Field, in the name of his father, forbid the proceeding, and was proceeding to state what passed between him and <em>Mozingo, </em>when he was arrested by a motion, by the defendants, to exclude the testimony; which was sustained by the court: and the appellant excepted. The appellant then asked the witness the following question: \u201cAt the time referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>to, did Mozingo claim it as a right to put said log across the dam, or simply ask it as a privilege, and for a short time?\u201d This question was objected to by the defendants, and excluded by the <em>court; </em>and the appellant again excepted : And these two exceptions form the subject of the second bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">It will be observed that the log referred to was placed on the dam prior to the purchase of the property by the defendants; and it had been proved by the appellant that this log was on the dam when it went into the possession of the defendants, and had not been removed ; that Mozingo, who had put it on the dam, had promised the appellant to remove it, but had failed to do so. It must be remembered also, that defendants relied only on a prescriptive right to the dam, as it was, which they sought to maintain by proof of adversary possession thereof for more than twenty years, under such circumstances as would create the presumption of a grant. Such evidence is presumptive only, and not conclusive; and may always be rebutted by evidence showing that the adversary use and enjoyment relied on was not acquiesced in, but the right thereto contested; and any evidence tending to show such resistance is proper evidence to rebut the presumption. <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Aylor, 7 </em>Leigh 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">If a mere denial of the right of the defendants to the use and enjoyment of the dam within the period of prescription is proper evidence to rebut the presumption, <em>a fortiori, </em>would such denial be proper testimony, accom\u2022panied by acquiescence therein to a certain extent, on the other side, and an arrangement between the parties for a temporary raising of the dam, and the use thereof as thus raised, for a <em>limited period. </em>Such was the testimony sought to be elicited from. H. S. Field. He was present when the dam was thus being <em>raised; </em>forbid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>raising thereof; but was prevented by the court from disclosing the conversation with Mozingo, who raised the dam, at the time of the act, and from proving whether or not Mozingo claimed it as his right or asked it as a privilege to put on the log. We are clearly of opinion \u25a0 that the entire conversation of Mozingo, occurring at the time of the act aforesaid, was proper evidence as part of the <em>\u201cres gestee;\u201d </em>and that the court erred in excluding that conversation, and the question subsequently propounded to the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\">The court is further of opinion, that there was no error in the rulings of the court below, set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s 3d, 4th and 5th bills of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">In the progress of the trial the defendants not having been able to secure the attendance of a witness, Fayette Mauzy, clerk of the county court of .Culpeper county, by consent of the plaintiff, read to the jury a statement or certificate, in writing, prepared and signed by said Mauzy, and sent to counsel as his testimony. The defendants then asked to be allowed to prove by one of their counsel, D. A. Grimsley, that the certificate failed to state one or more facts which had been deposed to by Mauzy on a previous trial, and what those facts were; to which the plaintiff objected; but the court overruled the objection, and allowed the witness to prove that one fact deemed material by defendants had been deposed to by Mauzy at the previous trial, and was omitted in his certificate ; but would not allow the witness to state what that fact was. To this ruling the' plaintiff excepted; and this constitutes his 6th exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">We do not see how this ruling of the court operated seriously, if at all, to the prejudice of the appellant; but we regard it as plainly erroneous. The defendants having themselves introduced the written statement of their own absent witness, in lieu of his personal attend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>anee, are not at liberty to discredit that- statement by proving that it was variant from the witness\u2019 statement on a former trial. They were not compellable to read the statement; but having voluntarily done so, it became their own testimony; and it was error to allow them to impeach it to any extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The 7th exception of the plaintiff was to the exclusion by the court, as evidence on the trial, of the record of a suit brought by Field, in the Circuit court o\u00ed the county of Culpeper, in June 1855, against the personal representative of George Ficklin, dec\u2019d, to recover damages for the injury done his land in Eicklin\u2019s life-time, by the dam aforesaid; and in which judgment had been rendered for the plaintiff. This record was offered, not as evidence to conclude the defendants, but for the purpose of rebutting the testimony introduced by the defendants to prove a prescriptive right to their dam. But the defendants moved to exclude it; and their motion was sustained by the court. In this we think the court erred. The injury for which the suit was brought was not the original erection of the dam in 1825, but was the result of the dam, as renewed and raised above its former height in 1845 or 1846. Both dams being wholly on the land of Ficklin, and no injury having resulted to the appellant from the dam of 1825, he had no cause of action by reason of the erection of that dam. It was the renewed dam of 1845 or 1846 which caused the injury of which he complained; and that is the dam for the use and enjoyment of which the defendants attempt to show a prescriptive right. To rebut such presumption, we have already seen that a denial of the right within the period of prescription is proper evidence; and we can conceive of no higher evidence of a denial of the right claimed, than a suit instituted within ten years from its inception, to recover damages for the exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>the supposed right, and a successful prosecution thereof to final judgment. We are of opinion, therefore, that the record aforesaid was proper rebutting testimony, and that the court erred in excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\">It may not be necessary to dispose of the defendants\u2019 exceptions in this case; but the court is further opinion, that there was no error in the ruling of the Circuit court as set forth in their first and second bills of exception: but we are inclined to think that it was error to admit the parol testimony set forth in the defendants\u2019 fourth bill of exceptions. The plaintiff was allowed to prove by parol evidence, not only the pendency, but the object, of a pending suit. Of that object, being matter disclosed by the record, we think the record itself the best, if not the only evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">After the evidence and arguments of counsel on both sides had been fully heard, the court was asked by the plaintiff to give to the jury the following instructions:</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">1st. If the jury believe, from the evidence, that the mill-dam and abutment of the defendants at Castleton was built without an order of court, or without the return of the inquest of a jury of <em>ad quod damnum, </em>and that the lands of the plaintiff have been injured by the building of said dam and abutments, then they must find for the plaintiff\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">2d. If the jury believe, from the evidence, that the dam and abutment at Castleton, across Hazle river, wag built under an order of court, and upon the return of an inquest of a jury of <em>ad quod damnum, </em>and that the lands of the plaintiff have been injured thereby, they must find for the plaintiff, unless they believe, from the evidence, that the injuries to the plaintiff\u2019s land were actually foreseen and estimated for by said jury of <em>ad quod dam</em>num.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>3d. If the jury believe, from the evidence, that the dam and abutment of defendants across the Hazle river, at Castleton, were built without authority of law, and in pursuance of the act of assembly, and that thereby the lands of the plaintiff' have been injured, then the said dam and abutment constitute a private nuisance; and each day they are continued creates a fresh nuisance, for which the plaintiff has a right of action against the defendants, and is entitled to recover any damages sustained between the 6th of April 1863, when the notice to abate was served, and the date of the writ in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">4th. If the jury believe, from the evidence, that George Picklin, and those under whom he claimed, had legal authority to build the dam across the Hazle river at Gastleton, at the point P on the diagram of A. Tutt, made under the order in this cause, and that said Picklin, in his life-time, abandoned the dam at P, and built another dam across said river two hundred and thirty-one yards below the point at P, without authority of law, then the said dam last mentioned is an illegal structure, and the plaintiff is entitled to recover for any injuries done his lands by reason of the continuance of said illegal structure in the said river by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">5th. The court further instructs the jury, that the right to a dam at \u201cP,\u201d on-the diagram of the survey of A. Tutt, made under an order in this cause, and known as the \u201c old dam,\u201d which did no injury to the lands of the plaintiff', conferred no right to a dam at \u201c 0,\u201d on said diagram, known as the \u201c new dam,\u201d which does injure the lands of the plaintiff. And if the jury believe, from the evidence, that the lands of the plaintiff' are injured by the dam of the defendants at \u201c0,\u201d then they must find for the plaintiff; unless they believe that the last mentioned dam was built by authority of law, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>said damages to the plaintiff\u2019s lands were foreseen, and estimated for by the jury of <em>ad quod </em>damnum.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\">And the defendants\u2019 moved the court to give the following :</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">1st. Defendants move the court to instruct the jury as follows: If the jury believe, from the evidence, that the dam and mill in the declaration mentioned were erected by George Ficklin, dec\u2019d, in the year 1824, or prior thereto, and that from the date of their erection he claimed and held the possession, use and enjoyment thereof, and of the water power on Hazle river afforded by said dam and used in the working of said mill, adversely and uninterruptedly as to the plaintiff and those to whom he is and was in privity, for twenty years from the period of such erection, then the said Ficklin had, and those claiming under him have, a lawful right to continue the said possession, use and enjoyment of said dam and mill.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">2d. If the jury believe, from the evidence, that in the year 1845 George Ficklin claimed to be the owner of the dam and mill in the declaration mentioned, and had so claimed and held adversely to the plaintiff for twenty years prior thereto, and in the said year 1845, or subsequently thereto, he raised the said dam higher than it had been previously <em>thereto; </em>and also believe that the injury to the lands of the plaintiff, in the declaration specified, was thereby occasioned, inasmuch as the plaintiff\u2019s declaration does not cover said raising of the dam and damages arising, therefrom, he has no right to recover said damages in this action, and they must find for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">3d. The jury are instructed to disregard as inadmissible, under the pleadings and issue in this cause, so much of the evidence as pertains to the proposition, that the dam in question has, since its original erection, been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>ra*8ec^ a^ove ^s original height, :and as pertains to the proposition, that the plaintiff\u2019s lands have been damaged by such raising of the dam.</p>\n<p id=\"A_L\">But the court refused to give any of the instructions asked by the plaintiff; and refused to give numbers 1 and 3 askedaby defendants; but gave the defendants\u2019 2d instruction, and added the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">If the jury believe, from the evidence, that George Ficklin erected the mill and dam and abutment referred to in the declaration, and that thereafter the said Ficklin and parties claiming under him, continued in the exclusive and uninterrupted possession and enjoyment of the said mill and dam and abutment and water-power of Hazle river, afforded by said dam and used in the working of said mill, with claim of right and title thereto, from a period more than twenty years prior to the institution of plaintiff:'\u2019s suit <em>v. </em>A. J. Coons and wife, (who inherited the property from Ficklin, and through whom the defendants claim title,) now pending in the Circuit court of Culpeper county, Va., up to the time of the institution of the said suit, such possession, use, &amp;c., entitle the defendants in this action to the benefit of the presumption that the construction of said mill and dam and abutment was authorized by law; and as there is no evidence to the contrary, presented to the jury, they must presume that the plaintiff' and those under whom he derives title to the lands alleged to have been damaged, was at the time of the erection of the mill, &amp;c., or prior thereto, fully compensated for all injury which might be occasioned by such mill-dam and abutment, to his lands; and they must find upon the issue joined in this cause for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">To this action of the court the plaintiff excepted; and on his motion, the court certified all the evidence oh which the instructions \u00e1sked for and given were based.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>We are of opinion, that there was no error in the refusal of the court to give the instructions moved by the plaintiff, in the form in which they were presented. They are, all of them, evidently based on the \u25a0 assumption that there can be no legaLdam across a water course, unless established by legal proceedings under the act of assembly; ignoring entirely rights acquired by actual grant, by permission and by prescriptive right, derived from long use and enjoyment. They were properly rejected, therefore, by the court. 'We are also of opinion that there was no error in refusing to give the 1st and 3d instructions moved by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">The first instruction ignores utterly the important distinction between lapse of time as evidence, and lapse of time as a bar. In the latter case, it is conclusive; in the former, presumptive only, and liable to be rebutted by circumstances. The case before us is of the latter character. In the case of <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Aylor, </em>7 Leigh 546, already cited, this court held, 1st: that \u201cthe use and enjoyment, by the defendant and those under whom he claimed, although it was exclusive and adversary, and existed for more than twenty years, was <em>not </em>conclusive evidence of the defendant\u2019s right; but presumptive merely: Secondly \u2014 that evidence tending to show that such use and enjoyment was not acquiesced in, but the right thereto contested, was proper evidence to rebut the presumption.\u201d Such rebutting evidence is abundant in this record; and it would have been plainly erroneous to declare that twenty years exclusive and adversary use and enjoyment of the easement was <em>conclusive </em>of the right. The instruction was, therefore, properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">hTor was there error in refusing to give the defendants\u2019 3d instruction. That instruction affirmed that under the pleadings in the cause, evidence to show that since the original erection of the dam it had been raised in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>height, and that injury to plaintiff\u2019s land had resulted therefrom, was inadmissible. This instruction, although directly pertinent to the facts, the court refused to give, and we think properly; thereby affirming, in effect,that such evidence was admissible under the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">But we are of opinion that the court did err in giving the second instruction moved by the defendant; and also in giving the instruction added by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">The second instruction affirms, substantially, but in different form, what was disaffirmed by the court in its refusal to give the third instruction. It affirms, in substance, the proposition that if Mcklin, prior to 1825,had erected a dam across the stream which did no injury to the plaintiff, and held and used this dam adversely until 1845, and then repaired the dam and raised its height so as to injure the lands of the plaintiff, that this raising, and the injury resulting therefrom, was not covered by a declaration counting on said act as an erection of a dam, and claiming compensation for damages resulting from the continuance thereof by defendants. <em>We </em>think the declaration does cover the case; and the court below had itself so decided, in refusing to direct the jury to disregard the evidence- tending to establish the raising of the dam in height since its original erection, and the injury resulting therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">The court erred, also, in giving the last instruction prepared by the court. It decides, instead of leaving that question to the jury, that there was no proof to rebut the presumption of a prescriptive right, and gives substantially the first instruction asked by the defendant, which we have already seen had been properly rejected. The law should have been laid down by the court, as it was held to be in in <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Aylor, </em>above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Judgment reversed, with costs to the appellant; and cause remanded to the Circuit court of Madison county, to be further proceeded in, according to the principles above declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\">The judgment was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">The court is of opinion, for reasons stated in writing and filed with the record, that the Circuit court erred, to the prejudice of the plaintiff in error, as follows, viz:</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">First. In sustaining the defendants\u2019 in error exceptions to any of the questions and answers in the deposition of the plaintiff in error, either on his examination in chief or on cross-examination, except to the 6th, 7th, 8th, 10th and 12th questions, and answers in chief, as set'forth in the plaintiff\u2019s in errors first bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">2dly. In excluding the testimony of Henry S. Field, in relation to his conversation with Mozingo, as set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s in error second bill of exceptions; all that passed between the witness and Mozingo, at the time of and relating to the act of Mozingo therein referred to, was proper evidence as part of the <em>res gestae.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">3dly. In allowing the defendants in error, after they had, with the consent of the plaintiff in error, introduced and read to the jury, the written statement of an absent witness of their own, to prove by one of their counsel, that at a former trial of the cause, this witness had stated a material fact not contained in his written statement, as set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s in error sixth bill of exceptions. The defendants in error should not have been allowed to discredit that written statement in any respect whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">4thly. In excluding from the jury, as rebutting evidence, the record set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s in error seventh bill of exceptions: That record, for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>for which it was offered, was proper testimony, and should have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">5thly. In giving to the jury the second instruction moved by the defendants in error, and in adding thereto the instruction prepared by the court, as set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s in error eighth bill of exceptions. On the facts of this case the court should have instructed the jury, in substance, as follows, it being the law of the case, as laid down in <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Aylor, 7 </em>Leigh 546. The use and enjoyment of the dam in question by the defendants in error, and those under whom they claim, although it may have been exclusive and adversary, and had existed for more than twenty years, is not conclusive evidence of the defendants\u2019 in errors right, but <em>presumptive merely; </em>and evidence tending to show that such use and enjoyment was not acquiesced in, but the right thereto contested, is proper evidence to rebut that presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">The judgment of the Circuit court is reversed, with costs to the plaintiff in error; the verdict of the jury set aside, and the cause remanded to the Circuit court, for a new trial to be had therein, in accordance with the foregoing principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
