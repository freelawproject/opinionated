At the last January term, application was made to vacate the rule of the preceding term, on the ground of a want of notice; and because one of the plaintiffs was not truly named in the bail-piece, which had been filed in the original cause, and the,bail had not justified. <em>The court </em>ordered, that the cause should be opened and be considered in the same situation as at the commencement of the last term, and that proceedings in the suit on the bail bond be stayed, on payment of costs, the bail justifying, if required, the name in the bail-piece to be corrected, and the defendant to confess judgment in the original suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-9\">The defendants attorney, supposing that the order of the court extended no farther than to vacate the rule of October term, applied to a judge during the last vacation, and obtained an order generally to stay all proceedings to this term, which was regularly served on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, who, considering it as irregular, proceeded in the bail bond suit. \u2022</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AVni\">* <em>Riggs, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akf\">now moved to set aside [*397] all the proceedings since the last term, as being contrary to the judge\u2019s order, and that all proceedings on the bail bond be stayed oh the terms offered at the last term.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b489-12\"><em>S.
