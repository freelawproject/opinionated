The cause is now ready to come before the referees, and this motion is to be'considered as the first application to put off a trial, on account of the absence of a material witness. The power given by the act, to the defendant, to sue out a commission, in his [*395] favor, and his omission to do it, cannot *vary the ordinary practice. The defendant may have a rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>to put off the meeting of the referees for two months unless the witness should return sooner.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Rule granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b487-12\"> \u201c The defendant may also, in the first instance, apply to the court who will postpone the hearing on account of the absence of a material witness; and this motion is regarded in the light of an application to put off a trial; 1 Johns. Cas. 394; S. C. Coleman, 107; 20 Johns. R. 476: and for this purpose , \u00e1 judge at chambers may grant an order to stay proceedings, until an application can be made to the court. 1 Caines\u2019 R. 157. But in no case, can a judge at chambers distinctly <em>adjourn </em>the hearing of a cause before referees, or grant any other order in relation to it, than one staying proceedings until a motion can be made to the court: and where a cause had been duly noticed for hearing before referees, for the 7th of July, and a judge at chambers, upon an affidavit of the absence of a material witness, granted an order, upon the day appointed for the hearing, adjourning the cause until the 7th of October, this court, (Sutherland, J.) held the order to be a nullity, and vacated it, with costs to the plaintiff, of preparing for the hearing before the referees, and of the motion. <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>MS.
