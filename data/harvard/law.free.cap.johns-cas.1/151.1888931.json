As soon as the intelligence of her capture was received by the plaintiffs, to wit, on the 16th March .following, he abandoned his interest to the defendants, offering the usual proofs of interest and of loss. The vessel was liberated on the 12th day of March, which could not have been known to either party at the time of the abandonment, and she afterwards *proceeded on her [*152] voyage with her cargo, and arrived in safety at New Orleans.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-5\"><em>Boyd, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-6\"><em>Troup, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-7\">The question submitted to the court was, whether the plaintiffs were entitled to recover for a total, or a partial loss only.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b203-8\">Lansing, Ch.

The plaintiffs could only be governed by the information they possessed. On receiving the intelligence of the capture, they were entitled to abandon, and an abandonment once properly made is definitive, and fixes the rights of the parties. It may be revoked by mutual consent, or waived; but otherwise it is conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">The plaintiffs are, therefore, entitled to recover as for a total loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
