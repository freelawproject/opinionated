And whereas the. said James White' hath this day conveyed-the said land to the said Lewis De <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Yilliers, and Rensselaer Williams, jun.

The plaintiff proved, that he had been compelled to pay the amount due on the bond accompanying the mortgage above mentioned, which bond was referred to in the mortgage and for the payment of which, the mortgage Was given as a collateral security. The judge at the trial, ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the amount he had so paid on the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-9\">*A verdict was thereupon taken by consent for the [*174] plaintiff for the amount so paid, subject to the opinion of the court, and if the court should be of opinion in favor of the defendant, it was agreed, that a nonsuit should be entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-10\"><em>Burr, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-W\">contended that the condition of the bond on which this action was brought, could rationally admit of no other interpretation, than that it was intended to indemnify the plaintiff against the debt which the mortgage was given to secure, and of course equally to indemnify him against the bond which accompanied it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-11\"><em>Van Vechten, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxW\">argued that the bond was not within the tenor of the condition, which was expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>confined to the mortgage, and that the court could not by construction extend the sense of the contract.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b232-5\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A_Z\">The land mentioned in the condition was sold by the plaintiff, subject to the incumbrance of the mortgage, and under an agreement to be indemnified against it. The amount due on the mortgage must, therefore, have entered into the price, and according ,lo the Spirit, of the contract, was to be paid by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The bond and mortgage could not have been considered as separate debts. They were concurrent securities for, the same demand, and the indemnity against one includes an indemnity against both.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">We are, therefore, of opinion, that the plaintiff is entitled to recover according to the verdict.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b232-9\"><em> Verba intentioni non e contra debent inservire.
