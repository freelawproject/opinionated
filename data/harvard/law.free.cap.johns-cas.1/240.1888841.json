The motion was founded on an affidavit of the defendant, stating that the action was brought on a special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>agreement made in the latter county, and that the cahse of action, if any, arose in that County, and not elsewhere, and also stating that eight or ten witnesses, whose testimony would be material on the trial, resided in that county.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b306-5\">\n<em>Woodwoorth,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A4Lt\">for the plaintiff, opposed the motion on two grounds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-6\">1. That the declaration contained no other than the common money counts, and that, therefore, the action could not be founded on a special agreement, and the plaintiff was entitled to retain the <em>venue </em>where it was laid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-7\">2.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APX\">delivered the opinion of the court. The affidavit of the defendant as to the place where the cause of action arose, is in the usual form, and instead of the plaintiff\u2019s meeting the application by stipulating to give evidence arising in the county where the <em>venu.e </em>is laid, he has sworn that the cause of action arose in another county, (Saratoga,) and that two of his witnesses resided there; at the sam\u00e9 time cautiously avoiding the negative, that the cause of action did not arise elsewhere. This was irregular, and cannot assist him to retain the <em>venue </em>at Albany.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">As to the other objection, although the declaration contains the money counts only, yet the special agreement may still come in question, and therefore, unless the plain-[*241] tiff *will stipulate that he will give no evidence of a special agreement, or that he will give material evidence arising in the city and county of Albany, the <em>venue </em>ought to be changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Rule granted.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b306-11\"> <em>Gourley </em>v. <em>Shoemaker, infra, </em>392, S.

Change <em>of </em>venue may be moved for either, 1, for the purpose of procuring a fair and impartial trial, ,or 2, on account of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>convenience, of parties and of witnesses; 2 R. S. 409, \u00a7 2. The former ground is considered in the note to <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Gibbs, infra, </em>vol. 2, p. 116. With regard to the latter, it appears from the cases cited above, that a stipulation on behalf \u2022of the plaintiff to give material evidence in the county where the venue was laid, constituted an answer to a motion to change it in actions <em>ex delicto, </em>and in the earlier practice in actions <em>ex contractu, </em>but the statute has altered this rule in both forms of actions, by defining as above stated, the purposes for which this motion may be made. 'But neither the residence of a greater number of witnesses in an adjoining state, adjacent to the place of trial laid in the declaration, although the plaintiff has obtained assurances that most of. those witnesses will attend; <em>Bank of St. Albans </em>v. <em>Knickerbacker, 6 </em>Wend. 541; see also <em>Canfield </em>v. <em>Lindley, </em>4 Cowen, 532; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>5 id. 414; <em>Peet </em>v. <em>Billings, </em>2 Wend. 282; nor, the residence of a greater number of witnesses in the county from which the venue is sought to be\" moved, when witnesses to prove the same facts, <em>e. gr. </em>value of /services as attorney arid counsel in the county <em>to </em>which removal is sought, can be procured in the latter county, constitutes a sufficient reason to retain the venue. <em>Benedict </em>v. <em>Hibbard, </em>5 Hill, 509. Under the Revised Statutes, the ground for granting or denying a change of venue, generally lies in the number and residence of witnesses,, their value to be shown under the advice of counsel according to the forms prescribed by the rules' of practice; <em>Anon. </em>1 Hill, 668, 669 5 Id. 3 Wend 425; <em>Constantine </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>9 id. 431; <em>Onondaga Co.
