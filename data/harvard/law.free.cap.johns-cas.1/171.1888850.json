The defendant pleaded in abatement that the plaintiff, and G. R. Webster, and G; Webster, were partners in trade at the time of making the supposed contract, and that the promises charged in the declaration, were made by the defendant to the said partners jointly, and not to the plaintiff severally.

As between themselves it was certainly competent to make it so. The moment a sale was made by one of them he immediately became- chargeable with the amount, and the profits accrued with certainty to the others, who were ho longer subject to the general risk of loss. The defendant understood this to he the course of their dealings, or' at, least requested that the sales to him might be considered as made with the plaintiff solely, to which the latter assented.
