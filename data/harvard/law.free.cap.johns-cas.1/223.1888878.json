On the 12th of the same month, White became insolvent; on the 23d, he assigned and conveyed in due form of law, and <em>bona </em>fide, all his estate, real and personal, to trustees, for the benefit of all his creditors. At the time of docketing' the judgment, White had a leasehold estate for the term of fourteen years, in the city of New York, into which the trustees entered by virtue of the assignment to them; and which, on the 15th April, *they sold, in [*224] execution of their trust, to one Seton for 1900 dollars..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-10\">On the 13th May, 1799, a <em>ft. fa. </em>issued on the judgment above mentioned, which was delivered to the defendant, as sheriff of New York, with directions to seize and sell the leasehold estate of White. The defendant returned on the execution <em>nulla bona, </em>conceiving that he had no power to sell the leasehold estate,, and there was no other property.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-11\"><em>Pendleton, </em>for the plaintiff, and <em>Munro, </em>for the defendant;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_br\">submitted the question, whether the leasehold estate was bound by the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, and liable to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>sold on' the execution, and if so, it was agreed, that the defendant should immediately pay the debt due to the plaintiff. -</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b288-5\">Lansing, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab8\">delivered the opinion of the court. The</p>\n<p id=\"Ate\">determination of this question depends upon the construction of the statute of this state,; passed the 19th March, 1787. The second section provides, that no judgment shall affect any lands or tenements, as to purchasers or mortgagees, but <em>from </em>the time of filing the roll;. and ;the third sectiofi extends the provision to the time of docketing. These sections are transcripts of the statutes of 29 Car. II. c.13, 14, and 4 and 5 Wm. and Mary, c. 20, but the section which precedes them, subjecting all lands, tenements and real estate of debt, ors, to be sold for the satisfaction of their debts, on execution, is a departure from-.the English law.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">When this question was first presented, I had doubts whether the docketing of the judgment did not bind the interest of. a tenant.for years, as comprised within the terms lands, tenements, dr hereditaments. If it did, the delivery of the <em>fi.fa. </em>in this instance, could only operate upon White\u2019s remaining property, the mere personal chattels. The word tenement in legal signification, is appropriate to real [*225]- estate,'and imports every thing that may be *holden if it be of a permanent nature; hence it is construed to be a term more comprehensive than land.. This, however, is merely a restraining statute. It creates\" no positive; rule on the subject. It purports to restrain the operation of the law already in exist\u00e9nce; and to enable us to give it a proper interpretation, it is necessary to examine what was held1 to be the'law, before the passing of- the statute Of 29 Car. II. This appears from <em>Fleetwood\u2019s case, </em>8 Co. 171, in which it is laid down, that a <em>bona fide </em>sale of a term for years, after a judgment, is. good; but not after execution awarded, and for this\" is cited 2 Roll. 157, and several cases from the Year Books. (2 Hen. IV. 14; 11 Hen. IV. 7; 9 Hen. VI, 58.) This shows how the law stood before the statute. \"</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">In the case of <em>Burden </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>(3 Atk. 739,) Lord Chancellor Hardwicke held, that a leasehold estate was affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>by a <em>fieri facias </em>lodged in the sheriff\u2019s office. This was a long time after the English statutes first above mentioned were passed, and it shows that the same doctrine as to this point, had prevailed both before and after the passing of those statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">We are, therefore, of opinion that the docketing of the judgment does not bind a term for years, and that the plaintiff take nothing by his motion.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Rule refused.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b289-11\"> See 1 Cruise, Dig. 183. 1 Hilliard Ab. 122.
