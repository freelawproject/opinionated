The conveyance was stated in the case as intended to be <em>bona fide, </em>and was executed at the dwelling-house of White, and a silver cup was delivered by him to the trustees in the fiameof all the property. The trustees did not. remove any of the goods so assigned to them; but advertised them for *sale at [*157] auction on the 30 April following, at the house occupied by White. On the same day, to wit, on the 30th April, a <em>fi.fa. </em>in this cause was delivered to the sheriff, and before the hour of sale was levied on part of the goods. Upon this, the trustees paid to the sheriff a certain sum of money, and the <em>fi. fa. </em>was withdrawn, and they, proceeded to sell, subject to an agreement that the money in the hands of the- sheriff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>should, be paid to the plaintiff, or returned to the trustees, as the court should direct,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-5\">Pendleton, for the plaintiff</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARc\">contended, that the assignment to the trustees, in contemplation of -law, was fraudulent and void; that the possession of the goods remaining in White, was a decisive badge of fraud, and it was.not in his power to dispose of his property to the prejudice of any individual creditor, who had been more vigilant than the others.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-6\">Harison, for the trustees insisted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A76\">that under the circumstances of this case, the possession remaining in White, was no evidence of fraud. It was a conveyance for the benefit of <em>all his </em>creditors, and no actual fraud is pretended.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b210-7\">Lansing, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3Q\">delivered the opinion of the court. The possession of the goods did not continue in White for his own Use or benefit. They were left with him for the accommodation, of the trustees, who, as representing \u25a0 all the creditors, could have no personal interest in'removing them. No false credit was created, and the sale which was within a reasonable time, does not appear to have been accelerated by the claim of the plaintiff. The possession- of White, was, therefore, not material, .and was consistent with the real intent of the assignment. It is admitted that there was no intention of fraud, and the assignment being for the benefit of all the creditors ought to be considered as valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Let the money in the hands of the sheriff be repaid to the trustees.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b210-9\"> In <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben, </em>2 T. R. 587, the court say \u201c This has been argued as a case in which the want of possession is. only <em>evidence </em>of a fraud and that it was not such a circumstance <em>per se </em>as makes the transaction fraudulent in point of law. That is the point we have considered and'we are all of opinion that if there be <em>nothing but the absolute conveyance without the possession, </em>that, in point of law, is.fraudulent.\u201d See also <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Blades, </em>5 Taunt. 212. <em>Paget </em>v. <em>Perchard, </em>1 Esp. 105. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Podger, </em>2 Wm. Blackstone, 702. <em>Shears </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Ad. 363. <em>Twyne\u2019s case, </em>3 Coke, 80. The doctrine of <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben, </em>has, however, been qualified in England, and as a general rule <em>\u201c\u25a0 </em>under almost any circumstances the question <em>fraud or no fraud </em>is one for the consideration of the jury.\u201d 1 Smith\u2019s Leading Cas. 11. <em>Martindale </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Ad. 498, where several cases establishing this doctrine are cited. <em>Carr v.

R. 337, <em>Bissel </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>3 Cowen, 166, and <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Garter, 2 </em>Wend. 446, decide that <em>\u201c </em>a voluntarjr sale of chattels with an agreement in or out of the deed that the vendor may keep possession is, except in special cases and for special reasons to be shown to and approved by the court, fraudulent and void as against creditors.\u201d By the Revised Statutes, however, it was provided that every sale of goods and chattels, and every assignment by way of mortgage or security, or upon any condition whatever, unless the same be accompanied by an immediate delivery, and followed by an actual and continued change of possession, shall be presumed to be fraudulent and void, as against creditors or subsequent purchasers in good faith, and shall be conclusive evidence of fraud unless it shall be made to appear on the part of the persons claiming under such sale, that the same was made in good faith and without any intent to defraud such creditors or purchasers. <em>2 </em>R. S. 2d edit. 70. Under this statute the question of fraud has been held a question of fact for the jury, <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Acker, </em>23 Wend. 653. <em>Cole </em>v. <em>White, </em>26 id. 511. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Van Wyck, </em>1 Hill, 438. <em>Prentiss </em>v. <em>Slack, </em>id. 567. <em>Hanford </em>v. <em>Archer, </em>4 Hill, 271,) in cases of sales, of mortgages and of assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">,In the federal courts the principle of <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harlen, </em>has been approved by Chief Justice Marshall. \u201c An unconditional sale where possession does not accompany and follow the deed, is with respect to creditors, on the sound construction of the statute of Elizabeth, a fraud and should be so determined by the court. <em>(Meeker et al. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>1 Gallis. 419, 423. <em>Phettiplace </em>v. <em>Sayles, </em>4 Mason, 312, 322, where the rule is rested on public policy.) <em>The distinction is between a deed purporting on the face of it to be absolute, .so that the separation of the possession from the title is incompatible with the deed itself; </em>and a deed made upon condition that does not entitle the vendee to the immediate possession.\u201d <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Russel, </em>1 Cranch, 309, 316. <em>Conrad </em>v. <em>Atlantic Ins. Co., </em>1 Peters, 388. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>4 Mason, 183. The case of - an assignment to a trustee for the benefit of creditors, does not necessarily fall within the principle of <em>Russel </em>v. <em>Hamilton. \u201c </em>The continuance of the possession with the donor until the trust can be executed may not be so incompatible with the deed as to render it absolutely void under all circumstances. This point is not supposed to be decided in <em>Russel </em>v. <em>Hamilton.\u201d Brooks </em>v. <em>Marbury, </em>11 Wheat. R. 79, 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In Virginia, the construction of the rule has always been and still is in accordance with <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben, </em>and <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Russel.

See the following cases, to the point that an absolute sale where possession is retained by the vendor is fraudulent in law, and <em>entirely </em>void. <em>Dale </em>v. <em>Arnold, 2 </em>Bibb, 605. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>4 J.

Russel, is established so 'far as regards absolute conveyances, (Wilt v. <em>Franklin, 1 </em>Binney, 502, 521, <em>Dawes </em>v. <em>Cope, </em>id. 258, 265,) bat delivery of possession is also indispensable where the owner of personal property creates a lien upon it that shall be valid against creditors or <em>bona fide </em>purchasers. <em>Clow </em>v.

The question of fraud arising out of the retention of property by a vendor, mortgagor, or assignor is very comprehensively discussed in 1 Smith Leading Cases, Hare &amp; Wallace\u2019s edit. 40\u201460, and a very great number of the American cases are there cited and commented on.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
