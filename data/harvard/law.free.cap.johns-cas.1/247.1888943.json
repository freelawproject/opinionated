It is an equitable jurisdiction and intended to prevent the vexatious multiplication of suits.\u201d <em>Standford v. Chase, </em>id. 381. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Hinman, </em>19 Johns. R. 237. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Vanderwoort, </em>9 Wend. 449. <em>Ex parte Stone, 3 </em>Cowen, 380. <em>Swing </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Upper Alloway Creek, </em>5 Halst. 58. <em>Sooy </em>v. <em>McKean, </em>4 id. 86. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>id. 96- <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Bewley, </em>1 Browne, 38. <em>Plumsted </em>v. <em>Rudebagh, </em>1 Yeates, 502. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>1 Cowen, 138. But if plaintiff be not liable for costs from the character in which he sues as administrator, the court will not make such order. <em>Boyce </em>v. <em>Hancock, </em>2 Bailey, 53; See also <em>Bordeaux </em>v. <em>Cave, </em>id. 6. Nor will they, if the <em>same </em>title as in the former suit be not in question in the latter; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Stiles, ut supra; </em>nor if the plaintiff be in execution for the costs of the former suit, though if the party be afterwards discharged under an insolvent act, or escape from the <em>ca. sa., </em>5 Wend. 240, the right of the party to a stay would be restored. 1 Cowen, 206. <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Wyckoff, </em>4 Wend. 203. The supreme court have also refused to stay proceedings in a suit until the payment of the costs of a suit in chancery between the parties, concerning the same matter, and in which the plaintiff\u2019s bill was dismissed with costs. <em>Stebbins </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>19'Johns.
