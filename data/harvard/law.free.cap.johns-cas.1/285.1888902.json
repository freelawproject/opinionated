We cannot officially know the forms of another state, and therefore they ought to be proved. The act of congress directs the mode'of proof, and requires that the presiding judge of the court from which the copy is obtained shall certify that the attestation <em>is in due form. </em>This not being done, the record is not sufficiently proved.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>' On the application of the plaintiffs, Ahe court assigned another day to produce a copy duly authenticated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b303-13\"><em> </em>\u201c The certificate under this branch of the requisition should be, according to the words of the law, by <em>the </em>judge ; i. e. the judge of the court in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>the judgment was given. The use of the definite article implies the idea of \u00e1 judge, who-alone constitutes the court. If the court has more than one member, none can certify but the <em>chief </em>or <em>presiding one. </em>And the certificate should contain <em>intrinsic </em>evidence that the person certifying was a judge of/ .the. court in which tire judgment was rendered; and not only so, but that he \"'was the sole, chief, or presiding judge, as the case may be. Per <em>Martin, </em>J.' delivering the opinion' of the court in <em>Kirtland </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 Mart. Lou. It. 497, 498. See also <em>Stephenson </em>v. <em>Bannister, </em>3 Bibb\u2019s R. 369, 370, stated <em>infra-</em>And, it seems, defects in this respect cannot be supplied <em>aliunde. </em>Id. <em>Kirtland </em>v. <em>Smith, supr\u00e1. </em>If, however, the record offered' in evidence shows that the person certifying is chief justice, the certificate, it has been said, will be sufficient, though the fact of. his being the Chief presiding judge IS not stated in his certificate. <em>Mudd </em>v. <em>Beauchamp, </em>Litt. Sel. Cas. 142. <em>Qucere </em>however ; for it ought to hppear that the presiding judge possesses that character at the time of giving the certificate; <em>Stephenson v. Bannister, </em>3 Bibbs R. 370, \u2022stated infra; and how can this fact appear ,save from the certificate ?</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\" \u201c The chancellor is <em>the </em>judge of the court of chancery, for the .purpose of authenticating proceedings of his court under the act of congress. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Blanchard </em>8 Mart. Lou. R. N. S. 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u201c -Where the judgment sought td be proved was rendered in the supreme \u2022court of the county of Jefferson, Mississippi,, as appeared from the clerk\u2019s ceiV tificate, and the judge who certified, was <em>the judge of the first judicial circuit, </em>the .authentication was decided to be .incomplete. <em>Non constat, </em>say the c\u00f3\u00fcrt, that the judge .jvhO certifies or attests, presides in the court in ,which the judgment was rendered. <em>Kirtland </em>v. <em>Smith, supra.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">See also <em>Stephenson </em>v. <em>Bannister, </em>3 Bibb\u2019s R. 369. \u201cIt is indispensable \u2022that the judge should state in his certificate, that the <em>attestation of the clerk is in.due form. </em>These words in the certificate mean, that the attestation is \u25a0in\u2019-the form adapted, by positive law or practice, for authenticating sitriilar records in the state whence the record comes. The intention o'f congress was, not .that the attestation should be according to the form used in the state-where it was offered, or to any other form generally observed ; but according to the form prescribed for the'eourt where the proceeding was had; and the certificate of the presiding judge is the only evidence which can be received of such form having been complied with. <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>1 Peters' C.
