Although, in a late case, the court of common pleas in England, refused to set aside a plea in abatement, on the ground of the insufficiency of the affidavit, for the reason, that the plaintiff might have considered the plea as a nullity and signed judgment. 2 Moore, 213 ; see 1 Dowl. Pr. Cas. 693.\u201d Gra. Prac. 2d ed. 230. By the Revised Statutes, no plea in abatement, &amp;c., shall be received by any court, unless the party offering such plea shall prove the truth thereof by affidavit, or by some other evidence, 2 R. S. 276, \u00a7 21.

The affidavit must be positive as to the truth of every fact contained in the plea, leaving nothing to be collected by inference.

As to the time within which the defendant is bound to plead, upon a judgment of <em>respondeas ouster, </em>it is provided by rule, that when there shall have been a judgment of <em>respondeas ouster, </em>on a demurrer to a plea in abatement, and the plaintiff shall have served the defendant with a notice of such judgment, the defendant shall plead within four days from the day of service of such notice, or\" his default in not pleading may be entered.
