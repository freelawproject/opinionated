The letter was in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\"><em>\u201c </em>American Newspaper Kuryer Codzienny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">in Polish Language. The Polish Daily News.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">The Only Polish Daily Newspaper published in New England.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYY\">255 Broadway, South Boston,.Mass., September 29, 1922.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\"><em>\u201c </em>To the Foreman and Members of the Special Grand Jury:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac0\">Gentlemen, \u2014 I understand that proceedings are taken up by Attorney General\u2019s office in regard to the affairs of the Hanover Trust Company and as President of that institution I was in immediate touch with the affairs of that concern and my information on it would be essentially valuable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\"><em>\u201c </em>I have been given the privilege to appear by two former Grand Juries; one sitting in the Fall of the year 1920 and the affairs of the Hanover Trust Company were then investigated for ten days and No Bill found against the officials of the bank, myself included, and again the Grand Jury, in the Spring of 1922, extended the same privilege to the officials of the Hanover Trust Company when the affairs were investigated for five days, when No Bill was again found and the officials of the Hanover Trust Company were again exonerated by this body of men.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">\u201c Now I ask you gentlemen to extend to me the same privilege to appear before you and explain fully where the bank was solvent when closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\"><em>\u201c </em>I understand you have granted the privilege to William S. McNary and I hope you will treat me with equal fairness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar6\">\u201c I waive all immunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">Yours very truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-12\">[signed] Henry H.

The principles of law stated in that decision and the result there reached are equally applicable to the case at bar and are decisive against the contentions of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-16\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
