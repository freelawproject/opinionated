Writ dated May 10, 1922.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-12\">The action was referred to an auditor, the parties agreeing <em>\u201c </em>that the auditor\u2019s report is to be final on facts.\u201d From the auditor\u2019s findings, it appeared that the plaintiffs had been counsel for a Massachusetts corporation, Bay State Syndicate, Inc., of which the defendant was treasurer and general manager. The closing paragraph of his report reads: \u201c The defendant\u2019s contention all through the hearing was that he did not hire the plaintiffs to do the work for bim personally but consulted them as attorneys for the corporation. I find on the evidence that he hired them personally and agreed to pay them the sum of $5,000 for their services, if they did what they could to save the corporation and relieve him from the anxiety of having the stockholders pursue him on account of the losses of large sums of money in the conduct of the business of which he was the head. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>find that afterwards when the work was nearly completed that the plaintiffs and the defendant compromised and the plaintiffs agreed to take $3,000 and a claim against the corporation for $1,500, and that the defendant agreed to this compromise. For a period beginning about October, 1921, and ending about March, 1922, the plaintiffs rendered valuable services for the defendant. There was no bill rendered to anybody except after the talk of compromise and claim for $1,500 was listed as above stated. I find on all the evidence that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the sum of $3,000, the amount claimed by them in their declaration.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-5\">The plaintiffs moved that the report of the auditor be confirmed and that judgment be entered thereon. The motion was heard by <em>Fosdick, </em>J. The defendant asked for the following <em>\u201c </em>rulings: \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-6\">\u201c 1. That the services of the plaintiffs have not saved the business and therefore their contract has not been completed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-7\"><em>\u201c </em>2. That the change from the Park Trust Company to the Bancroft Trust Company is merely a change in financial agents and the business has not been saved as agreed to by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-8\"><em>\u201c </em>3. That by charging $1,500 for services to the Bay State Syndicate, the plaintiffs waived the amount in their charge of $3,000 against the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-9\"><em>\u201c </em>4. That on all the pleadings and the evidence the plaintiffs are entitled to no more than $1,500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-10\">\u201c 5. That the fact that the plaintiffs intend to take no action to enforce the payment of their claim against the Bay State Syndicate, is not material, and having made the claim, the amount thereof is to be deducted from any charge they have against the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-11\">The rulings were refused and the motion was allowed. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-12\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-13\"><em>J.

The case was referred to an auditor, whose findings were to be final. No question of law was reported by him. His findings in favor of the plaintiffs were clear and consistent, positive arid comprehensive. The contract was found to have been fully performed by the plaintiffs. New obligations incurred by the defendant were voluntary on his part and did not impair the contract rights of the plaintiffs. The adjustment between the parties, whereby the plaintiffs agreed to charge a specified sum to a third person, does not affect their right to collect from the defendant the amount due from him according to compromise. The only judgment legally possible on the findings made by the auditor is in favor of the plaintiffs for the amount found due by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
