The case was submitted to the trial court on agreed facts and after a finding for the defendant is before us on report.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">The defendant contracted to convey the property <em>\u201c </em>by good and sufficient quitclaim deeds . . . conveying a good and clear record title to the same free from all incumbrances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>except taxes for the current year and restrictions of record, if any.\u201d While it is stipulated that \u201c Time is of the essence of this agreement. \u201d Tender of a deed or deeds is . . . waived \u201d and the plaintiff\u2019s refusal after extended negotiations to accept a conveyance leaves for decision the question, whether the title offered was in conformity with the requirements of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">A good and clear record title free from all incumbrances means a title which on the record itself can be again sold as free from obvious defects, and substantial doubts. See <em>Sturtevant </em>v. <em>Jacques, </em>14 Allen, 523, 526; <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Harmony Grove Cemetery Co. </em>108 Mass. 400, 402; <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Finn, </em>171 Mass. 70; <em>Oakey </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>14 Stew. 350; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>115 N. Y. 586. The distinction is plain between the obligation of the defendant under the wording of the agreement, and that which would have attached if the language had been <em>\u201c </em>conveying a good and clear title free from all incumbrances \u201d as pointed out in <em>Shanahan </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>218 Mass. 441, 442, and <em>Aroian </em>v. <em>Fairbanks, </em>216 Mass. 215. A <em>\u201c </em>good marketable title \u201d also is not the same as <em>\u201c </em>a good and clear record title.\u201d The first embraces an actual title which may rest on disseisin for twenty years or more, and is established by evidence independently of the record. The second rests on the record alone, which must show an indefeasible unencumbered estate. <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Finn, </em>171 Mass. 70, 72, 73. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Stober, </em>233 Mass. 223, 225, 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">It seems to have been mutually conceded that the defendant\u2019s title to lot <em>\u201c </em>26 Newbern avenue \u201d is derived under a sale by foreclosure of a mortgage. The mortgagee\u2019s deed, however, and affidavit were not recorded until forty-two days after the sale. By R. L. c. 187, \u00a7 15, now G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 15, <em>\u201c </em>The person selling shall, within thirty days after the sale, cause a copy of the notice and his affidavit stating his acts fully and particularly to be recorded in the registry of deeds for the county or district in which the land lies, with a note of reference thereto on the margin of the record of the mortgage deed, if the mortgage is recorded in the same registry. If the affidavit shows that he has in all respects complied with the requirements of the power of sale and of the statute, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>affidavit, or a certified copy of the record thereof, shall be \"admitted as evidence that the power of sale was duly executed.\u201d But even if the deed vested the title, and the failure to record a copy of the notice of sale and the affidavit would not defeat it <em>(Field </em>v. <em>Gooding, </em>106 Mass. 310, <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>115 Mass. 89, 93, <em>Learned </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>117 Mass. 365, 371, <em>Fitchburg Cooperative Bank </em>v. <em>Normandin, </em>236 Mass. 332, 334, 335), the failure of the mortgagee to comply with the statute would compel the plaintiff, if his title was questioned, to resort to extrinsic evidence to show that the power having been properly exercised the foreclosure was valid. The defendant therefore being unable to convey a good and clear record title to the Newbem land, the other alleged defects relied on by the plaintiff require no discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\">In accordance with the terms of the report, judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,000 with interest from November 16,1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
