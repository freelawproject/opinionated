The All Writs Act does not excuse a court from making these findings. Because the District Court enjoined respondent's execution without finding that he has a significant possibility of success on the merits, it abused its discretion. We accordingly vacate the injunction.\n </history>\n <opinion id=\"p-6\">\n  Justice BREYER and Justice SOTOMAYOR would deny the application to vacate the injunction.\n </opinion>\n <p type=\"majority\">\n </p>\n</casebody>\n"
