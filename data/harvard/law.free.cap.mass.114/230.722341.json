Cartwright\u2019s Case.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b246-9\">Upon an information for malfeasance in office fifed against a receiver of an insolvent insurance company appointed by this court under Gen. Sts. c. 58, \u00a7 6, it appeared that he had taken more than $10,000 of the company\u2019s funds without order of court and had appropriated them to his own use; that no entry of the taking had been made upon the receivers\u2019 books till after the filing of the information; that he had taken $25,000 in bonds belonging to the company and not returned them till the abstraction had been discovered. He was ordered to restore to his co-receiver the money so taken. He failed to comply with this order, and, in answer to an order to show cause why he should not be attached for contempt, testified under oath, admitting the facts, stating that he thought he had a right to take the money as compensation for his services; that he intended to do no wrong, but from poverty he was unable to restore it. Having been adjudged guilty of contempt and sentenced to imprisonment, he appealed. On the appeal, <em>Held, </em>(without passing upon the question of the right to appeal,) that the court had the summary power to commit for contempt; that proceedings for contempt were criminal in their nature; that the jurisdiction was not controlled by the question whether the contempt was or was not indictable; that the receiver was an officer of the court, and that his custody of funds was the custody of the court; that his sworn testimony was not conclusive in his favor; hat the question of contempt did not depend upon his intention; that he had <em>not </em>cleared himself by his testimony; that he had been guilty of a breach of trust and of a contempt; that the commitment was not alone to compel restitution, but to punish for the offence, and that therefore his inability to make restitution was not a sufficient answer.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b246-10\">Contempt. An application under Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>58, \u00a7 6, had been made to this court by the insurance commissioner against the Hide and Leather Insurance Company, representing that upon an examination had by him, he was of opinion that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>insolvent, and praying that an injunction might issue restraining it from proceeding with its business, and asking for the appointment of receivers. The injunction had issued, and December 2, 1871, Chester I. Reed, John W. Cartwright and Oliver H. Cole had been appointed receivers by a decree, a copy of which is in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b247-5\">Afterwards, Chester I.

Cartwright, one of the receivers heretofore appointed in said cause, has been guilty of gross negligence and malfeasance in the duties of his said office; wherefore the Attorney General moves that said Cartwright be removed from his said office, and for such other decree in relation thereto as the nature of the case may require.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-5\">\u201c Charles It. Train, Attorney General.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOg\">Upon this information, such proceedings were had that Cartwright was adjudged to be in contempt, and was sentenced to be imprisoned for the term of six months. From this adjudication and sentence he appealed to the full court, and the case was reported by <em>Devens, </em>J., as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-6\">\u2022 \u201c An information having been filed by the Attorney General in this cause November 28 last, alleging that the said Cartwright had been guilty of gross negligence and malfeasance in the duties of his office as one of the receivers of the said company, it was thereupon on the same day ordered by Mr. Justice Ames, at chambers, that the said Cartwright be notified to appear before some one of the justices of this court, at the court-house in Boston, on the sixth day of December last; and on the thirteenth day of said December the said Cartwright appeared before me, at chambers at the said court-house, by counsel, and was fully heard by me in the jnatter of the said information, and the Attorney General was present and was heard thereon. At this hearing it appeared and was not denied by said Cartwright, that he had appropriated specifically $25,000 in bonds of the United States belonging to this company, without the knowledge of either of his co-receivers, and that after discovery by the Attorney General of this appropriation of them, and demand upon him, they were restored; this was done before Davis was appointed receiver. And it further appeared that said Cartwright was indebted to the receivers of the said company in the sum of $13,565.97, for cash loaned to him by said company, and cash withdrawn by him for his personal use from the assets in the hands of the said receivers, and for interest thereon ; and it was thereupon on the same- day ordered and decreed by me that the said Cartwright pay into the hands of James C. Davis, one oi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>the receivers of the said company, to be administered as a part of the assets of the said company, the said sum of $13,565.97, on or before the seventeenth day of said December, together with interest on the principal of said indebtedness from the date of said order. And on the eighteenth day of said December a statement and affidavit of the said James C. Davis [a copy of which is given in the margin <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>] was filed in this cause, wherein it was stated that said Cartwright had failed and neglected to comply with said order of December 13th, and had not paid to the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Davis any part of the said sum; and it was alleged in said affidavit that a part of the indebtedness of the said Cartwright to the said receivers was for sums of money which were withdrawn by the said Cartwright from the assets of the said company in the hands of the receivers thereof, and appropriated by him to his own personal use ; and thereupon, on the same day, at chambers in said Boston, it was ordered by me that the said Cartwright be notified to appear before some one of the justices of this court at the said court-house on the twentieth day of said December, to show cause why an attachment should not issue against him as and for a contempt of this court, as well for the disobedience of the said order as for an unlawful appropriation of the assets of the said company to his own use [a copy of this order is given in the margin<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>] ; and notice of the said last mentioned order was on the same day duly served upon the said <em>Cartwright; </em>and in pursuance of said order the said Cartwright personally appeared before me at said court-house on said twentieth day of December, and the matter was then postponed to the twenty-third day of said December; and on said last mentioned day the said Cartwright appeared before the court in session, and was then and there examined on oath, at his own request, and fully heard by counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\u201c The books o\u00ed said receivers were produced at said hearing, and it appeared from said books that the indebtedness of said Cartwright to said receivers was, on December 13th last, $13,565.97, of which amount $1342.53 was for interest; $1650 for indebtedness to said company incurred before the appointment of receivers, and $10,573.44 for cash withdrawn from the company\u2019s assets in the hands of the receivers. Of the amount last stated, it appeared that sums amounting to $8840 were withdrawn by said Cartwright from the hands of the said receivers during the month of his appointment (December, 1871) and the two following months (January and February, 1872) and appropriated by him to his own use, and that the residue of said sum of $10,573.44 had been so withdrawn and appropriated by him at various times from said date to the twenty-second day of August, 1872; and that no part of his indebtedness had been paid to the said receivers. It appeared that the sum of $7450, which was so withdrawn and appropriated by him on the thirteenth day of January, 1872, was not entered on the books of the receivers at the date of such withdrawal, and was not so entered until December 1, 1873. But said Cartwright stated in his examination that he was ignorant that it had not been duly entered. Said Cartwright testified that he was unable, by reason of poverty, to comply with the order of the court for the payment of his indebtedness to the receivers , that he had no property of any sort or kind, but was willing to make over anything which he had; that he had made application to be adjudicated a bankrupt; that all moneys withdrawn by him from the hands of the receivers were withdrawn by the advice of the late Judge Reed, one of Ms co-receivers ; that he had not put away or secreted the money, and poverty was his sole reason for not complying with the order; that an account of the charges on the books had been presented to him, and he did not question its correctness, but that he did not remember all the items, and had not supposed that he had drawn so much ; that he did not dispute any of the amounts ; that he had been applied to to repay them, and had notice of the orders of the court; thai he had used the money for personal expenses; that he had a large family and needed it to live upon; that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>supposed that he had a right to. take the money, and that from what Judge Reed said, he supposed he should have $10,000 for his services ; that he had no intention to do wrong ; that of his indebtedness to the company, $1500 was secured by pledge of twenty-five shares of stock of the New England Coal Gas Condenser Association, of which he was president, which he believed to be adequate in value to the amount of the loan ; but that he had never known of any sales of the stock, and that it had no market value; that the other receivers had taken $7450 each, January 13, <em>1872; </em>that Judge Reed had said to him, \u2018 If you draw too much, you will have to replace it,\u2019 and told him to keep within $10,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-5\">\u201c No compensation for said Cartwright\u2019s services as receiver has ever been fixed or allowed by the court; and I was of opinion that the amount of his said indebtedness largely exceeded the value of such services. The receivers have not yet completed the settlement of the affairs of said company, and have not filed an account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-6\">\u201c It appeared to the court upon such examination and hearing, that said Cartwright had disobeyed the said order of December 13, and that he had unlawfully appropriated to his own use,, the sum of $10,573.44, withdrawn by him from the assets of the said company in the hands of the receivers <em>thereof; </em>and the said Cartwright was thereupon adjudged to be in contempt; and the matter being further postponed for sentence to the third day of January current, on said last mentioned day the said Cartwright appeared before the court in session, and was by me sentenced to be imprisoned in the common jail of the county of Suffolk for the term of six months, unless sooner discharged by further order of this court. The adjudication and sentence and the warrant of commitment are copied in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> And the said Cartwright appealed to the full court.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>C.

Ch. 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">But in the present case his own testimony fails to clear him. It appears by his examination upon oath that at the time of his appointment as receiver he was indebted to the corporation in the sum of \u00a71650.00, and that he afterwards took from the assets of the corporation in the hands of the receivers, and applied and spent for his own use, without any order or authority of the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>the sum of $10,573.44; that nearly $9000 of this sum was so taken by him within two or three months of his appointment, that no entry of the greater part thereof was made on the books of the receivers until after the Attorney General had filed an application to remove him from office for gross negligence and malfeasance in his official duties, and that no part of these two sums, amounting with interest at six per cent, to $13,565.97, had ever been replaced. The appellant\u2019s statement that he had no intention to do wrong is irreconcilable with the rest of his testimony, and with his admission that he also appropriated, without the knowledge of his co-receivers, $25,000 in bonds of the United States, belonging to the corporation, and did not return them until after that misappropriation had been discovered by the Attorney General and a demand had been made upon him for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The taking and spending by this receiver for his own use, whether with or without the concurrence or advice of the other receivers, of more than $10,000 of the funds in his possession as an officer and representative of the court, was a gross breach of trust, tending to bring reproach, disgrace and distrust upon the administration of justice, and was a contempt of the authority of the court, and punishable, according to the law of the land and the established practice of all courts of similar jurisdiction, by fine or imprisonment at the discretion of the court. The object of an attachment and commitment for a gross contempt of this nature being not merely to compel restoration of the money illegally taken, but to punish the offender, the discretion of the court cannot be controlled by the fact of his not having the present means of repaying what he has abstracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The appellant had full and sufficient notice of the nature of the contempt with which he was charged, by the terms of the order to show cause why an attachment should not issue against him, and by the affidavit of one of the receivers upon which that order was founded. He was fully heard in person and by counsel in his defence. And his offence is clearly set forth in the decree adjudging him guilty of contempt and in the warrant of commitment issued thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>It is unnecessary to consider how far that decree is the subject of appeal; because, for the reasons above stated, we are of opinion that there is no error of law in the proceedings, and that upon the facts of the case the discretion of the court was wisely and justly exercised by sentencing him to imprisonment for six months unless sooner discharged by further order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
