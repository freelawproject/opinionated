There had been an earlier trial of the case and plaintiff perhaps assumed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the familiarity of both sides with the factual background as developed in the former trial lingered on in the courtroom like perfume from the tomb of some long-dead Egyptian.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">At the second trial no witness was sworn; four exhibits of plaintiff were marked for identification. Plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 1,. a copy of a notice of dissolution of a partnership known as Lido Castaway between defendant and John J. Cirillo, which was signed by 'defendant and published on July 18, 1962, was received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 2 for identification is a certified copy of an order of the referee in bankruptcy of the bankrupt estate of John J. Cirillo. It was made July 20, 1962, and it confirmed to plaintiff the sale for $300 of \u201call the right, title and interest\u201dof Cirillo \u201cin and to the partnership known as \u2018Lido Castaway.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s exhibits 3 and 4 for identification were a reporter\u2019s transcript of the proceedings in bankruptcy,- and the notice of the meeting of creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Defendant\u2019s objections to the introduction of plaintiff\u2019s exhibits 3 and 4 for identification were sustained; his objection to plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 2 was overruled. Nevertheless, plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 2 is not marked as having been received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Upon this state of the record, plaintiff rested. Following the granting of defendant\u2019s motion, findings were prepared and signed. Finding No. 1 was that Cirillo was adjudicated a bankrupt on April 26, 1962, and that the referee purported to take jurisdiction of Cirillo\u2019s partnership interest and to sell such interest to defendant and confirmed such sale to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">The other findings were that plaintiff was not the owner of a one-half interest in any of the specific property described in the complaint and was not entitled to possession thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">The judgment went beyond the findings to adjudge that plaintiff has no right, title or interest either in the personal property described in the complaint and findings, or in <em>that business known as the \u201cLido Castaway.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">The defendant\u2019s answer alleged that by written agreement dated October 29, 1960, defendant Howard N. Whittaker and defendant John J. Cirillo entered into a partnership; that certain of the assets of such partnership consisted of certain of the property 'described in plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">Cirillo\u2019s bankruptcy dissolved the partnership. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 15031, subd. (5)) but did not terminate the partner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>ship (Corp. Code, \u00a7 15030) in the absence of specific agreement that it should have that effect, of which there is no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Cirillo was a coowner of the specific partnership property, but his right therein was not separately assignable and was not subject to execution. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 15025.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Cirillo\u2019s interest in the partnership was-his share of the profits and surplus; that interest was personal property (Corp. Code, \u00a7 15026) ; that interest was assignable (Corp. Code, \u00a7 15027), and its assignment transferred to- the assignee the right to an accounting (Corp. Code, \u00a7 15027, subd. (2); Chatten <em>v. Martell, </em>166 Cal.App.2d 545 [333 P.2d 364]).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The sale of the bankrupt\u2019s interest in the partnership did not purport to do more than transfer Cirillo\u2019s interest in the partnership. It was not a sale of particular assets. <em>(Anderson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>131 F.Supp. 501, 503.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Unless there was a different agreement, the non-bankrupt partner had the right to wind up the partnership affairs. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 15037.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The rights of Cirillo and his assignee to share in any surplus upon the winding up of the partnership affairs are as set forth in section 15038, Corporations Code, notwithstanding that Cirillo may wrongfully have brought about the dissolution of the partnership. <em>(Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, </em>45 Cal.2d 804 [291 P.2d 25, 55 A.L.R.2d 1385].)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Since the assignment to plaintiff did. not vest him with title to any specific property, the motion for judgment was properly granted. The findings of fact are supported because of the lack of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">Because the judgment might be subject to misinterpretation should there be proceedings for accounting between the parties, we deem it proper to modify it so that the second paragraph, commencing with the words \u201c It Is Adjudged \u2019 \u2019 on line 1, and ending with the words \u201cand equipment thereon\u201d on line 4, be amended to read as follows: \u201cIt Is Adjudged that plaintiff Peter J. Stathis has no right, title or interest in and to any of the furniture, fixtures and equipment located at Lido Castaway, 730 Lido Park Drive, Newport Beach, California, nor in any other property owned by the business known as Lido Castaway, nor in . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">The judgment is modified in the particulars herein set forth; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed, with costs1 to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">Brown (Gerald), P. J., and Coughlin, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
