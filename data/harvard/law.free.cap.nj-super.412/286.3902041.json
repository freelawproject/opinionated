The Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC) has determined that assistant superintendents and apprentice assistant superintendents employed in the Burlington County Weights and Measures Department are policemen simply because a public employee holding that position has the statutory authority to arrest if a provision of the Weights and Measures Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>51:1-1 to 51:1-133, is violated in his or her presence. <em>N.J.S.A </em>51:1-106. We conclude that PERC has given greater effect to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3 than the Legislature intended and, for that reason, reverse and remand to permit PERC to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">On June 26, 2007, the New Jersey State Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association, Local 203 (PBA Local 203) filed a petition with PERC seeking to represent Burlington County\u2019s assistant superintendents and apprentice assistant superintendents of weights and measures. The employees holding the positions were then represented by the Communications Workers of America, Local 1034 (CWA), but they had expressed interest adequate to permit consideration of PBA Local 203\u2019s application. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>19:10-1.1; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:11-1.1; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:11-2.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>On May 16, 2008, following precedent established by PERC in <em>In re County of Warren, </em>12 <em>NJPER </em>357 (\u00b6 17134 1986), the Director determined that the employees were \u201cpolicemen\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3, severed them from the CWA, which admits employees other than policemen to membership, and directed an election to permit them to choose between no representation and representation by PBA Local 203. While the Director adhered to PERC\u2019s decision in <em>County of Warren, </em>he observed that the facts of this case might warrant PERC\u2019s reconsideration of that precedent. Burlington County and CWA sought review by PERC, and PERC stayed the election and granted review. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:ll-8.2(a)(l). On September 25, 2008, PERC issued its final decision, reaffirming <em>County of Warren </em>and affirming the Director\u2019s application of its holding, dissolving the stay and remanding the matter to schedule the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">On October 31, 2008, PERC conducted the election, which resulted in a unanimous vote in favor of representation by PBA Local 203. The Director certified the results of this election on November 12, 2008, establishing PBA Local 203 as the elected representative of all full-time and part-time weights and measures assistant superintendents and apprentices employed by Burlington County.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">CWA now appeals and challenges PERC\u2019s determination that the employees affected are \u201cpolicemen\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3 and, therefore, prohibited from belonging to a union that admits non-police employees to membership. PERC and PBA Local 203 have submitted briefs in support of PERC\u2019s determination, and we granted the New Jersey State PBA leave to participate as amicus curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">The history of the union membership and the duties, responsibilities and authority of officers employed by the Burlington County Weights and Measures Department as assistant superin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>tendente are not in dispute. In his May 16, 2008 decision, the Director made the following pertinent findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">1. The County and CWA have signed a series of collective negotiations agreements which have included the weights and measures titles for more than 20 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">2. The County established a weights and measures department under the aegis of the Weights and Measures statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>51:1 <em>et. seq.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">4. The County uses the New Jersey Department of Personnel job description for assistant superintendent of weights and measures for its employees in the department of weights and measures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">6. The disputed employees test commercial scales, equipment, fuel storage tanks, pumps, food measuring devices and containers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\">7. The [New Jersey] Department of Personnel job description for assistant superintendent of weights and measures neither lists nor refers to any authority to make arrests. The description lists tasks including: conducting investigations of alleged or suspected violations; preparing reports of findings and action taken; appealing in court as an expert witness; investigating] complaints; withholding] seals; recommending] corrective action; filing] papers for prosecution of violations; halting] trucks to check for proper credentials ..., explaining] and interpreting] laws and regulations governing weights and measures; and inspecting], testing] and calibrating] various types of equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-10\">In the \u201cknowledge and abilities\u201d section, the job specification requires an assistant superintendent to be able to comprehend, interpret and explain basic laws and regulation procedures and standards applicable to weights and measures inspections; collect and compile evidence; act as a witness under oath; and \u201c[ ] to take a firm stand when controversies arise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-11\">8. The petitioned-for employees did not attend any police academy. They do not carry firearms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-12\">The County has prohibited assistant superintendents from making arrests. It is unaware of any weights and measures employee attempting an arrest of any person violating the weights and measures laws or regulations over the past 10 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-13\">If an incident alises involving an individual allegedly violating the weights and measures statute, the assigned County weights and measures assistant superintendent or apprentice superintendent is directed to immediately contact a local police department or County Prosecutor\u2019s office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-14\">Assistant superintendents of weights and measures and apprentice superintendents are ineligible to enroll in the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-15\">Weights and measures officers are issued \u201cbadges\u201d or identification cards after successfully completing a course of instruction under the direction of the State Superintendent of Weights and Measures. The identification card advises that the holder (an \u201capprentice\u201d) is authorized by the State Superintendent ... to enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>the New Jersey weights and measures statute____Neither the identification card nor the badge identifies the employee as a police officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Notwithstanding these findings, the Director and PERC relied upon County of Warren, <em>supra, </em>12 <em>NJPER </em>at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">We note initially that PERC is charged with administering the New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act (Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-1 to -29, and its interpretation of the Act is entitled to substantial deference. <em>N.J. Tpk. Auth. v. AFSCME, Council 73, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>331, 352, 696 A.2d 585 (1997). Appellate courts \u201c \u2018will not upset a State agency\u2019s determination in the absence of a showing that it was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, or that it lacked fair support in the evidence, <em>or that it violated a legislative policy expressed or implicit </em>in the governing statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Camden County Prosecutor, </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>15, 22-23,925 A.2d 63 (App.Div.2007) (quoting <em>County of Gloucester v. Public Employment Relations Commission, </em>107 <em>N.J.Super. </em>150, 156, 257 A.2d 712 (App.Div.1969), <em>aff'd, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>333, 262 A.2d 1 (1970)). \u201cAlthough an agency\u2019s \u2018interpretation of the statute it is charged with administering ... is entitled to great weight,\u2019... [appellate courts] will not yield to PERC if its interpretation is \u2018plainly unreasonable, contrary to the language of the Act, or subversive of the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23, 262 A.2d 1 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">PERC\u2019s interpretation of the law outside of its charge is entitled to \u201cno special deference.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, deference is not afforded when PERC\u2019s interpretation gives a provision of the Act greater reach than the Legislature intended, <em>N.J. Tpk. Auth., supra, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>at 351-52, 696 A.2d 585, and PERC must follow judicial precedents interpreting the Act, <em>In re Byram Twp. Bd. of Ed., </em>152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>12, 22, 377 A.2d 745 (App.Div.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">With those standards in mind, we consider the parties\u2019 contentions. CWA argues that statutory authorization to arrest only for violations of the weights and measures law does not make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>these assistant superintendents and apprentices \u201cpolicemen\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3. PBA Local 203 contends that PERC correctly followed its own precedent in a manner \u201cconsistent with the law and case precedent.\u201d Amicus curiae similarly contends that the decision to sever weights and measures employees from CWA and affiliate them with PBA Local 203 serves the Legislature\u2019s purpose by ensuring that such employees \u201care not subjected to conflicts of interest that may arise that could impede the collective bargaining process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">As noted, <em>N.J.S.A </em>34.T3A-5.3 provides, with certain exceptions not pertinent here, that \u201cno policeman shall have the right to join an employee organization that admits employees other than policemen to membership.\u201d In enacting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3, \u201cthe Legislature was seriously concerned with preventing law enforcement officers, authorized to make detections, apprehensions and arrests, from joining an employees\u2019 union <em>which might place them in a conflicting position and create circumstances for possible divided loyalty or split allegiance.\u201d County of Gloucester, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 157, 257 A.2d 712 (emphasis added). In County of Gloucester, the court concluded that the Legislature\u2019s goal was avoidance of the potential for conflicting interests and divided loyalties. <em>Ibid. </em>The court reached that conclusion about the purpose of the law after looking to a federal statute limiting security guards from joining unions representing non-guards and judicial decisions construing that statute with a focus on a guard\u2019s duty to respond in the event of labor unrest and the inherent potential for conflict with fellow union members. <em>Id. </em>at 157, 257 A.2d 712 (citing <em>National Labor Relations Bd. v. American Dist. Tel. Co., </em>205 F.2d 86, 89 (3d Cir.1953)).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The issue in <em>County of Gloucester </em>was whether PERC\u2019s determination that corrections officers were not \u201cpolicemen\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3 was correct. <em>Id. </em>at 155, 257 A.2d 712. Based on the legislative intent of <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:13A-5.3 to avoid \u201cdivided loyalty or split allegiance,\u201d the court held that corrections officers are \u201cpolicemen\u201d by virtue of the authority granted to them under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A: 154-4. <em>Id. </em>at 157-58, 257 A.2d 712. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">All correction officers of the State of New Jersey ... shall ... in addition to any other power or authority, be empowered to act as officers for the detection, apprehension, arrest and conviction of offenders against the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\"><em>[ </em>N.J.S.A. 2A:154-4. ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The court in <em>County of Gloucester </em>reasoned that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A: 154-4 \u201cis unambiguous and plainly vests in correction[s] officers specific powers and duties <em>commonly exercised by the police,\u201d id. </em>at 157, 257 A.2d 712 (emphasis added), and concluded that the authority to act as police commonly act, whether or not exercised in the past, placed corrections officers in the same position as police with respect to potential for conflict and divided interests. <em>Id. </em>at 158, 257 A.2d 712. Thus, the court concluded that they were \u201cpolicemen\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3 who may not be in the same employee organization as non-policemen. <em>Id. </em>at 158-59, 257 A.2d 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">In <em>County of Warren, supra, </em>12 <em>NJPER </em>at 357, PERC, purportedly relying on the reasoning in <em>County of Gloucester, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 156-58, 257 A.2d 712, held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A85\">D like corrections officers, . . [weights and measures] employees have been charged with the statutory duty to make arrests____We believe that once there is a finding that an employee has power of arrest, it is not necessary to extend the inquiry into whether there is an actual or potential conflict of interest with non[-Jpolice employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-12\"><em>[ Id. </em>at 358, 257 A.2d 712. ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">PERC\u2019s decisions in <em>County of Warren </em>and in this case, however, do not follow the rationale of <em>County of Gloucester. </em>They rest solely upon <em>N.J.S.A. </em>51:1-106, which authorizes arrest by \u201c[aj weights and measures officer, on the violation of any of the provisions of this Title <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>51:1-1 to:13-3] within his view or presence.\u201d In <em>County of Warren, </em>PERC deemed that narrow arrest authority \u201cdispositive.\u201d 12 <em>NJPER </em>at 358. In this case, PERC concluded that because of that statutory authority to arrest there was no need to assess the potential for conflict of the sort the Legislature intended to avoid through this provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3. In effect, PERC has established a per se <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>rule based upon authority to arrest, no matter how narrow its scope, without considering the relevance of that rule to the Legislature\u2019s purpose in limiting the right of a policeman to join unions with membership that includes persons who are not policemen.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">PERC has misread <em>County of Gloucester, </em>and, as a consequence, has given <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3 greater reach than the Legislature intended. PERC, like courts, must strive to interpret the Act in accordance with its language and the Legislature\u2019s intent. See <em>N.J. Tpk. Auth., supra, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>at 352, 696 A.2d 585; <em>County of Gloucester, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 155-56, 257 A.2d 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The term critical to the question presented in this case\u2014 \u201cpoliceman\u201d\u2014is not defined. <em>County of Gloucester, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 155-56, 257 A.2d 712. Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-1, that undefined term must \u201cbe read and construed with [its] context, and shall, unless inconsistent with the manifest intent of the [Legislature ..., be given [its] generally accepted meaning, according to the approved usage of the language.\u201d That is what this court did in <em>County of Gloucester; </em>the court considered the reason and spirit of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3, the common understanding of the term \u201cpoliceman\u201d and related statutes addressing the duties and responsibilities common to police work. <em>Id. </em>at 156, 257 A.2d 712. In contrast, in this case and in <em>County of Warren, </em>PERC focused on nothing other than the limited authority the Legislature has given these employees to arrest for violations of the weights and measures law.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The language of <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:13A-5.3 and statutes addressing police work do not suggest the Legislature considers regulatory officers to be \u201cpolicemen.\u201d Statutes identifying officers who perform \u201cpolice work\u201d for the purpose of assuring that they are adequately trained to protect the public, provide some guidance but offer no support for PERC\u2019s determination. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-66 to -77. At the municipal and county level, the Legislature\u2019s efforts to train those who do police work include officers who have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>\u201cby statute or ordinance the responsibility of detecting crime and enforcing the <em>general criminal laws of this State.\u201d N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-67 (emphasis added) (defining \u201cLaw enforcement unit\u201d). The Legislature also included corrections officers; as noted above, they have that general law enforcement authority by virtue of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:154-4. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-67 (defining \u201cPolice officer\u201d). Neither county weights and measures officers nor any other county officers with authority limited to the enforcement of regulatory laws are mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The authority to arrest for violations of the weights and measures law committed in an employee\u2019s presence is not comparable to the general law enforcement authority granted to police and corrections officers. It is even narrower in scope than the authority to arrest granted to all persons. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2A:169-3 (giving constables, police officers and <em>\u201cany other person\u201d </em>authority to arrest for a disorderly person offense committed in his or her presence) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">PERC\u2019s extension of the term \u201cpoliceman\u201d to include these employees does not account for the narrow field in which they operate relative to the broad functions of persons commonly considered to be policemen. In <em>County of Gloucester, </em>it was the similarity of the authority of corrections officers and policemen that led this court to conclude that they were in the same position as policemen relevant to the Legislature\u2019s purpose in limiting the right of a policeman to join a union with members who are not policemen. 107 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 156-57, 257 A.2d 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">As far as we can discern, the limited statutory arrest authority enjoyed by these weights and measures employees does not pose the potential risk of conflicting interest and divided loyalties the Legislature sought to address. If PERC had followed <em>County of Gloucester, </em>it would have addressed whether the exercise of these employees\u2019 limited authority to arrest for a violation of the weights and measures law, alone or in combination with their other duties and responsibilities, would \u201cplace them in a conflicting position and create circumstances for possible divided loyalty or split <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>allegiance\u201d if they were to join a union that accepted members who were not policemen. <em>Id. </em>at 157,257 A.2d 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Unless PERC can articulate a reason based upon the Legislature\u2019s purpose in adopting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3 or some other provision of the Act, it exceeds its statutory authority by extending the scope of the Act\u2019s limitation on a policeman\u2019s right to join a union to public employees who are not commonly understood to be policemen or treated as such in other statutes that apply to policemen. <em>N.J. Tpk. Auth., supra, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>at 351-52, 696 A.2d 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">PERC\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cpoliceman\u201d includes any public employee who occupies a position in which there is any statutory authority to arrest, even authority that is limited to arrest for regulatory violations that have no. apparent relationship to any activity likely to be undertaken by the union or a coworker. Fashioned as it was without reference to the plain meaning or purpose of the law, PERC\u2019s per se rule has the clear capacity to reach persons the Legislature had no intention to include. Ironically, the broad reading of the term \u201cpoliceman\u201d may have the effect of undermining the Legislature\u2019s intent by bringing members who have responsibilities quite different than those of \u201cpolicemen\u201d into a union with members who are \u201cpolicemen.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Accordingly, we concur with CWA that the employees\u2019 statutory arrest power alone is not sufficient to deem them \u201cpolicemen\u201d within the intendment of <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:13A-5.3. Because the per se rule PERC adopted in <em>County of Warren </em>and applied in this case apparently extends the scope of the statute beyond what the Legislature intended, we disapprove that rule and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">We do not vacate PERC\u2019s final determination, however. As PERC relied on the per se rule, we cannot know whether PERC\u2019s ruling is supportable on some other basis\u2014consistency with the Legislature\u2019s intention to avoid divided loyalties on the part of \u201cpolicemen\u201d that is inherent in the aggregate statutory authority of these employees but not apparent to us, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>N.J.S.A </em>51:1-106; <em>County of Gloucester, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 156-57, 257 A.2d 712; relevance to statutes governing arbitration for police officers and the \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d standard for negotiating units, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-14a to -16.6; <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:13A-5.2; or consistency with a proper exercise of PERC\u2019s general authority to administer the Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:13A-2; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:13A-5.2. The Legislature\u2019s broad delegation of authority to PERC in matters of representation demands that PERC apply its expertise to address the petition anew without reliance on the per se rule we have disapproved and in light of the arguments presented by the parties. We leave the scope of the proceedings on remand to the discretion of PERC and decline to consider issues that PERC has not yet addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in conformity with the decision. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
