(petitioner) appeals the December 4, 2008 final agency decision of the Department of Human Services, Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (Division), affirming a transfer penalty imposed on her application for Medicaid benefits. Petitioner sought the benefits to pay for the cost of her nursing home care. The transfer penalty was imposed based on a determination that a \u201clife care contract\u201d (LCC) between petitioner and her daughter, in which petitioner made a lump sum advance payment to her daughter for the future provision of personal care services, was not a transfer for fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Upon notification of the imposition of the transfer penalty, petitioner appealed and the case was transmitted to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL). The matter was decided by way of summary decision, over petitioner\u2019s objection, on stipulated facts and oral argument. The Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (ALJ) September 8, 2008 initial decision upholding the imposition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>transfer penalty was adopted and amplified on December 4, 2008 by the Division. This appeal followed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">When the Middlesex County Board of Social Services (Board) advised petitioner of the transfer penalty on February 28, 2008, it was due to, among other items, the advance payment of $56,550 on account of the LCC, to her daughter E.K. during the look-back period. The look-back period is a fixed term of months preceding an application for Medicaid benefits in which transfers of assets or income are closely scrutinized to determine if they were made for the sole purpose of Medicaid qualification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See H.K v.

THE CAREGIVER IS NOT OBLIGATED TO DEVOTE FULL TIME TO THE RESIDENT\u2019S CARE. <em>The Resident and the Caregiver recognize and acknowledge that the Caregiver has her mm professional or familial responsibilities to career and family. The Caregiver is, therefore, not obligated to devote her entire time, attention and energies to the business of the Resident </em>The Caregiver shall, to the best of her ability, devote as much of her time that is not devoted to career and family to fulfill her obligations under this Contract. However, the Caregiver shall be on-call at all times and available to assist the Resident within a reasonable period of time after being contacted by the Resident or by a staff person of a facility in which she resides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">SECTION 11. COMPENSATION. The Resident shall pay and the Caregiver agrees to accept, in payment of the aforesaid services to be rendered by the Caregiver, the compensation as computed below, which compensation the parties stipulate and agree to be fair, reasonable and of fair market value, commensurate with the quality and extent of the sendees provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\"><em>11.1 Hourly Rate. </em>The parties acknowledge that home health care aides who perform the services noted above generally receive $20.00 per hour and that geriatric care managers who perform such sendees on a contractual basis normally receive in excess of $100.00 per hour for them professional sendees. It is stipulated that the Caregiver receive $25.00 per hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\"><em>US Number of Hours. </em>The sendees to be performed by the Caregiver are to be furnished on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis over the whole of the lifetime of the Resident and, therefore, the hours that the Caregiver will in fact expend in performance of the Caregiver\u2019s duties will vary from time to time over such lifetime. At times it may be necessary for the Caregiver to perform 40 or more hours of services per week, and at times less than that. The parties stipulate that, over the lifetime of the Resident, it is expected that the average time which the Caregiver will expend will be 15 hours per week or more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\"><em>11.5 Payment. </em>As shown above, the total amount payable to the Caregiver hereunder is $56,550.00. The Caregiver may elect to receive payment over more than one tax year, but <em>the full amount due is not dependent upon the precise amount of work performed in any tax year, as the Resident\u2019s obligation accrues upon signing of this Contract. </em>The Resident agrees that the unpaid portion shall be a claim against her estate at the time of death, regardless of whether she lived longer than 6.2[sic] years from the date this contract is signed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>SECTION 13.

It must not offend either the state or federal constitution and must be in accord with the agency\u2019s legislative mandate. <em>See ibid. </em>(citations omitted). \u201cThe burden of demonstrating that the agency\u2019s action was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable rests upon the [.party] challenging the administrative action.\u201d <em>In re Arenas, </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>440, 443-44, 897 A.2d 442 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>219, 902 A.2d 1236 (2006) (citations omitted). <em>See also Barone v.

In this case, the ALJ decided the matter on seven facts stipulated by both parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">1. Petitioners[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] have each entered into a similar written \u201cLife Care Contract\u201d with a family member for personal-care services, and, pursuant to the contract, ... E.S. prepaid $56,550.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">2. The contracts were executed and payments made during the \u201clook-back period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">3. The length of each contract is based upon the actuarial life expectancy of each petitioner, but the family member with whom each petitioner contracted remains obligated to continue to provide services without receipt of further payment, even if a petitioner outlives her actuarial life expectancy, and the family member receives a windfall if a petitioner dies prematurely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-10\">4. The services to be provided by a family member to each petitioner under the contract are solely and exclusively for the benefit of that petitioner and may not be assigned or transferred to anyone else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-11\">5. Petitioners are elderly individuals within the meaning of the regulations governing the Medicaid program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>6. Petitioners have each applied for institutional Medicaid benefits and have been denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">Y. As a result of the prepayments made pursuant to the contracts, each county welfare agency determined that each petitioner transferred resources for less than fair market value in order to become eligible for institutional Medicaid benefits and imposed a transfer penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">A summary decision in an administrative proceeding is appropriate where the pleadings, discovery and affidavits \u201cshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>l:l-12.5(b). We apply the same standard of review on appeal as we would to the grant of summary judgment under <em>Rule </em>4:46-2(c). <em>Contini v. Bd. of Educ. of Newark, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>106, 121, 668 A.2d 434 (App.Div.1995), <em>certif. denied, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>372, 678 A.2d 713 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">A genuine issue of material fact exists when \u201c \u2018the competent evidential materials ... are sufficient to permit a rational faet[-]finder to resolve the alleged disputed issue in favor of the non-moving party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Piccone v. Stiles, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>191, 194, 747 A.2d 296 (App.Div.2000) (quoting <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 523, 666 A.2d 146 (1995)). Further, \u201c \u2018[a]n issue of fact is genuine only if, considering the burden of persuasion at trial, the evidence submitted by the parties on the motion, together with all legitimate inferences therefrom favoring the non-moving party, would require submission of the issue to the trier of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195, 747 A.2d 296 (quoting <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Petitioner asserts that a material fact in dispute was the Division\u2019s position that the LCC was not a contract under New Jersey law. The ALJ\u2019s decision explicitly notes, however, that the Division did \u201cnot challenge the validity of the [LCC], and even concede [d] that these contracts may have value.\u201d Another alleged issue of material fact is whether the hourly compensation rate selected by E.K. is fair. The amount is of no consequence, as the rate does not add anything to the analysis of whether the LCC had any fair market value. The facts petitioner claims are materi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>al are in reality mere straw men\u2014facts neither challenged by the Division nor relevant to the overarching legal question.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In reaching their conclusions, both the ALJ and the Commissioner relied solely on the stipulations, on the terms contained within the four corners of the LCC, and relevant law. The facts petitioner asserts create material disputes requiring a full hearing were of no consequence to the determination from which this appeal is taken. Hence, the ALJ\u2019s determination to proceed by way of summary disposition was warranted and the Division\u2019s endorsement of the procedure was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Petitioner next challenges the agency decision on the basis that the Director did not accord any fair market value to the LCC, and that he compounded the mistake by doing so in the absence of a hearing. As we shall discuss, the agency decided the question properly because the LCC indeed has no fair market value. It was merely a vehicle disposing of an applicant\u2019s assets in preparation for the Medicaid application process and that determination in this case did not require a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">New Jersey has codified the federal Medicaid guidelines, which \u201cprovide that if an institutionalized individual ... disposes of assets for less than fair market value on or after the look-back date ..., the individual is ineligible for medical assistance.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(c)(l)(A). <em>See also N.J.A.C. </em>10:49-5.3(a). The enumerated services include nursing home care. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(c)(l)(A). Only if the transfer was made for fair market value was petitioner entitled to medical assistance. <em>Ibid.; N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.7(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Petitioner relies upon <em>Reed v. Missouri Department of Social Services, Family Support Division, </em>193 S.W.3d 839 (Mo.App.Div. 2006) and <em>Brewton v. State Department of Health &amp; Hospitals, </em>956 So.2d 15 (La.Ct.App.2007) in support of the proposition that the LCC had fair market value. In both of these cases, similar LCCs were not found to trigger a transfer penalty. Both purport <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>to analyze the value of similar agreements after the date of application for Medicaid benefits. <em>See Reed, supra, </em>193 S.W.3d at 841; <em>Brewton, supra, </em>956 So.2d at 16-17. They are distinguishable on that basis alone, as the snapshot moment for assessment of whether an asset was transferred for less than fair market value is at the time of application, not after. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(c)(l)(B)(i); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71^1.10(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Additionally, as the Division counters, the cases completely ignore Congress\u2019s attempts to regulate devices created solely to shelter assets, and/or income, during the spend-down period, in preparation for application for Medicaid benefits. <em>See, for example, </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a(k)(2) (defining prohibited \u201cMedicaid qualifying trusts\u201d); 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(d) (specifying techniques for the creation of a trust for persons under sixty-five who are disabled, which trusts are permissible in some instances). <em>See also </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1320a-7b(a)(6); <em>Cohen v. Comm\u2019r of the Div. of Med. Assist., </em>423 <em>Mass. </em>399, 668 N.E.2d 769, 772 (1996). In fact, the DRA was enacted by Congress in 2005 for the purpose of preventing applicants from spending down their assets for the sole purpose of qualifying for Medicaid benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">By enactment of the DRA, Congress undertook to close loopholes in the federal statutory provisions governing the Medicaid program that had allowed individuals with sufficient assets to pay for their own medical care to qualify for Medicaid____ Representative Joseph Barton of Texas, stated that enactment of the DRA would \u201cmake it more difficult to hide assets so that wealthy clients can pretend to be poor to qualify for long-term Medicaid coverage in nursing homes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\"><em>[ N.M., supra, </em>405 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 362-63, 964 A.2d 822 (citations omitted). ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">In our view, <em>Reed </em>and <em>Brewton </em>are not dispositive, and petitioner\u2019s reliance upon the cases is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">Petitioner also suggests that the fact E.K. entered into the contract with herself is of no consequence under the authority of <em>In re Keri, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>50, 853 A.2d 909 (2004). <em>Keri </em>is enlightening, but not for the proposition petitioner urges.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">In <em>Keri, </em>an incompetent\u2019s court-appointed legal guardian sought approval for a Medicaid spend-down plan including a payment of $92,000 to be shared equally between the guardian and his broth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>er, the sole heirs named in the incompetent\u2019s will. <em>Id. </em>at 55, 853 A.2d 909. An additional $78,000 remained from the guardian\u2019s sale of the incompetent\u2019s home. Those funds were earmarked to pay the incompetent\u2019s nursing home bills during the fifteen-month period of Medicaid ineligibility, i.e., the transfer penalty. The penalty was triggered by the transfer for less than fair market value of the $92,000 outright payment to the sole heirs. <em>Ibid. </em>The guardian\u2019s plan was approved because the \u201cMedicaid spend-down plan [did] not interrupt or diminish [the] ward\u2019s care, involve[d] transfers to the natural objects of [the] ward\u2019s bounty, and [did] not contravene an expressed prior intent or interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61-62, 853 A .2d 909. Additionally, <em>Keri </em>was decided prior to the adoption of the DRA in 2006. There are significant distinctions between the facts in <em>Keri </em>and the circumstances in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The LCC in this case triggers a transfer penalty without otherwise providing for petitioner\u2019s care, unlike the circumstances in <em>Keri. </em>Another difference is that here there are at least two natural objects of petitioner\u2019s bounty, as petitioner has at least one other child living besides E.K., and she is left out of any distribution made to E.K. Furthermore, in <em>Keri </em>the guardian sought approval of the plan, with notice to all interested parties, prior to disbursement. <em>Id. </em>at 55, 853 A.2d 909. That preliminary step was not taken here.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">A resource or asset is defined as \u201c \u2018any real or personal property which is owned by the applicant ... and which could be converted to cash to be used for his/her support and maintenance.\u2019\u201d <em>H.K., supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 380 n. 3, 877 A.2d 1218 (citations omitted). Generally, \u201ca conveyance made during the look-back period raises a rebuttable presumption that the resource was transferred for the purpose of establishing Medicaid eligibility,\u201d thereby triggering a transfer penalty. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The Administrative Code defines fair market value as \u201can estimate of the value of an asset, based on generally available market information, if sold at the prevailing price at the time it was actually transferred.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-4.10(b)6. In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>words, \u201c[t]he value of a resource shall be defined as the price that the resource can reasonably be expected to sell for on the open market in the particular geographic area minus any encumbrances.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.1(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The LCC includes a provision which prohibits the assignment, transfer, or conveyance of the contract to any other party. Given those contractual restrictions, the LCC has no determinable fair market value whatsoever as defined by the Administrative Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Even if it were transferable, the LCC has no fair market value as defined by the Administrative Code because it exposes anyone standing in petitioner\u2019s shoes to such unwarranted risks. Only the caregiver reaps benefits from this contract. Were the contract to be cancelled by the resident, the caregiver \u201cshall receive compensation for past services rendered at the fair market rate payable to home health aides ... it shall be assumed [ ] that the Caregiver rendered 15 hours per week of care to the Resident____\u201d In other words, the caregiver is to be paid regardless of actual performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Should the \u201cresident\u201d die, the caregiver is entitled to full payment, regardless of services rendered. Should the caregiver die the day after receipt of the full payment on the first day of the contract, her estate can retain whatever funds remain although no services were rendered, as there is no recoupment even under those circumstances. When the resident dies, any amount still owing of the $56,550 \u201ceonstitute[s] a claim against the [resident\u2019s] estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">As the Director opined, few would enter into a contract such as the LCC that expressly allows an employee to tend to their other \u201cprofessional\u201d and \u201cfamilial\u201d responsibilities at the expense of their job performance. The lump sum payment was calculated through the application of a formula including a minimum number of hours per week with no corresponding duty imposed upon the caregiver to perform a minimum number of hours weekly in services. The LCC is worthless on the open market; it is specious to suggest otherwise. The Director correctly applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>pertinent statutes and regulations, which indisputably redlined the transfer in this case as one for less than fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u201cIt is settled that \u2018[a]n administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of statutes and regulations within its implementing and enforcing responsibility is ordinarily entitled to our deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wnuck v. N.J. Div. of Motor Vehicles, </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>52, 56, 766 A.2d 312 (App.Div.2001) (quoting <em>In re Appeal by Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>93, 102, 704 A.2d 562 (App.Div.1997)). The Division is entrusted with the responsibility of implementing federal and state law so as to not jeopardize the eligibility of New Jersey residents for federal Medicaid funding. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71\u2014 2.2(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The Director\u2019s eminently reasonable conclusion that the arrangement here did nothing more than shelter petitioner\u2019s assets for the benefit of E.K., and was a transfer for less than fair market value, was based on substantial credible evidence in the record. It advances the agency\u2019s legislative mandate and in no way offends either the federal or state constitutions. The LCC stands in stark contrast to the monthly personal needs allowance a Medicaid recipient in a nursing home is entitled to retain\u2014$35. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-6a.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Petitioner also contends that the State cannot adopt a methodology more restrictive for Medicaid purposes than that which is authorized for payment of SSI benefits. This argument also lacks merit. SSI statutes and regulations do not address nursing home care benefits for persons over sixty-five. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1381a; 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1382c. Therefore, the fact that 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a(r)(2)(A) states that methodologies employed in determining income and resource eligibility may not be more restrictive than those for SSI is not relevant to these issues. Furthermore, the argument was not made either before the ALJ or the Director. We therefore do not address it further. <em>Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Petitioner next claims that the rejection of the LCC in this case constitutes ad hoc rulemaking in violation of the principles enunciated in <em>Metromedia, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 329-30, 478 A.2d 742. This argument is also unpersuasive. The Supreme Court in <em>Metromedia </em>held, for due process reasons, that an administrative agency must conduct formal rulemaking before imposing new standards upon those that it regulates. <em>Id. </em>at 330-31, 478 A.2d 742. Six factors guide the analysis of when such formal rulemaking is necessary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">(1) [the decision] is intended to have wide coverage encompassing a large segment of the regulated or general public, rather than an individual or a narrow select group; (2)[it] is intended to be applied generally and uniformly to all similarly situated persons; (3) [it] is designed to operate only in future cases, that is, prospectively; (4) [it] prescribes a legal standard or directive that is not otherwise expressly provided by or clearly and obviously inferable from the enabling statutory authorization; (5) [it] reflects an administrative policy that (i) was not previously expressed in any official and explicit agency <em>determination, </em>adjudication or rule, or (ii) constitutes a material and significant change from a clear, past agency position on the identical subject matter; and (6) [it] reflects a decision on administrative regulatory policy in the nature of the interpretation of law or general policy, [/d. at 331-32, 478 A.2d 742.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">These factors, \u201ceither singly or in combination,\u201d determine whether agency action amounts to the promulgation of an administrative rule. <em>Id. </em>at 332, 478 A.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Having considered each of these enumerated <em>Metromedia </em>factors, we are satisfied that the decision to reject the LCC in this case was an unassailable exercise of the agency\u2019s pre-existing authority that falls well outside the scope of <em>Metromedia. </em>It affects a small fraction of Medicaid beneficiaries and involves the application of unambiguous statutory and regulatory requirements of long standing. There is no <em>Metromedia </em>violation here, and accordingly no violation of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">Lastly, petitioner seeks payment of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988 as a result of the agency\u2019s allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>arbitrary and capricious violation of established law and her civil rights. Procedurally, we are not inclined to consider this claim, as it was not made before either the ALJ or the Director. <em>Nieder, supra, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>at 234, 300 A.2d 142. In any event, it is so lacking in merit as to not warrant further discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\"> Prior to the adoption of the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) on February 8, 2006, the look-back period was thirty-six months; the DRA extended the look-back period to sixty months. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 19I7(c)(l)(B)(i); DRA, Pub.L. No. 109-171, DRA \u00a7 6011. Currently, most counties continue to apply the thirty-six-month requirement, although it is anticipated that all New Jersey counties will be employing the sixty-month term by 2011.
