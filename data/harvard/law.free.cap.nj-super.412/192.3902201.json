The Law Division ruled, as a matter of law, that the State was contractually obligated to plaintiffs for full funding of TPAF, but that, as a matter of fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>plaintiffs failed to show that the Legislature\u2019s funding gaps substantially impaired TPAF\u2019s ability to pay benefits for the next thirty years, so as to violate the Contract Clauses of the State and Federal constitutions. Accordingly, the Law Division dismissed the complaint, and plaintiffs now appeal. We affirm, finding that TPAF members, although entitled by law to the receipt of vested benefits upon retirement, possess no constitutionally-protected contract right to the particular level, manner or method of State funding provided in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Since its inception in 1919, TPAF has had the purpose of funding retirement benefits to public education workers. Upon retirement, benefits paid are based upon the retiree\u2019s final average salary and total years of service, rather than upon contribution or return on investments. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>18A:66-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">TPAF is governed by a statutory scheme enacted in 1967 known as the \u201cTeachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund Law.\u201d <em>L. </em>1967, c. 271; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-1 to -93, -3 (hereinafter TPAF Act). TPAF subsumed prior state pension funds for education workers and subjected them to this statutory regime. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-3 <em>to - </em>93. TPAF is governed by a seven-member board of trustees, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-56, with the Attorney General serving as its \u201clegal adviser.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-57. Its \u201ctechnical advisor\u201d is an actuary selected by a committee consisting of the Treasurer, directors of three Treasury divisions (Pensions and Benefits, Investment, and the Office of Management and Budget), and members of the boards of trustees of TPAF and the other State pension systems. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-57; <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:4B-1. The day-to-day administration of TPAF is canned out by the Division of Pensions and Benefits. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-57. As of June 30, 2006, the date of the most recent data available in this matter, TPAF had 140, 831 active contributing members. In FY 2006, TPAF paid pensions totaling $2,075, 424, 405 to 62,212 service retirees; $57,324,718 to 2,447 disability retirees; and $78, 099 ,815 to 3,955 beneficiaries and dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">TPAF is comprised of eight separate operating funds. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-16. Its funding comes from three sources: (1) contribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>tions from employee wages; (2) contributions from the general revenue of the State; and (3) the return earned by these contributions when invested in the fund. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-18. As to the former, for FY 2004-2007, active TPAF members were required to contribute 5% of their compensation to TPAF.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The employee contribution rate may be reduced in the event TPAF has assets in excess of its liabilities. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-18(b).</p>\n<p id=\"pAbn\">The State\u2019s contributions, as employer, are credited to TPAF\u2019s main fund\u2014the \u201ccontingent reserve\u201d fund. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-18. The TPAF Act defines the amounts to be contributed and, as a basis for computing those amounts, mandates that they be determined annually, using the \u201ctables [mortality, service, compensation or salary experience] recommended by the actuary which the board of trustees adopts,\u201d and the presumed \u201cregular interest\u201d rate of return on plan assets as set by the Treasurer. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-2(j), (i), -18.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">For purposes of determining the State\u2019s contribution to the pension fund, the actuary is required to use the actuarial value of assets rather than the market value. This method is designed to minimize the effect of market volatility. The actuarial value is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">The value of the assets to be used in the computation of the contributions provided for under this section for valuation periods shall be the value of the assets for the preceding valuation period increased by the regular interest rate, plus the net cash flow for the valuation period (the difference between the benefits and expenses paid by the system and the contributions to the system) increased by one half of the regular interest rate, plus 20% of the difference between this expected value and the full market value of the assets as of the end of the valuation period. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-18(b).]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>There are three components to the State\u2019s annual statutory contribution: a \u201cnormal contribution\u201d; an \u201caccrued liability contribution\u201d; and an \u201cadditional formula normal contribution\u201d (AFNC). TPAF\u2019s actuary computes these three components on an annual basis. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The \u201cnormal contribution\u201d or cost component represents the pension costs of the service rendered in a given valuation year by the active TPAF member, that is the pension benefits members will accrue due to their service during the upcoming fiscal year. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-18(a); <em>L. </em>1994, c. 62, \u00a7 2. For the years in question, the normal contribution computed by the TPAF actuary grew from $448,664,518 in FY 2004 to $560,691,960 in FY 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The \u201caccrued liability contribution\u201d is an amortization payment addressing TPAF\u2019s \u201cunfunded accrued liability\u201d, which is the amount of \u201cthe accrued liability of the retirement system\u201d that is not \u201calready covered by the assets of the retirement systemf.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:66-18(b). If such liability exists, the actuary calculates the \u201caccrued liability contribution[s]\u201d needed to amortize it over thirty years. <em>Ibid. </em>The accrued liability component of the State\u2019s statutory contribution began in FY 2004 as $85.8 million and grew to $500.7 million in FY 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The final component of the State\u2019s statutory contribution\u2014 AFNC\u2014represents the additional benefit cost of the improved pension benefit payable to TPAF members with the enactment of <em>L. </em>2001, c. 133 (Chapter 133). In 2001, the TPAF retirement benefit was enhanced by reducing the divisor for a member\u2019s years of service from sixty to fifty-five. <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:66-5.1, - 35, -37, -44, -71; <em>L. </em>2001, c. 133, \u00a7 4-7, 15. The State\u2019s liability for the benefit enhancement due to the change in formula, also known as the \u201cadditional formula normal cost[,]\u201d would be payable out of the \u201cbenefit enhancement fund\u201d (BEF) created for that purpose. <em>N.J.SA </em>18Aj66-16, -42.2. Each year, the excess valuation assets that remained after application to the normal contribution would be credited to the BEF, until it equaled the present value of the plan\u2019s total liability for the benefit enhancement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-18(b), -42.2. The Legislature ensured at least the initial existence of excess valuation assets by declaring TPAF\u2019s valuation assets as of June 30,1999, to be \u201cthe full market value of the assets as of that date,\u201d which was considerably higher than their actuarial value at that time. <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:66-18(b). For any year when the BEF lacked sufficient assets to cover the benefit enhancement, the State would be obliged to contribute the difference. <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:66-18, -42.2. In 2001, the excess valuation assets were $1.9959 billion; by 2004 they were depleted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The TPAF Act declares \u201cthe creation and maintenance of reserves\u201d to pay benefits to be \u201cobligations of the State.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-33. It provides that the State \u201cshall\u201d make an annual contribution in accordance with the TPAF trustees\u2019 \u201citemized estimate of the amounts necessary.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The trustees, in reliance on the actuary\u2019s recommendations, must certify the contributions, \u201cwhich shall be made by the State to the contingent reserve fund.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-58(b).

However, they also reserve the State\u2019s right to alter the \u201cretirement systems and funds,\u201d and they deny that members have rights in the pension funds themselves:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">Except as expressly provided herein and only to the extent so expressly provided, nothing in this act shall be deemed to (1) limit the right of the State to alter, modify or amend such retirement systems and funds, or (2) create in any member a right in the corpus or management of a retirement system or pension fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C-9.5(e)J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">In 1994, in the course of making modifications for all state pension plans concerning the procedures for valuing their assets and estimating the State\u2019s obligations, <em>see L. </em>1994, c. 62, \u00a7 2, the Legislature made certain pronouncements about the management of a pension system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">In order to ensure the continued State funding of the public pension systems at levels related to the fiscal and financial soundness of those systems and in order to ensure the fiscal and financial integrity of the public pension systems, the Legislature finds and declares that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">a. public pension assets must be managed and administered to maintain their value and ensure appropriate levels of return on investment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">b. the accumulated assets of the public pension systems and them economic enhancement exist for the benefit of the retirees and members of those systems;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">c. the statutorily-established benefits to which they are entitled belong to said retirees; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-12\">d. no present or future retirees of [TPAF and the other state retirement systems] shall receive any reduction in benefits as a result of the provisions of this act, <em>[P.L. </em>1994, <em>c. </em>62.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-13\">[L. 1994, c. 62, \u00a7 1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">Despite these statutory admonitions, in FY 2004 and 2005, the Legislature made no TPAF appropriation, and in FY 2006 and 2007, appropriated monies to the TPAF less than the full statutory contribution calculated by the TPAF actuary. According to plaintiffs, these shortfalls totaled $2.6 billion, inclusive of the realloca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>tion of BEF assets.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consequently, in a series of amended complaints first filed on December 23, 2003, plaintiffs sought declaratory and other relief against the State, its former Treasurers, the New Jersey State Senate and General Assembly (collectively defendants), compelling the appropriation of $2.6 billion to remedy the TPAF funding gaps. Plaintiffs alleged the failure to fund TPAF in the amounts certified by the TPAF actuary violated the Contracts Clause (Count 1), Due Process Clauses (Count 3), and Unlawful Taking Clauses (Count 4) of the State and Federal constitutions; violated the Uniformity of Taxation Clause (Count 7) and the Debt Limitation Clause (Count 6) of the State constitution; violated the TPAF Act (Count 5) and other State pension statutes, <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:3C-9.1, as well as the Internal Revenue Code (Count 8); constituted a breach of trust and fiduciary duty (Count 2); and was barred by the doctrine of promissory estoppel (Count 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">On defendants\u2019 <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) motion, the Law Division, in a detailed opinion of July 15, 2004 and order of August 10, 2004, dismissed Counts 7, 8 and 9; merged Counts 2 through 5 with Count 1; and denied dismissal of the constitutional Contracts Clause claim, ruling that plaintiffs have a contractual right to \u201csystematic\u201d funding of TPAF and therefore to the soundness and integrity of that public pension system, protected from substantial impairment by the Contracts Clauses of the State and federal constitutions. Defendants\u2019 subsequent motion to dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction was denied in its entirety. In its opinion of May 25, 2007, the Law Division found material issues of fact as to whether the State\u2019s contribution levels for FY 2004-2007 had substantially impaired the fiscal soundness and integrity of TPAF.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The matter then proceeded to a four-day bench trial featuring expert testimony on both sides on the appropriation shortfalls and their effects. Briefly, the record demonstrated no standard defin\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>tion for the term \u201csoundness and integrity,\u201d and that the Actuarial Standards Board, an authoritative standards-setting body, had not promulgated standards for assessing the soundness and integrity of a public pension system. However, the 1993 edition of Actuarial Standard of Practice No. 4 does set forth \u201cgenerally accepted actuarial principles and practices\u201d for \u201cmeasuring pension obligations,\u201d and further indicated that, \u201cfunding methods,\u201d among other things, would be the subject of future standards of practice. Although this standard did not define the terms \u201cintegrity,\u201d \u201csoundness,\u201d or \u201csecurity,\u201d it noted that, \u201c[i]n many cases, benefit security depends to a significant degree on the accumulation of sufficient plan assets.\u201d Significant for present purposes, the standard declared that funding decisions are the prerogative of the plan\u2019s sponsor rather than of the actuary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">The extent to which benefits of a plan should be funded in advance of the date when they must be paid is a decision to be made by the plan sponsor, with the assistance of the actuary, in light of many factors, including regulatory requirements, collective bargaining considerations and alternative uses of money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In this regard, plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Vincent Amoroso, explained that the purposes of a pre-funded pension system like TPAF are to \u201cprovide asset security for the participants[,]\u201d \u201csmooth[ ] out\u201d the employer\u2019s annual contributions, and promote \u201cintergenerational equity\u201d by ensuring that all salary and pension obligations to current workers were funded by the current generation of taxpayers. Despite the admitted absence of any actuarial standards for achieving \u201cintergenerational equity,\u201d Amoroso nonetheless opined an assessment of TPAF\u2019s \u201csoundness\u201d should not be limited to TPAF\u2019s ability to pay benefits for the next thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">In the expert\u2019s view, TPAF\u2019s soundness had been substantially compromised by a growing unfunded accrued liability, compounded by the absence of earnings on the assets that should have been contributed by the State, but were not. He calculated that as of July 2006, if the shortfall were not restored, the lost earnings at the \u201cregular interest\u201d rate of 8.25% would total $8.5 billion in fifteen years, and $28 billion in thirty years, which is ninety-five percent of the market value of TPAF\u2019s assets at that time. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>According to Amoroso, the absence of those earnings requires that future generations make up the difference with higher taxes in order to maintain the statutorily required contributions. Nevertheless, the expert did not measure the effect of the FY 2004-2007 shortfalls on TPAF\u2019s capacity to pay retirement benefits over this thirty-year period. He also acknowledged that with the resumption of State funding of the normal cost and AFNC contributions, it was possible that TPAF could meet its obligations over the next thirty years if that unfunded accrued liability were \u201ccarrfied] ... into perpetuity[.7\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Defendants\u2019 expert, Kenneth Kent, calculated the amount of the unfunded accrued liability at $2 billion, not $2.6 billion, because the use of BEF funds for the normal contribution was permissible. In any event, due to the remarkable 17.06% rate of return on TPAF\u2019s assets in 2007-8.81% higher than the 8.25% interest assumption set by the Treasurer\u2014TPAF\u2019s value, in market terms, grew by an extra $2.3 billion above its assumed growth, an amount virtually equivalent to the funding gap of FY 2004-2007. But even if the unfunded accrued liability had not been redressed by the 2007 investment returns, and was instead \u201ccarried\u201d indefinitely from one year to the next, Kent\u2019s financial models showed that the funded ratio of TPAF assets versus obligations <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> would improve as long as appropriations equal to TPAF\u2019s annual obligations for benefits were resumed or phased in reasonably soon. The expert\u2019s models showed such results for the next thirty years, which he asserted as the longest period for reliable projection. Based on these assumptions, Kent concluded that the TPAF will continue to have enough assets to pay all retirement benefits for at least the next thirty years, despite the funding gap of FY 2004-2007. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>also noted that the State had a wide range of options to effect future funding of TPAF, including but not limited to changes to employee contributions and retirement age.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">After the close of evidence and extensive post-trial briefing, the Law Division issued an opinion on April 2, 2008, finding that plaintiffs failed to prove the FY 2004-2007 appropriation shortfalls substantially impaired TPAF\u2019s ability to meet its liabilities. The court reasoned in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">On this record, the court agrees with defendants that plaintiffs have failed to establish a Contracts Clause claim. First, during the FY 2004-2007 the assets in the TPAF grew steadily. Second, in FY 2007, the fund earned a return (17.06%) more than twice as high as that assumed by the actuary (8.25%). This resulted in the TPAF having an unanticipated influx of assets in a single year roughly equivalent to the State\u2019s FY 2004-2007 funding gap. Third, the evidence establishes there is no substantial impact on the long-term ability to pay benefits. In fact, Amoroso acknowledged the TPAF has sufficient funds to pay benefits over a period of thirty years. He testified, however, that the failure to fund the TPAF in the amounts required by the actuary will require future taxpayers to pay more than their fair share of contributions. He referred this failure to contribute [sic] as harming \u201cintergenerational equity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">The court rejects this notion of intergenerational equity as the guiding principle in ruling on the merits. Simply put, on this record, there is insufficient evidence to warrant a determination that the soundness and integrity has been unpaired by the State\u2019s funding decisions in FY 2004-2007.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">On April 14, 2008, the court entered judgment dismissing the complaint in its entirety.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">While we affirm the judgment dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, we do so for reasons other than those stated by the Law Division. <em>See Ellison v. Evergreen Cemetery, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>74, 78, 628 A.2d 793 (App.Div.1993) (\u201c[A]n order or judgment will be affirmed on appeal if it is correct, even though the judge gave the wrong reasons for it\u201d). In its July 15, 2004 opinion, the Law Division found that plaintiffs had contractual rights not only \u201cto the receipt of their benefits,\u201d but also \u201cto the soundness and integrity of the fund out of which those benefits are paid.\u201d Having declared a new, contract-based right to systematic funding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>of public pension systems, the Law Division then had to determine the effect thereon of appropriations shortfalls to ascertain whether the constitutional guarantee against impairment of contracts had been obligated. In our view, however, we need not decide whether there has been a substantial impairment because we find, as a threshold matter, no constitutionally protected contract right to the funding method adopted by the Legislature. Accordingly, the State is not contractually bound, in a constitutional sense, to pay the withheld appropriations to the TPAP.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The United States and New Jersey Constitutions both prohibit the impairment of contractual obligations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">No State shall ... pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\"><em>[U.S. Const. </em>art I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">The Legislature shall not pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts, or depriving a party of any remedy for enforcing a contract which existed when the contract was made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">[N.J. <em>Const. </em>art.

Members of the pension plan at issue in <em>Spina, </em>which the Legislature had enacted in 1920, had been entitled under its original provisions to retire at age fifty after twenty years of service. <em>Id. </em>at 393, 197 A.2d 169. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>contested the applicability of statutory amendments in 1944 and 1952 that only allowed retirement at age fifty-one after twenty-five years of service. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court noted that the 1920 legislation was a solution in itself, replacing a long history of unsound local pension schemes with one to which both municipalities and the State contributed. <em>Id. </em>at 393-96, 197 A.2d 169. Further, the significant reforms that had been enacted in 1944 and 1952, including the amendments at issue, were an attempt to finally \u201cachieve actuarial solvency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396-98, 197 A.2d 169.

The provision stated: \u201c \u2018In case there shall not be sufficient money in said pension fund created as aforesaid, the common council or other governing body <em>shall </em>include in any tax levy a sum sufficient to meet the requirements of said fund for the time being.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal citation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The <em>Spina </em>Court observed that the Legislature had reserved the right to revise the pension system before it. <em>Id. </em>at 398, 197 A.2d 169. It then ruled that the Legislature did not intend to create a contractual obligation for the municipalities, or to relinquish its authority to revise their obligations itself. <em>Id. </em>at 399,197 A.2d 169. Those rulings were in line with a previous ruling about the statutory requirement of contributions to amortize the pension system\u2019s accumulated deficit. <em>Ibid. See City of Passaic v. Consol.

The previous ruling was that the statutory requirement was not a guarantee of future funding equivalent to the creation of a State debt, \u201c \u2018but rather [the] present legislation merely provid[ed] that the State shall annually contribute to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>fund.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spina, supra, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>at 399, 197 A.2d 169 (quoting <em>City of Passaic, supra, </em>18 <em>N.J. </em>at 147, 113 A.2d 22). The statutory requirement at issue in <em>Spina, </em>mandating coverage of current shortfalls, was likewise \u201csimply an expression of legislative policy which remained within the control of that and every subsequent Legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399, 197 <em>A.2d </em>169.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\"><em>Spina </em>explained that \u201cthe general approach in our State\u201d is that \u201cthe terms and conditions of public service in office or employment rest in legislative policy rather than contractual obligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400, 197 A.2d 169. Our courts thus determine \u201cwhether a statute tenders a contract or merely declares a state policy\u201d by presuming the latter unless \u201cthe statute expressly calls for the execution of a written contract or confirms a settlement of a dispute.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Applying that test to the provision on which the plaintiffs relied, the Court held that \u201cthe 1920 statute did not result in a contract\u201d because \u201c[n]ot a word smacks of an intent to require or to permit one.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court further observed that attempts at the Constitutional Convention of 1947 \u201cto introduce a contractual gloss in this area have failed.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The <em>Spina </em>Court found the statutory language did not amount to \u201ca decision by the Legislature to part with its power of revision by thrusting a \u2018contractual\u2019 obligation upon municipalities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399, 197 A.2d 169. Although refusing to characterize the plaintiffs\u2019 interest a \u201ccontract\u201d that had been impaired by subsequent legislative amendment, the Court noted the plaintiffs had some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\u201cproperty interest[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 402, 197 A.2d 169, in their pensions under the 1920 statute, but expressly refused to define its precise nature: \u201cWe think there is no profit in dealing in labels such as \u2018gratuity,\u2019 \u2018compensation,\u2019 \u2018contract,\u2019 and Vested rights.\u2019 None fits precisely, and it would be a mistake to choose one and be driven by that choice to some inevitable consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401, 197 A.2d 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The Court then assessed the fit of the principles that it had set forth to the \u201cusual situation\u201d that inspires pension litigation, namely, \u201ca fund that cannot meet all of the present and future demands upon it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402, 197 A.2d 169. The Court noted that the question thus posed \u201cis whether the Legislature is free to rewrite the formula for the good of all who have contributed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It observed that even the states that had nominally embraced the contract theory and found a contractual obligation proceed to find that their state had nonetheless reserved the right to modify the pension system, which meant there was no guarantee that the pension system would in fact pay the expected benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 402-04, 197 A.2d 169. Accordingly, the Court found that the reservation of a right to modify eliminated the mutuality of assent that is the essence of contracting, thereby proving the unsuitability of contract as an applicable rubric. <em>Id. </em>at 404,197 A.2d 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Thus, the Court answered its question of whether the Legislature was \u201cfree to rewrite the formula for the good of all\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 402, 197 A.2d 169, by demonstrating that such freedom was recognized as necessary even in the states that nominally declared their pension systems to be contractual. <em>Id. </em>at 403-405, 197 A.2d 169. The Legislature\u2019s decision to amend the pension laws thus amounted to a \u201crevision\u201d for \u201cthe good of all who have contributed,\u201d a concept for which the <em>Spina </em>Court did not assay a definition or any parameters.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\"><em>Spina </em>did not address the precise -question of whether the plaintiffs had a contractually enforceable interest in future contributions to ensure the ongoing fiscal integrity of the pension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>system in that case. Rather, the Court recognized <em>only </em>a property interest in the existing fund, which the State could not simply confiscate. While a number of our sister states since <em>Spina </em>have found the nature of the interest at stake more contractual, and extended it to future legislative appropriations, <em>see e.g., Valdes v.

On the contrary, as opposed to West Virginia, whose constitutional scheme prohibits its legislature from amending the state\u2019s general substantive statutes with budgetary language, <em>Dadisman, supra, </em>384 S.E.2d at 825, New Jersey\u2019s constitutional Appropriations Clause, <em>N.J.

While the Law Division here correctly perceived a general evolution in pension fund jurisprudence <em>toward </em>an increased recognition of contract theory, its reliance on <em>Uricoli </em>as evidence of that trend in New Jersey seems misplaced. Contrary to supporting a robust and expansive application of contract law doctrine in New Jersey\u2019s public pension sphere, the Court stressed judicial deference to legislative intent in such matters. <em>Id. </em>at 77, 449 A.2d 1267. Recognizing \u201cthe vicissitudes of public policy and the shifting goals that are implicated in the pension laws,\u201d the Court empha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>sized that \u201cpension entitlement is in the legislative domain and that the subject is one which can be most appropriately addressed by the Legislature itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78, 449 A.2d 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">We turn now to the TPAF statutory scheme presently in issue. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-1 to -93. As noted the State\u2019s obligation thereunder is to create and \u201cmaintain!.]\u201d reserves to pay benefits. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-33. To this end, the State \u201cshall\u201d make annual contributions in amounts certified by TPAF\u2019s actuary, <em>ibid., </em>which ultimately \u201cshall\u201d be paid into TPAF\u2019s main fund. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-18(d), -58. The general public pension statutes also provide that the State \u201cshall\u201d make an annual appropriation for the pension funds\u2019 current liability and for authorization of the unfunded accrued liability. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C-9.5(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The Law Division in its July 2004 opinion, found these statutory references dispositive of a legislative intent to financially obligate the State to continually preserve not only TPAF\u2019s ability to pay current claims, but \u201cthe soundness of the system and the ability to make pension payments in the future.\u201d We disagree. The plain text of these statutes contains no enforceable right to any particular or systematic funding level or methodology in connection with TPAF.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Although use of the term \u201cshall\u201d is indicative of the strength of the Legislature\u2019s intent, we construe it as directory rather than mandatory since it relates to the form and manner in which the law is to be carried out and more clearly implements legislative intent. <em>See State v. Jorn, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>192, 196-97, 774 A.2d 507 (App.Div.2001); <em>Franklin Estates v.

The statutory language, considered in full, does not clearly and unequivocally express an explicit enforceable legislative commitment to a set level of future funding of TPAF\u2019s system. While TPAF\u2019s statutory scheme contains detailed mechanisms intended to improve the administrative efficiency and objectivity of the determination of the necessary contributions, the goal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>of actuarial soundness was also a feature of the legislation considered in <em>Spina.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">In our view, the concept of actuarial soundness does not appear to be a special characteristic reserved for projects with enforceable lifetime funding commitments, but rather an inherent and expected feature of any financing device that is intended to operate beyond the initial infusion of funds. Indeed, statutory language in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C-9.5(c) to the effect \u201c[t]he State shall make annual [contributions] ... pursuant to standard actuarial practices\u201d has been consistently present in our pension statutes for decades. <em>See, e.g., City of Passaic, supra, </em>18 <em>N.J. </em>at 144, 113 A.2d 22. By the same token, it is far from clear that \u201cthe individual legislator,\u201d who knew from <em>Spina </em>that embracing the concept of actuarial soundness did not create a contractual obligation, would have \u201cunderstood and intended\u201d the singular reference in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-33 to the \u201cmaintenance of reserves\u201d as creating one. <em>Spina, supra, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>at 405, 197 A.2d 169.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Nothing suggests that the Legislature intended to bind the hands of future legislatures in such a substantial way or to relinquish its sovereign power to deal with changing fiscal conditions. Of course, absent specific legislative permission, a govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>ing body <em>cannot </em>divest its successors of legislative power. <em>City of Ocean City v. Somerville, </em>403 <em>N.J.Super. </em>345, 359, 958 A.2d 465 (App.Div.2008); <em>Maese v. Snowden, </em>148 <em>N.J.Super. </em>7, 13, 371 A.2d 802 (App.Div.1977); <em>McCrink v. Town of West Orange, </em>85 <em>N.J.Super. </em>86, 91, 204 A.2d 10 (App.Div.1964). Here, there is no such legislative authorization. To the contrary, the Legislature plainly and clearly reserved to itself the right to \u201calter [or] modify\u201d TPAF, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C:9-5(e), just as <em>Spina </em>described for the pension scheme before it. 41 <em>N.J. </em>at 403-05, 197 A.2d 169. That the Legislature retained for itself the power of revision is contrary to any intent to confer private contractual rights to a systematic or particular level of State funding in the future. <em>See Pierce v. State, </em>121 <em>N.M. </em>212, 910 P.2d 288, 300 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The fact that plaintiffs have no constitutionally-protected vested contract right in systematic funding of TPAF does not mean that the pension statutes confer no rights at all. There is a clear distinction between the right to receive pension benefits and the funding method adopted by the Legislature to assure that monies are available for the payment of such benefits. As to the former, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C-9.5(b) provides that members \u201cshall have a <em>non-forfeitable right to receive benefits </em>as provided under the laws governing the retirement system or fund upon the attainment of five years of service credit in the retirement system or fund.... \u201d (emphasis added). The \u201cnon-forfeitable right\u201d means \u201cthat the benefits program, for any employee for whom the right has attached, cannot be reduced.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C-9.5(a). The essence of the right, acknowledged by the Attorney General, is the receipt of promised funds upon retirement, presumably at the rate fixed by law when such benefits were conferred. Indeed, the Attorney General concedes that in granting a non-forfeitable right to receive benefits, \u201cthe Legislature intended to create enforceable contractual rights.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Yet plaintiffs\u2019 interest in the fund does not include oversight of its administration or extend to future appropriations by the Legislature. Indeed, the general pension statutes expressly deny \u201ccreat[ing] in any member a right in the corpus or management of a retirement system or pension fund.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:3C-9.5(e)(2). Nor does the limited right conferred deny the Legislature the ability to fashion its ways and means in providing pension funding. Significantly, as noted, the State reserves the right to alter the retirement system and funds. <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:36-9.5(e)(l). To argue otherwise\u2014that the pension statutes forever removed legislative power of amendment\u2014would run afoul of our State Constitution\u2019s Appropriations Clause, requiring that the State\u2019s finances be conducted on the basis of a single fiscal year covered by a single balanced budget, <em>see N.J. Const. </em>Art. VIII, \u00a7 2, 112; and Debt Limitation Clause, <em>N.J. Const. </em>Art. VIII, \u00a7 2, H 3, prohibiting \u201c \u2018one Legislature from incurring debts which subsequent Legislatures would be obliged to pay, without prior approval by public referendum.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Camden, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 152, 411 A.2d 462 (quoting <em>New Jersey Sports &amp; Exposition Auth., supra, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 13-14, 292 A.2d 545). Thus, we read the funding provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C-9.5(c) as not giving rise to an enforceable right in future appropriations, but rather as accommodating section (b) by stating the principle that the right of members to receive the benefits accruing to their past service was non-forfeitable because those benefits represented compensation, rather than a \u201cgratuity\u201d that the employer may withhold without cause. <em>See Uricoli, supra, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>at 71-73, 449 A.2d 1267 (\u201c[TJhere is a current, ongoing evolution away from the concept of a pension simply as a gratuitous benefit and toward an acceptance of it as deferred compensation for public employees upon retirement.\u201d) By not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>further extending that right, the Legislature preserved the ability of successor legislatures to decide the precise manner, method, and amount of pension funding.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In conclusion, we find no constitutionally-protected contract right to systematic funding of the TPAF. Any such right is foreclosed by: (1) our own constitutional jurisprudence, which never recognized such a right and in 1947 rejected a proposal that would have expressly designated public employee pension benefits as contractual; (2) well-settled constitutional principles placing limitations upon any legislature to bind its successors as to appropriations and impliedly suspending prior fiscal enactments by each annual Appropriations Act; (3) Supreme Court precedent in <em>Spina\\ </em>explicitly rejecting a \u201ccontractual\u201d basis for State employee retirement benefits; and (4) current provisions of our pension statutes and their legislative history, which do not clearly and unambiguously evince a legislative intent to extend a nonforfeitable right to pension benefits to future appropriations. Having concluded there is no such constitutionally-protected contract right, we need not determine the prospective effect of the appropriations shortfalls in FY 2004-2007, and whether they constitute a \u201csubstantial impairment\u201d in any constitutional sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-9\"> This contribution rate has been raised to 5.5% beginning in FY 2008. <em>L </em>2007, c. 103, \u00a7 1; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b225-10\"> For FY 2006-2008, the Treasurer lowered the regular interest rate of 8.75% to 8.25%.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b225-11\"> The market value of TPAF's assets grew from $28,618,463,144 in FY 2004 to $31,495,000,296 in FY 2006, while the actuarial value of assets grew from $34,633,790,549 in FY 2004 to $35,422,799,539 in FY 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\"> From FY 2004 to 2007, the State's normal contribution grew at a steady rate, from $448.7 million to $560.1 million.

At the time, a representative of the New Jersey Teachers' Association urged adoption of an alternate proposal, S. 1132, rather than S. 1119. The S. 1132 proposal sought to establish in vested members of TPAF \"a contractual property right to a secure and financially sound retirement system.\" However, that version was not adopted and S. 1119, to which the ''non-forfeitable right\u201d language was later added, was ultimately enacted in Chapter 113.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
