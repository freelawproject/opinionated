PBA Local 124 v. Twp. of Middletown (Middletown II), </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>1, 13, 935 A.2d 516 (2007).

No contractual modification was contained in either agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>By letter dated August 28, 2008 from counsel for the Point Pleasant PBA to counsel for the Borough of Point Pleasant, the PBA called attention to an alleged conflict between Borough Ordinance \u00a7 14-19.1 and <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:10-23, stating that, in accordance with the statute \u201cthe maximum number of actual years of service which Point Pleasant may require as a prerequisite for post-retirement medical benefits is 25 years.\u201d The PBA requested that the Borough \u201ctake immediate steps to amend [its] ordinance so as to bring it into compliance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-23.\u201d It was noted that there were several officers who had completed at least twenty-five years of actual service and had been \u201cimproperly deprived of their entitlement to post-retirement medical benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">On September 19, 2008, counsel for the Borough responded. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">It is our opinion that <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:10-23 clearly provides <em>discretion </em>to the Borough as to whether it wishes to adopt an ordinance providing for post-retirement medical benefits and under those circumstances provides a <em>minimum </em>year of service [sic] before which an employee is not entitled to post-retirement medical benefits being paid for [by] the Borough.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Accordingly, counsel declared that the Borough\u2019s ordinance was in compliance with the statute. He stated further that the Borough did not \u201cintend to modify or amend the ordinance to provide that the Borough will be responsible for post-retirement medical benefits for employees with 25 years of service with the Borough and 25 years of service credit in a State or locally administered retirement system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">On October 6, 2008, an action in lieu of prerogative writs was filed, naming as plaintiffs PBA Local # 158 and three retired police officers affected by Ordinance \u00a7 14-19.1, Richard L. Fennessy, Robert J. Wells, Sr., and Lewis E. Thompson. In November 2008, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment. The motion was heard on stipulated facts that included the service histories of the three individual police officer plaintiffs. The stipulation established that Fennessy retired on October 1, 2001 at the age of fifty-one, with thirty years of Borough service; Wells retired on June 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>2008 at the age of fifty-five, with twenty-eight years of Borough service; and Thompson retired on May 31, 2001 at the age of fifty-two, with twenty-nine years and nine months of Borough service.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 motion was denied in a letter opinion dated March 9, 2009. In it, the judge rejected the Borough\u2019s challenge to the timeliness of the prerogative writs action, which had not been commenced within forty-five days of the accrual of a right to review as required by <em>Rule </em>4:69-6(a). He held, pursuant to the relaxation provision contained in <em>Rule </em>4:69\u20146(c), that \u201cthe issue of taxpayer contributions to a municipality\u2019s payment of post-retirement medical benefits without cost to the employee is an important public rather than private interest which requires adjudication clarification.\u201d However, the judge rejected the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 position, determining that the Borough retained the authority under the governing statute and prior case law to condition municipal payment of medical expense premiums on thirty-five years of service with the employer for employees who retired before the age of sixty-five.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">It was evident from the judge\u2019s opinion that, if the Borough had sought summary judgment, it would have been granted. Accordingly, to avoid the necessity of such a motion, the parties agreed to the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 action with prejudice, subject to the right of appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\"><em>Rule </em>4:69\u20146(a) provides, with certain exceptions that are not relevant here, that actions in lieu of prerogative writs must be commenced no later \u201cthan 45 days after the accrual of the right to the review, hearing or relief claimed.\u201d However, paragraph (c) of that rule permits enlargement of that period by the court \u201cwhere it is manifest that the interest of justice so requires.\u201d In construing paragraph (c), the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">This Court previously has defined three general categories of cases that qualify for the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d exception: \u201ccases involving (1) important and novel constitutional questions; (2) informal or <em>ex parte </em>determinations of legal questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>by administrative officials; and (3) important public rather than private interests which require adjudication or clarification.\u201d <em>Bnmetti v. Borough of New Milford, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>576, 586, 350 A.2d 19 (1975). The Court has added that one of the \u201c[o]ther factors that will ordinarily guide courts include[s] whether there will be a continuing violation of public rights.\u201d <em>Reilly v. Brice, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>555, 559, 538 A.2d 362 (1988) (citing <em>Jones v. MacDonald, </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>132, 138, 162 A.2d 817 (I960)). Balanced against those interests \u201cis the important policy of repose expressed in the forty-five day rule. The statute of limitations is designed to encourage parties not to rest on their rights.\u201d <em>Ibid,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\"><em>[ Borough of Princeton v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of County of Mercer, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>135, 152-53, 777 A.2d 19 (2001). ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">As we stated previously, the motion judge found that the matter in issue raised important public issues that required adjudication. We agree, determining that the public has a significant interest in ensuring that its municipal ordinances are consonant with state law, that public funds are properly utilized, and that municipal employees are accorded the rights upon retirement for which they have bargained or they are otherwise entitled to receive. We note in this regard that, at oral argument, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel agreed that any relief that we might order would be retroactive only to the date that the complaint was filed in this matter, thereby lessening any financial impact that a ruling in plaintiffs\u2019 favor might have on the public fisc. In these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the motion judge in determining to relax the filing period set forth by court rule. <em>Reilly v. Brice, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>555, 560, 538 A.2d 362 (1988) (establishing standard of review as abuse of discretion). Having found reason to invoke <em>Rule </em>4:69-6(e), we decline to dismiss this action on the alternative bases of laches and estoppel proposed by the Borough.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">We thus turn to the merits of this dispute, a purely legal issue of statutory interpretation for which no deference to the trial court is required. <em>Manalapan Realty v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995). Our interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-23 is informed by rules of statutory construction that first require us to examine the plain meaning of the provision in issue. <em>Middletown II, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>at 12, 935 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>516 (citing <em>State v. Hoffman, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>564, 578, 695 A.2d 236 (1997); <em>State v. Szemple, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>406, 421, 640 A.2d 817 (1994); <em>Merin v. Maglaki, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>430, 434, 599 A.2d 1256 (1992); <em>Renz v. Penn Cent. Corp., </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>437, 435 A.2d 540 (1981)). If the statutory language is clear, we must enforce the statute as written. <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Phillips v. Curiale, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>608, 618, 608 A.2d 895 (1992)). Only if the statute is silent or ambiguous may we look at extrinsic evidence, including legislative history. <em>Ibid </em>(citing <em>Hoffman, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 578, 695 A.2d 236; <em>Szemple, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 422, 640 A.2d 817). Then, our primary task becomes effectuating the Legislature\u2019s intent \u201cin light of the language used and the objects sought to be achieved.\u201d <em>Hoffman, supra,, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 578, 695 A.2d 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The portion of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-23 at issue in this litigation is part b., applicable to employees who are less than sixty-two years of age when they retire. That provision requires (1) \u201c25 years or more of service credit in a State or locally administered retirement system\u201d and (2) \u201ca period of service <em>of up to 25 years </em>with the employer at the time of retirement.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The act establishing the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System (PFRS) defines service credit or \u201ccreditable service\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1(8) as service rendered for which credit is allowed as provided under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-4. The latter statute, in turn, defines as creditable service \u201cservice as a policeman or fireman paid for by an employer, which was rendered by a member [of PFRS] since that member\u2019s enrollment.\u201d Each of the individual plaintiffs in this case meets this qualification, since each has more than twenty-five years of service credit as a policeman as the result of his employment by the Borough of Point Pleasant. Additionally, each more than satisfies the requirement of up to twenty-five years of service with the employer, the Borough. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Middletown II, \u201cN.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-23 provides that an employee who is retired with <em>any </em>combination of service and credit will meet the twenty-five year threshold for discretionary health benefits.\u201d 193 <em>N.J. </em>at 15, 935 A.2d 516. Thus, statutory requirements have been met in this case. <em>Middle-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>town II </em>makes it clear that it is irrelevant that plaintiffs\u2019 service credits and service with the Borough coincide.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The issue then becomes whether, as a matter of discretion, Point Pleasant may change the statutory threshold for retirees under the age of sixty-five by not considering service credits at all and by requiring a thirty-five year period of full time service with the Borough as a condition of receipt of paid medical insurance benefits up to the age of sixty five. Point Pleasant argues that such discretionary action is lawful under precedent established in <em>Fair Lawn Retired Policemen v. Borough of Fair Lawn, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>600, 691 A.2d 859 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>75, 697 A.2d 547 (1997). However, the decision in that case turned on a construction of the requirement of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A: 10-23 that the cost of coverage be assumed \u201cunder uniform conditions.\u201d In Fair Lawn, the Borough established categories of employees for payment purposes, agreeing to pay full, one-half or no benefits to retirees with a minimum of twenty years of service depending on the date of retirement or date of hire. We found that, in establishing the categories, the Borough was attempting to conform to applicable collective negotiation agreements, <em>Fair Lawn, supra, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 605, 691 A.2d 859, and we found that it was proper to consider separately employees who worked and retired under different compensation/benefit conditions, <em>id. </em>at 605-06, 691 A.2d 859. We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">[GJiven the wholly permissive nature of municipal assumption of insurance costs under N.J.S.A 40A:10-23 ... we find no logical reason to hold that the legislature intended to restrict municipalities to an all or nothing election respecting employees with twenty-five years or more of service. If a municipality may freely decide under the statute to \u201cassume the entire cost of such coverage\u201d or not to do so, we see no reason why it cannot elect (or agree) to assume a portion of such cost. <em>[Id. </em>at 606, 691 A.2d 859.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">This aspect of our opinion affirmed only the existence of municipal discretion in establishing the quantum of payment offered by it. Significantly, we found that portion of the ordinance requiring only twenty years of service to conflict with the twenty-five year actual service requirement of the pre-1995 version of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A: 10-23. <em>Id. </em>at 606, 691 A.2d 859. We held: \u201cAs to non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>disabled retirees with less than twenty-five years of service who retired subsequent to enactment of <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:10-23, provision of a fifty percent payment is <em>ultra vires </em>and in derogation of the statute, unless they had reached the age of sixty-two with fifteen years of service with the employer at retirement.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, we did not permit the service requirements of a municipal ordinance to diverge from statutory requirements, and when they did so, we declared them to be <em>ultra vires.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Similarly, in <em>Middletown II, </em>when construing the provision of the current <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-23 requiring \u201ca period of up to 25 years with the employer,\u201d the Court said the statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgB\">empowers the municipality to set a minimum period of service <em>of up to twenty five years </em>within its own jurisdiction, if it chooses.... [T]he requirement of an ordinance or resolution is linked only to the establishment of a threshold. It is entirely up to the employer to decide what, if any, threshold should apply <em>up to twenty-five years. </em>The employer has absolute hegemony over the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">[ 193 <em>N.J. </em>at 15, 935 A.2d 516 (emphasis supplied). ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Nothing in the <em>Middletown II </em>decision suggests that a municipality, in its discretion, can exceed in its requirements the statutory twenty-five year actual service period.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">We recognize that <em>Middletown II </em>arose in the different procedural context of a challenge to an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A: 10-23, and particularly to the arbitrator\u2019s determination that the municipality\u2019s adoption of labor agreements that did not specify the length of municipal service required of its retired police officers compelled it to accept as sufficient any combination of service credits and actual service that totaled twenty-five years. We recognize further that the standard of review of the arbitrator\u2019s determination was whether it was reasonably debatable. Thus, it can be argued that <em>Middletown II </em>can be read as offering a permissible interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:10-23, but not a definitive one.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">However, our close reading of the <em>Middletown II </em>opinion discloses no language that would suggest the Court\u2019s disagreement with the arbitrator\u2019s statutory interpretation or an alternative construction of the statutory language. Moreover, we find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>interpretation to be consistent with the plain meaning of the statute, and to the extent any ambiguity may exist, consistent with the Legislature\u2019s goals as set forth when the statute was amended in 1995. We thus interpret the portion of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-23 at issue in this case to require at least 25 years of creditable service, with some of that service performed for the employer, in this case, the Borough <em>of </em>Point Pleasant. Although Point Pleasant could have specified the amount of service with the Borough that was required within the period of \u201cup to 25 years\u201d set forth in the statute, it failed to do so, and thus, as in <em>Middletown II, </em>any length of service with the Borough would suffice. <em>See Middletown II, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>at 15-16, 935 A.2d 516. However, the fact of the Borough\u2019s failure to enact an ordinance that conforms in this respect to the statute\u2019s grant of discretionary power is irrelevant in the present case, since all of the individual plaintiffs had actually served more than twenty-five years with the Borough and had thus met the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">As we have noted, Ordinance \u00a7 14-19.1 as presently enacted, does not comply with the length of service terms of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-23 because it exceeds those statutorily set forth. Similarly, because the CNA incorporates Ordinance \u00a7 14-19.1 by reference, it is likewise statutorily noneompliant. In <em>Middletown Policeman\u2019s Benevolent Ass\u2019n Local No. 121 v. Twp. of Middletown (Middletown I), </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>361, 744 A.2d 649 (2000), the Supreme Court discussed a similar situation in which the CNA between the Township and the PBA failed to comply with the pre-1995 version of <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:10-23. In <em>Middletown I, </em>the CNA was overly generous, providing paid medical benefits to all retirees, regardless of the length of service, despite statutory language requiring twenty-five years of actual service with the employer. Significant ly, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">the Agreement between the PBA and the Township offered continued health benefits <em>\u201cto all employees who have retired.\" </em>That contract, therefore, did not comply with the terms of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-23, because it permitted (in fact, required) benefits to be paid to employees who had not completed twenty-five years of \u201csendee\u201d and therefore was <em>ultra vires.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">[ 162 <em>N.J. </em>at 370-71, 744 A.2d 649. ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>In <em>Middletown I, </em>the Court found the CNA to be <em>ultra vires </em>in a secondary sense, and thus applied equitable principles to estop the Township from terminating the benefits of a retiree whose determination to retire was premised upon assurances that free lifetime health care would be provided.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 371-73, 744 A.2d 649. However, here, where the ordinance is more restrictive than the governing statute allows, equitable considerations do not come into play. What is significant to the present case is the holding of <em>Middletown I </em>that a CNA that fails to comply with state law is <em>ultra vires. See also Middletown II, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>at 13-14 and 17, 935 A.2d 516 (discussing this aspect of <em>Middletown I). </em>Ordinance \u00a7 14-19.1 is similarly noncompliant, since its effectiveness does not turn on the amount of service credit obtained by the potential retiree and turns on actual service periods that exceed those set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A: 10-23. It is thus likewise <em>ultra vires.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment entered in the trial court, void Ordinance \u00a7 14-19.1 in its present form,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> order that the Borough assume the cost of medical expense benefits for the three individual plaintiffs, and order that they be reimbursed costs incurred in procuring equivalent coverage during the period after the complaint in this matter was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-11\"> The Agreement is denominated a Collective Bargaining Agreement, but that is incorrect. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3; <em>see also New Jersey Tpk. Employees\u2019 Union, Local 194 v. N.J. Tpk.

However, at the time, <em>NJ.S.A. </em>40A: 10-23 required twenty-five years of service with the employer, which the retiree lacked. He thus did not meet statutory standards.
