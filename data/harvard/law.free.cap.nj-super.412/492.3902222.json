Handy appeals his conviction, following a guilty plea, for possession of a controlled dangerous substance (CDS) in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10(a)(l). The appeal requires us to determine whether evidence found during the search incident to Handy\u2019s arrest should have been suppressed because the dispatcher who incorrectly informed the arresting officer that there was an outstanding arrest warrant acted unreasonably under the circumstances, even though the conduct of the arresting officer himself was reasonable. We conclude suppression is required and, consequently, reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The following facts are garnered primarily from the testimony of Millville Police Officer Carlo Drogo during the suppression hearing held on August 18, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">On the evening of September 13, 2005, Drogo responded to a backup call from Special Officer Anthony Sills, who had stopped several individuals, including Handy, for city ordinance violations because they were riding their bicycles on the sidewalk. It appears that none of those individuals, including Handy, had drivers licenses or other forms of identification with them at the time. While Sills issued the appropriate summonses, Drogo collected the names and birth dates of the individuals and called the information into Millville Police dispatch to determine whether there were any outstanding warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Handy told Drogo that his date of birth was \u201cMarch 18, 1974\u201d and that his name was \u201cGermaine Handy,\u201d which he spelled for Drogo. He also informed Drogo of his address on Broad Street in Millville. Drogo provided Handy\u2019s name and date of birth, along with those of the other individuals, to the police dispatcher for the warrant check.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The dispatcher subsequently reported to Drogo that there was an outstanding warrant for Handy\u2019s arrest. Drogo informed Handy about the warrant, placed him under arrest, and conducted a search of his person. During the search incident to the arrest, Drogo discovered crack cocaine and marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">Only after Handy had been arrested and placed in the back of the police car did the police dispatcher inform Drogo that there was a \u201cdiscrepancy\u201d with respect to the date of birth on the warrant. Drogo transported Handy to the police station and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>attempted to verify the warrant. In the process, Drogo also found that there was a difference in the spelling of Handy\u2019s first name and the first name on the warrant, a discrepancy that the police dispatcher had either not noticed or not reported to Drogo.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The arrest warrant, which had been issued on June 6,1996, was for a \u201cJermaine O. Handy,\u201d whose date of birth was given as March 14, 1972, and whose address was listed as being in Los Angeles, California. The offense underlying the warrant was a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-38.1(b), now repealed, which makes it a disorderly persons offense to \u201c[e]xhibit[] to a police officer or judge in accordance with R.S. 39:3-29 any falsely made, altered, forged or counterfeited motor vehicle certificate of registration or driver\u2019s license, knowing the same to be falsely made, altered, forged or counterfeited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">According to the pre-sentence report, Handy\u2019s middle initial is \u201cA\u201d for \u201cAntonio.\u201d Although Drogo discovered that the date of birth provided to him by Handy differed from the one on Handy\u2019s driver\u2019s license and dates of birth listed under Handy\u2019s \u201carrest jacket\u201d in the Millville computer system, we note that it is the same as the date of birth listed on the pre-sentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Drogo placed a call to the Chesterfield Township Municipal Court, which had issued the warrant. The call was answered by automated voicemail. Drogo left a message inquiring about the warrant, but he never received a return call. Unable to verify that the warrant was for the person he arrested, Drogo only processed Handy on the new charge. The State offered no evidence at the suppression hearing that defendant was the Handy for whom the warrant had been issued ten years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Handy was indicted on December 14, 2005. Indictment No. 05-12-1153 charged him with one count of third-degree possession of a CDS. Handy filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized incident to his arrest. The motion was heard and denied on August 18, 2006. The motion judge found that the police dispatcher\u2019s behavior was \u201cunreasonable\u201d because the dispatcher failed to immediately inform Drogo that there were discrepancies with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>respect to the date of birth and spelling of the first name. The judge nonetheless determined that, although it was a \u201cclose call on the facts that [were] presented,\u201d the arresting officer\u2019s actions in searching and arresting defendant were reasonable in light of the information provided by the dispatcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">On November 2, 2006, Handy was indicted on additional, but unrelated charges. Indictment No. 06-11-1108 charged him with third-degree possession of a CDS, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-10(a)(1) (count one), and fourth-degree tampering with physical evidence in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:28-6(1) (count two).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Handy had moved for reconsideration of the denial of his motion to suppress. However, on December 20, 2006, he withdrew the motion and accepted a plea offer. He pled guilty to Indictment No. 05-12-1153, third-degree possession of a CDS, and to count two of Indictment No. 06-11-1108, fourth-degree tampering with physical evidence. In exchange, the State agreed to recommend three years imprisonment for the CDS charge and a concurrent one year of imprisonment for the tampering with evidence charge. The remaining charge was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">On July 20, 2007, the judge sentenced Handy in accordance with the State\u2019s recommendation as contemplated in the plea agreement. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Handy raises the following argument on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-11\">THE JUDGE\u2019S FINDING THAT \u201cTHE DISPATCHER WAS UNREASONABLE\u201d SHOULD HAVE RESULTED IN SUPPRESSION BECAUSE THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE APPLIES WHEN A POLICE DISPATCHER\u2019S ACTIONS RESULT IN AN UNREASONABLE SEARCH OR SEIZURE. <em>U.S. Const, </em>amends. IV, XIV; <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. 1, 1110.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">The Supreme Court has explained the standard of review applicable to a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Our analysis must begin with an understanding of the standard of appellate review that applies to a motion judge\u2019s findings in a suppression hearing. As the Appellate Division in this case clearly recognized, an appellate court reviewing a motion to suppress must uphold the factual findings underlying the trial court\u2019s decision so long as those findings are \u201csupported by sufficient credible evidence in the record.\u201d <em>[State v. Elders, </em>386 <em>N.J.Super. </em>208, 228, 899 A.2d 1037 (App.Div. 2006) ] (citing <em>State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 474, 724 A.2d 234 (1999)); <em>see also State v. Slockbower, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>1, 13, 397 A.2d 1050 (1979) (concluding that \u201cthere was substantial credible evidence to support the findings of the motion judge that the ... investigatory search [was] not based on probable cause\u201d); <em>State v. Alvarez, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 562-64, 570 A.2d 459 (App.Div. 1990) (stating that standard of review on appeal from motion to suppress is whether \u201cthe findings made by the judge could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record\u201d (citing <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 164, 199 A.2d 809 (1964))).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">An appellate court \u201cshould give deference to those findings of the trial judge which are substantially influenced by his opportunity to hear and see the witnesses and to have the \u2018feel\u2019 of the case, which a reviewing court cannot enjoy.\u201d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>at 161, 199 A.2d 809. An appellate court should not disturb the trial coui\u2019t\u2019s findings merely because \u201cit might have reached a different conclusion were it the trial tribunal\u201d or because \u201cthe trial court decided all evidence or inference conflicts in favor of one side\u201d in a close case. <em>Id. </em>at 162, 199 A.2d 809. A trial court\u2019s findings should be disturbed only if they are so clearly mistaken \u201cthat the interests of justice demand intervention and correction.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In those circumstances solely should an appellate court \u201cappraise the record as if it were deciding the matter at inception and make its own findings and conclusions.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\"><em>[State v. Elders, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>224, 243-44, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Our review of a judge\u2019s legal conclusions, however, is plenary. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 1, Paragraph 7, of the New Jersey Constitution both prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures. The exclusionary rule, which is one remedy for violations of those provisions, operates to preclude prosecutorial use of evidence obtained from unlawful searches and seizures. <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 <em>U.S. </em>643, 654-56, 81 <em>S.Ct. </em>1684, 1691-92, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081, 1089-90 (1961); <em>State v. Reid, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>386, 405, 945 A.2d 26 (2008). Its primary purpose is to deter future police misconduct. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The federal courts recognize a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, pursuant to which evidence will not be suppressed if the police officers employed an objective standard of reasonableness and acted in good faith with respect to a warrant later found to be defective. <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>897, 920, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>3405, 3419, 82 L.Ed.2d 677, 697 (1984). New Jersey, however, does not recognize a good faith exception. <em>State v. Novembrino, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>95, 153-54, 519 A.2d 820 (1987). We do recognize, however, that the exclusionary rule does not apply to all instances where mistakes are made in executing a warrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">The basic test under both the Fourth Amendment and Article I, paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution is one of \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d in light of \u201cthe facts known to the ... officer at the time.\u201d <em>[State v. Bruzzese, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>210, 221, 463 A.2d 320 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>1030, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1295, 79 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>695 (1984)]; <em>accord [Maryland v. Garrison, </em>480 <em>U.S. </em>79, 88, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>1013, 1018, 94 L.Ed.2d 72, 83 (1987)]; <em>see also United States v. Ramirez, </em>523 <em>U.S. </em>65, [69,] 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>992, 996, 140 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>191, 198 (1998) (\u201cThe general touchstone of reasonableness which governs Fourth Amendment analysis ... governs the method of execution of the warrant.\u201d). This reasonableness test may be satisfied even though the police have made a mistake in executing a warrant. As the Court observed in <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 <em>U.S. </em>177, 185, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2793, 2800, 111 L.Ed.2d 148, 159 (1990), \u201cwhat is generally demanded of the many factual determinations that must regularly be made by agents of the government\u2014whether the magistrate issuing a warrant [or] the police officer executing a warrant ...\u2014is not that they always be correct, but that they always be reasonable.\u201d <em>Therefore, if a police officer\u2019s actions in executing a warrant are reasonable, there is no constitutional violation and thus no need to consider the availability of a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\"><em>[State v. Green, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>346, 354, 723 A.2d 1012 (App.Div.1999) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Handy does not dispute the motion judge\u2019s factual findings, which we have determined were supported by the record. Indeed, he relies upon the judge\u2019s determination that the police dispatcher acted unreasonably and argues that the motion judge made an error of law in focusing solely on the conduct of the police officer in denying the motion. He argues that the judge should have suppressed the evidence on the basis of the unreasonable conduct of the police dispatcher, who informed Drogo that there was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>warrant for Handy without telling him about the significant discrepancies. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The United States Supreme Court has twice had occasion to analyze whether the exclusionary rule applies to conduct beyond that of the arresting officer. In <em>Arizona v. Evans, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>1, 15, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>1185, 1193, 131 L.Ed.2d 34, 47 (1995), the Court found that the exclusionary rule did not apply where a court clerk had failed to update the computer system to reflect that the warrant at issue had been quashed. The Court explained its reasoning, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">Finally, and most important, there is no basis for believing that application of the exclusionary rule in these circumstances will have a significant effect on court employees responsible for informing the police that a warrant has been quashed. Because court clerks are not adjuncts to the law enforcement team engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime, they have no stake in the outcome of particular criminal prosecutions. The threat of exclusion of evidence could not be expected to deter such individuals from failing to inform police officials that a warrant had been quashed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">More recently, in <em>Herring v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>695, 699, 172 L.Ed.2d 496, 503 (2009), the Court found that the error of a warrant clerk, who was a law enforcement employee in an adjacent county, in failing to update the database to reflect that the warrant had been recalled, did not trigger the exclusionary rule. The specific facts in <em>Herring, </em>which differ markedly from those in this case, were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">On July 7, 2004, Investigator Mark Anderson learned that Bennie Dean Herring had driven to the Coffee County SherifPs Department to retrieve something from his impounded truck. Herring was no stranger to law enforcement, and Anderson asked the county\u2019s warrant clerk, Sandy Pope, to check for any outstanding warrants for Herring\u2019s arrest. When she found none, Anderson asked Pope to check with Sharon Morgan, her counterpart in neighboring Dale County. After checking Dale County\u2019s computer database, Morgan replied that there was an active arrest warrant for Herring\u2019s failure to appear on a felony charge. Pope relayed the information to Anderson and asked Morgan to fax over a copy of the warrant as confirmation. Anderson and a deputy followed Herring as he left the impound lot, pulled him over, and arrested him. A search incident to the arrest revealed methamphetamine in Herring\u2019s pocket, and a pistol (which as a felon he could not possess) in his vehicle____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>There had, however, been a mistake about the warrant. The Dale County sheriffs computer records are supposed to correspond to actual arrest warrants, which the office also maintains. But when Morgan went to the files to retrieve the actual warrant to fax to Pope, Morgan was unable to find it. She called a court clerk and learned that the warrant had been recalled five months earlier. Normally when a warrant is recalled the court clerk\u2019s office or a judge\u2019s chambers calls Morgan, who enters the information in the sheriffs computer database and disposes of the physical copy. For whatever reason, the information about the recall of the warrant for Herring did not appear in the database. Morgan immediately called Pope to alert her to the mixup, and Pope contacted Anderson over a seeui'e I\u2019adio. This all unfolded in 10 to 15 minutes, but Herring had already been arrested and found with the gxm and drugs, just a few hundi\u2019ed yards fi-om the sheriffs office____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at-, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 698, 172 L.Ed.2d at 502-03.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The Court held that the exclusionary rule should be employed only when its deterrent effect is needed, rather than whenever there is an unlawful search or seizure. <em>Id. </em>at-, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 700, 172 <em>L.Ed,.2d </em>at 504.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">The extent to which the exclusionary rule is justified by these deterrence principles vaxies with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct. As we said in <em>[United State v. Leon], </em>\u201can assessment of the flagrancy of the police misconduct constitutes an important step in the calculus\u201d of applying the exclusionary rule. 468 <em>U.S. </em>[897, 911, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>3405, 3414, 82 L.Ed.2d 677, 691 (1984)]. Similarly, in <em>[Illinois v. </em>Krull] we elaborated that \u201cevidence should be suppressed \u2018only if it can be said that the law enforcement officer had knowledge, or may properly be charged with knowledge, that the search was unconstitutional under the Fouifh Amendment.\u2019 \u201d 480 <em>U.S. </em>[340, 348-49, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>1160, 1166, 94 L.Ed.2d 364, 374 (1987)] (quoting <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>422 <em>U.S. </em>531, 542, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>2313, [2320, 45 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>374, 383] (1975)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">... To trigger the exclusionary rule, police conduct must be sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system. As laid out in our cases, the exclusionary rule serves to deter deliberate, reckless, or gx-ossly negligent conduct, or in some cii\u2019cumstanees recurring or systemic negligence. The error in this case does not rise to that level.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at-, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 701-02, 172 L.Ed.2d at 506-07 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">The facts in the case before us are quite distinct from those in <em>Herring. </em>Rather than a past clerical error, such as neglecting to remove a no-longer valid warrant, the police dispatcher in this case inaccurately reported to the police officer in the field that there was an active warrant for Handy when, in fact, there were significant discrepancies in the spelling of the first name and the date of birth that were not reported at the same time, thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>causing the arrest of the wrong person.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Had the police dispatcher reported the discrepancies at the same time as the existence of the warrant, Drogo would have attempted to verify that the warrant was for Handy before, rather than after, the arrest. Inasmuch as he was never able to verify that the warrant was for Handy, the arrest and the resulting search would not have taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The deterrent value of applying the exclusionary rule in this case is, in our view, quite significant, especially in contrast to the low value under the factual circumstances before the Supreme Court in <em>Herring. </em>The police dispatcher is the crucial link between the officer in the field and police headquarters. The officer depends on receiving the correct information from the dispatcher, information such as whether there is or is not an outstanding arrest warrant for the person with whom the officer is then face to face. Misinformation either way has the potential to leave the officer either unaware that he or she is dealing with a dangerous criminal or arresting the wrong person.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The need to avoid the former is obvious and clearly in the best interest of the police officer in the field, the need to avoid the latter finds its basis in the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection of \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>See also N.J. Const. </em>art. 1,1t 7. The police officer in the field and the citizen on the street both benefit from a police dispatch system that is free of unreasonable conduct by dispatchers who fail to ensure that they are providing the available information about outstanding warrants as accurately and completely as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Although we believe our decision in this case is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Herring, </em>the courts of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>State are not required to apply federal search and seizure law in interpreting the search and seizure requirements of the New Jersey Constitution. <em>Novembrino, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 101-02, 519 A.2d 820. As our Supreme Court observed in <em>Reid, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 396, 945 A.2d 26 (quoting <em>Novembrino, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 145, 519 A.2d 820), \u201con multiple occasions this Court has held that the New Jersey Constitution \u2018affords our citizens greater protection against unreasonable searches and seizures\u2019 than the Fourth Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Our decision here is fully consistent with our decision in <em>State v. Moore, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>12, 16, 614 A.2d 1360 (App.Div. 1992), in which we held that \u201cthe fruits of ... an unlawful arrest are not available to the State for [the defendant\u2019s] prosecution even though the particular arresting officer acted in good faith and without culpability.\u201d In <em>Moore, </em>the defendant was arrested on a bench warrant that was no longer valid because she had posted bail and pled guilty to the underlying offense, but the court never recorded that the bench warrant was satisfied and the police never deleted it from their computer databases after the defendant\u2019s earlier arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 13-15, 614 A.2d 1360. We held that \u201cwhether the errors ... resulting in a bad arrest ... are attributable to law enforcement, judicial administration, or a combination of both does not matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17, 614 A.2d 1360. We placed emphasis on the fact that the purpose of the exclusionary rule in New Jersey is \u201c \u2018both to deter unlawful conduct and to vindicate fundamental guarantees.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>State v. Minter, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>269, 280, 561 A.2d 570 (1989)). Significantly for the purposes of this ease, we relied on Professor LaFave\u2019s assertion that \u201c \u2018the police may not rely upon incorrect or incomplete information when they are at fault in permitting the records to remain uncorrected.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18, 614 A.2d 1360 (quoting 2 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search &amp; Seizure </em>\u00a7 3.5(d) at 21-22 n. 75, (2d ed. 1987 and 1992 Supp.)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Here, the police were responsible, through the unreasonable actions of the police dispatcher, for conveying incomplete and inaccurate information to the arresting officer. If the citizens\u2019 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure is to be vindicated, then the exclusionary rule must be applied beyond the officer in the field and to the police employee who acts unreasonably in supplying critical, but inaccurate or incomplete, information under circumstances such as those before us. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Novembrino, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 153, 519 A.2d 820, \u201c[o]ne obvious consequence of the application of the exclusionary rule in New Jersey has been the encouragement of law-enforcement officials to comply\u201d with \u201cconstitutionally-mandated\u201d requirements. The Court declined to adopt the good faith exception because of its concern that \u201cthe good-faith exception assures ... that the constitutional standard will be diluted.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In our view, failure to extend the requirement of reasonable conduct to the police dispatcher under the circumstances of this case would have considerable potential to \u201cdilute\u201d the protections against unreasonable search and seizure guaranteed by the New Jersey Constitution and, we believe, the Fourth Amendment. Consequently, we reverse the denial of the motion to suppress and vacate the conviction under Indictment No. 05-12-1153. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for resentencing on the remaining conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-11\"> It is not clear from the record whether the dispatcher was a police officer or a civilian employed as a police dispatcher. At oral argument before us, the State conceded that the exclusionary rule would probably be applicable had the dispatcher been a police officer. We have concluded that it applies in either case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> The State\u2019s suggestion on appeal that the warrant may actually have been for Handy is simply not supported in the record. As previously noted, the date of birth Handy gave to Drogo is the same date of birth reflected on the pre-sentence report. In addition, the list of aliases in the pre-sentence report does not include \"Jermaine O. Handy,\u201d the name on the warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\"> The State's reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Diloreto, </em>180 <em>N.J. 264, </em>279-80, 850 A.2d 1226 (2004), is misplaced. That case involved a community policing action in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the defendant\u2019s status as a missing person had not been timely removed by the police from a database. <em>Id. </em>at 270, 850 A.2d 1226. In addition, the illegal weapons at issue were discovered during a pat down while defendant's status was being sorted out rather than incident to arrest on the basis of an invalid warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 269, 850 A.2d 1226. The Court itself placed emphasis on the narrowness of its holding: \u201cIt bears repeating that the most significant factor in our analysis (and a factor that should serve to narrow the reach of our holding) is that the police in this case were responding to an alert regarding an endangered missing person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 850 A.2d 1226.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
