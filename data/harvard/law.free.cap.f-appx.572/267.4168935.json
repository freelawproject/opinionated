Citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c), Orellana contends that the district court erred in failing to explain adequately its reasons for imposing a period of supervised release. As Orellana properly concedes, our review of this issue is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 327-28 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-23\">The district court should explain the sentence imposed \u201cto allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Little explanation is required where, as here, the sentence imposed is within the guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Cancino-Trinidad, </em>710 F.3d 601, 606 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-24\">In this case, the district court stated that it had imposed a three-year period of supervision \u201cto deter the defendant from reentering the United States illegally as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>measure of additional deterrence and protection.\u201d The district court\u2019s explanation for imposing a period of supervised release was adequate under this court\u2019s decision in <em>Dominguez-Alvarado. See </em>695 F.3d at 330. There was no error, plain or otherwise. <em>See id. </em>The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
