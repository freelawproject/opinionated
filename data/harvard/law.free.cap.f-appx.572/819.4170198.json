We find no error in the court\u2019s ruling and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">The circumstances under which the police wound up in Fuller\u2019s backyard, as depicted at the hearing on Fuller\u2019s motion to suppress, are these. On June 10, 2013, at 1:48 p.m., as Detective LaGrasta, his partner, Detective Session, and another detective of the Lauderhill Police Department were attempting to stop a stolen automobile, the car\u2019s three male occupants jumped out while the car was rolling and ran.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Two went west, a third east. La-Grasta and Session ran after the two headed west; the third detective remained on the scene, at 3321 NW 6th Court. Detective LaGrasta quickly caught one of the two suspects, the driver of the car, in the backyard of a house on NW 6th Street, and handed him over to officers who had arrived at the scene. LaGrasta then hailed a passing motorist who drove him to the 3300 block of 4th Court, where his lieutenant was after the second suspect who was running through backyards on 4th Court. At this point, Detective Ramos, who was driving nearby, said in a radio transmission that two suspicious people were in the backyard at 3461 4th Court. LaGrasta went there. Fuller was living at that address with his girlfriend, Sabrina Hampton.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The lot at 3461 NW 4th Court contains a small house with a lawn in front and on the sides, and a backyard enclosed by a chain-link fence with a gate and, on one side, a neighbor\u2019s wooden fence. The fence gate was open. Detective LaGrasta ran around the house and looked into the backyard. He saw Fuller and Hampton in the backyard sitting up against the neighbor\u2019s wooden fence. Fuller eyeballed LaGrasta, who was wearing tactical gear with a police insignia and standing 15 to 20 feet away, and immediately removed a gun from his waistband and dropped it into a trash can he was sitting on. At that point, LaGrasta, concerned for his safety, entered the backyard, ordered Fuller to the ground, removed a loaded firearm, a .45 caliber Taurus, from the trash can, and placed Fuller in handcuffs. He searched Fuller and found cocaine powder and a straw with cocaine residue. Detective Session, who had entered the backyard from the other side of the house, told LaGrasta that Fuller was not the man he was chasing.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">Fuller was detained at 1:59 p.m., just eleven minutes after LaGrasta and Session began their the pursuit of the suspects, and LaGrasta read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights. He waived his rights and responded to LaGrasta\u2019s questions. He admitted owning the firearm; he said he\u2019d purchased it on the street in Ft. Lauderdale for $250.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">We review the District Court\u2019s denial of Fuller\u2019s motion to suppress as a mixed question of law and fact. <em>United States v. Franklin, </em>694 F.3d 1, 7 (11th Cir.2012). We accept the court\u2019s factual findings in resolving an exigent circumstance issue unless the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe determine <em>de novo </em>whether the court erred in applying the law to those facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Bradley, </em>644 F.3d 1213, 1261 (11th Cir.2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">The Fourth Amendment protects persons and their \u201chouses, papers, and effects\u201d from \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. This protection extends to the curtilage of a person\u2019s home, which is \u201cpart of the home itself for Fourth Amendment purposes.\u201d <em>See Florida v. Jardines, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1409, 1414, 185 L.Ed.2d 495 (2013) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>(quoting <em>Oliver v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 180, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 1742, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984)); <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>480 U.S. 294, 300, 107 S.Ct. 1134, 1139, 94 L.Ed.2d 326 (1987). The Supreme Court has defined the curtilage as the area around the home that harbors those intimate activities associated with domestic life and the privacies of the home. <em>Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 300, 107 S.Ct. at 1139. Thus, \u201c[w]henever government agents enter into the curtilage they necessarily intrude upon the individual\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>588 F.2d 1046, 1053 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">Under the Fourth Amendment, \u201csearches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Franklin, </em>694 F.3d at 7 (quoting <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 586, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 1380, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980)). However, a warrantless search or seizure of a home may be justified \u201cwhere both probable cause and exigent circumstances exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Tobin, </em>923 F.2d 1506, 1510 (11th Cir.1991)). The government bears the burden of proving an exception to the warrant requirement. <em>United States v. Holloway, </em>290 F.3d 1331, 1337 (11th Cir.2002). The exigent circumstances doctrine applies only when there is a compelling need for official action, but no time for law enforcement to secure a warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 1334. The exigent circumstances doctrine extends to situations involving \u201cdanger of flight or escape, loss or destruction of evidence, risk of harm to the public or the police, mobility of a vehicle, and hot pursuit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Under the hot pursuit doctrine, police officers may enter premises without a warrant when they are in hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect. <em>See United States v. Santana, </em>427 U.S. 38, 42-43, 96 S.Ct. 2406, 2409-10, 49 L.Ed.2d 300 (1976). A \u201chot pursuit means some sort of chase, but it need not be an extended hue and cry \u2018in and about [the] public streets.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42-43, 96 S.Ct. at 2410. The Supreme Court has indicated that a claim of hot pursuit is \u201cunconvincing\u201d where there was \u201cno immediate and continuous pursuit of the petitioner from the scene of a crime.\u201d <em>Welsh v. Wisconsin, </em>466 U.S. 740, 753, 104 S.Ct. 2091, 2099, 80 L.Ed.2d 732 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">During the approximately 12 minutes between the suspects\u2019 fleeing from the stolen car and Detective LaGrasta\u2019s arrival at Fuller\u2019s yard, LaGrasta and other detectives were engaged in a single pursuit that was continuous from the time the suspects fled the stolen car to the moment LaGras-ta entered Fuller\u2019s back yard. <em>See Welsh, </em>466 U.S. at 753, 104 S.Ct. at 2099; <em>Santana, </em>427 U.S. at 42-43, 96 S.Ct. at 2409-10. Fuller does not challenge LaGrasta\u2019s search and detention after he entered the backyard. What he challenges is whether LaGrasta\u2019s entry was justified by exigent circumstances because the \u201chot pursuit\u201d had grown cold. We agree with the District Court that pursuit had not grown cold. LaGrasta was engaged in an uninterrupted pursuit, aided by an ongoing dispatch transmission; hence, his entry was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-17\">. As of the date of his arrest, Fuller had been convicted of multiple felonies \u2014 six as a juvenile and four as an adult \u2014 and thus was prohibited from possessing a firearm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b842-6\">. After the suspects jumped out of the car, it crashed into a house.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
