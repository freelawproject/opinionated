The bankruptcy court dismissed Stuart\u2019s complaint as untimely, and the district court affirmed. After a review of the record and the briefs of the parties, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">In 2005, Stuart, the appellant here, filed suit against Linda Ann Mendenhall, debtor in the bankruptcy proceeding from which this appeal arises, in New York state court alleging, among other things, legal malpractice and fraud. According to Stuart, he had established liability on the fraud cause of action after lengthy proceedings, and the court had scheduled a hearing to determine damages. But the action was stayed when Mendenhall filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the Northern District of Alabama in October 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-17\">Upon receipt of Mendenhall\u2019s petition, the bankruptcy court set the meeting of the creditors for November 16, 2012, and established January 15, 2013, as the bar date for filing complaints to determine dis-chargeability of a debt under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a). One day before the bar date, Stuart, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a motion to extend the deadline under Rule 4007(c), Fed. R. Bankr.P., stating that he had been unable to appear at the meeting of creditors as a result of Hurricane Sandy, which caused his home to be flooded and resulted in the destruction of documents pertinent to the debt. Mendenhall objected to an extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-18\">After a hearing, the bankruptcy court granted Stuart a \u201c60 day extension\u201d but did not clarify whether the extension ran from the original deadline, January 15, or from the date of the order, January 22. Assuming that the court intended the latter date, Stuart\u2019s counsel filed an adversary complaint under \u00a7 532(a) against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>Mendenhall on March 21, 201S.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stuart\u2019s counsel moved for and was granted admission <em>pro hac vice </em>on March 22, 2013. Men-denhall moved to dismiss the complaint as untimely, relying on the former date, January 15. Neither party sought clarification of the court\u2019s extension order before Stuart filed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">At a hearing on the motion to dismiss in May 2013, the bankruptcy court acknowledged \u201cpoor draftsmanship\u201d of the order and requested briefing on the timing issue. Stuart then filed a brief with an incorporated motion to extend the filing deadline <em>nunc pro tunc </em>if the court determined that the complaint was untimely under the extension order. Mendenhall responded that the court had no authority to grant an extension without a timely motion under Rule 4007(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">After receiving the parties\u2019 briefs, the bankruptcy court issued a memorandum opinion explaining that Stuart\u2019s complaint was due to be dismissed as untimely. First, the court determined \u201cthat the extension was intended to run from the date of the original deadline despite any lack of clarity in the order.\u201d The court relied on several factors in reaching this result: the extension was granted over the debtor\u2019s objection, Stuart\u2019s motion did not request a specific period of extension, the sixty-day extension was generous, and Stuart had not sought clarification of the ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Finding the complaint to be untimely, the bankruptcy court also determined that it lacked discretion to retroactively extend the deadline set in Rule 4007(c). If no timely motion is filed under Rule 4007(c), \u201ca bankruptcy court has no authority to extend the deadline based on excusable neglect.\u201d While acknowledging some case law supporting the position that a court has greater discretion to extend a court-ordered deadline, the bankruptcy court adopted the contrary view that the deadline in this case could not be extended because no timely motion was filed before the expiration of the second deadline. Accordingly, the bankruptcy court dismissed Stuart\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">Stuart timely appealed to the district court, which affirmed, finding that the bankruptcy court had properly interpreted its order, that the court lacked discretion to extend the deadline, and that Stuart\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated. Stuart now appeals to this Court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">In bankruptcy cases, \u201cthis court sits as a second court of review and thus examines independently the factual and legal determinations of the bankruptcy court,\u201d employing the same standards of review as the district court. <em>Finova Capital Corp. v. Larson Pharmacy, Inc. (In re Optical Techs., Inc.), </em>425 F.3d 1294, 1299-300 (11th Cir.2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Factual findings of the bankruptcy court are reviewed for clear error, and legal conclusions by either the bankruptcy court or the district court are reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-13\">Stuart challenges the dismissal of his complaint as untimely on three grounds. He contends that the bankruptcy court erred in construing its order in favor of the debtor, that the court should have granted a further extension of time even if his complaint had been untimely, and that the court\u2019s orders were unconstitutional. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">Stuart first argues that the bankruptcy court improperly dismissed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>complaint because the extension order was ambiguous, and Mendenhall failed to allege or show that she would have been prejudiced by proceeding on the complaint. Stuart acknowledges that the bankruptcy court had discretion to interpret its order but argues that the court incorrectly took the side of a \u201cdishonest fraudulent debtor\u201d over an \u201cinnocent creditor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">We will defer to the bankruptcy court\u2019s interpretation of its own order \u201cunless it clearly abused its discretion.\u201d <em>In re Optical Techs., </em>425 F.3d at 1300. The abuse-of-discretion standard \u201callows a range of choice\u201d for the court, \u201cso long as that choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Rasbury v. IRS (In re Rasbury), </em>24 F.3d 159, 168 (11th Cir.1994) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We have also said that \u201cwe are reluctant to disturb a bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment interpreting its own earlier order\u201d because the bankruptcy judge \u201cis in the best position to clarify any apparent inconsistencies in the court\u2019s rulings.\u201d <em>Ranch House of Orange-Brevard, Inc. v. Gluckstern (In re Ranch House of Orange-Brevard, Inc.), </em>773 F.2d 1166, 1168 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">While perhaps harsh to Stuart, the bankruptcy court\u2019s interpretation of its own order was not an abuse of discretion. As the bankruptcy court explained, the extension was granted over the debtor\u2019s objection, Stuart did not ask for a specific extension of time, and Stuart could have sought clarification of the order. Furthermore, the bankruptcy court recognized the order\u2019s ambiguity and solicited briefing from the parties on the issue before taking any action on Mendenhall\u2019s motion to dismiss. The fact that Stuart\u2019s counsel was not admitted <em>pro hac vice </em>until March 22, 2013, does not change our conclusion because even <em>pro se </em>parties are responsible for complying with procedural rules. <em>See Moton v. Cowart, </em>631 F.3d 1337, 1340 n. 2 (11th Cir.2011) (\u201cWhile we must construe the pleadings of pro se defendants liberally, we nevertheless have required them to conform to procedural rules.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">We acknowledge that external circumstances may have made it more difficult for Stuart and his attorney to participate in the bankruptcy proceeding and that Stuart\u2019s interpretation of the court\u2019s order may have been reasonable. Nonetheless, even if we might have interpreted the order in Stuart\u2019s favor had it been our call, we must affirm the bankruptcy court on this point because it did not \u201cclearly abuse[ ] its discretion.\u201d <em>See In re Optical Techs., </em>425 F.3d at 1300; <em>In re Rasbury, </em>24 F.3d at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">Stuart next contends that the district court should have granted an extension retroactively even if his complaint had been untimely. Stuart relies on <em>Yip v. Soler (In re Soler), </em>490 B.R. 629 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.2013), for the proposition that a bankruptcy court has discretion to extend a court-ordered deadline where the failure to timely file was a result of excusable neglect. According to Stuart, because his original motion for an extension was timely, the bankruptcy court retained the authority to enlarge the time to file retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">Relevant here, a complaint to determine the dischargeability of a debt under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(c) \u201cshall be filed no later than 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors.\u201d Fed. R. Bankr.P. 4007(c). While the bankruptcy court may extend this deadline for cause upon the motion of a party in interest, the motion must be filed before the deadline expires. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cOn motion of a party in interest, after hearing on notice, the court may for cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>extend the time fixed under this subdivision. The motion shall be filed before the time has expired.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Notably, Rule 9006(b)(3), Fed. R. Bankr. P., provides that the bankruptcy court \u201cmay enlarge the time for taking action under\u201d Rule 4007(c), among other rules, \u201conly to the extent and under the conditions stated\u201d in that rule. This is an exception to the bankruptcy court\u2019s general authority to extend deadlines under Rule 9006(b)(1), Fed. R. Bankr.P., which provides that \u201cthe court for cause shown may at any time in its discretion\u201d enlarge a deadline to act, including \u201con motion made after the expiration of the specified period ... where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.\u201d In sum, according to these rules, the bankruptcy court may enlarge the time for taking action under Rule 4007(c) only when a motion for extension is filed before the time expires. <em>See Byrd v. Alton (In re Alton), </em>837 F.2d 457, 459 (11th Cir.1988) (\u201c[T]he provisions of [Rule] 4007(c) are mandatory and do not allow the Court any discretion to grant a <em>late filed </em>motion to extend time to file a dischargeability complaint.\u201d) (emphasis in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Under the plain language of the relevant bankruptcy rules, we conclude that the bankruptcy court properly denied Stuart\u2019s untimely motion to retroactively extend the deadline for filing a dischargeability complaint under Rule 4007(c). Rule 9006(b)(3) makes clear that the general authority granted in Rule 9006(b)(1) is inapplicable for the purpose of filing a complaint under Rule 4007(c) and that Rules 4007(c) and 9006(b)(3) instead govern timing. Although the court extended the original January 15, 2013, deadline pursuant to a timely motion, the new period to act under Rule 4007(c) expired on March 18, 2013.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Stuart did not file another motion for an extension before the time expired. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 4007(c). Rather, he moved for an extension <em>nunc pro tunc </em>in May 2013, at the earliest. Accordingly, the district court properly denied his untimely motion for an extension. <em>See In re Alton, </em>837 F.2d at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Despite the conclusion reached in <em>In re Soler, </em>we cannot interpret the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>bankruptcy rules to permit an extension of time to file a dischargeability complaint under Rule 4007(c) when the motion is made after the time for seeking it has already expired. <em>See Anwar v. Johnson, </em>720 F.3d 1183, 1185-87 (9th Cir.2013) (holding that a bankruptcy court had no discretion to retroactively extend the deadline for filing under Rule 4007(c), where the deadline had already been extended pursuant to a timely motion). Otherwise, we risk undermining the strict time limitations imposed by Rule 4007(c). <em>See Ichinose v. Homer Nat\u2019l Bank (In re Ichinose), </em>946 F.2d 1169, 1172-73 (5th Cir.1991) (stating that the \u201cstrict limitation on the extension of time\u201d under Rules 4007 and 9006(b)(3) \u201creflects the overall goal of the bankruptcy process to provide individual debtors a fresh start\u201d); <em>see also FDIC v. Meyer (In re Meyer), </em>120 F.3d 66, 69 (7th Cir.1997) (noting \u201crigid observance of the 60-day rule\u201d and describing the purpose of Rule 4007(c) as \u201cencouraging creditors to file their complaints speedily or yield them forever\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Accordingly, even assuming that Stuart has shown that the failure to file a timely complaint was due to excusable neglect, we nonetheless affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of Stuart\u2019s untimely motion for an extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Finally, Stuart contends that the bankruptcy court\u2019s extension order was unconstitutionally vague and that the court\u2019s later order interpreting it amounted to an unconstitutional <em>ex post facto </em>law. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">First, to the extent that Stuart can challenge the order on vagueness grounds, any ambiguity in the order was not \u201cso indefinite as really to be no rule or standard at all.\u201d <em>Leib v. Hillsborough Cnty. Pub. Transp. Comm\u2019n, </em>558 F.3d 1301, 1310 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). The order established a firm time period, even if the order may have been susceptible to two reasonable interpretations of when that period began. Nor was Stuart deprived of \u201cnotice adequate to apprise him of the pendency of the action and afford him an opportunity to present his objection.\u201d <em>In re Alton, </em>837 F.2d at 460-61 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). Stuart knew that his time to file a dischargeability complaint was running and could have asked for clarification of the deadline but did not. Second, the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution does not apply here because \u201cthe ex post facto bar applies only to criminal laws, not to civil regulatory regimes.\u201d <em>United States v. W.B.H., </em>664 F.3d 848, 852 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">In sum, we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not err in interpreting the extension order or denying Stuart\u2019s untimely motion to extend the deadline retroactively and that the court did not violate Stuart\u2019s constitutional rights. Accordingly, we affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissal of Stuart\u2019s dischargeability complaint as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-7\">. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 532(c) provides that even debts for fraud will be discharged unless the creditor timely requests a determination that the debt is excepted from discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b884-5\">. Although neither party raises the point, we acknowledge that <em>Kontrick v. Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004), held that Rule 4004(a), a provision containing \"essentially the same time prescriptions\u201d as Rule 4007(c), was a nonjurisdictional claims-processing rule. Therefore, a debtor may forfeit the right to assert the untimeliness of a creditor's complaint under Rule 4004(a) by failing to raise the issue until after the complaint was adjudicated on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 458-60, 124 S.Ct. at 917-18. However, the Court did not reach the question of \"[wjhether the Rules, despite their strict limitations, could be softened on equitable grounds,\u201d citing to a split of authority among the circuit courts-including a citation to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Alton </em>for the proposition that \"Rule 4007(c) confers no discretion to grant an untimely motion to extend the time to object, even if the creditor lacked notice of the bar date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457 n. 11, 124 S.Ct. at 916 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">Accordingly, <em>In re Alton </em>is still good law for the general rule that the bankruptcy court has no discretion to grant a late-filed motion to extend time to file a dischargeability complaint, at least where the debtor has properly raised untimeliness as an issue. <em>See Smith v. GTE Corp., </em>236 F.3d 1292, 1300 n. 8 (11th Cir.2001) (prior panel ruling binds subsequent panels \"unless and until the first panel's holding is overruled by the Court sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court\u201d). Here, Mendenhall has properly raised untimeliness as an issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b884-11\">. The last day of the sixty-day period was Saturday, March 16, 2013, so the period continued to run until the end of the day on Monday, March 18, 2013, the next day that was not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9006(a)(1)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
