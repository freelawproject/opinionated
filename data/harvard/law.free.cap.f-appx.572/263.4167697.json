He argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable and greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Avalos asserts that the Guidelines failed to account for his personal history and circumstances, including that he had lived in the United States legally since he was 16 years old, that most of his family lives here, and that his motive for returning was to be with his pregnant wife. Further, Avalos contends that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and double counted his prior conviction and overstated the seriousness of his criminal history which he characterizes as an international trespass. He maintains that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply to his sentence because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not supported by empirical data, but he acknowledges that the argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-22\">Generally, we review sentences for reasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Under the bifurcated review process adopted in <em>Gall, </em>we first consider whether the district court committed procedural error and next examine the sentence for substantive reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>619 F.3d 469, 471-72 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-23\">It is not immediately clear whether Ava-los properly preserved his \u201cempirical data\u201d and \u201cdouble-counting,\u201d arguments. Because Avalos cannot show an abuse of discretion in connection with these arguments, <em>see Mandragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67; <em>see also United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.2009), we need not determine which standard of review is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-24\">In addition, the district court considered Avalos\u2019s request for a downward variance and ultimately determined that a sentence within the advisory guidelines range was appropriate under the circumstances and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Avalos\u2019s arguments that that \u00a7 2L1.2 overstates the seriousness of his criminal history and does not take into account his personal history and characteristics are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see also Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586 (\u201cThe fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d). We are also unpersuaded by Avalos\u2019s argument that his offense was a non-serious trespass. <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008). Therefore, Avalos has failed to show that his 46-month, within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
