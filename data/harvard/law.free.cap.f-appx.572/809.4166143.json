Santiesteban pled guilty to both counts, and the District Court, denying him safety-valve relief because he had not truthfully provided to the Government all the information he had about the charged offenses, sentenced him to concurrent prison terms of 120 months on Count One and 60 months on Count Two. Santiesteban appeals his sentences because he disagrees with the court\u2019s finding that he was not forthcoming as \u00a7 5C1.2 requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">We use a elear-error standard to review a district court\u2019s factual determination of whether a defendant qualifies for application of the \u00a7 5C1.2 safety-valve provision. <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cFor a finding to be clearly erroneous, this Court must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rothenberg, </em>610 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir.2010) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). As indicated above, the safety-valve provision permits a district court, if a defendant meets five criteria, to sentence within the relevant Guidelines range without regard to any statutory mandatory-minimum sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(l)-(5). The criteria at issue here is the fifth criteria, whether the defendant truthfully provided the government with \u201call information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5). To satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5), a defendant must demonstrate that he has made a good-faith effort to cooperate with the government. <em>Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1557. \u201cThe burden is on the defendant to come forward and to supply truthfully to the government all the information he possesses about his involvement in the offense, including information relating to the involvement of others and to the chain of the narcotics distribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining the truthfulness of a defendant, the district court must independently assess the facts and may not rely on the Government\u2019s assertion of dishonesty. <em>United States v. Espinosa, </em>172 F.3d 795, 797 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">We conclude that the District Court did not clearly err in denying Santiesteban safety-valve relief on the ground that he did not provide the Government complete and truthful information regarding his offenses. The court had ample evidence be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>fore it on which to find that Santiesteban had not been forthcoming. Games\u2019s testimony, for example, which the court found credible, showed that Santiesteban was untruthful. Games testified that Santieste-ban sold him close to 20 kilograms of cocaine and that Santiesteban had talked to him about supplying cocaine to other buyers, about transporting around 25 kilograms to Tampa at a time, and about how he had built a trap compartment in his car to hide the drugs. Games\u2019s testimony contradicted Santiesteban\u2019s statements to Agent Bessette that all the cocaine he ever sold amounted only to 10 grams and that he never transported cocaine to Tampa, as Games said he did. Santiesteban\u2019s arguments to the contrary are contradicted by the record. His proffer to the Government failed to satisfy \u00a7 5C1.2(a)\u2019s fifth criteria; therefore, his sentences are</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
