He argues on appeal that the district court erred in imposing an eight-level aggravated felony enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) based on his prior conviction of conspiring to launder monetary instruments. De La Garza contends that the district court improperly relied on information in the Presentence Report (PSR) to determine that his prior offense warranted the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) enhancement. He also asserts that the judgment should be reformed to reflect sentencing under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1), rather than under the \u201caggravated felony\u201d provision of \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">As De La Garza concedes, his failure to raise these issues in the district court results in plain error review. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Terrazas, </em>529 F.3d 293, 296 (5th Cir.2008). To show plain error, De La Garza must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">An offense described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956 relating to the laundering of monetary instruments is an aggravated felony \u201cif the amount of the funds exceeded $10,000.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(D). Under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(U), \u201can attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense described in this paragraph\u201d is also an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The Government has supplemented the record with a copy of the plea agreement in De La Garza\u2019s prior money laundering conspiracy conviction; it shows that the amount of the funds involved in the offense easily exceeded the $10,000 threshold of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(D). We may properly consider the plea agreement in determining whether the prior conviction was an aggravated felony. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>United States v. Fernandez-Cusco, </em>447 F.3d 382, 388 (5th Cir.2006). If in view of the foregoing, De La Garza has not established plain error in the application of the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) aggravated felony enhancement, and reformation of the judgment is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
