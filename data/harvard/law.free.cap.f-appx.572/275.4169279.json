Similar to his objection in district court, Rios claims, in the light of his mental illness, the district court clearly erred by applying a two-level sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice, resulting in an unreasonable sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (obstructing or impeding the administration of justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-21\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cA finding of obstruction of justice under [Guideline] \u00a7 3C1.1 is a factual finding reviewed for clear error\u201d. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>263 F.3d 436, 441 (5th Cir.2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-22\">The district court imposed an upward adjustment pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 3C1.1 because Rios told Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials he was a United States citizen by virtue of being born at an identified hospital in Texas. This assertion is material because it bears upon the issue of citizenship, which is central to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>an illegal-reentry prosecution. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n. 6 (defining \u201cmaterial\u201d); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(3) (defining \u201calien\u201d), 1326 (reentry of removed aliens); <em>see, e.g., United States v. Jarar-Favela, </em>686 F.3d 289, 302 (5th Cir.2012) (providing elements to prove illegal reentry); <em>United States v. Mann, </em>493 F.3d 484, 498 (5th Cir.2007) (applying obstruction enhancement). Therefore, the district court properly considered Rios\u2019 false claim of citizenship as material for purposes of Guideline \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The district court did not clearly err either in concluding Rios willfully attempted to mislead officials as to his citizenship or in applying the sentencing enhancement. Rios erroneously asserts the psychiatrist\u2019s report concludes he was incapable of willfully misleading officials due to his mental disorder. The psychiatrist\u2019s report notes \u201cthe likelihood\u201d that Rios knew he was lying when he asserted he was a United States citizen. The record does not show clear error in connection with the imposition of the challenged adjustment. <em>See Martinez, </em>263 F.3d at 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Rios\u2019 claim that his sentence was unreasonable, due to the claimed procedural error, fails because, as discussed above, there was no such error.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
