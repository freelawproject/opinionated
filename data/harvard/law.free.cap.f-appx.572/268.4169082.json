The district court dismissed Oguntodu\u2019s complaint against certain defendants as frivolous, and it dismissed his complaint against the remaining defendants for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2), 1915A; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c). Oguntodu unsuccessfully sought reconsideration of his claims in a motion filed pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and he is proceeding IFP on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-20\">We review the dismissal of Oguntodu\u2019s complaint de novo. <em>See Velasquez v. Woods, </em>329 F.3d 420, 421 (5th Cir.2003). A claim is frivolous if it does not have an arguable basis in fact or law. <em>Gonzales v. Wyatt, </em>157 F.3d 1016, 1019 (5th Cir.1998). A claim may be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted if, assuming all well pleaded facts are true, the plaintiff has not pleaded \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-21\">In his appellate brief, Oguntodu reiterates the facts he alleged in the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>court. He also asserts that the staff at his new maximum security housing unit has been violating his constitutional rights. He does not, however, address the reasons given by the district court for dismissing the claims he raised in the instant complaint. Accordingly, he has abandoned any challenge to the judgment of the district court. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Oguntodu\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5TH CIR. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Oguntodu\u2019s complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim each count as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Oguntodu has already accumulated two other strikes. <em>See Oguntodu v. Gary, </em>No. 13-11099 (5th Cir. May 9, 2014). Accordingly, Oguntodu may no longer proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Oguntodu is further cautioned that any future frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings in the district court or in this court will subject him to additional and progressively more severe sanctions, as will his failure to withdraw any pending matters that are frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
