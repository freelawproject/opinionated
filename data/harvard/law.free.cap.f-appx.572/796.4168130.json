Defendant cross-appeals the order granting in part its motion for attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff also purports to appeal the district court\u2019s September 28, 2011 denial of Plaintiffs motion to reopen the case and/or for leave to file an amended complaint, which Defendant argues we have no jurisdiction to review, as Plaintiff failed to appeal the court\u2019s denial of the motion within thirty days. We address this jurisdictional issue at the outset before turning our attention to the award of attorneys\u2019- fees and costs. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-14\">We outline the procedural history of this case to provide background for the jurisdictional issue presented by the parties on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-15\">Plaintiff filed suit against Defendant on July 12, 2010, in Florida state court for wrongful dishonor of a letter of credit and fraud. Defendant removed the action to federal court based on diversity of citizenship pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. Defendant then moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and for failure to plead fraud with particularity under Rule 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-16\">On May 13, 2011, the district court granted Defendant\u2019s motion and dismissed Plaintiffs claims against Defendant without prejudice, granting Plaintiff leave to amend its complaint within fourteen days. The court warned Plaintiff that \u201c[fjailure to file the amended pleading will result in a final order of dismissal of Dependable Component\u2019s claims with and/or without prejudice.\u201d Nevertheless, Plaintiff failed to amend its complaint within the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>allowed by the district court and made no request for an extension. The amendment period expired on May 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Upon Defendant\u2019s motion, the district court entered a Final Order of Dismissal on June 9, 2011, noting that Plaintiff failed to amend its complaint by the May 27 deadline despite the court\u2019s warning that failure to do so would result in a final dismissal. Although the district court again stated that the dismissal of Plaintiffs claims against Defendant was without prejudice, the court directed the clerk to close the case. Plaintiff did not appeal the Final Order of Dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Defendant then moved for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs on July 27, 2011. One week later, Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen the case and/or for leave to amend its complaint, admitting that it failed to amend its complaint during the fourteen-day window because it decided to \u201ccut its losses and not continue with the case.\u201d Finding that Plaintiff had failed to articulate good cause as to why it waited three months to take action, the district court denied Plaintiffs motion on September 28, 2011. In doing so, the court again emphasized that Plaintiff was cautioned that failure to file an amended complaint by May 27, 2011, would result in a final order of dismissal, which the court entered on June 9. Plaintiff did not appeal the denial of its motion to reopen / amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Upon request for clarification from the magistrate judge regarding whether the district court intended its Final Order of Dismissal to serve as an adjudication on the merits for purposes of attorneys\u2019 fees, the court entered , an order on the magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation on January 26, 2012. Acknowledging that both the original dismissal with leave to amend and the Final Order of Dismissal stated that Plaintiffs claims against Defendant were dismissed without prejudice, the district court stated that this Circuit recognizes that a dismissal without prejudice becomes a dismissal with prejudice when no timely amendment is filed and no request for an extension is made. Therefore, the court found, the Final Order of Dismissal was a dismissal with prejudice and constituted an adjudication on the merits. On the same day in a separate order, the district court granted in part Defendant\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. It is from these two January 26, 2012 orders that Plaintiff now timely appeals. Before addressing the appeals from the January 26, 2012 award of attorneys\u2019 fees, however, we first turn to the jurisdictional issue with respect to Plaintiffs purported appeal of the September 28, 2011 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">On appeal, Plaintiff asks us to also review the district court\u2019s September 28, 2011 denial of its motion to reopen / amend even though Plaintiff failed to appeal that denial within thirty days pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A). Plaintiff contends that the September 28, 2011 denial of its motion was interlocutory and therefore merged with the January 26, 2012 order. Plaintiff argues that the January 26 order was the first unambiguously final order issued by the district court in that it clarified that the Final Order of Dismissal was with prejudice, giving this Court leave to review the prior \u201cinterlocutory\u201d denial of its motion to reopen / amend on Plaintiffs timely appeal from the January 26' order. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">The law of this Circuit is clear that a dismissal with leave to amend becomes final for purposes of appeal at the expiration of the window to amend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-12\">In dismissing the complaint, the district court may also provide for a stated peri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>od within which the plaintiff may amend the complaint. If the plaintiff does not amend the complaint within the time allowed, no amendment may be made absent leave of court, and the dismissal order becomes final at the end of the stated period. For appeal purposes, we hold that the order of dismissal in this situation becomes final upon the expiration of the time allowed for amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aou\"><em>Schuurman v. Motor Vessel Betty KV, </em>798 F.2d 442, 445 (11th Cir.1986). Thus, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Plaintiffs complaint became final when the fourteen-day window to amend expired on May 27, 2011. Plaintiff cannot justify its failure to take action for over three months by claiming that the \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d language in the initial dismissal and in the Final Order of Dismissal resulted in an inability to appeal. <em>\u201c \u2018A </em>dismissal is a final order, and appealable as such, whether it is with or without prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hertz Corp. v. Alamo Rent-A-Car, Inc., </em>16 F.3d 1126, 1133 n. 14 (11th Cir.1994) (quoting 9 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2376 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Moreover, the district court warned Plaintiff in its initial dismissal that failure to amend would result in a final order of dismissal, which the court entered on June 9, 2011. And at the very latest, the district court\u2019s June 9, 2011 Final Order of Dismissal provided notice that the district court\u2019s dismissal of Plaintiffs complaint was final for purposes of appeal, especially in light of the court\u2019s direction to close the case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff failed to timely appeal either order, instead filing a very belated motion to reopen the case and/or for leave to amend the complaint only after Defendant moved on July 27, 2011, for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Plaintiff then failed to appeal the district court\u2019s September 28, 2011 denial of that motion to reopen / amend within thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">Plaintiff cannot now reach back to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of its complaint or the court\u2019s denial of Plaintiffs motion to reopen/amend.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, we limit our review to the district court\u2019s January 26, 2012 orders clarifying that its Final Order of Dismissal was an adjudication on the merits (for purposes of the prevailing-party issue for attorneys\u2019 fees) and granting in part Defendant\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We now turn to Plaintiffs appeal and Defendant\u2019s cross-appeal from those orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">We review a district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for an abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>discretion, reviewing questions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Atlanta Journal and Constitution v. City of Atlanta Dept. of Aviation, </em>442 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2006). Where the right to attorneys\u2019 fees and costs sounds in state law and reaches this Court by way of federal diversity jurisdiction, we apply the substantive law of the forum state. <em>Trans Coastal Roofing Co. v. David Boland, Inc., </em>309 F.3d 758, 760 (11th Cir.2002). We therefore apply Florida law.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Following the district court\u2019s entry of the Final Order of Dismissal, Defendant moved for attorneys\u2019 fees under Florida Statutes \u00a7 675.111(5). That provision states that \u201c[reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses of litigation must be awarded to the prevailing party in an action in which a remedy is sought under this chapter,\u201d which includes the claim for wrongful dishonor of a letter of credit asserted by Plaintiff. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 675.111(5) (Supp.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Under Florida law, the prevailing party for purposes of attorneys\u2019 fees is the party that prevailed on any significant issue in the litigation. <em>Moritz v. Hoyt Enters., Inc., </em>604 So.2d 807, 809-10 (Fla.1992) (adopting the prevailing-party test outlined by the Supreme court in <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983)). The result obtained governs the determination of which party prevailed, and \u201cthe fairest test to determine who is the prevailing party is to allow the trial judge to determine from the record which party in fact prevailed on the significant issues tried before the court.\u201d <em>Green Cos., Inc. v. Kendall Racquetball Inv., Ltd., </em>658 So.2d 1119, 1121 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1995). Florida law looks for \u201c(1) a situation where a party has been awarded by the court at least some relief on the merits of his claim, or (2) a judicial imprimatur on the change in the legal relationship between the parties.\u201d <em>Smalbein ex rel. Estate of Smalbein v. City of Daytona Beach, </em>353 F.3d 901, 905 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">Here, Defendant is the prevailing party under Florida law, as the district court dismissed Plaintiffs action against Defendant, despite the fact that the dismissal was without prejudice. <em>See Valcarcel v. Chase Bank USA NA, </em>54 So.3d 989, 991 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2010) (holding that even though the complaint was dismissed without prejudice as a sanction for misconduct and even though the order of dismissal was therefore not an adjudication on the merits, the defendants were nevertheless properly considered the prevailing party for purposes of attorneys\u2019 fees); <em>Henn v. Ultrasmith Racing, LLC, </em>67 So.3d 444, 445-46 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2011) (\u201c[Ajppel-lant was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees as the prevailing party in the case.... Like <em>Val-carcel, </em>the dismissal in this case was not an adjudication on the merits, since it was a dismissal without prejudice. Under <em>Val-carcel, </em>however, a defendant may \u2018prevail\u2019 even where the case is not dismissed on the merits. The fact that the trial court dismissed the case without prejudice was sufficient to trigger appellant\u2019s entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees as the prevailing party under the rental contract.\u201d); <em>Baratta v. Valley Oak Homeowners\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>891 So.2d 1063, 1065 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2004) (holding that the defendant became the prevailing party and thus properly claimed attorney\u2019s fees when the plaintiffs claim was involuntarily dismissed for failure to prosecute); <em>see also Alhambra Homeowners Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Asad, </em>943 So.2d 316, 318 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2006) (holding that a defendant is the prevailing party within the meaning of statutory provisions awarding attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party even when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>plaintiff voluntarily dismisses the action).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the district court correctly determined that Defendant was entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees as the prevailing party under \u00a7 675.111(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Regarding the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees awarded, Florida law applies the lodestar method, which requires courts to determine the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation and the reasonable hourly rate for the type of litigation, multiply the reasonable number of hours by the reasonable hourly rate, and, when appropriate, adjust the fee. <em>Fla. Patient\u2019s Comp. Fund v. Rowe, </em>472 So.2d 1145, 1151-52 (Fla.1985). The court is itself an expert on the question and may consider its own knowledge and experience concerning reasonable and proper fees and may form an independent judgment either with or without the aid of witnesses as to the reasonableness of the fee request. <em>Norman v. Hous. Auth. of Montgomery, </em>836 F.2d 1292, 1803 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">The district court here applied the lodestar method, reducing the number of billable hours requested and decreasing the varying hourly rates requested by Defendant\u2019s attorneys to an hourly rate of $350 for each lawyer. <em>See id. </em>at 1299, 1302 (instructing that excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary hours should be excluded from the amount claimed and that a reasonable hourly rate is the prevailing market rate in the relevant legal community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skills, experience, and reputation). We do not think the district court\u2019s findings as to the reasonable number of hours expended in the litigation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>the reasonable hourly rate were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">On cross-appeal, Defendant argues that the district court erred in limiting the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the litigation of the wrongful dishonor of a letter of credit claim. Defendant argues that \u00a7 675.111(5) provides for greater recovery in that it does not contain a limitation to fees expended in litigating a particular claim but rather provides for attorneys\u2019 fees and other expenses incurred in the overall action in which a remedy is sought under Chapter 675. Plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that the district court erred in failing to limit the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to those fees incurred in litigating the wrongful dishonor of a letter of credit claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The official comment to \u00a7 675.111(5) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-7\">The court must award attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party, whether that party is an applicant, a beneficiary, an issuer, a nominated person, or adviser.... The party entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees has been described as the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d Sometimes it will be unclear which party \u201cprevailed,\u201d for example, where there are multiple issues and one party wins on some and the other party wins on others. Determining which is the prevailing party is in the discretion of the court. Subsection (e) authorizes attorney\u2019s fees in all actions where a remedy is sought \u201cunder this article.\u201d It applies even when the remedy might be an injunction under Section 5-109 or when the claimed remedy is otherwise outside of Section 5-111.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 675.111 cmt. 6. \u201cIn all actions\u201d is meant to be broadly construed: \u201c\u2018Action,\u2019 in the sense of a judicial proceeding, includes recoupment, counterclaim, setoff, suit in equity, and any other proceedings in which rights are determined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 671.201(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although scant authority exists on this issue, courts have recognized the breadth of \u00a7 675.111(5) and have awarded attorneys\u2019 fees under that provision in actions involving multi-count complaints without limiting the fees to the litigation of particular counts. <em>See, e.g., Jaffe v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>674 F.Supp.2d 1360, 1362-63 (S.D.Fla.2009), <em>aff'd sub nom. Jaffe v. Bank of Am. Corp., N.A., </em>399 Fed.Appx. 535 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">For example, in <em>Jaffe v. Bank of America, N.A., </em>the district court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to the defendant in an action in which the plaintiffs sought an injunction under Chapter 675 but also alleged breach of fiduciary duty, equitable estoppel, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, unjust enrichment, and civil conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>at 1362, 1363. After the court vacated the preliminary injunction and entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants on all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, the district court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to the defendant without separating the claim for a Chapter 675 injunction from the rest of the claims, holding that \u201cbecause this was an action in which a remedy was sought under chapter 675 (i.e. an injunction against paying under a letter of credit), reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses of litigation must be awarding [sic] to the prevailing party.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Similarly, this Court in a more recent unpublished opinion affirmed an award of attorneys\u2019 fees that did not differentiate between fees incurred in litigating the Chapter 675 claim from fees incurred in litigating other claims. In upholding the award, this Court stated that \u201c[b]ecause section 675.109\u2019s letter-of-credit fraud was the key legal theory underlying Appellants\u2019 claims below, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that this case involves \u2018an action in which a remedy is sought under [chapter 675],\u2019 and that [the defendant] was therefore entitled to attorney\u2019s fees as the prevailing party therein.\u201d <em>2002 Irrevocable Trust for Richard C. Hvizdak v. Huntington Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>515 Fed.Appx. 792, 794 (11th Cir.2013) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Although the few interpretations of \u00a7 675.111 to date appear to support a finding that separation of time spent on allegations of a wrongful dishonor of a letter of credit is not necessary when that was Plaintiffs key legal theory underlying the litigation, we need not in this case definitively so decide. In this case, Plaintiff has failed to persuade us that the attorneys\u2019 fees awarded were attributable to claims too unrelated to the wrongful dishonor claim. For example, the district court in determining the award of attorneys\u2019 fees referred to the case as a \u201crun-of-the-mill wrongful dishonor of a letter of credit action.\u201d Moreover, we think the overall award to be reasonable. Thus, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $61,175.98 to Defendant in this matter.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b820-11\">. We note that James A. Stepan has moved to withdraw as counsel for Plaintiff Dependable Component Supply due to his recent move to a law firm not retained by Plaintiff. The law firm of Genovese, Joblove &amp; Battista, P.A., has also moved to withdraw as counsel for Plaintiff. Both motions are DENIED without prejudice to renewal when it is confirmed that Plaintiff has continued representation by new counsel. Until then, Mr. Stepan and the Genovese firm will remain as counsel of record for Plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b820-18\">. Plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike the first twelve pages of Defendant's Reply Brief on its cross-appeal is DENIED. In considering Defendant's cross-appeal, however, we disregarded the section of Defendant\u2019s Reply Brief to which Plaintiff objected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b822-5\">. Moreover, even if the June 9 dismissal extended the period of time in which Plaintiff could amend its complaint, which we do not agree that it did, Plaintiff failed to amend within a reasonable time, at which point the June 9 order became final in any event. Plaintiff then failed to timely appeal that order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b822-6\">. We also note that Plaintiff did not specify the district court's September 28, 2011 Order Denying Motion to Reopen Case and/or Leave to File Amended Complaint in its notice of appeal. \"The general rule in this circuit is that an appellate court has jurisdiction to review only those judgments, orders or portions thereof which are specified in an appellant's notice of appeal.\u201d <em>Osterneck v. E.T. Barwick Indus., Inc., </em>825 F.2d 1521, 1528 (11th Cir.1987), <em>aff'd sub nom. Osterneck v. Ernst &amp; Whinney, </em>489 U.S. 169, 109 S.Ct. 987, 103 L.Ed.2d 146 (1989); <em>Weatherly v. Ala. State Univ., </em>728 F.3d 1263, 1271 (11th Cir.2013). Plaintiff argues that the September 28, 2011 order denying its motion to reopen/amend was interlocutory and merged with the January 26, 2012 order on the magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation, but as discussed above, we are unpersuaded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b822-12\">.Thus, Defendant's motion for dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of Plaintiff's appeal of the September 28, 2011 order, which was carried with the case, is GRANTED.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b824-5\">. We note that the magistrate judge in this case discussed the holding of the district court in <em>Sanchez v. Swire Pacific Holdings, Inc., </em>No. 09-20235-CIV, 2009 WL 2005272, at *4 (S.D.Fla. July 9, 2009), that a defendant is not a prevailing party for purposes of attorney\u2019s fees when a complaint is dismissed without prejudice because no substantive change in the legal relationship of the parties occurs in that situation. The <em>Sanchez </em>court dismissed the complaint without prejudice to refile based on the plaintiff's failure to file an opposing memorandum of law. <em>Id. </em>The court determined that the defendant had not prevailed in the overall litigation and therefore was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because the legal relationship between the parties had not yet been altered in any substantive way and no significant issue had been determined, as the complaint had' merely been dismissed with leave to refile due to a \"procedural default.\" <em>Id. </em>at *4, *5; <em>see also Shaw v. Schlusemeyer, </em>683 So.2d 1187, 1188 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1996) (\"In the instant case, the dismissal of Mr. Shaw\u2019s complaint was without prejudice and he was granted leave to amend the complaint.... The dismissal was based on procedural grounds and not a determination of any significant issue in the case. Importantly, the instant dismissal did not bring the litigation to an end. In fact, by its very terms, the order afforded Mr. Shaw an opportunity to correct what the trial court viewed as a technical defect in his complaint. Under these facts, it was error to award Ms. Schlu-semeyer prevailing party attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">In the case at bar, on the other hand, the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint without prejudice was based not on a procedural ground or technical defect but rather on Plaintiff's failure to state a cause of action for wrongful dishonor of a letter of credit and its failure to adequately plead fraud. Thus, we find the dismissal without prejudice of the complaint here to be more aligned with the Florida cases finding that a defendant is the prevailing party for purposes of attorneys\u2019 fees when he succeeds in having the plaintiff\u2019s complaint involuntarily dismissed. <em>See, e.g., Baratia v. Valley Oak Homeowners\u2019 Ass'n, </em>891 So.2d 1063, 1065 n. 3 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2004) (\"However, the trial court here did not abuse its discretion in designating Valley Oak as the prevailing party, when it succeeded in involuntarily dismissing Baratta\u2019s claim [for failure to prosecute].\u201d). Our conclusion is also supported by the fact that a dismissal without prejudice under Rule 12(b)(6) becomes a dismissal with prejudice when no timely amendment is made and no request for an extension is submitted. <em>Hertz Corp. v.
