On appeal, he argues that: (1) the district court did not set a payment schedule for the fine in his judgment and that the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) may not set an inmate\u2019s payment schedule; and (2) the BOP increased his payment schedule to an amount he is financially unable to meet. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>In general, we review the district court\u2019s resolution of a question of law <em>de novo. United States v. Noriega, </em>117 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir.1997). We may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any basis supported by the record. <em>Miller v. Harget, </em>458 F.3d 1251, 1256 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The United States Code provides that a sentence imposing a fine is a final judgment, but may be (1) modified or remitted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3573; (2) corrected under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35; or (3) appealed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(c). The Code also provides that a fine may be remitted or modified upon motion of the government if reasonable efforts to collect the fine are unlikely to be effective, but provides no mechanism for a defendant to seek modification or rescission. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3573; <em>see also United States v. Linker, </em>920 F.2d 1,1-2 (7th Cir.1990) (persuasive authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">A federal prisoner challenging the execution of his sentence must bring a claim under \u00a7 2241, not \u00a7 2255. <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1351 &amp; n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). A \u00a7 2241 petition by a federal prisoner must be brought in the district where the inmate is incarcerated. <em>See Rumsfeld v. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 443-44, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Here, it is not clear under what basis Means brought his self-styled motion to expedite and rescind financial payments. The thrust of Means\u2019s motion appears to be a request that the district court rescind his obligation to make further financial payments, either because the BOP has set a payment schedule that he cannot meet or because the BOP lacks the authority to set a payment schedule. The former argument appears to be a motion for remission under \u00a7 3573, while the latter appears to be an attack on the execution of his sentence, which would properly be brought under \u00a7 2241. However, regardless of how we construe this motion, the district court was correct to refuse to grant Means relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">To the extent we construe Means\u2019s motion as a motion for remission under \u00a7 3573, the fine may not be remitted or modified because the government has not made such a motion. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3573; <em>see also Linker, </em>920 F.2d at 1-2. Means also cannot obtain relief under Rule 35, because he did not file his motion within 14 days of sentencing, Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a), and he cannot modify the judgment through a direct appeal under \u00a7 3742, because he has already brought a direct appeal. To the extent we construe Means\u2019s motion as a collateral attack on the execution of the judgment against him under \u00a7 2241, he is currently incarcerated in Kentucky, but he filed his motion in the Northern District of Alabama. Thus, the district court would have been correct to dismiss Means\u2019s construed \u00a7 2241 petition because he failed to file the petition in the district where he is currently incarcerated. <em>See Rumsfeld, </em>542 U.S. at 443-44, 124 S.Ct. 2711.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-7\">.
