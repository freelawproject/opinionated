(\u201cSupreme\u201d) in his employment discrimination suit for racially discriminatory termination brought under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, he raises three issues. First, he argues that the district court erred in concluding that he did not establish a <em>prima fade </em>case of racially discriminatory termination. Second, he argues that the district court erred in concluding that he did not establish that Supreme\u2019s reason for terminating him \u2014 violation of company procedures \u2014 was pretextual. Finally, he argues that the district court abused its discretion in granting Supreme\u2019s motion to strike his additional disputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-17\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b695-18\">We review the granting of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>Robinson v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>595 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2010). A district court shall grant summary judgment \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). If the movant satisfies the burden of production showing that there is no genuine issue of fact, \u201cthe nonmoving party must present evidence beyond the pleadings showing that a reasonable jury could find in its favor.\u201d <em>Shiver v. Chertoff, </em>549 F.3d 1342, 1343 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). We draw \u201call factual inferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">II. <em>Prima facie </em>case</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">We use the same analytical framework to consider claims under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. <em>Standard v. A.B.E.L. Services, Inc., </em>161 F.3d 1318, 1330 (11th Cir.1998). Under Title VII, it is unlawful for an employer \u201cto discharge any individual ... because of such individual\u2019s race....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). Under \u00a7 1981, \u201c[a]ll persons ... shall have the same right ... to make and enforce contracts ... as is enjoyed by white citizens. ...\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination based on disparate treatment in termination, a plaintiff may show that \u201c(1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) he was replaced by a person outside his protected class or was treated less favorably than a similarly-situated individual outside his protected class.\u201d <em>Maynard v. Bd. of Regents, </em>342 F.3d 1281, 1289 (11th Cir.2003). In the disciplinary context, the most important factors \u201care the nature of the offenses committed and the nature of the punishments imposed.\u201d <em>Stone &amp; Webster Constr., Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>684 F.3d 1127, 1135 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Alternatively, we have indicated that, in lieu of evidence of a similarly-situated comparator, a plaintiff may make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial bias in the application of discipline for a violation of work rules by showing that he did not actually violate the work rule. <em>Jones v. Gerwens, </em>874 F.2d 1534, 1540 (11th Cir.1989). However, when an employee argues that he did not actually violate the rule in question, \u201can employer may rebut this allegation by showing its good faith, honest belief that the employee violated [the] rule.\u201d <em>Stone &amp; Webster Constr., </em>684 F.3d at 1136. If an employer terminates an employee \u201cbecause it honestly believed that the employee had violated a company policy, even if it was mistaken in such belief, the discharge is not \u2018because of race.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Papp Clinic, P.A., </em>808 F.2d 1449, 1452-53 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">The district court did not err in concluding that Winborn did not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of racially discriminatory termination. He failed to identify Caucasian comparators who were treated more favorably after engaging in substantially similar misconduct. Moreover, there was nothing in the material before the district court on summary judgment to suggest that his supervisors did not hold a good faith belief that he had committed the misconduct for which they terminated him. Accordingly, because he failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, we conclude the district court did not err in granting summary judgment, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">III. Pretext</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">Even if we were to accept that Winborn had established a prima facie case, he still would not prevail because he failed to establish that Supreme\u2019s asserted reason for his termination \u2014 violation of company rules \u2014 was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">When a plaintiff has established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, the burden of production then shifts to the defendant to offer a legitimate, nondiseriminatory rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>son for the adverse employment action. <em>E.E.O.C. v. Joe\u2019s Stone Crabs, Inc., </em>296 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). If the defendant is able to do so, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that this reason is really a pretext for unlawful discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 1272-73. The ultimate burden of proving that the employer intentionally discriminated against the employee remains at all times with the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 1273. A plaintiff must prove pretext by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Meeks v. Computer Associates Intern., </em>15 F.3d 1013, 1019 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">When an employer offers an employee\u2019s violation of a work rule as the justification for termination, the employee can \u201cprove pretext by showing either that she did not violate the work rule or that, if she did, other employees not within the protected class who engaged in similar acts were not similarly treated.\u201d <em>Sparks v. Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc., </em>830 F.2d 1554, 1563 (11th Cir.1987). A plaintiff must show pretext with \u201cconcrete evidence in the form of specific facts.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Jones, </em>575 F.3d 1281, 1308 (11th Cir.2009). Mere \u201cconclu-sory allegations and assertions\u201d will not suffice. <em>Id. </em>When considering whether an employee\u2019s termination based on alleged misconduct was merely a pretext, the proper inquiry is whether the employer believed that the employee was guilty of misconduct and whether that belief was the reason for the employee\u2019s discharge. <em>Elrod v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>939 F.2d 1466, 1470 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">The district court did not err in concluding that Winborn had failed to prove pretext. He offered nothing beyond mere \u201cconclusory allegations\u201d to challenge the evidence that his supervisors believed \u2014 at the time of his termination \u2014 that he had violated company policies and contributed to a potential theft. <em>See Bryant, </em>575 F.3d at 1308. Accordingly, we affirm the district court in this respect as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">IV. Motion to strike</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">When appropriate, we will review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s application of its local rules. <em>Mann v. Taser Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>588 F.3d 1291, 1302 (11th Cir.2009). A plaintiff bears the burden of showing the district court abused its discretion by making a clear error of judgment. <em>Id. </em>Issues raised for the first time on appeal that were not presented in the district court are deemed waived. <em>See Walker v. Jones, </em>10 F.3d 1569, 1572 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">We reject Winborn\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s ruling on Supreme\u2019s motion to strike because Winborn filed no opposition to the motion in the district court. Moreover, even if we assume error in this regard and consider the facts as urged by Winborn, there is nothing in the record beyond \u201cconclusory allegations\u201d to challenge the evidence that Winborn\u2019s supervisors believed \u2014 at the time of the termination \u2014 that he had violated company policies and contributed to a potential theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b697-15\">Based upon the foregoing and our review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-16\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-11\">. The complaint also cited 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, but did not allege state action. The district court dismissed his Title VII failure-to-promote claim and pendent state law tort claims, and he does not challenge that ruling in his brief on appeal. Accordingly, this opinion will only address his claim of racially discriminatory termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\">.
