Graves argues that the district court\u2019s upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l) based on his criminal history was an abuse of discretion, making his sentence unreasonable, because 1) the facts resulting in his conviction are different and show that he was less of a participant and less culpable as compared to his codefendants; 2) the elements of his offense of conviction are substantially different from and do not constitute a lesser included offense of his codefendants\u2019 conspiracy convictions; and 3) the criminal history used by the court as the basis for the upward departure was based on different non-white collar crimes which varied in type and time.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-22\">In the context of a guidelines departure pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3, reasonableness review requires this court to evaluate both \u201cthe district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly and the extent of that departure for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cAn upward departure by a district court is not an abuse of discretion if the court\u2019s reasons for departing 1) advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and 2) are justified by the facts of the case.\u201d 442 F.3d at 347 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). However, \u201c[a] district court abuses its discretion if it departs on the basis of legally unacceptable reasons or if the degree of the departure is unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 416 n. 21 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-23\">The fact that Graves pleaded guilty to a different offense from his codefendants is irrelevant for sentencing purposes because his guideline range was based upon his relevant conduct, which included the broader conspiracy involving his co-defendants. Graves\u2019s offense level was based upon all of the facts reported in the pre-sentence report concerning the entirety of the conspiracy. If Graves believed he was less culpable, he could have argued for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>minor or minimal participant adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2, but he did not. Graves did receive a benefit from pleading guilty to a charge with a statutory maximum of 120 months, as compared to the 180-month statutory maximum of the conspiracy charge of his co-defendants. The district court indicated that the statutory maximum limited its ability to sentence Graves even higher. Graves cites no relevant authorities to support his argument that his supposed lesser culpability somehow requires a within guidelines sentence despite his criminal history. Graves has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion by failing to account for his alleged lesser culpability in upwardly departing based on his criminal history. <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Regarding his criminal history, Graves argues that it did not support an upward departure because of the \u201clapsed time\u201d between his criminal history and the present criminal offense, as well as the fact that his criminal history was different in nature from the present offense, a white collar crime. Graves was 33 years old at the time of sentencing, and his criminal history stretched from age 18 to age 32. There was no \u201ctime lapse\u201d in his criminal history, but a steady engagement in criminal conduct over the course of 14 years, as noted by the district court. Graves\u2019s lenient treatment, also noted by the district court, allowed him to continue to commit crimes. The district court\u2019s consideration of his lenient treatment is a proper consideration and a valid basis for departure. <em>See United States v. Delgado-Nunez, </em>295 F.3d 494, 498 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 328-29 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The fact that Graves\u2019s present offense was different in nature from his previous offenses does not preclude the district court\u2019s consideration of such offenses in its determination that an upward departure was warranted under \u00a7 4A1.3. The listed factors in \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2) are not exhaustive, and the district court can consider serious dissimilar criminal conduct not resulting in a conviction. <em>See United States v. Alford, </em>142 F.3d 825, 831 (5th Cir.1998) Graves\u2019s prior convictions and criminal conduct involving burglary, assault with bodily injury, possession of controlled substances, and possession of a prohibited weapon are serious crimes which pose an obvious danger to society and justify the district court\u2019s decision to depart. <em>See Lee, </em>358 F.3d at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by upwardly departing under \u00a7 4A1.3 for insufficient or unacceptable reasons. <em>See Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d at 416 n. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b281-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
