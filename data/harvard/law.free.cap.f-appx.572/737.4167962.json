She challenges the district court\u2019s denial of her request for a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). On appeal, Sanchez argues that she has clearly demonstrated acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3El.l(a) by fully complying with her pretrial supervision requirements and maintaining lawful employment, severing ties with her former co-conspirators, and expressing remorse for the offense conduct in admitting it to the district court and pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">We review the district court\u2019s assessment of acceptance of responsibility for clear error, <em>United States v. Knight, </em>562 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir.2009), and it is entitled to great deference by virtue of the sentencing judge\u2019s unique position to make such factual determinations, \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n. 5). The district court\u2019s finding as to acceptance cannot be set aside unless it is without foundation, <em>Knight, </em>562 F.3d at 1322, and our review of the record leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed, <em>United States v. White, </em>335 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">Sanchez bears the burden of clearly demonstrating that she is entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, \u00a7 3El.l(a), and must present more than a guilty plea, <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1279 (11th Cir.2006). She is, accordingly, not \u201centitled to a reduction ... as a matter of right.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>458 F.3d at 1279 (citing \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 3)). Although truthfully admitting to the offense conduct and entering a guilty plea constitute \u201csignificant evidence\u201d of acceptance, they may be outweighed by evidence of inconsistent conduct. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-14\">In conducting this inquiry, the district court is permitted to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the timeliness of Sanchez\u2019s conduct in manifesting the acceptance. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 1(H)). We have generally held that pleas on the \u201ceve of trial\u201d are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>timely for purposes of \u00a7 3E1.1. <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371, 1373 (11th Cir.1998), <em>abrogated on other grounds as recognized by United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). Furthermore, we have determined that one of \u00a7 3El.l(a)\u2019s chief purposes is to save the government the time and expense of going to trial. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>106 F.3d 350, 351 (11th Cir.1996), <em>abrogated on other grounds, </em>127 F.3d 987 (11th Cir.1997) <em>(en banc). </em>Accordingly, concerns about the government\u2019s time, expenses, and efforts are relevant to evaluating the timeliness of Sanchez\u2019s plea under \u00a7 3El.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Here, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Sanchez failed to satisfy her burden of clearly demonstrating the acceptance-of-responsibility requirements under \u00a7 3El.l(a). Because Sanchez did not plead guilty until the day of trial, her plea was untimely and caused the government to incur various expenses and efforts, including deposition of a material witness and multiple weeks of staff time. <em>See Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d at 1373. The jury summoned for Sanchez\u2019s scheduled trial was inconvenienced because there was no trial to attend. Because Sanchez did not enter into stipulations regarding the content of her phone conversations, the government incurred expenses to hire a Spanish language interpreter to read them into evidence at her scheduled trial. Sanchez contends that she already accounted for her untimeliness and the litigation costs it generated when she did not request a one-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b) at the sentencing hearing. However, Application Note 6 makes clear that timeliness \u201cis a consideration under both subsections\u201d and a component of the sentencing judge\u2019s subsection (a) analysis. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Although Sanchez made a significant showing as to other of Application Note l\u2019s criteria, including compliance with electronic monitoring, maintaining lawful employment, and severing ties with co-conspirators, this evidence does not as of right satisfy her burden of clearly demonstrating acceptance or entitle her to a two-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3El.l(a) and comment, (n. 3); <em>Wade, </em>458 F.3d at 1279. Nor does it counterbalance the great deference afforded to the district court, which was in a unique position to evaluate all the circumstances of her case. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 5). Sanchez\u2019s manifestation was untimely under Application Note 1 and her conduct, on balance, was inconsistent with accepting full responsibility under Application Note 3. Because the district court\u2019s assessment of these criteria was not clearly erroneous, neither was its finding that Sanchez failed to clearly demonstrate adequate acceptance under \u00a7 3El.l(a). We, accordingly, affirm its denial of Sanchez\u2019s request for an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
