The district court concluded that Mr. Stevens\u2019 petition had failed to satisfy the \u201csavings clause\u201d requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Following a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-25\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b753-26\">On April 21, 1994, following a jury trial in the Southern District of Alabama, Mr. Stevens was convicted of three offenses: conspiracy to commit armed robbery of a motor vehicle, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 2 (Count 1); armed robbery of a motor vehicle (\u201ccarjacking\u201d), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119 (Count 2);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (Count 3). <em>See </em>AL D.E. I.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Upon its own finding at sentencing that a death resulted from the carjacking, the district court sentenced Mr. Stevens to life imprisonment without parole for Count 2, to be served concurrently with 60-month sentences for Counts 1 and 3. Mr. Stevens appealed, and this Court affirmed his convictions and sentences. <em>See United States v. Knight, </em>70 F.3d 1285 (11th Cir.1995) (table).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In 1997, Mr. Stevens filed a motion to vacate pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, arguing (1) that the government failed to prove two essential elements to support his convictions on Counts 1 and 2; (2) that he was denied effective assistance of counsel; and (3) that newly discovered evidence would likely have resulted in his acquittal. <em>See </em>AL D.E. 139. The district court denied his petition \u201cin accordance with Rule 8(a) of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings for the United States District Courts.\u201d <em>See </em>AL D.E. 150. Mr. Stevens was denied a certificate of appealability, first by the district court and then by this Court. <em>See AL </em>D.E. 152; GA D.E. 8-2. <em>See also Stevens v. United States, </em>49 Fed. Appx. 288 (11th Cir.2002) (table) (affirming denial of motion to reconsider).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">After the denial of Mr. Stevens\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion, the Supreme Court decided <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999). <em>Jones </em>held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119 \u201cestablished] three separate offenses by the specification of distinct elements, each of which must be charged by indictment, proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and submitted to a jury for its verdict.\u201d 526 U.S. at 252, 119 S.Ct. 1215. The following year, as foreshadowed by <em>Jones, </em>the Supreme Court held in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that any facts enhancing the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-13\">In 2003, citing <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Jones, </em>Mr. Stevens filed a pro se habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, claiming that he was \u201cfactually innocent,\u201d and that, pursuant to <em>Jones, </em>the sentencing court had no authority to sentence him based on elements neither stated in the indictment nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See </em>Report and Recommendation, GA D.E. 8-2 at 2. The district court dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition because Mr. Stevens had not shown that a petition under \u00a7 2255 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention, as required before a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition pursuant to the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e). <em>See </em>2004 District Court Order, GA D.E. 8-3. The district court regarded Mr. Stevens\u2019 petition as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion that had been filed without the required prior approval of the Eleventh Circuit. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In 2004, Mr. Stevens filed his second \u00a7 2241 petition, raising essentially the same claims as before. <em>See </em>2005 District Court Order, GA D.E. 8-4. The district court dismissed Mr. Stevens\u2019 petition, again, for failing to satisfy \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">On November 20, 2012, Mr. Stevens filed this present \u00a7 2241 petition, alleging for the third time that the district court sentenced him based on elements neither stated in the indictment nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt to the jury, in violation of the rule established in <em>Jones </em>and <em>Apprendi See </em>GA D.E. 1. Mr. Stevens also claimed that his life sentence exceeds the statutory maximum under \u00a7 2119(1), and that he is actually innocent of the crimes charged. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">We exercise plenary review over the denial of a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition. <em>See Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir.2013). A federal prisoner may challenge the propriety of his conviction and sentence pursuant to a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, but is generally only entitled to file one such motion. A second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion may not be filed without permission of the circuit court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Under limited circumstances, a prisoner may file a subsequent habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 without seeking a circuit court\u2019s permission. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255(e). <em>See also Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). To do so, however, a petitioner must satisfy the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255(e), by showing that \u201cthe remedy by [\u00a7 2255] motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">We have held that a prisoner may not use \u00a7 2241 to circumvent the restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions. <em>See Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999). A petitioner must establish at least two necessary conditions to satisfy the threshold, jurisdictional \u201csavings clause\u201d inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-12\">First, the claim must be based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. The second, and equally essential, condition is that the Supreme Court decision must have overturned a circuit precedent that squarely resolved the claim so that the petitioner had no genuine opportunity to raise it at trial, on appeal, or in his first \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-13\"><em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b755-15\">Mr. Stevens argues in his current \u00a7 2241 petition that his sentence exceeded the statutory maximum for his offense of conviction. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Jones </em>and <em>Apprendi, </em>Mr. Stevens asserts that he could not be sentenced to the maximum term of life imprisonment based on an element neither stated in the indictment nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 namely, that his violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119 resulted in the death of another. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119(3) (1994). Mr. Stevens instead contends that he was subject to a 15-year maximum sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119(1) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>The Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Jones </em>was \u201cdeveloped in <em>Apprendi </em>and subsequent cases,\u201d culminating in the principle that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 <em>U.S. 220, </em>237-44, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Although we recognize Mr. Stevens\u2019 assertion that the current claims are based in part on <em>Jones, </em>we conclude that they are no different than claims based on the decisions in <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny. Indeed, Mr. Stevens relies on <em>Jones </em>for essentially the same principle announced in <em>Apprendi: </em>that his violation of \u00a7 2119 resulted in the death of another \u2014 the \u201cfact ... necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by facts established by ... [the] jury verdict\u201d \u2014 was required to be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 237-44, 125 S.Ct. 738 (discussing <em>Appren-di).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">We have previously held that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral appeal, including in the context of a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1281-82 (11th Cir.2006). <em>See also McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1256-58 (11th Cir.2001) (finding <em>Ap-prendi </em>not retroactive for collateral review pursuant to a \u00a7 2255 motion); <em>In re Joshua, </em>224 F.3d 1281, 1283 (11th Cir.2000) (rejecting the retroactive application of <em>Apprendi </em>to permit second or successive habeas petitions). We have likewise held that <em>Booker </em>has no retroactive applicability on collateral review. <em>See Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 868 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that <em>\u201cBooker\u2019s </em>constitutional rule falls squarely under the category of new rules of criminal procedure that do not apply retroactively to \u00a7 2255 cases on collateral review\u201d). We see no reason to treat <em>Jones </em>any differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Accordingly, because his \u00a7 2241 claims are not \u201cbased upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision,\u201d Mr. Stevens\u2019 petition fails to satisfy the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255(e).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Stevens\u2019 \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-17\">. At the time of Mr. Stevens\u2019 offense and conviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOG\">Whoever, with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm, takes a motor vehicle that has been transported, shipped, or received in interstate or foreign commerce from the person or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation, or attempts to do so, shall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>(1) be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 15 years, or both,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">(2) if serious bodily injury (as defined in section 1365 of this title) results, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 25 years, or both, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">(3) if death results, be fined under this title or imprisoned for any number of years up to life, or both, or sentenced to death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b754-10\">. Although Mr. Stevens was convicted and sentenced in Alabama, he is currently incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution in Jesup, Georgia, and, therefore, filed his present petition in the Southern District of Georgia. For the sake of clarity, we refer to court documents related to his proceedings in Alabama, i.e., trial, sentencing, and his initial \u00a7 2255 petition, as \"AL D.E.,\u201d and those filed in his present petition in Georgia as \"GA D.E.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b754-15\">. Mr. Stevens claims in his present \u00a7 2241 petition that he was improperly sentenced on Count 2 because the elements of the carjacking charge were not stated in his indictment. But his earlier \u00a7 2255 motion contradicts that assertion. In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Mr. Stevens stated that \"[t]he Indictment charged that [co-defendant] Knight and Stevens conspired to take a motor vehicle by force, violence or intimidation, and that ... during the taking, the victim, Harold Edward Dunn, was shot and fatally wounded.\u201d AL D.E. 139.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b756-6\">. In his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and in his appellate briefs, Mr. Stevens argued for the first time that <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), required the sentencing court to impose a sentence based on \"the least prohibited act where it is unclear which aspect of the ... statute the defendant violated.\u201d Reply Brief of Appellant at 2 (ellipsis in original). <em>See also </em>GA D.E. 12 at 3. <em>Johnson, </em>however, dealt with the applicability of a state conviction for battery as a predicate \"violent felony\u201d offense for an enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act. Where the elements of an offense establish several different ways of committing that offense, and where no record exists to explain how the defendant committed the offense, the Supreme Court held that a district court, in determining the applicability of the ACCA enhancement, must assume that the prior conviction for that offense rested upon \"the least of these acts.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at 137, 130 S.Ct. 1265. Because Mr. Stevens failed to raise this argument in his initial habeas petition, it is not properly before us. For the sake of clarity, however, we note that the argument would be inapposite to Mr. Stevens\u2019 situation even if it had been adequately raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
