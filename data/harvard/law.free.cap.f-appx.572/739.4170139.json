Although the district court varied downward and imposed a sentence four months below the low end of the applicable guideline range, Bermudez-Tapia argues his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Upon review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we reject Bermudez-Tapia\u2019s contention and affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Bermudez-Tapia has failed to demonstrate any \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d that would warrant a determination that the district court abused its discretion. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1166 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). That Bermudez-Ta-pia\u2019s sentence did not exceed the guideline range and in fact fell below it is an indication that his sentence was reasonable, <em>see United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008), as is the fact that his sentence fell well below the statutory maximum, <em>see United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). Bermu-dez-Tapia urges us to question the weight the district court assigned to his sole prior conviction, but such a determination falls within the district court\u2019s discretion, and we will not substitute our own judgment for that of the district court. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007). The record demonstrates that the district court carefully considered the circumstances of Bermudez-Tapia\u2019s offense and Bermudez-Tapia\u2019s own characteristics, including his youth at the time of his prior conviction. There is no indication the district court made a clear error of judgment in fashioning Bermudez-Tapia\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, we have no basis on which to find the sentence substantively unreasonable. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-17\">. We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging a sentence bears the burden to establish that it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
