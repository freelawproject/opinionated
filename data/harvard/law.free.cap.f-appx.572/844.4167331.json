On appeal, Ziol-kowski argues his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately address all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and failed to give sufficient weight to various mitigating factors. He also contends his sentence is greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing. After review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">Ziolkowski\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable. The district court did not procedurally err in imposing Ziolkowski\u2019s sentence by failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or by failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). As we have consistently held, \u201cthe district court is not required to state it has considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the factors on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>751 F.3d 1268, 1281 (11th Cir.2014). At sentencing, the district court stated that a 360-month sentence \u2014 which was the statutory maximum and top of the advisory guidelines range \u2014 was appropriate given Ziolkowski\u2019s prior offenses, which included convictions for sexual abuse and rape; the danger Ziolkowski presented to the community; his lack of rehabilitation; and his lack of remorse. The district court also explicitly stated that it had considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in calculating Ziolkowski\u2019s sentence, incorporated the presentence investigation report\u2019s findings into its sentence, and explained that the sentence was appropriate to promote specific and general deterrence. Accordingly, the district court set forth enough information to satisfy us that it considered the parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for making its decision. <em>See United States v. Kuhlman, </em>711 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201cIn explaining the sentence, the district court should set forth enough information to satisfy the reviewing court of the fact that it has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for making its decision, but nothing requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d (quotations, citation, and alteration omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">Ziolkowski\u2019s sentence is also substantively reasonable. Although Ziolkowski argues the district court failed to afford adequate weight to his mitigating circumstances, including his age, health problems, and physical condition, we will vacate a sentence only if \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number><em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation omitted). The district court did not commit a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. As the district court noted, Ziolkowski\u2019s sentence was appropriate given the nature and circumstances of the offense, Ziolkow-ski\u2019s prior history, the need to deter criminal conduct, and the need to protect the public. Ziolkowski\u2019s 360-month sentence is not \u201coutside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case,\u201d <em>id., </em>and is not greater than necessary to accomplish the purposes of sentencing, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
