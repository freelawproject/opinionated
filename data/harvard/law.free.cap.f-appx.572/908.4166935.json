He was convicted and incarcerated from February 16, 1995, to January 31, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-21\">The District Court dismissed Rembert\u2019s complaint <em>sua sponte </em>without prejudice for failure to state a claim for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), because his claims were time-barred under \u00a7 1983\u2019s four-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He appeals the dismissal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-22\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and view the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003). A <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for frivolity under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), however, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 1160. In <em>Hughes, </em>we reviewed the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a time-barred \u00a7 1983 claim for abuse of discretion because the court found it was frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). <em>Id. </em>at 1163. More recently, in <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>the Supreme Court reiterated that, if a complaint\u2019s allegations taken as true show that the plaintiff is not entitled to relief, then the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>plaint is subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim. 549 U.S. 199, 214-15, 127 S.Ct. 910, 921, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). In discussing whether exhaustion under the Prison Litigation Reform Act must be pled in the complaint, the Court illustrated that a claim for relief barred by the applicable statute of limitations was an example of such an instance where a complaint would fail to state a claim for relief. <em>Id. </em>at 215, 127 S.Ct. at 920-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Here, even under the more generous <em>de novo </em>standard of review supplied by \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), Rembert\u2019s arguments on appeal are without merit. Section 1915 of Title 28 of the U.S.Code governs proceedings <em>in forma pauperis, </em>and provides that \u201cthe court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that ... the action or appeal ... fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)is governed by the same standard as a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997). Dismissal for failure to state a claim is appropriate if the facts as pleaded fail to state a claim for relief that is \u201cplausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citation omitted). The \u201cplaintiffs obligation to provide the \u2018grounds\u2019 of his \u2018entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (alterations and citation omitted). Despite the fact that a complaint need not contain detailed factual allegations, it must contain \u201cmore than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. at 1949. We hold <em>pro se </em>pleadings to a less strict standard than pleadings filed by lawyers, and, thus, they are liberally construed. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">A \u00a7 1983 claim is governed by the forum state\u2019s residual personal injury statute of limitations, and, in Florida, \u201ca plaintiff must commence a \u00a7 1983 claim ... within four years of the allegedly unconstitutional or otherwise illegal act.\u201d <em>Burton v. City of Belle Glade, </em>178 F.3d 1175, 1188 (11th Cir.1999); <em>see also </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 95.11(3)(p). \u201cThe general federal rule is that the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the facts which would support a cause of action are apparent or should be apparent to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.\u201d <em>Rozar v. Mullis, </em>85 F.3d 556, 561-62 (11th Cir.1996) (quotations and alterations omitted). To determine when a plaintiff could have sued for an injury, the court first must identify the injury alleged. <em>Id. </em>at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Based on the four-year statute of limitation for \u00a7 1983 claims, Rembert\u2019s last date to timely file a civil action was in 1999. Rembert filed his complaint on July 9, 2013, well after the running of the applicable statute of limitations, and as such, his complaint failed to state a cognizable claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-18\">. The District Court incorrectly cited 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A as the basis for its <em>sua sponte </em>review of Rembert's complaint, as he was no longer a prisoner at the time the complaint was filed. However, because Rembert moved for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>his complaint was subject to screening under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
