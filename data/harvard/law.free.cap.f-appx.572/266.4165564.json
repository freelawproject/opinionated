In its initial Memorandum and Order, the district court addressed Townsend\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration, Plea to Jurisdiction, and Motion for Summary Judgment, and his Claim to Quiet Title, as well as Defendants-Appellees\u2019 Cross Motion for Summary Judgment. In its subsequent Memorandum and Order, the district court addressed Townsend\u2019s Objection, Motion to Amend, Motion for New Trial, and Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment. We affirm the judgments and orders of the district court for the reasons set forth in its Memorandum and Order of October 23, 2013, and in its additional Memorandum and Order of November 26, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-22\">This appeal is the culmination of a saga that began in June 2004 with Townsend\u2019s purchase of residential property in Conroe, Texas, including his execution of a promissory note secured by a deed of trust. This was followed by Townsend\u2019s tax protest in the form of refusing to pay his 2006 and 2007 property taxes on that real estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>That in turn led to this protracted litigation which eventually resulted in the district court\u2019s 2013 judgments and orders that Townsend appeals here.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Just as the Defendant-Appellees patiently addressed Townsend\u2019s largely baseless pleadings and assertions, and just as the district court patiently addressed his numerous claims and contentions, we have patiently reviewed the record on appeal, including the briefs of the parties and both of the district court\u2019s memoranda and orders. Our review leads us to conclude that there is no merit in any of Townsend\u2019s contentions on appeal. Neither do they warrant further discussion or explanation. Accordingly, the judgments of the district court are, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b288-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
