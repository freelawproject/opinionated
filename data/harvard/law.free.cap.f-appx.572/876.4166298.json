On appeal, Douglas argues that the district court plainly erred by delivering an Allen<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charge, which she contends unduly coerced the jury into returning a split verdict finding her guilty on one of the two charged counts. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Generally, we review the district court\u2019s use of an <em>Allen </em>charge for abuse of discretion, and will hold that a court abused its discretion only if the charge was inherently coercive. <em>See United States v. Woodard, </em>531 F.3d 1352, 1364 (11th Cir.2008). Where a party does not object to the district court\u2019s use of an <em>Allen </em>charge, however, we will review a challenge to the charge on appeal only for plain error. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>530 F.2d 49, 51 (5th Cir.1976).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under plain error review, the defendant must show: (1) error; (2) that is plain; and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). We may then exercise our discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if \u201c \u2018the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cTo determine whether an <em>Allen </em>charge is plain error, we must evaluate whether the particular charge is coercive in light of the facts and circumstances of the case and whether further instructions following timely objection could correct the problem.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>530 F.2d at 51. We have held that, even if factors lead to the conclusion that the district court erred in giving an <em>Allen </em>charge, the error does not constitute plain error if further instructions by the court could have cured the error. <em>See id. </em>at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">In giving an <em>Allen </em>charge, the district court \u201cinstructs a deadlocked jury to undertake further efforts to reach a verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Bush, </em>727 F.3d 1308, 1311 n. 1 (11th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 967, 187 L.Ed.2d 824 (2014) (quotations omitted). In considering whether an <em>Allen </em>charge was inherently coercive, we consider both the language of the charge and the totality of the circumstances under which it was delivered. <em>Woodard, </em>531 F.3d at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-15\">We have noted our approval of the current pattern jury instruction for an <em>Allen </em>charge, concluding that it is not, based on its language alone, inherently coercive. <em>Bush, </em>727 F.3d at 1320. However, because of the potential for coercion inherent to an <em>Allen </em>charge, \u201cclose scrutiny is demanded of any modification of the accepted language.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonso, </em>740 F.2d 862, 878 (11th Cir.1984). In assessing the propriety of a particular <em>Allen </em>charge, we look to whether \u201cpartial or one-sided comments were engrafted\u201d upon the instructions. <em>See Posey v. United States, </em>416 F.2d 545, 552 (5th Cir.1969). Moreover, \u201c[a]n instruction which appears to give a jury no choice but to return a verdict is impermissibly coercive.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>504 F.3d 1218, 1219 (11th Cir.2007). On the other hand, we have held that an <em>Allen </em>charge is not coercive where the district court specifically states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>to the jury that no juror is expected to give up his or her honest belief regarding the evidence. <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d 838, 846-47 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">In considering the totality of the circumstances, we consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the amount of time between the delivery of the <em>Allen </em>charge and the return of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Woodard, </em>531 F.3d at 1364. We have held that, even where the window of time between the giving of the <em>Allen </em>charge and the return of the verdict is relatively brief, such an occurrence does not necessarily render the charge coercive. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Chigbo, </em>38 F.3d 543, 545-46 (11th Cir.1994) (holding that a 15-minute window between the <em>Allen </em>charge and the return of the jury\u2019s verdict did not demonstrate that the charge was coercive); <em>United States v. Scruggs, </em>583 F.2d 238, 241 (5th Cir.1978) (48 minutes). We\u2019ve also held that the fact that the jury returned a split verdict does not establish that the given <em>Allen </em>charge was coercive. <em>United States v. Demarest, </em>570 F.3d 1232, 1243 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Here, the district court did not commit any error, much less plain error, in giving the <em>Allen </em>charge. As the record shows, the district court\u2019s <em>Allen </em>charge was nearly identical to the approved Eleventh Circuit pattern instruction, and it clearly instructed the jurors that they were not to give up their honest beliefs as to the evidence. <em>See Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d at 846-47. Additionally, neither of the court\u2019s non-pattern comments that Douglas challenges on appeal demonstrate that the charge was unduly coercive. Specifically, Douglas challenges two of the court\u2019s given statements as coercive: (1) the court\u2019s statement, made at the beginning of the charge, that \u201cI have read your latest note, and I\u2019ve read all of your notes from yesterday that gave me the same message as you gave me today with your last note\u201d; and (2) the court\u2019s later statement, given at the end of the charge, providing that \u201cwe will wait to hear from you before we call it a day.\u201d Contrary to Douglas\u2019s attempts to label these comments by the district court as coercive, neither comment was partial or one-sided, as neither would lead a reasonable juror to believe that either the majority\u2019s or minority\u2019s views on the evidence were correct. <em>See Posey, </em>416 F.2d at 552. Further, neither of the challenged comments expressed to the jurors that they had no choice but to return a verdict. <em>See Jones, </em>504 F.3d at 1219. Finally, there is nothing in the record that indicates that the district court\u2019s <em>Allen </em>charge was unduly coercive under the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-9\">. <em>Allen v.
