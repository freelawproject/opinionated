O\u2019Shaughnessy appeal the district court\u2019s order imposing sanctions against O\u2019Shaughnessy under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 for his conduct in pursuing a lawsuit in the district court against attorney Robert McIntosh and his law firm. O\u2019 Shaughnessy, through local counsel, filed a complaint against McIntosh and his firm, alleging McIntosh\u2019s conduct in a state court proceeding breached McIntosh\u2019s fiduciary duties as a court appointed co-trustee of the James Walther <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>Revocable Life Insurance Trust (the trust). O\u2019Shaughnessy claimed that McIntosh failed to disclose to the state court that his co-trustee, Patrick Walther, mishandled the trust and physically abused Dorothy, that McIntosh lied to the state court when he reported that Dorothy would not disclose her financial and medical records to him, and that McIntosh conspired with the trustee and the trustee\u2019s attorney to institute a guardianship over Dorothy to deprive her of the ability to control her own assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">After the district court granted summary judgment to McIntosh and his firm, the court imposed Rule 11 sanctions against O\u2019Shaughnessy in the amount of $21,708.75. This interlocutory appeal of the district court\u2019s Rule 11 order followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, O\u2019Shaughnessy argues the district court abused its discretion by imposing sanctions because (1) the case involved an issue of first impression under Florida law regarding whether a trust beneficiary could sue a court appointed trustee, and Rule 11 sanctions are not appropriate to punish an attorney for advancing a legal theory on a question of first impression, (2) the district court failed to resolve all doubts in O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s favor, and (3) O\u2019Shaughnessy conducted a reasonable investigation under the circumstances. After a thorough review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">The district court did not abuse its substantial discretion in imposing Rule 11 sanctions against O\u2019Shaughnessy. <em>See Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 405, 407, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990) (holding that courts of appeals should review all aspects of the district court\u2019s Rule 11 determination for abuse of discretion and noting that \u201cthe district court has broad discretion to impose Rule 11 sanctions\u201d). Sanctions are warranted when a party files a document that (1) has no reasonable factual basis; (2) is based on a legal theory that has no reasonable chance of success and cannot be advanced as a reasonable argument to change existing law; or (3) is filed in bad faith or for an improper purpose. <em>Anderson v. Smithfield Foods, Inc., </em>353 F.3d 912, 915 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(b), (c). In addition, Rule 11 imposes \u201can affirmative duty to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the facts and the law before filing,\u201d and \u201cthe applicable standard is one of reasonableness under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Bus. Guides, Inc. v. Chromatic Commc\u2019ns Enters., Inc., </em>498 U.S. 533, 551, 111 S.Ct. 922, 112 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">Contrary to O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s arguments, the district court did not sanction him for pursuing an issue of first impression. Instead, the district court acknowledged that prior case law was not directly controlling and that the legal theory O\u2019Shaughnessy advanced was not completely frivolous. The district court considered the tenuous nature of the legal theory simply as a single factor among many in concluding sanctions were warranted. In addition to the tenuous legal basis for the claims, the district court explained that O\u2019Shaughnessy failed to thoroughly investigate the facts before filing the complaint in federal court, stating that his investigation was \u201cwholly insufficient\u201d given the circumstances of the case and numerous indicators that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>O\u2019Shaughnessy should have done more to investigate the facts of the case. The district court pointed to numerous specific facts and circumstances that should have alerted a reasonable attorney to a need for further investigation, and we cannot say the district court abused its broad discretion by imposing sanctions for O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s failure to conduct a reasonable investigation that would have demonstrated the frivolity of the factual allegations in the complaint. <em>See Worldwide Primates, Inc. v. McGreal, </em>87 F.3d 1252, 1254 (11th Cir.1996) (\u201cIf the attorney failed to make a reasonable inquiry, then the court must impose sanctions despite the attorney\u2019s good faith belief that the claims were sound.\u201d); <em>see also Cooter &amp; Gell, </em>496 U.S. at 404, 110 S.Ct. 2447 (explaining that determining whether Rule 11 sanctions are warranted involves \u201cfact-intensive, close calls,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he district court is best acquainted with the local bar\u2019s litigation practices and thus best situated to determine when a sanction is warranted to serve Rule ll\u2019s goal of specific and general deterrence\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order imposing Rule 11 sanctions against O\u2019Shaughnessy is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-7\">. In addition to suing McIntosh and his law firm, O\u2019Shaughnessy also pursued claims against another attorney and that attorney\u2019s law firm for their actions related to the state court proceedings. Although those claims remain pending, we have jurisdiction over the instant appeal under the collateral order doctrine. <em>See DeSisto Coll., Inc. v. Line, </em>888 F.2d 755, 763 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b906-6\">. O'Shaughnessy also briefly argues in a footnote in his initial brief that the district court's award of attorney\u2019s fees as a sanction amounted to impermissible fee-shifting. That argument lacks merit, as the Supreme Court has specifically held that Rule 11 sanctions do not amount to fee shifting, <em>Bus. Guides, Inc., </em>498 U.S. at 551-53, 111 S.Ct. 922, and the text of Rule 11 explicitly authorizes the district court to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as a sanction, Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(c)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b906-21\">. McIntosh\u2019s motion for sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 is DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
