Specifically, Newberry raises two challenges to the finding of the Administrate Law Judge (ALJ) that she is not disabled. First, she contends the ALJ failed to specify the weight he gave to the opinion of Dr. Carlos Giron, Newberry\u2019s pain specialist, or his reasons for rejecting certain portions of Dr. Giron\u2019s opinion. Second, New-berry contends the ALJ failed to explain his reasons rejecting Newberry\u2019s own testimony concerning her pain or to specify which aspects of her testimony he rejected. Upon review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we reject each of New-berry\u2019s contentions and affirm the denial of her application.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-20\">Newberry first contends the ALJ erred by failing to state with particularity the weight given to the different medical opinions presented and his reasons for the weights assigned. <em>See Sharfarz v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 278, 279 (11th Cir.1987). However, in evaluating Dr. Giron\u2019s opinion, the ALJ explained that his opinion was unsupported by other objective medical evidence in the record, which included MRIs that revealed only mild or minimal spinal abnormalities and the absence of neurological abnormalities at Newberry\u2019s most recent orthopedic consultative examination. The ALJ also determined that Dr. Giron ordered a conservative course of treatment, which belied his findings of severe limitations, and determined that the evaluation of Dr. J.W. Spivey, a consultative examiner, was more consistent with other evidence in the record, such as the routine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>activities Newberry undertook in her daily life. <em>See Harwell v. Heckler, </em>735 <em>F.2d </em>1292, 1293 (11th Cir.1984). These were sufficient reasons to explain the ALJ\u2019s treatment of Dr. Giron\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Newberry faults the ALJ for not explicitly assigning weight to every part of Dr. Giron\u2019s opinion and for not discussing Dr. Giron\u2019s finding that Newberry would need to lie down at times throughout a workday. However, \u201cthere is no rigid requirement that the ALJ specifically refer to every piece of evidence in his decision,\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhard, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir.2005), and even if the ALJ erroneously failed to explicitly assign weight to and discuss every aspect of Dr. Giron\u2019s opinion, this error was harmless because it is still clear that the ALJ\u2019s rejection of the portions of Dr. Giron\u2019s opinion that are inconsistent with the ALJ\u2019s ultimate conclusion was based on substantial evidence, <em>see Diorio v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir.1983) (classifying certain errors as harmless in the context of the substantial-evidence standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Newberry\u2019s second contention is that the ALJ failed to explain his rejection of Newberry\u2019s subjective accounts of her own pain. However, because the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination was sufficient for us to conclude that he considered Newberry\u2019s condition as a whole, the determination is sufficient. <em>Dyer, </em>395 F.3d at 1210. Although the ALJ\u2019s explanation as to his adverse credibility determination was terse, before making the finding he considered Newberry\u2019s activities of daily living, the frequency of her symptoms, the types and effects of her medications, and her overall treatment history. Thus it is clear the ALJ considered Newberry\u2019s condition as a whole and that his determination of Newberry\u2019s credibility was based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">In sum, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding as to Newberry\u2019s residual functional capacity and ability to perform limited sedentary work. Consequently, we must affirm the denial of her application.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-18\">. In a Social Security appeal, we review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence and based upon proper legal standards. <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011). \"We may not decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner,\u201d <em>id. </em>(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted), and \"[ejven if the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner\u2019s findings, we must affirm if the decision reached is supported by substantial evidence,\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158-59 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
