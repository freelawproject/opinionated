According to Mr. Zhu, he fears he would be subject to forced sterilization and significant fines if returned to China based on his violation of the one-child policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Because the BIA agreed with the immigration judge\u2019s order and made additional observations, we review both decisions. <em>See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cWe review the decision of the Board, and we review the decision of the Immigration Judge to the extent that the Board expressly adopted the opinion of the Immigration Judge.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). We review conclusions of law de novo and factual determinations, including findings of removability and credibility determinations, for substantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 1350-51; <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2006). Under the substantial evidence test, we draw every reasonable inference in favor of the decision, and reverse a finding of fact only if the record compels reversal. <em>See Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">I. Removability</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, \u201c[a]n alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, or who arrives in the United States at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General, is inadmissible.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae. In removal proceedings, the alien bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that he was inspected and admitted to the United States with procedural regularity. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(c). <em>See also Garces v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>611 F.3d 1337, 1345-46 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">Mr. Zhu initially admitted the allegations of removability, and his first application for adjustment of status indicated that he entered the United States without inspection on October 31, 1997. He later sought to amend his position and testified that, with the assistance of a snakehead, he used someone else\u2019s passport to enter the United States with inspection on October 26, 1997. Although the IJ concluded that the \u201cmore credible evidence\u201d was that Mr. Zhu entered the United States without inspection, the IJ did not make a \u201cclean determination!] of credibility.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also id. </em>(\u201cThough the IJ made a reference to Yang\u2019s claims as a \u2018ridiculous fabrication\u2019 and stated that her testimony was \u2018extremely inconsistent and [made] absolutely no sense whatsoever,\u2019 we are not persuaded that this was an explicit finding that Yang\u2019s testimony was not credible.\u201d) (alteration in original). Because the IJ did not make an adverse credibility determination, we \u201caccept [this] testimony as credible.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1354 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">The IJ ultimately concluded that Mr. Zhu\u2019s testimony alone was insufficient to meet his burden of proof due to the lack of corroborative evidence. The IJ noted that Mr. Zhu could have subpoenaed the airline\u2019s records to show that he entered the United States under a different name on October 26, 1997, but he failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">As the BIA correctly noted, the IJ was not required to accept Mr. Zhu\u2019s version of events, even if credible, without corroboration. But \u201ceven under circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>where corroboration may reasonably be expected, petitioners may meet their burden of proof by offering a believable and sufficient explanation as to why such corroborating evidence was not presented.\u201d <em>Diallo v. I.N.S., </em>232 F.3d 279, 289-90 (2d Cir.2000). <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii) (\u201cWhere the trier of fact determines that the applicant should provide evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony, such evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.\u201d). Mr. Zhu attempted to do so here by explaining that DHS did not respond to his Freedom of Information Act request, and that the airline informed him that it did not keep records dating back to his time of entry. Neither the BIA nor the IJ addressed the sufficiency of Mr. Zhu\u2019s explanations for the absence of corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Every circuit court to address the issue has held that \u201cbefore the failure to produce corroborating evidence can be held against an applicant, there must be explicit findings that (1) it was reasonable to expect the applicant to produce corroboration and (2) the applicant\u2019s failure to do so was not adequately explained.\u201d <em>Soeung v. Holder, </em>677 F.3d 484, 488 (1st Cir.2012). <em>Accord Omondi v. Holder, </em>674 F.3d 793, 798 (8th Cir.2012) (same); <em>Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 554 (3d Cir.2001) (same); <em>Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 289-90 (same). As the Seventh Circuit explained in <em>Hor v. Gonzales, </em>421 F.3d 497, 500-01 (7th Cir.2005), \u201can immigration judge\u2019s determination that if there were evidence to corroborate the alien\u2019s testimony the alien could and should have presented it is entitled to reasonable deference. The precondition to deference is that the immigration judge explain (unless it is obvious) why he thinks corroborating evidence, if it existed, would have been available to the alien.\u201d Because the BIA and the IJ failed to make such findings here, we vacate the BIA\u2019s order and remand the matter for a determination of whether Mr. Zhu adequately explained his failure to provide corroboration. <em>See Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1237 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201c[T]he general practice in this circuit is to remand when the IJ or BIA fails to make adequate findings or give reasoned consideration to all the evidence.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">II. Withholding of Removal and CAT Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">Mr. Zhu also challenges the BIA\u2019s order upholding the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">In order to be eligible for withholding of removal, the applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that it is \u201c \u2018more likely than not\u2019 [he] will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to [his] country.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005). <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) (\u201c[T]he Attorney General may not remove an alien to a country if the Attorney General decides that the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d). Persecution is an \u201cextreme concept\u201d and requires \u201cmore than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulve-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number><em>da, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Mr. Zhu did not allege past persecution, he is entitled to withholding of removal under the INA only \u201cif he can demonstrate a future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground in his country.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">To establish eligibility for CAT relief, an applicant must show that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). \u201cTorture is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering ... is intentionally inflicted on a person for ... any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Upon review of the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the denial of Mr. Zhu\u2019s application for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. To show an objectively reasonable, well-founded fear of persecution under China\u2019s one-child policy, an alien must show: (1) objective evidence of the details of the policy relevant to him; (2) a violation of the policy; and (3) the violation would be punished in the local area in a way that would give rise to an objective fear of future persecution. <em>In re J-H-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 196, 198-99 (B.I.A.2007). <em>See also Wu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>745 F.3d 1140, 1155 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Although Mr. Zhu submitted materials indicating that family planning officials in some provinces in China used physical coercion to compel sterilization, there was evidence that Chinese law prohibits such tactics, and Mr. Zhu did not demonstrate that such tactics have been used in his province of Fujian. For example, the articles submitted by Mr. Zhu indicate that forced sterilization of women has occurred, but do not discuss forced sterilization of men, and Mr. Zhu admitted that his wife would not be subjected to forced sterilization because she is a United States citizen. Other submitted reports indicate that the extended family or husbands of those in violation of the policy could be punished, and that residents in Guangdong Province could be forced to pay a fine of up to six times the family\u2019s income, but Mr. Zhu offered no evidence establishing that he and his wife, who had children in the United States, would be in violation of the one-child policy in his province of Fujian. <em>See </em>A.R. at 539 (\u201cIt is not clear if children born outside of China are subject to the penalties set out in the Fujian family planning legislation.\u201d); A.R. at 298 (\u201cTo get around the one child policy, parents give birth abroad .... Depending on the place and the situation the fine [for having more than one child] can vary between $370 and $12,800.\u201d). <em>See also Wu, </em>745 F.3d at 1155 (\u201cWu did not show the existence of a policy that counted U.S.-born children towards the number of children allowed under China\u2019s family planning policy.\u201d). Accordingly, the record does not compel the conclusion that it was more likely than not that Mr. Zhu would suffer persecution or torture, either in the form of forced sterilization or fines rising to the level of persecution, should he return to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Mr. Zhu\u2019s contention that the BIA dismissed his claims without any discussion or analysis of the evidence, and thus did not issue a reasoned decision, lacks merit. The BIA\u2019s opinion shows that it gave reasoned consideration to Mr. Zhu\u2019s petition and made adequate findings, as it discussed all of the IJ\u2019s findings and wrote separately to address the issue of remova-bility. It did not need to specifically address each piece of evidence presented. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number><em>Seck v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>663 F.3d 1356, 1364 (11th Cir.2011) (\u201cWhere the BIA has given reasoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate findings, we will not require that it address specifically each claim the petitioner made or each piece of evidence the petitioner presented.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we grant Mr. Zhu\u2019s petition as to the issue of removability, and deny Mr. Zhu\u2019s petition as to his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief. We reverse the BIA\u2019s order as to removability and remand to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">PETITION GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-6\">. On appeal, Mr. Zhu only presents arguments as to withholding of removal and CAT relief, and he has thus abandoned any challenges to the BIA's denial of his asylum claim. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2 (\"When an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b729-18\">. We lack jurisdiction to consider Mr. Zhu\u2019s argument that the IJ failed to issue a reasoned decision because he failed to raise it before the BIA. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006); INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (requiring a petitioner to exhaust all available administrative remedies).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
