Mr. Johnson argues that the residual clause in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) defining a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is unconstitutionally vague. Mr. Johnson further asserts that \u201crobbery by sudden snatching\u201d is not a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d He acknowledges that our precedent forecloses both of these arguments and only intends to preserve them for consideration by this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>or the Supreme Court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">We review constitutional sentencing issues <em>de novo. See United States v. Harris, </em>741 F.3d 1245, 1248 (11th Cir.2014). We also review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Contreras, </em>739 F.3d 592, 594 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">The standard base offense level for a violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1) is 14, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6)(A), but is increased to. 20 if the defendant committed the instant offense \u201csubsequent to sustaining one felony conviction ... of a crime of violence.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). \u201cCrime of violence\u201d is defined, in relevant part, in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 as \u201cany offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that ... (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or <em>otherwise involves conduct that presents a senous potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) (emphasis added). The residual clause in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) (emphasized above) is at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">\u201c[A] prior panel\u2019s holding is binding on all subsequent panels unless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this court sitting <em>en banc.\u201d United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). As acknowledged by Mr. Johnson, our prior precedent forecloses his argument that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">The definitions of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines and \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) contain virtually identical residual clauses. <em>See United States v. Alexander, </em>609 F.3d 1250, 1253 (11th Cir.2010) (explaining that the definitions of \u201cviolent felony\u201d and \u201ccrime of violence\u201d are \u201cvirtually identical\u201d and considering whether a crime is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d is similar to considering whether a crime is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">Several years ago, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the residual clause of the ACCA is unconstitutionally vague. <em>See James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 210 n. 6, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). The Court stated that the \u201crequirement that an unenumerated crime \u2018otherwise involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u2019 is not so indefinite as to prevent an ordinary person from understanding what conduct it prohibits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 2277, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>(citation and quotation marks omitted), the Supreme Court similarly noted that ACCA\u2019s residual clause \u201cstates an intelligible principle and provides guidance that allows a person to conform his or her conduct to the law. Although this approach may at times be more difficult for courts to implement, it is within congressional power to enact.\u201d We too have concluded that the residual clause of the ACCA is not, unconstitutionally vague. <em>See United States v. Gandy, </em>710 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Mr. Johnson\u2019s argument that \u201crobbery by sudden snatching\u201d does not fit into the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is similarly foreclosed by analogous precedent. Although have not held explicitly that the residual clause of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) includes \u201crobbery by sudden snatching,\u201d we have held that \u201crobbery by sudden snatching\u201d is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the residual clause of the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Welch, </em>683 F.3d 1304, 1312-13 (11th Cir.2012). In <em>Welch, </em>we concluded that \u201crobbery by sudden snatching\u201d presents \u201ca serious risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Based on Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit precedent, we reject Mr. Johnson\u2019s argument that the residual clause of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 is unconstitutionally vague. We also conclude, under our analogous precedent, that the district court properly calculated the base offense level as 20 because Mr. Johnson\u2019s prior felony conviction of \u201crobbery by sudden snatching\u201d constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
