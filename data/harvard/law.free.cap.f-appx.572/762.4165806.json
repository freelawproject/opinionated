She contends that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) erred by failing to: (1) give proper deference to her treating physician\u2019s opinion, (2) credit her subjective complaints about her pain, and (3) provide substantial evidence that there were significant jobs in the national economy available to someone in her position.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Markuske filed an application in July 2009 for disability insurance benefits under the Social Security Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423. Markuske had worked as a computer programmer from 1984 to 2004, but quit because pain and numbness in her hands and arms prevented her from concentrating on her coding. She claimed that, beginning in January 2009, she was disabled due to carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands, ulnar nerve neuritis, cubital tunnel syndrome, median neuropathy, ten-donopathy of the distal triceps tendon, a cervical disc protrusion, osteoarthritis, and muscle spasms. The Social Security Administration denied her initial application and her request for reconsideration. Mar-kuske then sought a hearing before an ALJ, which was held on May 18, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The ALJ applied the established five-step analysis for determining eligibility for disability insurance benefits. <em>See Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520 (2013). The ALJ found as follows: (1) Markuske had not engaged in substantial gainful activity from her alleged onset date of January 21, 2009, through December 31, 2009, which was her date last insured.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) Markuske had severe impairments consisting of depression, anxiety, specific phobia (situational), fibro-myalgia, and carpal tunnel syndrome. (3) Those impairments did not meet or equal one of the Commissioner\u2019s listings of impairment, whether considered singly or in combination. (4) Markuske retained the residual functional capacity (RFC) to perform a reduced range of light work but was unable to perform her past relevant work.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">In the fifth and final step, the burden of proof shifts to the Commissioner to prove that there is a significant number of jobs in the national economy that the claimant is capable of performing. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2 (11th Cir.2001). The ALJ therefore elicited testimony from a vocational expert (VE). In her first hypothetical question, the ALJ asked the VE if a person of Markuske\u2019s age, education, and work experience could perform certain jobs existing in the national economy if she were limited to: (1) performing light work; (2) never climbing ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; (3) occasionally climbing stairs and ramps; (4) occasionally balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling; (5) frequently performing fine and gross manipulations with her dominant hand; and (6) receiving only simple instructions and procedures. The VE answered that there was sufficient work available to such a person, including as a housekeeper and a sales attendant. The ALJ then asked a second hypothetical question that further limited the hypothetical individual to only occasional fine and gross manipulation with her dominant hand. The VE responded that there would still be sufficient work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>available, including as a furniture rental consultant and a children\u2019s attendant. Finally, the ALJ changed the limitation on the hypothetical individual\u2019s dominant hand one more time, asking what jobs would be available if the individual had \u201climited right-hand dominant fingering.\u201d The YE answered that \u201c[a]ll light jobs\u201d would be available to such an individual, including housekeeper, sales attendant, furniture rental consultant, and children\u2019s attendant. Based on the VE\u2019s testimony, the ALJ determined that Markuske had sufficient work opportunities and therefore was not entitled to disability insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Markuske requested review by the Social Security Appeals Council and had her request denied in July 2012. She then filed suit in district court, seeking judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner in November 2018. This is Markuske\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision in a Social Security case, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir.2007); <em>Miles v. Chater, </em>84 F.3d 1397, 1400 (11th Cir.1996). That means we review <em>de novo </em>the Commissioner\u2019s legal conclusions, but review factual findings only to determine if \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d supports them. <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1260 (quotation marks omitted). On the evidentiary continuum, substantial evidence falls in between a scintilla of evidence and a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Miles, </em>84 F.3d at 1400. Evidence is \u201csubstantial\u201d if a reasonable person could accept that it adequately supports a conclusion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-13\">Markuske contends that the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment should have included the limitations identified by her treating neurologist, Dr. Qin Gu, in a medical source statement form.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The opinion of a treating physician \u201cis entitled to substantial weight unless good cause exists for not heeding the treating physician\u2019s diagnosis.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Sullivan, </em>937 F.2d 580, 583 (11th Cir.1991). Good cause exists if, among other things, the ALJ \u201cclearly articulates\u201d why the \u201cevidence supported a contrary finding.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1241 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-14\">In filling out the form, Dr. Gu gave answers that placed severe limitations on Markuske\u2019s ability to work. For example, he indicated that Markuske\u2019s impairments would prevent her from: lifting objects on more than an occasional basis, standing or walking for more than two hours each workday, and sitting for more than two hours each workday. Dr. Gu also estimated that Markuske\u2019s impairments would cause her to miss more than four workdays per month. Every time the form asked Dr. Gu to identify the medical findings supporting his opinion, he answered that he based his opinion on the \u201cchief complaints\u201d he heard from Markuske.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-15\">The ALJ gave Dr. Gu\u2019s assessment \u201clittle weight\u201d because it was \u201cnot supported by evidence in the record.\u201d First, the ALJ cited Dr. Gu\u2019s own treatment notes, which indicated that an MRI showed that Markuske had \u201conly a minimal disc protrusion and mild degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine\u201d and that medication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>had \u201cstabilized\u201d her neck pain. Second, the ALJ cited Markuske\u2019s \u201cself-report that her medications were effective in relieving her pain symptoms.\u201d For example, her chiropractor\u2019s treatment notes show that, after two months of chiropractic treatment and taking Aleve, Markuske reported a dramatic improvement in her back and neck pain. Her neck pain went from a seven on a ten-point scale to a four, and her back pain went from a four to a two. And in the \u201cPain Report\u201d that Markuske included with her disability application, she acknowledged that Zanaflex helped relieve her pain symptoms. Finally, the ALJ noted that the doctors who examined Markuske\u2019s back reported only \u201cminimal findings of tenderness of the lumbar and sacral regions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">The ALJ provided a clear articulation of why the evidence undermined Dr. Gu\u2019s opinion on the medical source statement form and thus established good cause. <em>See Edwards, </em>937 F.2d at 583. The contradictory treatment notes from Dr. Gu, statements from Markuske, and clinical observations all supported the ALJ\u2019s finding that Dr. Gu\u2019s answers on the medical source statement form were exaggerations of Markuske\u2019s limitations. <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241 (holding that the evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s contrary finding where the treating physician was contradicted by his previous treatment notes and the claimant\u2019s admissions about her activities). The ALJ therefore did not err by giving the form little weight.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Markuske also contends that the ALJ failed to properly credit her subjective complaints of pain and limitations. A claimant can establish a disability through personal testimony about pain or other symptoms. But the claimant must support that testimony by also meeting two parts of a three-part showing: \u201c(1) evidence of an underlying medical condition; and (2) either (a) objective medical evidence confirming the severity of the alleged pain; or (b) that the objectively determined medical condition can reasonably be expected to give rise to the claimed pain.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2002). If the claimant satisfies that three-part test, the ALJ cannot discredit the claimant\u2019s testimony unless the ALJ \u201carticulate[s] explicit and adequate reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">At the hearing before the ALJ, Mar-kuske testified that she had \u201cconstant pain\u201d in her hands and neck. She also described experiencing a \u201cshooting pain ... that goes from my neck down my arms.\u201d She explained that the neck pain also led to the headaches that prevented her from continuing to work as a computer programmer. Finally, she said that she suffered pain in her lower back and hips if she sat or stood too long.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">The ALJ concluded that Markuske\u2019s subjective complaints of pain were not credible to the extent that they were in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>consistent with the RFC determination that the ALJ had made. The ALJ justified that conclusion based on her finding that \u201cthe medical evidence reflects only minimal to mild medical findings for impairments of the back, neck and elbow.\u201d First, the ALJ addressed Markuske\u2019s neck pain, noting that the same grounds for discounting Dr. Gu\u2019s medical source statement form applied to Markuske\u2019s complaints. Next, the ALJ addressed Mar-kuske\u2019s back pain. The ALJ pointed out that examining physicians noted only \u201cminimal findings of tenderness of the lumbar and sacral regions\u201d and \u201cobserved [her] sitting comfortably and having no difficulty getting out of a seated position.\u201d Finally, the ALJ addressed Markuske\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome. The ALJ noted that nerve conduction studies showed that Mar-kuske\u2019s elbow pain had improved, culminating in Dr. Gu\u2019s March 2009 study concluding that she had \u201c[b]asically normal nerve conduction.\u201d The ALJ also cited Dr. Gu\u2019s January 2009 examination notes, in which he found that Markuske\u2019s arms had \u201c5/5 muscle strength, normal muscle tone, and normal range of motion of the shoulders despite tenderness and decreased strength of the right elbow and hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The objective medical evidence cited by the ALJ provided \u201cadequate reasons\u201d for her decision to partially discredit Mar-kuske\u2019s subjective complaints. <em>See Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1225; <em>see also, e.g., Tucker v. Barnhart, </em>363 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Finally, Markuske contends that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions to the VE were fatally flawed because they did not include: (1) her moderate limitations in concentration, persistence, or pace; and (2)her phobia of the germs in hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">As for the concentration, persistence, or pace limitations, the ALJ found that Markuske had \u201cmoderate difficulties\u201d in maintaining attention. The ALJ qualified that finding by pointing out that Mar-kuske reported that she had \u201ca \u2018fine\u2019 ability to follow written instructions,\u201d and that a non-examining state agency consultant, Dr. Ronald Chase, had determined that she \u201ccould perform simple tasks at an acceptable pace.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The ALJ then incorporated those limitations in her hypothetical questions to the VE by specifying that the hypothetical individual \u201ccould understand, remember, and carry out simple instructions and procedures, ... may show occasional difficulty with more complex tasks, [and] could sustain task and perform an acceptable pace.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question thus included the limitations supported by the medical evidence, which is all that is necessary. <em>See Meredith v. Bowen, </em>833 F.2d 650, 654 (7th Cir.1987) (\u201cAll that is required is that the hypothetical question be supported by the medical evidence in the record.\u201d); <em>cf. Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1180-81 (indicating that an ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question is proper if it matches the limitations specified by the medical evidence). Markuske does not identify any other limitations in concentration, persistence, or pace that were supported by medical evidence and omitted by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-14\">As for Markuske\u2019s phobia about germs in hospitals, none of the jobs identified by the VE were limited to hospitals. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Most of them \u2014 housekeeper, furniture rental consultant, and children\u2019s attendant \u2014 by definition involve work outside of a hospital setting. So even if we assume that the ALJ erred by omitting a limitation that addressed Markuske\u2019s phobia of hospitals, that limitation would not have changed the VE\u2019s answer or the ALJ\u2019s legal conclusion. The alleged error was therefore harmless. <em>See Diorio v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir.1983) (holding that a mistake by the ALJ that does not affect her ultimate conclusion is harmless error).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b786-8\">. The ALJ determined that Markuske had \"acquired sufficient quarters of coverage to remain insured through December 31, <em>2009\u201d </em>but no further. <em>See generally </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.101 (2013). Markuske does not dispute that determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b787-8\">. The medical source statement form is a standardized questionnaire used to ascertain a physician\u2019s opinion on the claimant\u2019s physical or mental limitations. <em>See, e.g., Cox v. Barnhart, </em>345 F.3d 606, 610 (8th Cir.2003); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(b)(6) (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b788-5\">. We also note that the record provides an additional ground for the ALJ's decision. \"A treating physician\u2019s report may be discounted when it is not accompanied by objective medical evidence or is wholly conclusory.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1159 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted). Thus, an AU may discount a treating physician's opinion where it \"appears to be based primarily on [the claimant\u2019s] subjective complaints of pain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is the case with Dr. Gu\u2019s opinion. On the medical source statement form, Dr. Gu confirmed that all of his opinions on Markuske\u2019s limitations were based on her \"chief complaints.\u201d Chief complaint is a medical term of art for the patient's subjective description of the ailment for which she is seeking medical treatment. So Dr. Gu's answers on the form were based on Markuske\u2019s subjective complaints, not objective medical evidence that Dr. Gu gleaned through observation or testing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b789-8\">. In full, Dr. Chase determined that Markuske \"has the capacity to understand, remember and carry out simple instructions and procedures, and make appropriate decisions. [She] may show occasional difficulty with more complex tasks as a result of symptoms. [She] is able to sustain simple tasks and perform at an acceptable pace.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
