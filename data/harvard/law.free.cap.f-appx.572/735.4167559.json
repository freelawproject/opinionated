Because the district court properly exercised its discretion to decline to reduce Hargrove\u2019s total 240-month sentence following its consideration of the relevant sentencing factors, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-23\">Following a jury trial in 2010, Hargrove was convicted of four counts of distributing crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(iii), and (b)(1)(C). At sentencing, the district court held Har-grove responsible for 16.4 grams of crack cocaine, resulting in a guidelines range of 100 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment under the drug quantity tables in effect at the time. But because Hargrove had prior felony drug convictions, he faced a mandatory 120-month statutory minimum sentence, which changed his guidelines range to 120 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(iii) (2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2). The court then departed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>upward eight levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a), noting that Hargrove\u2019s criminal history category of VI substantially under-represented the seriousness of his criminal history. The resulting guidelines range became 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the court ultimately imposed a total sentence of 240 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">In 2012, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>considered Hargrove\u2019s eligibility for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in light of the enactment of Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. But the court stated that it lacked the authority to grant relief because Hargrove\u2019s guidelines range was based on a mandatory statutory minimum. On appeal, we vacated and remanded based on the district court\u2019s erroneous conclusion that it lacked the authority to grant a sentence reduction. On remand, the district court acknowledged that it had the authority to grant Hargrove a sentence reduction, but noted that the 240-month sentence remained appropriate in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">In his instant appeal, Hargrove argues that the district court erred by failing to properly recalculate his guidelines range based on the applicability of Amendment 750. He also asserts that the court\u2019s failure to give notice to the parties and allow them to submit pleadings on remand resulted in a decision that did not consider all of the relevant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cA district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). A district court has discretion to reduce the imprisonment term if a defendant\u2019s sentence is based on a sentencing range that was later lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">A district court must follow a two-step process in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s sentence by \u201csubstituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, \u201cthe court shall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). \u201cAll other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain intact.\u201d <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">Second, the district court must decide whether, in its discretion and in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, to retain the original sentence or to resentence the defendant under the amended guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 781; <em>see also United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cThe grant of authority to the district court to reduce a term of imprisonment [under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ] is unambiguously discretionary.\u201d). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to adequately deter criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">The district court\u2019s denial of Hargrove\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was not an abuse of discretion. First, we find no merit to Har-grove\u2019s assertion that the court failed to properly calculate his amended guideline range. In light of our remand order, the court acknowledged that Hargrove was eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 750 reduced the high-end of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>his guideline range from 125 to 120 months. <em>United States v. Hargrove, </em>732 F.3d 1253, 1255 (11th Cir.2013). Although the court did not expressly consider the effect of the upward departure under \u00a7 4A1.3(b) in calculating Hargrove\u2019s amended guideline range, we have explained that a district court has the discretion to reapply a downward departure, <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 761, and nothing in our case law suggests a different conclusion about an upward departure, <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Turning to the second step of the analysis, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to reduce Har-grove\u2019s sentence in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. The record demonstrates that the district court took the pertinent sentencing factors into account, including the need for deterrence and to protect the public in light of Hargrove\u2019s extensive criminal history. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cThe district court is not required to articulate the applicability of each factor, as long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Lastly, we find no merit to Hargrove\u2019s argument that the court erred by failing to allow him an opportunity to advance additional arguments on remand. Hargrove fails to show changed circumstances from his sentencing hearing or his first \u00a7 3582 proceeding \u2014 where both parties had the opportunity to fully brief the issues \u2014 that would have necessitated additional responses from the parties. <em>See United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cBecause a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not a <em>de novo </em>re-sentencing, courts need not permit re-litigation of any information available at the original sentencing. Nor is either party entitled to any response when the court does not intend to <em>rely </em>on new information\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">In sum, Hargrove has not established that the district court\u2019s decision to maintain his 240-month sentence constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
