On appeal, Garcia argues that the sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court provided limited explanation of its reasons for imposing it and made improper remarks concerning immigration policy and Garcia\u2019s immigration status during his sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">We review sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). Reasonableness is reviewed under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of showing that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we first ensure that the sentence was proeedurally reasonable, meaning the district court properly calculated the guidelines range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. In its explanation, the district court \u201cshould set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that [it] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). When a party \u201cpresents nonfrivolous reasons for imposing a different sentence, however, the [district court] will normally go further and explain why [it] has rejected those arguments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 127 S.Ct. at 2468. Nevertheless, such explanation need not be extensive \u201c[w]here a matter is ... conceptually simple ... and the record makes clear that the sentencing judge considered the evidence and arguments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, 127 S.Ct. at 2469.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">When revoking a defendant\u2019s term of supervised release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), the district court is to consider certain \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine an appropriate sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Specifically, courts are directed to consider: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to deter criminal conduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, and provide the defendant with education or treatment; (3) the applicable guidelines range; (4) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (5) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (6) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), (a)(4)-(7). The district court need not discuss or explicitly state on the record each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, and the court\u2019s acknowledgment that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the parties\u2019 arguments is sufficient. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). Even when the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>court could \u201chave said more\u201d in its explanation, we have considered the context and the record to determine what reasoning underlies the sentencing decision. <em>See United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2007) (concluding that, given the record, the district court\u2019s explanation of its within-guidelines sentence was adequate).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">We have stated that \u201ca judge may not impose a more severe sentence than he would have otherwise based on unfounded assumptions regarding an individual\u2019s immigration status or on his personal views of immigration policy.\u201d <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1253 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Velasquez, </em>the district court sentenced Velasquez to nine months\u2019 imprisonment for violating his supervised release because it could not comprehend why an immigration judge had released him on bond. <em>Id. </em>at 1249, 1251-52. We stated that the district court had imposed Velasquez\u2019s sentence as if it were reviewing and overturning the immigration judge\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1252 n. 3. In vacating Velasquez\u2019s sentence, we explained that the district court had attempted to usurp the role of the executive branch. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The district court\u2019s sentence was not procedurally unreasonable. There was no indication that the district court was attempting to usurp the role of the executive branch or that it sentenced Garcia to a higher sentence based on improper immigration concerns. Moreover, the court\u2019s explanation for the sentence was sufficient, given that Garcia\u2019s case was conceptually simple and that the court imposed a guidelines sentence after acknowledging the arguments of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
