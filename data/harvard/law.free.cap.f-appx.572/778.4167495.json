Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b801-23\">A. 1988 Entry and 1999 Adjustment of Status</p>\n<p id=\"b801-24\">In 1988, Cover, a Jamaican citizen, entered the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor. In 1999, Cover\u2019s status was adjusted to a lawful permanent resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>B. 2007 Conviction and Notice to Appear</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">In 2007, Cover pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(vii), 846. The district court sentenced Cover to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment. Cover did not appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">As a result of his conviction, in May 2007, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) issued a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), charging Cover as a native and citizen of Jamaica who was removable for two reasons: (1) under INA \u00a7 237(a) (2) (A) (iii), as an alien who had been convicted of an aggravated felony, and (2) under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)(i), as an alien who had been convicted of a controlled substance offense. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (a)(2)(B)(i). The NTA was not served, however, until 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">C. August 2011 IJ Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">At the August 2011 hearing in immigration court, Cover appeared <em>pro se. </em>The IJ asked Cover, \u201c[A]re you from Jamaica, and you speak English?\u201d Cover responded, \u2018Tes, sir.\u201d Cover asked for additional time to prepare. His hearing was rescheduled for October 27, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">D. Cover\u2019s 2011 Motion for Termination of Removal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">Prior to the October 27 hearing, Cover, <em>pro se, </em>filed a \u201cMotion for Termination of Removal Proceedings And Motion for Issuance of an Order Directing the Department of Homeland Security to Renew Expired Permanent Resident Card.\u201d In the motion, Cover admitted that (1) he was a permanent resident, residing in the United States since 1988, and a noncitizen and (2) his permanent resident card expired in June 2009. Cover requested that the IJ order the agency to renew his card.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-13\">Cover also acknowledged that he had pled guilty to a controlled substance offense and, as a result, was removable. Cover argued that the government was estopped from removing him because it had induced Cover to plead guilty by telling him that he would not be removed. Cover alleged that the promise was made orally; it was not included in his written plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-14\">Cover\u2019s attachments to the motion to terminate included: (1) several letters from Cover\u2019s family members asking that Cover not be removed to Jamaica, two of which stated that Cover\u2019s place of birth was Jamaica and (2) a letter to a prison official, at the correctional facility where Cover was incarcerated, requesting immigration law materials because, <em>inter alia, </em>he was a \u201cdeportable alien\u201d and a \u201cnon-U.S. citizen[ ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-15\">E.Pre-October 27, 2011 Government Exhibits</p>\n<p id=\"b802-16\">Sometime prior to the October 27 hearing, the government filed two exhibits: (1) a Form 1-213 Record of Deportable/Inad-missible Alien, indicating that Cover\u2019s place of birth and citizenship was Jamaica; and (2) a criminal judgment showing that Cover was convicted - of the crime described in NTA. A stamp on the judgment, by the U.S. District Court Clerk for the Middle District of Florida, certified the document as a \u201ctrue and correct copy of the original.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>F. October 27, 2011 Removal Order</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">At the October 27, 2011 hearing, the IJ asked Cover if he would admit the allegations in the NTA. Cover admitted he was a convicted felon, but declined to answer further.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The IJ found Cover removable to Jamaica. The government pointed out that \u201cfor the record ... all of the matters contained in the NTA are addressed and admitted in some form in [Coverj\u2019s motions that he\u2019s filed with the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">G. March 2012 BIA Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">Cover appealed to the BIA. In March 2012, the BIA remanded Cover\u2019s case to the IJ for further proceedings. The BIA noted that the IJ did not issue a separate oral or written decision setting forth his rationale for ordering Cover removed and therefore ordered the record returned to the IJ for preparation of a full decision. The BIA directed the IJ to determine \u201canew\u201d whether Cover was removable as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">H. May 2012 Release from Prison and Request to Subpoena Witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">In May 2012, Cover finished his criminal sentence and was released to the custody of immigration officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">In the immigration court, Cover filed a \u201crequest to Subpoena Witnesses,\u201d including the Assistant U.S. Attorney (\u201cAUSA\u201d) involved in Cover\u2019s criminal case and Cover\u2019s former defense attorneys. Cover\u2019s request alleged that these witnesses could attest to: (1) his cooperation with the government; and (2) the government\u2019s promise that he would not be removed if he pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">The IJ denied the subpoena request because Cover had not established that the evidenee was essential to the instant proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-15\">I. August 2012 Government Exhibits</p>\n<p id=\"b803-16\">Subsequently, in immigration court, the government filed several exhibits establishing that Cover was removable. As to Cover\u2019s alienage, the exhibits included copies of: (1) the 2005 decision on Cover\u2019s Application for Naturalization, showing that the application was administratively denied due to poor moral character; (2) Cover\u2019s Jamaican passport, stating that he was born in Kingston, Jamaica; (3) a 1999 INS Memorandum of Creation of Record of Lawful Permanent Residence, listing Cover\u2019s country of birth as Jamaica; (4) a 1999 Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status on which Cover listed his country of birth as Jamaica; and (5) Cover\u2019s Birth Registration Form, showing he was born in Kingston, Jamaica. Only the last document \u2014 the Birth Registration Form \u2014 was a certified copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-17\">As to Cover\u2019s criminal conviction, the government submitted a certified judgment of Cover\u2019s drug conspiracy conviction that was identical to the certified judgment it filed prior to the BIA\u2019s March 2012 remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-18\">J. September 6, 2012 Removal Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b803-19\">At a removal hearing on September 6, 2012, Cover refused to answer any allegations in the NTA and expressly invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Cover did argue that he only pled guilty in exchange for not being removed and that his conviction was obtained in violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-20\">Cover also orally moved to withdraw his October 5, 2011 motion to terminate removal proceedings, and the IJ granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>motion. \u25a0 Cover also expressly waived his right to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Cover objected to the government\u2019s August 2012 exhibits as evidence and argued that the documents were unauthenticated. The IJ admitted the evidence, noted Cover\u2019s objections, and stated that it would \u201cgive them the weight that it deems appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">K. September 20, 2012 IJ Decision and Order of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">In his September 20, 2012 oral decision, the IJ found that the government\u2019s August 2012 exhibits, which the IJ found to be reliable, established Cover\u2019s removability. The IJ noted that Cover did not provide any testimony or documentation to contradict the evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">During the 2012 hearing, the IJ also determined that, (1) even if the government orally promised not to remove Cover, he had ample time to collaterally attack his 2007 drug conviction and (2) thus any alleged promise by the government did not bar the removal proceedings. The IJ ordered Cover removed to Jamaica.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">L. October 2012 to March 2013 BIA Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">In October 2012, Cover appealed the removal order to the BIA. Cover argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the government\u2019s exhibits about his alienage and criminal conviction were unauthenticated, inadmissible, and insufficient to show removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">In March 2013, the BIA affirmed. The BIA determined that Cover made several explicit references, in testimony and in written submissions to the court, that he had been convicted of the felony described in the NTA. Any alleged error in considering the criminal judgment was harmless. With respect to alienage, the BIA found no clear error in the IJ\u2019s findings of fact and that DHS established Cover\u2019s alienage based on the totality of the record. The BIA also determined that Cover\u2019s constitutional challenges lacked merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-13\">Cover timely filed this petition for review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-14\">II. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b804-15\">We lack jurisdiction to review a final removal order against an alien who is removable under INA \u00a7 287(a)(2)(A)(iii) due to a prior conviction for an aggravated felony, which includes a drug trafficking crime. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Similarly, we lack jurisdiction to review a final removal order against an alien who is removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)(i), due to a conviction for a controlled substance offense. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-17\">However, we retain jurisdiction to review whether the statutory conditions limiting review exist. <em>Sebastian-Soler v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>409 F.3d 1280, 1283 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, we have jurisdiction to review whether Cover (1) is an alien (2) who is removable by reason of having committed a crime covered by the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>id.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">We also have jurisdiction over constitutional claims: INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D) vests this Court with jurisdiction to review all appeals that present \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Alvarez Acosta v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>524 F.3d 1191, 1195-96 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">III. REMOVABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The government \u201chas the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence\u201d that the individual in removal proceedings is (1) an alien and (2) deportable. INA \u00a7 240(c)(3)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(A).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">Evidence of foreign birth gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of alienage, and the burden shifts to the individual in removal proceedings to prove citizenship. <em>Matter of Rodriguez-Tejedor, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 153, 164 (BIA 2001). An alien who, after admission, is convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana is deporta-ble.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), (a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (a)(2)(B)\u00ae; INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">The BIA has determined that, although some form of authentication is required of domestic or foreign records presented in immigration proceedings, \u201cany authentication procedure that comports with common law rules of evidence constitutes an acceptable level of proof.\u201d <em>Matter of Velasquez, </em>25 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 680, 684 (BIA 2012) (alteration and quotation marks omitted); <em>see Matter of D-R-, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 445, 458 (BIA 2011). \u201cThe guiding principle is that proper authentication requires some sort of proof that the document is what it purports to be.\u201d <em>Matter of Velasquez, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 684 (quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">Here, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that the government established that Cover was removable. As to alienage, the certified copy of Cover\u2019s Birth Registration Form showed that he was born in Kingston, Jamaica. The IJ found that the copy of Cover\u2019s Birth Registration Form was reliable, and the document was certified as a true copy of the original. This was sufficient to authenticate the document. <em>See id. </em>Because the government presented evidence of Cover\u2019s foreign birth, a rebuttable presumption of alienage arose. <em>See Matter of Rodriguez-Tejedor, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 164. Cover did not submit any evidence to rebut this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>As to his conviction for a deportable offense, a certified copy of the judgment entered in Cover\u2019s criminal case showed that he was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1287.6(a); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(3)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(B)(i) (stating that a certified official record of judgment and conviction \u201cshall constitute proof of a criminal conviction\u201d). Further, Cover admitted his guilty plea multiple times.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We cannot say that the record compels reversal of the BIA\u2019s determination that the government\u2019s evidence established Cover\u2019s removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">V. DUE PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">\u201cTo establish due process violations in removal proceedings, aliens must show that they were deprived of liberty without due process of law, and that the asserted errors caused them substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>See Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341-42 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">A. Evidence Produced Following March 2012 BIA Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">Cover argues that his due process rights were violated by the IJ holding a second hearing after the BIA\u2019s March 2012 remand. He contends that the IJ should have determined his removability based solely on the evidence presented prior to the IJ\u2019s first order of removal in October 2009.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">Under the circumstances of this case, the IJ was not barred from considering the government\u2019s evidence filed following the BIA\u2019s March 2012 remand.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Cover had admitted removability in his October 5, 2011 motion and his own attachments, and thus, during the October 27, 2011 hearing, the government had no need to present evidence establishing Cover\u2019s re-movability.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>After the BIA\u2019s March 2012 remand of Cover\u2019s case, Cover moved to withdraw his October 5, 2011 motion (admitting his al-ienage and conviction for a deportable offense). After that motion was granted, it was only then that the government had to introduce evidence to show Cover\u2019s remov-ability. At that point, the IJ held a hearing on the sufficiency of the government\u2019s evidence, and the IJ found Cover removable. Therefore, Cover\u2019s due process rights were not violated by the IJ\u2019s consideration of the government\u2019s evidence presented after the BIA\u2019s March 2012 remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">B. Request for Subpoenas</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Cover also argues that the IJ violated his due process rights by not issuing a subpoena to the AUSA involved in his criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">In an immigration proceeding, the IJ has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to issue subpoenas,\u201d and the IJ shall issue the subpoena \u201c[u]pon being satisfied that a witness will not appear and testify or produce documentary evidence and that the witness\u2019 evidence is essential.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.35(b)(1), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Cover argues that the AUSA\u2019s testimony was essential because it would have shown that the AUSA told him that he would not be removed if he pled guilty and that, because of that oral promise, he cannot be ordered removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Here, there is no indication, much less evidence, that the Attorney General delegated to the AUSA involved in Cover\u2019s criminal case the power to make promises regarding removability during the plea negotiations in Cover\u2019s case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See San Pedro v. United States, </em>79 F.3d 1065, 1071-72 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that (1) the Attorney General has the power to promise a criminal defendant during plea negotiations that he will not be deported, (2) U.S. Attorneys and AUSAs have the power to promise a criminal defendant non-deportation <em>only </em>where the Attorney General has delegated that power, and (3) the Attorney General had not delegated that power to U.S. Attorneys or AUSAs by way of the United States Attorney\u2019s Manual). Notably too, there is no such promise in Cover\u2019s written plea agreement, which states that it constitutes \u201cthe entire agreement\u201d between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">Therefore, Cover did not show that the AUSA\u2019s testimony would have been essential to the removal proceedings. Thus, it was not error for the IJs\u2019 to refuse to subpoena his witnesses, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.35(b), and his due process rights were not violated.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">YI. FIFTH AMENDMENT PRIVILEGE</p>\n<p id=\"b807-14\">Cover argues that the BIA erred in relying on his statements to the IJ after he invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege, admitting that he pled guilty in 2007 to a criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-15\">The privilege afforded by the Fifth Amendment protects one from \u201cbeing involuntarily called as a witness against himself in a criminal prosecution but also privileges him not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>criminal, formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Garcia, </em>565 F.3d 1306, 1316 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Here, it is unclear to what extent, if any, the BIA relied on Cover\u2019s statements, made after he invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, in affirming the IJ\u2019s removal order. In any event, Cover has not shown how his admission of his alienage or of his 2007 conviction would have exposed him of criminal liability, and thus, he was has not shown that he was entitled to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, there was substantial evidence to support a finding of removability, even without considering statements Cover made in his removal proceedings after invoking the Fifth Amendment, such that any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny Cover\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-11\">. In 2008, Cover did file a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, but the sentencing court denied him relief. In 2013, Cover\u2019s habeas corpus petition was dismissed. Cover did not appeal either ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b803-13\">. Cover later renewed his request to subpoena witnesses, which the IJ denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b804-11\">.

We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1026-27. \u201cUnder the substantial evidence test, we view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\" <em>Id. </em>at 1027.

Cover\u2019s argument \u2014 that the conviction record submitted by the government was not properly authenticated because it did not feature the seal of the court and was not attested to by the district court judge \u2014 fails. His stance relies on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738, which is applicable only to judgments from courts of a \"State, Territory, or Possession\u201d of the United States, whereas the conviction at issue was in a federal district court. Similarly, his argument that additional certification was required because the document was submitted by electronic means is without merit, because the document was certified by a court official as an official record from its repository, as required by the relevant statutory provision. INA \u00a7 240(c)(3)(C), <em>8 U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\">. Cover also argues that his conviction may not be used as the basis for his removability because it was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights. Cover may not collaterally attack his underlying conviction in an immigration proceeding. <em>See Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1251 (11th Cir.2001) (stating that the petitioner\u2019s purported due process claim \u2014 that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea-\u2014 should be challenged in a collateral attack on his conviction and is not reviewable in a removal proceeding).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b806-14\">. To the extent Cover argues that principles of collateral estoppel barred further proceedings on removability, we reject his argument. Collateral estoppel only applies \"when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Valdiviez-Garza, </em>669 F.3d 1199, 1201 (11th Cir.2012) (quotation marks omitted). The BIA's March 2012 remand order was not a final order, and in any event, the BIA did not decide the issue of whether the government established that Cover was removable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b806-15\">. We acknowledge that, generally, following a remand from the BIA, an IJ \"has authority to consider additional evidence if it is material, was not previously available, and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d <em>In re M-D-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 138, 141 (BIA 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b807-9\">. Cover also argues, as he did below, that the BIA erred by not determining that the government was estopped from removing him because of the prosecutor\u2019s alleged promise. However, that argument also hinges on the prosecutor\u2019s ability to bind DHS with a promise, and therefore, fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b807-16\">. Cover also sought to have his former attorneys testify that they told him that he would not be removed if he pled guilty. This evidence was relevant to Cover\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. As discussed above in footnotes, a petitioner cannot collaterally attack his conviction in immigration proceedings. Thus, Cover has not shown that this evidence was essential.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
