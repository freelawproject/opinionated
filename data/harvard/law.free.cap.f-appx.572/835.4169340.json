After a jury trial, she was found guilty on all three counts. She was sentenced to 331-months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-14\">Hoehn raises two challenges on appeal. First, she argues that the district court erred in denying her motion for judgment of acquittal regarding Count 3 because she did not actually possess the shotgun and the evidence was insufficient to show that she constructively possessed it. Second, she argues that the district court erred in using the drug quantity estimate in her Presentence Investigation Report (PSR).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">At trial Hoehn moved for judgment of acquittal on Count 3, arguing there was insufficient evidence to show that she constructively possessed the shotgun. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal based on sufficiency of the evidence. <em>United States v. Capers, </em>708 F.3d 1286, 1296 (11th Cir.2013). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and interpret all inferences and credibility choices by the jury in a manner that supports the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>390 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2004). We affirm a conviction so long as a reasonable juror could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">To convict a person of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, the government must prove (1) possession and (2) a connection to a drug trafficking crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Possession includes constructive possession, meaning the person had both the \u201cpower or right\u201d and \u201cdominion and control\u201d over the gun. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>661 F.3d 568, 576 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam). Possession may be sole or joint. <em>Id. </em>at 578 n. 12; <em>see also United States v. Garcia, </em>655 F.2d 59, 62 (5th Cir. Unit B Sept.1981)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u201cConstructive possession can be joint, as when more than one person occupy a room containing the item.\u201d). The government can prove constructive possession through evidence showing the defendant\u2019s ownership, dominion, or control over the firearm itself or the place where the firearm was located. <em>United States v. Cochran, </em>683 F.3d 1314, 1320 (11th Cir.2012). \u201cWe have found control of premises to be enough to uphold a conviction on a sufficiency of the evidence challenge.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">Hoehn was arrested at a hotel after the police received a tip that individuals were manufacturing methamphetamine in room 309 and were armed with a shotgun and pistol. Three or four officers entered the room with guns drawn and saw Hoehn crouched down between the bed and the bar. One police officer testified that a shotgun was within \u201ceasy reach\u201d and \u201csomebody could snatch that gun and shoulder or hip it just in a blink of an eye. It wouldn\u2019t take but one move to pick that weapon up and have it at the ready.\u201d An agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives testified that the fact that there were two firearms in the room was relevant because it was evidence that the methamphetamine lab in the room was a two-person operation. He also described the placement of the shotgun as \u201cgrab and go.\u201d A different police officer testified that the shotgun looked like it was \u201cready to be grabbed at a moment\u2019s notice to be used.\u201d The shotgun was loaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Given this record, a jury could have reasonably inferred that Hoehn constructively possessed the shotgun. She exercised dominion or control over the room in various ways. For example, she requested to be moved to the room where she was arrested from a different room in the hotel. She also personally requested various items for the room from the front desk. Further, a juror could reasonably infer her dominion over the room from evidence that she established it as her temporary residence, including the presence of an overnight bag with personal items including a notebook labeled \u201cSara\u2019s\u201d that tested positive for Hoehn\u2019s fingerprints. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Hoehn\u2019s proximity to the loaded shotgun provided additional evidence of constructive possession. Therefore, we affirm in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Because Hoehn argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred in using the drug quantity of 734.2 grams of methamphetamine from her PSR, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>595 F.3d 1324, 1326 (11th Cir.2010). Under plain-error review, we will only reverse if Hoehn shows (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that error affects her substantial rights. <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 831 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). \u201cA substantial right is affected if the appealing party can show that there is a reasonable probability that there would have been a different result had there been no error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 831-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">A \u201creasonable probability\u201d with respect to the third prong of the plain-error test is one that is \u201csufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\u201d in light of the record as whole. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299, 1304-05 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted). If the effect of an error is \u201cuncertain or indeterminate\u201d then Hoehn has not met her burden with respect to this prong. <em>Id. </em>at 1301. She \u201cmust prove more than that the record is consistent with [her] argument; [she] must show that the error actually did make a difference.\u201d <em>United States v. Davila, </em>749 F.3d 982, 997 (11th Cir.2014) (per curiam) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">For cases involving a mixture or substance containing a controlled substance, the guideline commentary instructs courts to deduct any unusable portions of the mixture to calculate the weight of the mixture or substance attributable to the defendant for sentencing purposes. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG) \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.l); <em>see also United States v. Jackson, </em>115 F.3d 843, 847 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201c[T]he entire weight of drug mixtures which are <em>usable </em>in the chain of distribution should be considered in determining a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d (emphasis added)). Section 2Dl.l(c)(4) of the Guidelines provides a base offense level of 32 where a defendant manufactures at least 500 grams but less than 1.5 kilograms of methamphetamine. USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4). Section 2Dl.l(c)(5) provides a base offense level of 30 for at least 350 grams but less than 500 kilograms of methamphetamine. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(5). A total offense level of 35 and a criminal history category of II yields a guideline range of 188-235-months imprisonment, whereas a total offense level of 33 with the same criminal history category yields a 151-188-month range. <em>See </em>USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A (Nov.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">A police investigator testified that the methamphetamine-making ingredients in Hoehn\u2019s hotel room would have converted into over one thousand grams of methamphetamine. The police sent 468.2 grams of seized liquids from six different sources to a crime lab, and all six tested positive for methamphetamine. But not all of the liquid in the room was tested, and not all of the liquid was necessarily pure methamphetamine. As noted, the PSR used the figure of 734.2 grams, but included no detail about how that precise amount was calculated. Neither the district court nor the parties discussed the weight of the methamphetamine assigned to Hoehn at her sentence hearing. The district court adopted the facts and sentencing calculations in the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">Here, even if the district court committed plain error by failing to subtract the unusable portion of the seized methamphetamine mixtures in calculating the drug weight for which Hoehn was responsible, it still would not warrant reversal. Hoehn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>has failed to show by a reasonable probability that the error affected her total sentence. There is no evidence that any deduction would have resulted in a net usable mixture of less than 500 grams, the amount necessary to lower the guideline range used by the court. The testimony at trial merely suggested that some of the supposed 734.2 grams might not be usable product. Without evidence as to how much of that amount would have been subtracted as unusable under the guidelines, we can at most speculate as to the effect of any erroneous calculation. But that is not enough. Because the effect of any error on the outcome is \u201cuncertain or indeterminate,\u201d Hoehn has failed to show that her sentence would have been different but for the error. <em>Davila, </em>749 F.3d at 997. Thus, her challenge fails under the third prong of plain-error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-7\">. Hoehn does not challenge her convictions on Counts 1 and 2, and thus any claims in this respect are abandoned. <em>United States v. Levy, </em>416 F.3d 1273, 1275-76 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b859-7\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981. <em>Id. </em>at 1209.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
