He asserts that his prior conviction for fleeing and eluding a law enforcement officer, in violation of Florida Statute \u00a7 316.1935(2), is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.2(a). He contends that because that prior conviction is not a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) the district court erred in treating him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-24\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Cortes-Salazar, </em>682 F.3d 953, 954 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-25\">Our recent decision in <em>United States v. Smith </em>forecloses Davis\u2019 appeal. <em>See </em>742 F.3d 949 (11th Cir.2014). In <em>Smith </em>we concluded that fleeing and eluding a law enforcement officer under Florida Statute \u00a7 316.1935(2) is categorically a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>Id. </em>at 952-53; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). We have \u201crepeatedly read the definition of a \u2018violent felony\u2019 under \u00a7 924(e) of the Armed Career Criminal Act as \u2018virtually identical\u2019 to the definition of a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2.\u201d <em>United States v. Arch</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number><em>er, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008); <em>compare </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (\u201cviolent felony\u201d means any crime punishable by a year of imprisonment, that involves \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d) <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2) (a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d includes a crime punishable by a year of imprisonment that includes \u201cburglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d). Having already concluded that fleeing and eluding a law enforcement under Florida Statute \u00a7 316.1935(2) is categorically a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA, we also conclude that it is categorically a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the virtually identical definition found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a). The district court correctly found that Davis is a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
