In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Rivera argued, inter alia, that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to the admission of evidence of his prior conviction for conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base. We granted a certificate of appealability on the following question: \u201cDid the District Court err in denying Mr. Rivera\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the admission of his prior conviction?\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we answer this question in the negative and affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Rivera\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), evidence of a prior conviction \u201cis not admissible to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)(1). However, the evidence may be admissible if it is relevant to other material issues such as intent. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)(2). Under our three-part test for the admissibility of extrinsic evidence under Rule 404(b), evidence of Rivera\u2019s prior conviction was admissible. <em>See United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1330 (11th Cir.1997) (asking whether the evidence under review (1) is \u201crelevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character,\u201d (2) is \u201csufficient to support a finding that the defendant actually committed the extrinsic act,\u201d and (3) has \u201cprobative value [that is not] substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). First, Rivera\u2019s prior drug trafficking conviction is highly probative of his intent to distribute the drugs involved in the instant case, <em>see, e.g., id. </em>at 1331; <em>United States v. Cardenas, </em>895 F.2d 1338, 1343-44 (11th Cir.1990), and Rivera\u2019s intent was at issue in his trial, <em>see Cardenas, </em>895 F.2d. at 1342. Second, Rivera\u2019s conviction is clearly sufficient to support a finding that he actually committed the prior act. <em>See Calderon, </em>127 F.3d at 1332. Third, whatever prejudice evidence of Rivera\u2019s prior conviction might have caused was ameliorated by the district court\u2019s limiting instruction such that under the circumstances the possibility of prejudice did not substantially outweigh the evidence\u2019s probative value. <em>See id. </em>at 1333; <em>Cardenas, </em>895 F.2d at 1345. Thus, evidence of Rivera\u2019s prior conviction was admissible under Rule 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">In light of this conclusion, Rivera\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim based on his coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>sel\u2019s failure to object to the admission of evidence concerning his prior conviction fails, because the failure to object to this admissible evidence did not \u201cf[a]ll below an objective standard of reasonableness in light of prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Cummings v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of </em>Corr., 588 F.3d 1331, 1356 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, given the likelihood the district court would have admitted the evidence of Rivera\u2019s prior conviction over any objection his counsel might have made, Rivera cannot establish any prejudice arising from counsel\u2019s failure to object. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (\u201cThe defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d). That two of Rivera\u2019s codefendants testified that he participated in a scheme to distribute the heroin at issue further diminishes the possibility the jury in his trial would have reached a different result had Rivera\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of the evidence in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Accordingly, as to the certified question on appeal, Rivera has failed to carry his burden to establish ineffective assistance under <em>Strickland, </em>and the district court did not err in denying his petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-10\">.
