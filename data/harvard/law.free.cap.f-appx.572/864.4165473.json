Stat. \u00a7 760.10. Barsorian contends that the district court erred in concluding that no reasonable juror could find that Grossman Roth\u2019s proffered reason for his demotion and termination was pretextual or that Barsorian\u2019s age was the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of his demotion and termination. He also argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-20\">Barsorian was hired by the law firm of Grossman Roth in 2003 to serve as the director of its IT department. He was then fifty-eight years old. During the eight years that Barsorian served in this capacity, he never received any negative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>performance evaluations. However, the firm contends that its IT network had numerous shortcomings while Barsorian was its head. According to the firm, the system was \u201cconstantly locking up,\u201d which caused employees to lose work, remote access to it was unreliable, and the firm\u2019s technology was generally outdated. The firm also claims that Barsorian was absent from the office during work hours a lot, particularly on Fridays. It maintains that he was verbally reprimanded for being absent on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">The first indication that Barsorian\u2019s job security might be threatened came in April 2011. According to him, a new partner in the law firm, David Buckner, came into Barsorian\u2019s office around that time and said, \u201cWe are going to refresh the IT department.\u201d Barsorian admitted in his deposition that he could not be sure whether Buckner\u2019s comment referred to replacing the personnel in the IT department or updating the technology itself. But he relies on that statement to show that the firm discriminated against him because of his age \u2014 that its plan was to terminate him and bring in someone younger.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Despite Barsorian\u2019s interpretation of that statement as indicating an intent to discriminate, there is evidence that Gross-man Roth was becoming increasingly dissatisfied with its information systems. In May 2011 the firm retained DataCorp, an independent IT consulting firm, to conduct an assessment of its systems. DataCorp conducted a \u201chealth check assessment\u201d of Grossman Roth\u2019s IT infrastructure and prepared a report detailing its findings and recommendations. The report, dated May 2, 2011, stated that the IT department was functional but \u201cnot adequate to keep pace with [the firm\u2019s] business continuity and systems high-availability mandates.\u201d It identified specific \u201cpoints of failure\u201d that needed to be addressed in order to \u201cimprove productivity, mitigate the risks of system downtime, and offer the [firm\u2019s] user community a more robust, secure, and scalable operating environment.\u201d The firm\u2019s managing partner, Neal Roth, stated under oath that he \u201clost confidence\u201d in Barsorian after reading the report and made the decision to terminate him. Mr. Roth testified in a deposition that he alone made the decision to do so, and that he was not aware of Barsorian\u2019s age at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Barsorian was demoted from the position of IT director to the position of assistant IT director on May 13, 2011. According to Grossman Roth, it decided to hire a new IT director to address the problems created by Barsorian\u2019s \u201cmisfeasance and neglect.\u201d Hugo Perez of DataCorp recommended Javier Lozada for the job. Loza-da was thirty-nine years old, but Perez maintained in his deposition that the ages of Lozada and Barsorian were never mentioned. Grossman Roth hired Lozada, and Barsorian stayed on to train him for nine months until Barsorian was fired in February 2012. He was sixty-six years old at the time of both his demotion and termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Barsorian mounted two legal challenges to his termination. First, he filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that his firing violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Barsorian alleged that the law firm fired him because he had a medical disability that is expensive to treat and caused the insurance premium to increase. The merits of that claim are not at issue in this appeal. Second, Barsorian filed this lawsuit in state court, asserting that his discharge violated the ADEA and FCRA. Grossman Roth removed the case to federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>After removing the case, Grossman Roth moved to dismiss Barsorian\u2019s complaint on the basis that his ADA claim with the EEOC demonstrated that he was not discharged because of his age. The district court denied the motion to dismiss, finding that Barsorian was entitled to plead alternative theories of relief, and Grossman Roth filed its answer and affirmative defenses. The firm later filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Barsori-an could not establish a prima facie case of age discrimination because his age was not the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of his discharge and because Barsorian could not show that the firm\u2019s proferred legitimate reasons for firing him were pretextual. In support of its argument that Barsorian\u2019s age was not the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of his termination, Gross-man Roth pointed to the fact that Barsori-an had also filed an ADA claim with the EEOC. Thus, in Grossman Roth\u2019s view, Barsorian\u2019s ADA claim constituted an \u201cadmission\u201d that \u201chis age was not the \u2018but for reason\u2019 for his discharge.\u201d The firm attached a copy of Barsorian\u2019s charge of discrimination in the ADA case to its motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The district court granted the motion. It held that Barsorian had established a prima facie case of age discrimination but that he had failed to show that Grossman Roth\u2019s proffered reason for firing him\u2014 that he had inadequately performed his job \u2014 was pretextual. In the penultimate paragraph of its seventeen-page order, the district court mentioned Barsorian\u2019s ADA charge of discrimination. It noted that that claim, \u201ccoupled with [his] failure to produce <em>any </em>circumstantial evidence that the reason given for his discharge was a pretext,\u201d indicated that \u201cnot even [Barsori-an] believed that he was discharged because of his age.\u201d The court thus concluded that, even if Barsorian had been able to establish pretext, he could not show that his age was a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">The district court entered final judgment on its order and Barsorian\u2019s counsel withdrew. Barsorian then filed a pro se motion with the district court in which he raised two grounds for relief. He first challenged the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and then sought relief from the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(3)(6). His jurisdictional argument was premised on the fact that the district court had considered his ADA claim. Barsorian argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider that claim when ruling upon Grossman Roth\u2019s motion for summary judgment because jurisdiction remained with the EEOC in that case. His argument that he was entitled to relief from the judgment under Rule 60(b)(3)(6) was based on his assertion that Grossman Roth had made fraudulent misrepresentations of fact, cited irrelevant case law in order to confuse him, and \u201cretaliated\u201d against him for filing the ADA claim by \u201cillegally and unfairly requiring him] to \u2018testify\u2019 in his deposition\u201d about it. While this motion was pending, Barsorian on September 12, 2013, filed a notice of appeal of the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Grossman Roth.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">The district court denied Barsorian\u2019s motion, which it construed as a motion for reconsideration. After that denial, Barso-rian on October 25, 2013 filed an amended notice of appeal designating for appeal the summary judgment order and the order denying his Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 60(b)(3)(6) motion. Grossman Roth, for its part, had filed a motion to tax costs, which the court granted in part in February 2014. Barsorian did not file a new notice of appeal. He did, however, file in this Court a self-styled motion to stay, reverse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>and vacate the district court\u2019s order granting in part the motion to tax costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor. <em>Ellis v. England, </em>432 F.3d 1321, 1325 (11th Cir.2005). Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See id.; see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Grossman Roth because it found that Barsorian had failed to show that the firm\u2019s proffered, nondiscriminatory reason was pretextual. The district court also found, in the alternative, that summary judgment was appropriate because Barsorian had failed to establish that his age was the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of his termination. Although the district court articulated two reasons for its grant of summary judgment, we address only the first one because it by itself compels affir-mance.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">The ADEA prohibits an employer from firing an employee who is 40 years old or older \u201cbecause of\u2019 the employee\u2019s age. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 623(a)(1), 631(a). The FCRA contains a provision to the same effect. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.10(l)(a). As a result, \u201c[a]ge discrimination claims brought under the Florida Civil Rights Act have been considered within the same framework used to decide actions brought pursuant to the ADEA.\u201d <em>Zaben v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., </em>129 F.3d 1453, 1455 n. 2 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see Morrow v. Duval Cnty. Sch. Bd., </em>514 So.2d 1086, 1087 (Fla.1987). Because of the statutes\u2019 similarity, our analysis of Barsorian\u2019s claims under both statutes is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">In the district court Barsorian sought to establish age discrimination indirectly through circumstantial evidence. <em>Compare Van Voorhis v. Hillsborough Cnty. Bd. of Cnty. Commissioners, </em>512 F.3d 1296, 1300 (11th Cir.2008) (defining direct evidence as \u201c[ojnly the most blatant remarks, whose intent could be nothing other than to discriminate on the basis of age\u201d) (quotation omitted) <em>with Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., </em>161 F.3d 1318, 1330 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201c[Rjemarks by nondecisionmak-ers or remarks unrelated to the decision-making process itself are not direct evidence of discrimination.\u201d). The district court properly analyzed his claim through the framework set forth by <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and found that Barsorian had established a prima facie case of age discrimination. <em>Kragor v. Takeda Pharmas. Am., Inc., </em>702 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2012). Barsori-an\u2019s initial burden was satisfied upon a showing that he was a member of the protected class (people over the age of forty) who was fired from a job he was qualified for and replaced by a person outside of the protected class. <em>See id. </em>at 1309. Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, once he established his prima facie case, the burden shifted to the employer to rebut the presumption of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 1308. Grossman Roth satisfied that burden by producing evidence that it fired Barsorian after Data-Corp, the third-party technology consultant, found that various elements of the firm\u2019s IT system were outdated and needed to be upgraded, which caused the firm\u2019s managing partner to \u201clos[e] confidence\u201d in Barsorian.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">After Grossman Roth rebutted the presumption of discrimination by offering that legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Barsorian\u2019s termination, the burden shift<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>ed back to Barsorian. <em>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 2106, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). He then had to come forward and \u201cshow that [Grossman Roth\u2019s] stated reason [was] a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Kragor, </em>702 F.3d at 1308. In order to show pretext, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the employer\u2019s proffered reason is not the true reason for the adverse employment decision. <em>Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n of Jefferson Cnty., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1162-62 (11th Cir.2006). A plaintiff can show that the proffered reason is not believable by pointing to \u201cweaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions\u201d in the proffered explanation, but a reason is not pretextual unless it is shown both that the reason was false and that age discrimination was the real reason. Id. at 1163 (quotation omitted). Nor can a plaintiff show pretext by \u201cquarreling with the wisdom of that reason\u201d or substituting his business judgment for that of the employer\u2019s. <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). Even a showing that the employer fired the employee on the basis of an incorrect assessment is insufficient, for if the employer honestly but mistakenly believed it had accurate information, then its decision to terminate the employee was not discriminatory. <em>Elrod v. Sears. Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>939 F.2d 1466, 1470 (11th Cir.1991). What is required instead is that the plaintiff meet the employer\u2019s proffered reason \u201chead on and rebut it.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1030. In this sense, the district court\u2019s inquiry is limited to \u201cwhether the employer gave an honest explanation of its behavior.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">There is no dispute in this case that Grossman Roth hired an outside analyst to evaluate its IT system, received negative feedback about that system, and demoted and fired Barsorian, the man in charge of the IT system, afterward. That is the basic core of evidence supporting Gross-man Roth\u2019s assertion that it fired Barsori-an because it believed his performance was deficient. It is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. <em>See Clark v. Coats &amp; Clark, Inc., </em>990 F.2d 1217, 1228 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201cAn employer\u2019s good faith belief that an employee\u2019s performance is unsatisfactory constitutes a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for termination.\u201d). And none of the grounds that Barsorian cites meets that reason \u201chead on and re-butts] it.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Barsorian raises three arguments on appeal. First, he argues that Buckner\u2019s allegedly ageist statement about refreshing the IT department, combined with Mr. Roth\u2019s supposed statement that firing Bar-sorian was \u201cnot my call\u201d supports an inference that Mr. Roth was influenced by Buckner\u2019s discriminatory desire to fire Barsorian.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, he asserts that a comparison of resumes establishes that he is more qualified than his replacement, Jorge Lozada. According to him, that fact suggests that the firm\u2019s proffered reason was not its real reason. And third, he contends that the DataCorp report upon which Grossman Roth relied was inaccurate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>Two of those arguments \u2014 the second and third \u2014 are waived, as our review is limited to issues raised before the district court. <em>See Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 120, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 2877, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976); <em>Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal Servs., Inc. v. La Quinta Motor Inns, Inc., </em>689 F.2d 982, 990 (11th Cir.1982). This rule applies even to <em>pro se </em>litigants, <em>see Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998), and its application here is especially appropriate in light of the fact that Barsorian had the assistance of counsel in the district court. Even assuming those arguments are not waived, they demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the issue. We do not ask whether an employer\u2019s decision to fire an employee was the right decision. An \u201cemployer may fire an employee for a good reason, a bad reason, a reason based on erroneous facts, or for no reason at all, as long as its action is not for a discriminatory reason.\u201d <em>Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahall Comms., </em>738 F.2d 1181, 1187 (11th Cir.1984). Thus, we are not concerned with whether the report of DataCorp, which is not a party, was accurate or if Barsorian\u2019s qualifications are in reality superior to Lozada\u2019s. The proffered reason for his termination was not his lack of qualifications, but the belief that the IT department was not functioning as well as it should. \u201c[0]ur sole concern is whether unlawful discriminatory animus motivate[d]\u201d the decision. <em>Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., </em>196 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir.1999). There is no evidence that an unlawful animus was at work here.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Barsorian\u2019s only remaining argument concerns Buckner\u2019s remark about refreshing the IT department and Mr. Roth\u2019s alleged statement that firing Barso-rian was not his call. This argument is flawed. First, as Barsorian conceded, he has no evidence that Buckner\u2019s statement about the need to \u201crefresh the IT department\u201d referred to the IT department\u2019s lone employee, Barsorian, or an update to the technology itself. In light of the technological problems that Grossman Roth was having, Buckner\u2019s statement could have referred to the technology and not to Barsorian. Second, even if Buckner\u2019s statement meant that the IT department\u2019s personnel needed to be refreshed, his use of the word refresh does not in itself suggest an age-based animus. <em>See Ransom v. CSC Consulting, Inc., </em>217 F.3d 467, 469-70 (7th Cir.2000) (concluding that the statement \u201crefresh the officer pool\u201d did not suggest a preference for younger employees but instead referred to corporate behavior).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Third, Barsorian has presented no evidence that Buckner was the one who made the decision to fire him or influenced it. To the contrary, Mr. Roth testified that Buckner had no influence on the decision to fire Barsorian, and even Barsorian admitted that Mr. Roth, as managing partner, had final decisionmaking power over him. Thus, even if Buckner\u2019s comment related to Barsorian\u2019s age, it would not be enough to create a genuine issue of fact precluding summary judgment. <em>See Alvarez v. Royal Atlantic Developers, </em>610 F.3d 1253, 1267-68 (11th Cir.2010) (holding that a single stray remark from a non-decision-maker that \u201cCubans are dumb\u201d was not enough to raise a genuine fact issue); <em>Standard, </em>161 F.3d at 1329-30 (statement that \u201colder people have more go wrong\u201d did not raise a genuine issue of fact because the statement was too vague and because it was uttered by someone who was not involved in the decision to terminate the plaintiff); <em>Mauter v. Hardy Corp., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>825 F.2d 1554, 1558 (11th Cir.1987) (vice president\u2019s statement that the corporation was \u201cgoing to weed out the old ones\u201d did not preclude summary judgment where the vice president played no part in the decision to fire the plaintiff). Because there is no evidence that Buckner influenced the decision to fire Barsorian, Buckner\u2019s statement does not create a genuine issue of fact requiring trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">We turn now to the district court\u2019s denial of Barsorian\u2019s motion for reconsideration. After the district court granted Grossman Roth\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Barsorian filed a <em>pro se </em>motion seeking relief under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 60(b)(3)(6). The district court construed that motion as one for reconsideration and denied it. We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Sanderlin v. Seminole Tribe, </em>243 F.3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Barsorian\u2019s motion for reconsideration revolved around the fact that the district court had taken notice of his ADA claim that was pending in the EEOC. The district court mentioned that claim in connection with its finding that Barsorian had not established that his age was the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of his termination, suggesting that even Barsorian thought that there was some reason other than his age for his termination. Because we did not affirm on that ground, and our review of the grant of summary judgment is <em>de novo, </em>we need not consider whether it was proper for the district court to take notice of a collateral, administrative action in that way. It does not affect our decision that Barsorian failed to show pretext. Nor does the fact that the district court mentioned the ADA claim affect that court\u2019s jurisdiction over this action, as Barsorian contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">To the extent that Barsorian alleges that Grossman Roth committed fraud, made misrepresentations, or retaliated against him in the course of this litigation, there is no evidence of it and the argument is frivolous. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Barsorian\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Finally, Barsorian filed in this Court a motion \u201cto stay, reverse, and vacate the district court\u2019s order granting in part Grossman Roth\u2019s motion to tax costs.\u201d The district court entered that order on February 3, 2014. But Barsorian filed his amended notice of appeal before then, in October 2013. This timing is problematic because the party taking the appeal must \u201cdesignate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed,\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B), and a failure to do so will ordinarily \u201cpreclude the appellate court from reviewing any judgment or order not so specified.\u201d <em>McDougald v. Jenson, </em>786 F.2d 1465, 1474 (11th Cir.1986). Because Barsorian filed his notice of appeal before the district court even entered the order granting Grossman Roth\u2019s motion to tax costs, he could not have designated that order in his notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">We considered a factual scenario very similar to this one in <em>LaChance v. Duffy's Draft House, </em>146 F.3d 832 (11th Cir.1998). In that case, LaChance brought a claim against his former employer alleging that it fired him in violation of the ADA. <em>Id. </em>at 833. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the employer, and LaChance filed a notice of appeal. <em>Id. </em>After he did that, the district court issued an order awarding the employer attorney\u2019s fees and costs, but LaChance did not file a new notice of appeal or amend his original notice of appeal. <em>Id. </em>We held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>order awarding attorney\u2019s fees was \u201cnot reviewable by this [C]ourt\u201d because La-Chance \u201cfailed to amend his notice of appeal to include the order granting attorney\u2019s fees, or file anything within 30 days of the order granting attorney\u2019s fees that mentioned that order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 838. The same is true of the order taxing costs</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Barsorian\u2019s motion to stay, reverse, and vacate the district court\u2019s order taxing costs is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-5\">. Although Barsorian does not explain the connection between those two statements as explicitly as we have here, it is appropriate to consider them together as a coherent argument in light of our duty to liberally construe pro se briefs. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 792 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b891-9\">. Barsorian's attorney raised other arguments when opposing summary judgment in the district court, but Barsorian does not raise them here. As a result, we decline to address them. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (\"[I]ssues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed aban<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>doned\u201d).
