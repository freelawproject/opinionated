In exchange for Craft\u2019s guilty plea, the Government stipulated in a written plea agreement that, for purposes of sentencing, Craft possessed three images of child pornography. However, subsequent forensic examination of Craft\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>computer and hard drives revealed more than 3,900 prohibited images. Consequently, in preparing the presentence investigation report, the probation officer applied a five-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D) because Craft\u2019s offense involved 600 or more images. The \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D) enhancement, together with other adjustments and Craft\u2019s criminal history category of I, yielded an advisory guidelines range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. At sentencing, Craft asked the district court to accept the stipulation in the plea agreement and sentence him based on his possession of three images. The district court declined to accept the stipulation and sentenced Craft to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Craft argues the district court should not have sentenced him based on his possession of more than 3,900 images of child pornography but, instead, should have accepted the stipulation in the plea agreement and sentenced him based on only three images.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">The district court did not err by declining to accept the stipulation in Craft\u2019s plea agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have explained that, in calculating a defendant\u2019s sentence, the district court is not bound by the parties\u2019 stipulations. <em>United States v. Forbes, </em>888 F.2d 752, 754 (11th Cir.1989). The Guidelines also provide that \u201c[t]he court is not bound by [the parties\u2019] stipulation, but may with the aid of the presentence report, determine the facts relevant to sentencing.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6B1.4. As the guidelines commentary notes, \u201cthe court cannot rely exclusively upon stipulations in ascertaining the factors relevant to the determination of sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6B1.4 (commentary). \u201cRather, in determining the factual basis for the sentence, the court will consider the stipulation, together with the results of the presentence investigation, and any other relevant information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In calculating Craft\u2019s sentence, the district court considered the stipulation, together with other relevant information, including the results of the presen-tence investigation and a forensic analysis which revealed that Craft possessed more than 3,900 images of child pornography. The court did not err in its application of the Guidelines and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-6\">. \"[I]n assessing a district court's imposition of an offense-level enhancement, we review the court's findings of fact for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo.\" United States v.
