(\u201cJacobs\u201d), in her race and sex discrimination suit arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2(a) and \u00a7 1981. On appeal, Brown argues that the district court erred in: (1) granting summary judgment on her discrimination claim; and (2) denying her motion to compel discovery. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Skrtich v. Thornton, </em>280 F.3d 1295, 1299 (11th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is proper only when the evidence demonstrates that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>We review the denial of a motion to compel discovery for abuse of discretion. <em>Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 837 (11th Cir.2006). A \u201cdistrict court is allowed a range of choice in such matters, and we will not second-guess the district court\u2019s actions unless they reflect a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">First, we are unconvinced by Brown\u2019s claim that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants on her discrimination claim. Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to \u201cdischarge any individual ... because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A Title VII disparate treatment claim based on circumstantial evidence is analyzed under the framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir.2004). To establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment, the plaintiff must show: (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she was subjected to adverse employment action; (3) her employer treated similarly situated employees outside her class more favorably; and (4) she was qualified to do the job. <em>Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>1368 (11th Cir.1999). Once a prima facie case is established, the employer has the burden to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment decision. <em>Wilson, </em>376 F.3d at 1087. After an employer articulates one or more legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for the employment action, the plaintiff must show that the proffered reason was a pretext for illegal discrimination. <em>Id. </em>If the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, a plaintiff cannot recast the reason, but must \u201cmeet that reason head on and rebut it.\u201d <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">\u201cIn determining whether employees are similarly situated for purposes of establishing a prima facie case, it is necessary to consider whether the employees are involved in or accused of the same or similar conduct and are disciplined in different ways.\u201d <em>Maniccia, </em>171 F.3d at 1368 (quotations omitted). Thus, we require \u201cthe quantity and quality of the comparator\u2019s misconduct be nearly identical to prevent courts from second-guessing employers\u2019 reasonable decisions and confusing apples with oranges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even if a plaintiff and comparator are similar in some respects, differences in their overall record may render them not \u201csimilarly situated\u201d for purposes of establishing a prima facie case. <em>See, e.g., Knight v. Baptist Hosp. of Miami, Inc., </em>330 F.3d 1313, 1316-19 (11th Cir.2003) (the employee and comparator who committed the same act were not similarly situated because the comparator\u2019s overall record was better).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Here, Brown had not established a prima facie case of discrimination because, as the record reveals, none of the alleged comparators are similarly situated to Brown. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Brown, the record shows that Jacobs\u2019s investigations confirmed that Brown had created a \u201cdreadful\u201d work environment, the problems were her management style caused high turnover in her department to the point where she was on her third generation of employees, she communicated poorly with others, she was the subject of at least two meritorious formal complaints, and she failed to follow Jacobs\u2019s policies. In short, Jacobs\u2019s investigators concluded that the problems in Brown\u2019s department were wide-spread and could not be fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">In contrast, the white male managers cited by Brown as alleged comparators were not subject to any formal complaints. Moreover, while there may have been some informal complaints about them, their misconduct, if any, did not cause the problems associated with Brown\u2019s department. Even if Brown was similar in some respects, such as having a difficult personality or management style, the other managers are still not similarly situated because Brown\u2019s overall record was far worse. As a result, Brown has failed to show a genuine issue of material fact as to whether similarly situated employees outside of her protected class engaged in similar conduct and were treated differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">But even if we were to assume that Brown is able to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, Jacobs has presented legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for Brown\u2019s termination, which she has not rebutted. Among other reasons, Jacobs identified Brown\u2019s inability to manage or lead people, high turnover rates and poor performance in HR, and a general reluctance among Jacobs\u2019s employees to use HR. Brown provided no evidence to contradict these reasons, and, therefore, has not presented evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue that they were merely pretext for illegal discrimination. Therefore, because Brown failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>moreover, failed to rebut Jacobs\u2019s legitimate, non-diseriminatory reasons for Brown\u2019s termination, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Jacobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">We are also unpersuaded by Brown\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion in denying Brown\u2019s motion to compel a response to an interrogatory. As we\u2019ve said, \u201c[wjhere a significant amount of discovery has been obtained, and it appears that further discovery would not be helpful in resolving the issues, a request for further discovery is properly denied.\u201d <em>Avirgan v. Hull, </em>932 F.2d 1572, 1580 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The record in this case shows that the discovery scheduling order required all discovery be commenced in time so that it would be completed by March 2, 2009. However, Brown waited until 7:50 P.M. on March 2, 2009, to submit her motion to compel, and therefore failed to timely move to compel discovery in a manner that would complete discovery by the required date. Further, Brown\u2019s reasons for waiting until the last day of discovery to make this request are unavailing because: (1) she received Jacob\u2019s alleged deficient response to interrogatory # 10 on December 18, 2008; (2) she received another deficient response in mid-February; and (3) she discovered information about the investigation into the unnamed manager five days before the deadline. Under these circumstances, the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to compel does not reflect a clear error in judgment. <em>See Holloman, </em>443 F.3d at 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-11\">. Because \u00a7 1981 discrimination claims \"have the same requirements of proof and present the same analytical framework\u201d as those brought under Title VII, the disposition of Brown\u2019s Title VII argument applies equally to her claims brought under \u00a7 1981. <em>See Springer v. Convergys Customer Mgmt. Grp., Inc., </em>509 F.3d 1344, 1347 n. 1 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
