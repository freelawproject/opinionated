The suit named as defendants the Plaintiffs\u2019 employer, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (\u201cMARTA\u201d), as well as the following MARTA officials in both their individual and official capacities: Beverly Scott, general manager; John M. Weber, director of rails and operations; Linda Lee, general superintendent; Richard Krisak, assistant general manager of rail operations; and Dwight Ferrell, chief operating officer (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">The Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint stemmed from their 2009 terminations from their positions with MARTA. Carson, an African-American who worked as a rail line supervisor, alleged that he had been fired for racially discriminatory and retaliatory purposes, under the pretext that he had violated MARTA rules by operating a train while off duty on September 17, 2009, among other misconduct. Clark, an African-American who worked as a rail superintendent, alleged that the Defendants fired him after he had objected to Carson\u2019s treatment, under the pretext that Clark had failed to fully investigate Carson\u2019s earlier alleged violations of MARTA\u2019s radio-operation policies and had forwarded to Carson, without authorization, an e-mail that contained the recordings of the radio transmissions being investigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">I. Racial Discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b987-13\">The Plaintiffs first argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Defendants as to the Title VII and \u00a7 1981 claims of racial discrimination. They contend that the Defendants\u2019 proffered legitimate, nondiserim-inatory reasons for their terminations were contradictory and not credible, and therefore the claims should survive summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-14\">The Plaintiffs then proceed to list a number of alleged contradictions within the evidence. First, inconsistencies exist as to whether certain defendants had seen a letter \"written by an individual who had accused Weber of creating a hostile work environment. Second, the evidence included contradictory accounts as to the extent of the Defendants\u2019 knowledge regarding Weber\u2019s alleged discriminatory conduct. Third, contradictory evidence exists as to the manner in which MARTA investigated and reported Carson\u2019s alleged rule violations. Fourth, the evidence shows an inconsistency regarding MARTA\u2019s termination policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-15\">Fifth, the Plaintiffs argue that the evidence presents contradictions as to whether Carson in fact violated MARTA\u2019s rules and policies. Ferrell testified in a deposition that Carson was certified and capable of operating one of MARTA\u2019s trains, yet Carson\u2019s termination letter stated other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>wise. Additionally, Weber\u2019s office assistant, Dawn Pope, stated in an affidavit that a member of the legal and human resource departments had told her that the Plaintiffs should not have been terminated because they had not disobeyed any rules. Weber also could not explain why Carson\u2019s sanctions for violating MARTA\u2019s rules far exceeded the required sanctions. Moreover, contradictions existed as to whether Carson had been cleared for duty by the time he operated a train on September 17, 2009. Sixth, the evidence suggests that Clark\u2019s termination had been in error. An affidavit from MARTA employee Toya Kellum stated that she overheard Lee tell Clark to stop his investigation into Carson. Krisak later confirmed that, if Clark had been told to stop his investigation, such an instruction would have made a difference as to whether he should have been terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Finally, with regard to Clark\u2019s claims of racial discrimination, the Plaintiffs argue that the district court failed to consider Weber\u2019s \u201cpattern and practice\u201d of habitually treating African-American subordinates less favorably than white subordinates.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Rioux v. City of Atlanta, Ga., </em>520 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cWhen deciding whether summary judgment is appropriate, all evidence and reasonable factual inferences drawn therefrom are reviewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1341-42. Once the moving party meets its burden of production, \u201cthe non-moving party must present evidence beyond the pleadings showing that a reasonable jury could find in its favor.\u201d <em>Shiver v. Chertoff, </em>549 F.3d 1342, 1343 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). A mere \u2018scintilla\u2019 of evidence supporting the opposing party\u2019s position will not suffice; there must be enough of a showing that the jury could reasonably find for that party. <em>Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n of Jefferson Cnty., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1162 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">Title VII makes it illegal for an employer \u201cto discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). Likewise, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, \u201c[a]ll persons ... shall have the same right ... to make and enforce contracts ... as is enjoyed by white citizens,\u201d which in an employment context means protection against discrimination based on race and color. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(a); <em>see also Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs. Inc., </em>161 F.3d 1318, 1330-34 (11th Cir.1998). Allegations of racial discrimination brought under Title VII and \u00a7 1981 are analyzed using the same evidentiary requirements and analytical framework. <em>See Standard, </em>161 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">Because the Plaintiffs concede that they relied upon circumstantial evidence, the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), is applicable to their race discrimination claims. <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en </em>banc) (discussing an ADEA claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">Under <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>a plaintiff must first establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824. To prevail on a claim for racial discrimination under Title VII based on circumstantial evidence, an employee may show that: (1) he was a member of a protected class; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; (3) he was qualified for the position; and (4) he was replaced by a person outside of his protected class or was treated less favorably than a similarly situated individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>outside of his protected class. <em>Maynard v. Bd. of Regents, </em>342 F.3d 1281, 1289 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">If the plaintiff successfully demonstrates a <em>prima fade </em>case, the burden then shifts to the employer to produce evidence that its action was taken for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802-03, 93 S.Ct. at 1824. In the third step of the analysis, the plaintiff must show that the employer\u2019s proffered reason really is a pretext for unlawful discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 804, 93 S.Ct. at 1825.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">The inquiry into pretext requires us to view all of the evidence and \u201cdetermine whether the plaintiff has cast sufficient doubt on the defendant\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons were not what actually motivated its conduct.\u201d <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir.1997) (citation omitted). Such evidence must demonstrate \u201cweaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoheren-cies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). A plaintiff may not establish pretext simply by questioning the wisdom of the employer\u2019s reason. <em>Id. </em>at 1543. Instead, he must meet the employer\u2019s reason \u201chead on\u201d and rebut it. <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1088 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">A reason is not pretext for discrimination \u201c \u2018unless it is shown <em>both </em>that the reason was false, <em>and </em>that discrimination was the real reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brooks, </em>446 F.3d at 1163 (quoting <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2752, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993)). An employee may do that \u201ceither directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Ala. State Tenure Comm., </em>405 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). Ultimately, our inquiry is limited to \u201cwhether the employer gave an honest explanation of its behavior.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1030 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">\n<em>A. Carson\u2019s Racial Discrimination Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">Here, in light of all the evidence, the district court did not err in concluding that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate pretext as to Carson\u2019s discrimination claims. <em>See McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 804, 93 S.Ct. at 1825; <em>Combs, </em>106 F.3d at 1538. Although the Plaintiffs base their argument on a string of alleged contradictions in the evidence, a majority of these contradictions are irrelevant to whether Carson actually had violated MARTA rules and policies, and thus do not rebut head-on the proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for his termination. <em>See Wilson, </em>376 F.3d at 1088; <em>Combs, </em>106 F.3d at 1538.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">The only identified inconsistencies that are relevant to the Defendants\u2019 reason for terminating Carson concern whether he in fact violated MARTA\u2019s policies. However, none of these inconsistencies show that the proffered reason for his termination is unworthy of credence. <em>See Combs, </em>106 F.3d at 1538. Finally, even if the Plaintiffs had shown that the Defendants\u2019 proffered reason for the termination had been false, they failed to establish that racial discrimination was the real reason for his firing. <em>See Brooks, </em>446 F.3d at 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">\n<em>B. Clark\u2019s Racial Discrimination Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b989-13\">Here, the Plaintiffs have not challenged the district court\u2019s conclusion that Clark failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with regard to the racial discrimination claim brought under Title VII. Hence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>any challenges to the grant of summary judgment on Clark\u2019s discrimination claims are limited to the count brought under \u00a7 1981. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that a party abandons claims that he does not argue in his brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">As to the \u00a7 1981 discrimination claim, neither of the Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments has merit. First, a \u201cpattern and practice\u201d claim only may be brought by the government or a class of private plaintiffs pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). <em>See Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol, </em>516 F.3d 955, 964-65 (11th Cir.2008). Second, even if the Plaintiffs\u2019 argument with regard to pretext has merit, the district court had determined that the Plaintiffs failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination after failing to identify any similarly situated employees outside of Clark\u2019s class who had received more favorable treatment. Thus, the Plaintiffs did not first meet their burden regarding a <em>prima facie </em>case, nor do they challenge that matter on appeal. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824; <em>Maynard, </em>342 F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">II. Retaliation</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">The Plaintiffs next argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment as to their Title VII and \u00a7 1981 retaliation claims. Regarding Carson\u2019s claims, the Plaintiffs contend that his complaints about Weber\u2019s routine discriminatory practices, as well as MARTA\u2019s failure to address this discriminatory conduct, constituted what Carson would reasonably believe to be protected expression. Further, the court\u2019s assumption that Carson\u2019s termination had been too remote in time to his complaints is not supported by the record evidence. Also, an affidavit from MARTA employee Ethel Williams established that, after Carson had filed a 2004 complaint against Weber, Weber had stated that Carson would not advance any further than his current position at MARTA. Regarding Clark\u2019s claims, the Plaintiffs argue that he had a good-faith belief that he was engaging in a statutorily protected activity when he declined to investigate or punish Carson, because that sanction exceeded MARTA\u2019s rules and policies. Finally, the Plaintiffs argue that the Defendants\u2019 proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for their terminations were contradictory and not credible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">As noted above, we review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Rioux, </em>520 F.3d at 1274. Title VII provides that \u201c[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees ... because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by [Title VII], or because he has made a charge\u201d under Title VII. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a); <em>see Thompson v. North American Stainless, LP, </em>562 U.S. 170, -, 131 S.Ct. 863, 867, 178 L.Ed.2d 694 (2011). Section 1981 of Title 42 also encompasses retaliation claims by an employee. <em>Chapter 7 Trustee v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., </em>683 F.3d 1249, 1257-58 (11th Cir.2012) (citation omitted). A plaintiff seeking to bring a retaliation claim under either statute must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case by showing that (1) he engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) he suffered a materially adverse action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. <em>Id. </em>at 1258 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">To state a retaliation claim, the plaintiff need only show that he had a \u201creasonable belief\u2019 that an unlawful employment practice was occurring, and is not required to show that the employer actually engaged in an unlawful employment practice. <em>Berman v. Orkin Exterminating Co., Inc., </em>160 F.3d 697, 702 (11th Cir.1998). A plaintiff also may establish causation by showing that the' decision-makers were \u201caware of the protected conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated.\u201d <em>McCann v. Tillman, </em>526 F.3d 1370, 1376 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted). One way to do this is to demonstrate that there was close temporal proximity between the two events. <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007). However, a delay of three to four months is too long, as a matter of law, to prove causation. Id<em>.; see also Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1370 (11th Cir.1999) (concluding that \u201c[t]he more than 15-month period that elapsed between Appellant\u2019s grievance and the alleged adverse employment actions belies her assertion that the former caused the latter\u201d). \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">With regard to whether an employee has engaged in a statutorily protected activity, an employer may not retaliate against an employee because the employee \u201chas opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by\u201d Title VII. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Similarly, an employer may not retaliate against an employee because the employee \u201chas made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A complaint about an employment practice constitutes protected opposition only if the individual explicitly or implicitly communicates a belief that the practice constitutes unlawful employment discrimination. EEOC Compl. Man. (CCH) \u00a7\u00a7 8-II-B(2) (2006); <em>see also Fed. Express Corp. v. Holowecki, </em>552 U.S. 389, 399, 128 S.Ct. 1147, 1156, 170 L.Ed.2d 10 (2008) (stating that the EEOC manual reflects \u201ca body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants my properly resort for guidance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">\n<em>A. Carson\u2019s Retaliation Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">Here, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment as to Carson\u2019s Title VII and \u00a7 1981 claims of retaliation. The court correctly concluded that, while Carson did file an internal complaint against Weber in 2004, it was too temporally remote from Carson\u2019s termination in 2009 to establish a causal nexus. <em>See Thomas, </em>506 F.3d at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">\n<em>B. Clark\u2019s Retaliation Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">As with the racial discrimination claims, the Defendants have not challenged the district court\u2019s conclusion that Clark failed to exhaust his administrative remedies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>with regard to the retaliation claim brought under Title VII. Hence, any challenges to the rulings on Clark\u2019s retaliation claims are limited to the count brought under \u00a7 1981. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">As to Clark\u2019s \u00a7 1981 retaliation claim, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment. Nothing in the record indicates that Clark either halted his investigation into Carson\u2019s alleged violations of radio-transmission policies, or forwarded the e-mail to Carson related to that investigation, in an effort to oppose MARTA\u2019s unlawful employment practices. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a); <em>Gate Gourmet, </em>683 F.3d at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">For the reasons stated above, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment as to all claims brought by the Plaintiffs, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-7\">. The response brief submitted for this appeal asserts, among other arguments, that the Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal should be dismissed for failure to pay the docketing fee. However, the docket sheets for both our clerk\u2019s office and the district court indicate that on November 11, 2013, the Plaintiffs paid the required $508, which included the $450 docketing fee, the $5 filing fee, and a $53 returned-items fee for a prior insufficient payment. <em>See </em>11th Cir. R. 3, I.O.P.; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1917. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs remain in compliance with Rule 3(e). <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 3(e) (\"Upon filing a notice of appeal, the appellant must pay the district clerk all required fees.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">Also, in their reply brief, the Plaintiffs request a default judgment against defendant MARTA, as well as MARTA\u2019s exclusion from oral argument, because MARTA failed to timely file a response brief. The Plaintiffs contend that the submitted response brief came only from the defendants named as individuals, and did not include MARTA. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that MARTA did not join in the response brief, the request for a default ruling in the Plaintiffs\u2019 favor is meritless, because the only punishment MARTA could receive is losing the opportunity to be heard on oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 31(c). Also, because we have decided this appeal without the aid of oral argument, the Plaintiffs' request to exclude MARTA from oral argument is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b992-17\">.
