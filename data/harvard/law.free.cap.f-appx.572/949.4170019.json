On appeal here, Tug-gerson-Brown raises two arguments: (1) that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), at step two of the sequential analysis, erred in concluding that her depression, lumbar degenerative disc disease, back, neck, and leg pain, and diabetes, separately or combined, did not constitute a severe impairment, and (2) that the ALJ failed to consider those impairments in conjunction with others at the latter stages of the sequential analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s decisions with deference to factual findings and close scrutiny of legal conclusions. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir.2007). Factual findings are conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence, or enough evidence such that a reasonable person would find it adequate to support the conclusion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">According to administration regulations, once before an ALJ, the evaluation of an alleged disability should follow a five-step sequential process. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4); <em>see also Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011). At the second step, the ALJ considers the medical severity of the applicant\u2019s impairments, and, if he finds that an applicant does not have a \u201csevere\u201d impairment or combination of impairments, he should conclude that there is no disability. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii). We have described step two as a \u201cfilter\u201d requiring the denial of any disability claim where no severe impairment or combination of impairments is present. <em>Jamison v. Bowen, </em>814 F.2d 585, 588 (11th Cir.1987). We have also described step two as designed to screen out groundless claims, where the applicant\u2019s medical problems could not possibly prevent her from work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>ing. <em>Stratton v. Bowen, </em>827 F.2d 1447, 1452 &amp; n. 9 (11th Cir.1987). To proceed to step three of the evaluation process, an ALJ need only conclude that an applicant had \u201cat least one\u201d severe impairment. <em>Jamison, </em>814 F.2d at 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Where an applicant has multiple impairments, the ALJ considers the combined effect of all impairments without regard to whether any individual impairment would demonstrate disability. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1523. At step three of the sequential process, the ALJ determines whether an applicant has \u201cimpairment(s)\u201d that meets one of the listed disabilities. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii). The regulations state that, where no individual impairment meets a listing, the ALJ will consider whether a combination of impairments is medically equivalent to a listing. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1526; <em>see also Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1224 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">At step four of the sequential evaluation, the ALJ considers his assessment of the applicant\u2019s Residual Functional Capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) and past relevant work to determine whether the applicant can return to her former work. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv). In determining RFC, the ALJ considers all medically determinable impairments. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1545(a)(2). At the fifth step, the administration considers the same RFC assessment and other information to see if the applicant can adjust to other work in light of her \u201cimpairment(s).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(v) and (g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">In <em>Wilson, </em>the ALJ acknowledged that Wilson suffered multiple injuries and then stated that he \u201cdid not have an impairment or combination of impairments\u201d that equaled a listing. 284 F.3d at 1224 (emphasis omitted). We held that statement was sufficient to demonstrate that the ALJ considered the cumulative effect of the applicant\u2019s impairments. <em>Id. </em>at 1224-25; <em>see also Jones v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>941 F.2d 1529, 1533 (11th Cir.1991) (reaching the same conclusion based on similar language).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">As we have described, step two of the sequential evaluation acts as a \u201cscreening\u201d or \u201cfilter\u201d to eliminate groundless claims. <em>See Stratton, </em>827 F.2d at 1452 &amp; n. 9; <em>Jamison, </em>814 F.2d at 588. Accordingly, we have recognized that step two requires only a finding of \u201cat least one\u201d severe impairment to continue on to the later steps. <em>See Jamison, </em>814 F.2d at 588. Further, the regulations state that the only consequence of the analysis at step two is that, if the ALJ finds no severe impairment or impairments, he should reach a conclusion of no disability. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii). Here, the ALJ found multiple severe impairments and accordingly proceeded to step three of the evaluation. Based on our precedent and the regulations, therefore, it is apparent that there is no need for an ALJ to identify every severe impairment at step two. Accordingly, even assuming that Tugger-son-Brown is correct that her additional impairments were \u201csevere,\u201d the ALJ\u2019s recognition of that as a fact would not, in any way, have changed the step-two analysis, and she cannot demonstrate error below.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">While the ALJ did not need to determine whether every alleged impairment was \u201csevere,\u201d he was required to consider all impairments, regardless of severity, in conjunction with one another in performing the latter steps of the sequential evaluation. Despite Tuggerson-Brown\u2019s arguments to the contrary, it is apparent from the face of the ALJ\u2019s decision and the RFC report relied upon by the ALJ that the ALJ did, in fact, consider all medical evidence in combination in concluding that Tuggerson-Brown was not disabled. In performing his analysis, the ALJ stated that he evaluated whether Tuggerson-Brown had an \u201cimpairment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>combination of impairments\u201d that met a listing and that he considered \u201call symptoms\u201d in determining her RFC. Under our precedent, those statements are enough to demonstrate that the ALJ considered all necessary evidence. <em>See Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1224-25. The ALJ went beyond those statements in his analysis, specifically discussing evidence of Tuggerson-Brown\u2019s depression, diabetes, leg, neck, and back pain, and mild degenerative disc disease. The RFC report likewise addressed many of the same symptoms. Accordingly, the record sufficiently demonstrates that the ALJ properly considered all of Tuggerson-Brown\u2019s impairments, even those not specifically found to be severe, in reaching a conclusion that she was not disabled. Tuggerson-Brown does not specifically challenge or assert that the AL J\u2019s ultimate conclusion was not based on substantial evidence in some other regard, and therefore we affirm the denial of disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
