Stat. \u00a7 112.044. Because we conclude FAU is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, we vacate and remand with instructions for the district judge to dismiss that claim of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b968-23\">In October 2012, Miriam Crisman, a 56-year-old white female, sued her former employer, FAU, in federal court in the Southern District of Florida. She alleged gender and race discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a), and age discrimination under the FL-ADEA, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 112.044. After she had served over 29 years of employment, she contended FAU <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>had fired her for financial reasons. Although she purports to be substantially more qualified, Crisman alleges FAU had retained and transferred into her position a much younger black male.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\">FAU moved to dismiss Crisman\u2019s FL-ADEA, age-discrimination claim and argued FAU was an agency or instrumentality of the State of Florida, which barred the claim under Eleventh Amendment immunity. It asserted section 112.044 of the Florida Statutes did not include an explicit and definite waiver of the State\u2019s immunity from suit in federal court, as required by federal law and section 768.28(18) of the Florida Statutes. Crisman responded the plain language of FL-ADEA provided she could bring an action in \u201cany court of competent jurisdiction,\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 112.044(4), which included federal courts. She also argued FAU\u2019s reference to section 768.28(18) was misplaced, because Chapter 768 concerns only tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">The district judge denied FAU\u2019s motion to dismiss and found the plain meaning of the section 112.044 operative language, \u201cin any court of competent jurisdiction,\u201d clearly indicated Florida\u2019s intent to be subject to suit in federal court. R at 198. The judge noted the adjective \u201cany\u201d negated the conclusion Florida had limited its consent to suit solely in its courts. R at 198. The judge also stated the language of section 112.044(4) \u2014 \u201cin any court of competent jurisdiction\u201d \u2014 answered not only whether the State consented to suit, but also where the State consented to suit, and Florida had consented to suit in any court. R at 201. The judge further noted FAU\u2019s references to section 768.28 were inappo-site.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">On interlocutory appeal, FAU argues it was entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity on Crisman\u2019s FL-ADEA claim, Count III.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, FAU contends the district judge\u2019s denial of sovereign immunity under FL-ADEA was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">We review issues of Eleventh Amendment immunity de novo. <em>United States v. Ala. Dep\u2019t of Mental Health &amp; Mental Retardation, </em>673 F.3d 1320, 1324 (11th Cir.2012). The Eleventh Amendment states: \u201cThe Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XI. The Supreme Court has construed the Eleventh Amendment \u201cto establish that an unconsenting State is immune from suits brought in federal courts by her own citizens as well as by citizens of another state.\u201d <em>Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp. v. Feeney, </em>495 U.S. 299, 304, 110 S.Ct. 1868, 1872, 109 L.Ed.2d 264 (1990) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The Eleventh Amendment bar to suit, however, is not absolute, because states may consent to suit in federal court, and Congress may abrogate states\u2019 sovereign immunity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">A state waives its Eleventh Amendment immunity \u201conly where stated by the most express language or by such overwhelming implication from the text as will leave no room for any other reasonable construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305, 110 S.Ct. at 1873 (citations, internal quotation marks, and alterations omitted). A state does not waive its sovereign immunity only by consenting to suit in its own courts, \u201cand thus, in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>for a state statute ... to constitute a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity, it must specify the State\u2019s intention to subject itself to suit in <em>federal court.\u201d Id. </em>at 306, 110 S.Ct. at 1873 (citations, internal quotation marks, and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">A state does not consent to suit in federal court merely by stating its intention to sue and be sued, \u201cor even by authorizing suits against it <em>in any court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d Coll. Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., </em>527 U.S. 666, 676, 119 S.Ct. 2219, 2226, 144 L.Ed.2d 605 (1999) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>327 U.S. 573, 575, 578-79 &amp; n. 1, 66 S.Ct. 745, 746-48 &amp; n. 1, 90 L.Ed. 862 (1946)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Such ambiguous and general consent-to-suit provisions, standing alone, are insufficient to waive Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>See Feeney, </em>495 U.S. at 306, 110 S.Ct. at 1873 (holding a statute providing for \u201cconsent to suits, actions, or proceedings of any form or nature\u201d was ambiguous). Nevertheless, \u201c[o]ther textual evidence of consent to suit in federal courts may resolve that ambiguity and sufficiently [and] clearly establish the scope of the State\u2019s more general consent to suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306-07, 110 S.Ct. at 1873. In <em>Fee-ney, </em>the Supreme Court determined, although the consent-to-suit provision at issue was ambiguous, the venue provision resolved the ambiguity and expressly stated New York and New Jersey had consented to suit within a \u201cjudicial district, established by one of said States <em>or by the United States, </em>and situated ... within the Port of New York District.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). Additionally, in <em>Kenne-cott Copper, </em>the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that the language in a Utah state statute allowing taxpayers to bring an action \u201cin any court of competent jurisdiction\u201d was informed by Utah\u2019s explicit language in its other provisions wherein it consented to suit in federal courts. <em>Kennecott Copper, </em>327 U.S. at 579 &amp; n. 8, 66 S.Ct. at 748 <em>&amp; </em>n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">In <em>Maynard, </em>we rejected the argument that a statute allowing a state \u201cto sue and be sued, and to plead and be impleaded in <em>all </em>courts of law and equity\u201d constituted a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>Maynard v. Bd. of Regents of Fla. Dep\u2019t of Educ. ex rel. Univ. of S. Fla., </em>342 F.3d 1281, 1287-88 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting Fla. Stat. \u00a7 240.205(4)). We concluded, \u201c[g]iv-en the Supreme Court\u2019s emphasis on the breadth and force of Eleventh Amendment immunity, ... the necessary express consent to suit in federal court [was absent] in this waiver\u2019s language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1288 (footnote omitted). We further stated there was \u201cno meaningful distinction between \u2018any court\u2019 and \u2018all courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">FL-ADEA, section 112.044(4) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-8\">Any person other than an employee who is within the Career Service System established by chapter 110, or any person employed by the Public Employees Relations Commission, who is aggrieved by a violation of this act may bring a civil action <em>in any court of competent jurisdiction </em>for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of this act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 112.044(4) (emphasis added). Chapter 768 of the Florida Statutes generally concerns negligence and other tort actions. Nevertheless, section 768.28(18) of the Florida Statutes provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-10\">No provision of this section, or <em>of any other section of the Florida Statutes, </em>whether read separately or in conjunction with any other provision, shall be construed to waive the immunity of the state or any of its agencies from suit in federal court, as such immunity is guaranteed by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>unless such waiver is explicitly and definitely stated to be a waiver of the immunity of the state and its agencies from suit in federal court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.28(18) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">The consent-to-suit provision at issue, section 112.044(4), contains language authorizing suit \u201cin any court of competent jurisdiction,\u201d but the Supreme Court has held such language is ambiguous and insufficient to indicate a state\u2019s intent to be sued in federal court. <em>See Coll. Sav. Bank, </em>527 U.S. at 676, 119 S.Ct. at 2226; <em>Kennecott Copper, </em>327 U.S. at 578-79 &amp; n. 1, 66 S.Ct. at 746-48 &amp; n. 1. Similarly, we have rejected consent-to-suit provisions providing a state may be sued \u201cin <em>all </em>courts of law and equity.\u201d <em>Maynard, </em>342 F.3d at 1287-88. Accordingly, the district judge erred by denying FAU\u2019s motion to dismiss Crisman\u2019s FL-ADEA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">In addition, we have found no other textual evidence showing Florida has consented to suit in federal court to resolve FL-ADEA claims. <em>See Feeney, </em>495 U.S. at 306-07, 110 S.Ct. at 1873. Moreover, section 768.28(18) explicitly states no provision of the Florida Statutes may be construed to waive the State\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity unless the waiver is explicitly and definitely stated to be a waiver of sovereign immunity. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.28(18). FL-ADEA does not explicitly and definitely state Florida consents to suit in federal court. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 112.044. Therefore, FAU is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity on Crisman\u2019s FL-ADEA claim. We vacate the district judge\u2019s denial of FAU\u2019s motion to dismiss based on the FL-ADEA and remand with instructions to dismiss that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-6\">. The denial of a claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine. <em>See P.R. Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., </em>506 U.S. 139, 142-47, 113 S.Ct. 684, 687-89, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
