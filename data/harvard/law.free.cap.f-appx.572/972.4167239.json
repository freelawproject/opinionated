No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). Upon review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence unless (1) the defendant was sentenced based on a guideline range that the Sentencing Commission has subsequently lowered and (2) the \u201creduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is not consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements if an amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">Amendment 750 had the effect of lowering the guidelines under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, but the district court did not sentence McKinney based on those guidelines. Instead, the district court sentenced McKinney pursuant to a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 851.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, even if McKinney were not subject to this statutory minimum, his guideline range would be determined by his status as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, which was not affected by Amendment 750. Consequently, the district court had no authority to reduce McKinney\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 750. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376-77 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"AbM4\">To the extent McKinney argues for a sentence reduction based on the FSA, we have expressly rejected such a claim, <em>id. </em>at 377, and McKinney\u2019s argument that the crack cocaine statutes should not apply because they are racially discriminatory cannot succeed in light of <em>Berry, see United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-14\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the district did not err in determining that it did not have the authority to reduce McKinney\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b995-10\">. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b995-11\">. McKinney\u2019s conviction for possessing with intent to distribute at least 50 grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(iii) (2002), required a mandatory life sentence because McKinney had at least two prior Florida state felony drug convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b995-18\">.Although McKinney argued in the district court that he was also entitled to relief pursuant to <em>United States v. Hargrove, </em>732 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir.2013), he has abandoned any such claim by not raising it in his initial brief. <em>See United States v. Curtis, </em>380 F.3d 1308, 1310-11 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that issues not raised in a party\u2019s initial brief are deemed abandoned or waived). In any event, <em>Har-grove </em>is inapplicable because McKinney is a career offender.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
