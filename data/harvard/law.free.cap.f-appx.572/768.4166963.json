Vega-Delgado argues that she was entitled to a reduction in her base offense level for her minor role in the offense. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">The district court did not clearly err by denying Vega-Delgado\u2019s request for a reduction for her minor role. A defendant is eligible for a two-level reduction in her base offense level if she \u201cwas a minor participant,\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 SB 1.2(b) (Nov.2013), whose \u201cpart in committing the offense ... ma[de] [her] substantially less culpable than the average participant,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(A). To warrant a reduction, the defendant\u2019s role in the offense must be minor in comparison to her relevant conduct and in comparison to other participants in the offense. <em>United States v. Alvarez-Coria, </em>447 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir.2006). Based on the information in Vega-Delgado\u2019s presentence investigation report, to which she did not object, <em>see United States v. Turner, </em>626 F.3d 566, 572 (11th Cir.2010), her relevant conduct is identical to her actual conduct, which consisted of transporting 2.73 kilograms of cocaine from Texas to Florida; calling a confidential source to obtain a buyer; scheduling the transaction; and transferring the cocaine from the confidential source\u2019s residence to the trunk of a vehicle used to transport the cocaine to the buyer. And Vega-Delgado\u2019s conduct is not \u201csubstantially less\u201d than that of her codefen-dant, who negotiated the price and delivered the cocaine to the buyer. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">We AFFIRM Vega-Delgado\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
