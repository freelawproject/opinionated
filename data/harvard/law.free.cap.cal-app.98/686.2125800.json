The court did find as follows: \u201cThat at all times herein mentioned, Fred L. Alies was doing business under the registered fictitious name of Alies Printing Company.\u201d The answer not only denies the allegation of the complaint to which the finding is in form responsive, but also \u201calleges that the Alies Printing Company is a concern doing business under a fictitious name and that they have not complied with the statutes made and provided for in such cases.\u201d There is no finding upon this allegation, in so far as the statute relates to publication\u2014conceding without deciding that the finding that the fictitious name was registered was equal to a finding that it was filed, as required by the statute\u2014and no evidence in the record to justify a finding that the name was published. Our attention is naturally directed first to the indefinite and uncertain nature of the allegation of the answer. It is without doubt subject to criticism and should have been the object of an attack by the respondent in the lower court. However, it was not. In fact, at the very beginning of the trial, counsel for defendant resisted the introduction of any testimony until proof had been made of compliance with the sections of the code already mentioned. Both court and counsel for respondent accepted the allegation as putting in issue the question whether there had been a publication of the certificate and a filing of the affidavit of publication. The theory upon which the cause was tried was that where the name of the party who owns the business is used in the name of the company, the name is not fictitious and compliance with the code sections is unnecessary. Under such circumstances it would be manifestly improper for the appellate court to determine the pleading to be insufficient to put the fact in issue. <em>(Illinois </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number><em>Trust &amp; Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Pacific Ry. Co., </em>115 Cal. 297 [47 Pac. 60]; <em>Gervaise </em>v. <em>Brookins, </em>156 Cal. 110 [103 Pac. 332]; <em>Fighiera </em>v. <em>Radis, </em>180 Cal. 660 [182 Pac. 418].)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\">Counsel for respondent after failure to produce to the trial court a case sustaining his theory that where the name of the party who owns the business is used in a company name, compliance with the code sections is not essential to the maintenance of the action, offered in evidence a \u201ccertified copy of the record,\u201d which record consisted solely of a certificate signed by Fred L. Alies that he was doing business under the fictitious name of \u201cAlies Printing Company\u201d without any affidavit of publication as required. We are therefore brought directly to the question whether the designation used is in the. eyes of the law fictitious so as to require the certificate to be published. It would serve no useful purpose for us to discuss at length the meaning of the word fictitious for the reason that our supreme court has definitely established the law applicable to the instant situation. In <em>North </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>135 Cal. 621 [67 Pac. 1037], it said: \u201c \u2018Abrams Bros.\u2019 cannot be said to be a designation \u2018showing the names of the persons interested as parties. \u2019 The firm name might apply equally to a partnership composed of two or more and might embrace all or only some of the brothers of the name of Abrams.\u201d In <em>Schwarz &amp; Gotlieb, Inc., </em>v. <em>Marcuse, </em>175 Cal. 401 [165 Pac. 1015], in which case it was held that it was necessary to publish the certificate and file the affidavit where the name P. H. Murphy &amp; Son was used, the court took occasion in commenting upon the opinion in <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Byers, </em>17 Okl. 633 [10 Ann. Cas. 810, 89 Pac. 1114], to say with reference thereto as follows: \u201c . . . the last case . . . announces the remarkable conclusion that \u2018Patterson Furniture Company\u2019 shows that there is a company composed of persons whose surname is Patterson; and that \u2018it further shows that there are no other members of the firm except those whose surname is Patterson. \u2019 Evidently the learned justice who wrote that opinion overlooked the fact that commonly the title \u2018Patterson Furniture Company\u2019 might indicate a corporation or copartnership in which the stockholders or members might or might not be Pattersons.\u201d And again, in <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Glick, </em>205 Cal. 699 [272 Pac, 587], it was held that those using the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>name \u201cAndrews-Cordano Plumbing Company\u201d could not maintain an action until after compliance with, the sections of the code for the reason that the name does not inform third persons of the exact membership of the company. These quotations are peculiarly pertinent to the designation under consideration and conclude respondent\u2019s argument in this particular. The farthest our courts have gone is to say that those partnership names are not assumed or fictitious in which the surnames of all the partners are used and joined together by the conjunction and, such, for example, as \u201cPendleton &amp; Williams.\u201d The action cannot, therefore, be maintained in the absence of a compliance with the requirements of the sections already mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">The next contention of appellant is that an assignment to the respondent by the \u201cAlies Printing Company\u201d was not proved, the trial court having found that it was. There was proof that Fred L. Alies owned the business and operated under that name. There was proof that he signed and executed the assignment. This was sufficient to justify the finding complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Other specifications of insufficiency of the evidence are made. We have examined each of them and find that there was sufficient to uphold every finding of the court attacked in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Works, P. J., and Craig, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the District'Court of Appeal on June 6, 1929.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
