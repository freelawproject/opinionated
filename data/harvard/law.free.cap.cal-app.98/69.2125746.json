DAVID et al., Respondents.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Hill, Morgan &amp; Bledsoe and Kenneth K.

M. David, O. J. David and M. F. Brown, at all the times herein mentioned have been and now are a copartnership doing business under the fictitious name of Journal of Commerce, and have complied with all the requirements of Sections 2466 and 2468' of the Civil Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">\u201cThat applicant is the publisher of the newspaper known as Journal of Commerce and said newspaper is a newspaper of general circulation, printed and published at regular intervals, to-wit: daily except Sunday, in the City and County of Los Angeles, California, for the dissemination of local news and intelligence of a general character and has a <em>Iona fide </em>subscription list of paying subscribers; that said newspaper has been established, printed and published as a daily newspaper, except Sunday, at regular intervals in said City, County and State for a period of more than one year last past, to-wit: from on or about December 11, 1925, to the date hereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">Thereafter and prior to the time fixed for the hearing, the contestant, A. McDowell, a citizen, resident and taxpayer of the city of Los Angeles, filed a contest to said petition, alleging \u201cthat said newspaper was not -published for the dissemination of local news or intelligence of a general character, but on the contrary, said newspaper was devoted to the interest and published for the entertainment and instruction of a particular class, profession, trade or calling or for a number of such classes, professions, trades, or callings, to-wit: to the interest and for the entertainment and instruction of persons engaged in or connected with the construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>and building industry of Southern California, and that such was the avowed purpose of such newspaper and of the publishers thereof, and the contestant further alleges that the newspaper did not disseminate local news or intelligence of \u00e1 general character. \u2019 \u2019 The court thereafter heard the matter and made its findings in favor of the applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The sole question presented and urged on this appeal is whether or not the evidence was sufficient to support the findings of the court that the newspaper in question was published for the dissemination of local news and intelligence of a general character, and that such newspaper was not devoted to the interest and published for the entertainment and instruction of a particular class, profession, trade or calling, or for a number of such classes, professions, trades or callings, and that said newspaper was not published for the avowed purpose of entertaining and instructing persons engaged in or connected with the building industries of Southern California, within the meaning of section 4460 of the Political Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The superior court, having determined from the evidence that the publication is a newspaper of general circulation as that term is defined in section 4460, such determination of the evidence is conclusive on appeal unless it shall appear, as a matter of law, that it is insufficient to support the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">In the instant proceeding the evidence adduced on the part of the applicant at the hearing, as shown by the bill of exceptions, consisted of the testimony of C. M. David, a member of the applicant copartnership, and E. J. Davis, circulation manager for applicant, and introduction in evidence of several issues of the paper in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Appellant urges as error the fact that, under objections made by contestant, in addition to two issues of the paper that were dated prior to the date of the commencement of this proceeding, four issues dated subsequent to such date were admitted in evidence. Assuming, without holding, that they were not admissible, for the reason that such evidence was cumulative of what was shown by the issues that concededly were properly received in evidence, no substantial injury resulted therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">An examination of the copies of the paper in evidence shows that the publication is made up principally of stereo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>typed matters under the headings of \u201csub-bids wanted,\u2019\u2019 \u201csub-contracts let,\u201d \u201ctoday\u2019s bid calls,\u201d \u201ccommercial news flashes,\u201d \u201cLos Angeles Permits,\u201d \u201cbond bids,\u201d \u201cbond elections,\u201d \u201cbids wanted in Southwest,\u201d \u201ccredit information,\u201d \u201cmechanics\u2019 liens,\u201d \u201cnotices of completion,\u201d \u201cattachments,\u201d \u201cnotices of actions,\u201d \u201cbuilding contracts,\u201d \u201crelease of attachments, \u2019 \u2019 a number of advertisements almost all of which relate to building and construction industries and a number of items claimed to be news items but almost all of which involve or are in some manner connected with the building and construction industries and which appear to be of particular interest to persons connected with such industries. The following headlines of the so-called news items indicate the contents and character and are a fair sample of such items, to-wit: \u201cApprove Plans for Subdivision,\u201d \u201cWater System Contract Let,\u201d \u201cQuantities for Don Pedro Dam,\u201d \u201cResidence Plans are Completed,\u201d \u201cLacy Avenue Bids Received,\u201d \u201cMorrow Water Contract Let,\u201d \u201cDraws Chinese Church Plans,\u201d \u201cWater Board Receives Bids,\u201d \u201cGlass Company to Build Plant\u201d and \u201cGarden Court Lease is Taken.\u201d In addition thereto, we find the following items: \u201cMarkets at a Glance,\u201d showing stock market conditions, quotations of Liberty bond values and rates of bank notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">C. M. David testified \u201cthat when they reported disasters they were generally of the type which might interest the construction industry, such as the destruction of buildings and bridges; that they had not carried any report of political matters; that their subscribers were interested in building construction news and that all matters which would have anything to do with building industries would be of interest <em>to </em>their <em>subscribers; </em>that their subscribers woud be interested in weather particulars, credit information, where bids are to be awarded, where bond issues have been voted for public improvements, financial news, bond issues, new business concerns, moves and fire reports; that all of the editorials which were published were connected with business matters, and none had anything to do with social conditions or political situations, and in the majority of cases the editorials related to building construction industries and that they carried no report of social news.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Respondent appears to rely on <em>In re Green, </em>21 Cal. App. 138 [131 Pac. 91], but a comparison of these two publications shows a marked difference in' purpose and contents. The paper under consideration in that case, in addition to certain stereotyped matter, contains news accounts of courts and other official proceedings, including the activity of the California members of Congress, review of court decisions, general advertisements, personal notices, and many items of local current events of a diversified character.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In the case of <em>In re Herman, </em>183 Cal. 153 [191 Pac. 934], it was found by the court that the \u201cDaily Bulletin\u201d was a newspaper of the following description: a few telegraphic items were contained therein, although these telegraphic items had been copied from other newspapers; the current \u201cnews\u201d was court calendars, without any description of court proceedings; list of suits filed, marriage licenses and building permits issued, matters of stereotyped nature, tables of temperature and rainfall, altitudes at various points in that section of the <em>state; </em>the names and locations of churches, hospitals, asylums, orphan homes and <em>clubs; </em>the names and addresses of clergymen, location of fire-alarm boxes, directories of public offices and officials and such like matters. In holding that the newspaper involved in that ease was not a paper of general circulation, the court said: \u201cIt is clear to us that the purpose of this paper was not the dissemination of local or telegraphic news and intelligence of a general character and that the contents did not come within this description.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">While the rule has been laid down to the effect that even though a newspaper is devoted more or less to a particular class, profession, trade or calling, it will not be deprived of its character as a newspaper of general circulation if, in fact, the newspaper does publish intelligence of passing events and news items of interest to the general public, together with news of interest to such particular class of persons. <em>(In re Green, </em>21 Cal. App. 138 [131 Pac. 91]; <em>In re Labor Journal, </em>190 Cal. 500 [213 Pac. 498].) But the news published in such newspaper must be of such a character that the general reading public might well look to such a paper to learn the news of passing events, and should not be of such a character that the general public would not be at all interested in it. <em>(Hanscomb </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>60 Neb. 72 [83 Am. St. Rep. 509, 48 L. R. A. 411, 82 N. W. <em>114]; Crowell </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>22 R. I. 51 [84 Am. St. Rep. 815, 46 Atl. 35].)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The undoubted purpose of the statutory requirement was to require the publication of legal notices to be published in newspapers which would reach the general reading public, and which would consequently give notice to the public generally and not notice merely to a particular class of the public. <em>(In re Herman, </em>183 Cal. 153 [191 Pac. 934].)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">It should be borne in mind that notice by publication is at best a poor substitute for actual or personal notice, and while undoubtedly valid in cases where necessary, still, where it is permissible at all, it must be such as would be reasonably likely to bring the fact of the pendency and the purpose of the proceeding to the attention of those interested. <em>(Title etc. Restoration Co. </em>v. <em>Kerrigan, </em>150 Cal. 289 [119 Am. St. Rep. 199, 11 Am. Cas. 465, 8 L. R. A. (N. S.) 682, 88 Pac. 356].)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">In this case no telegraphic news is published; the local news items hereinbefore mentioned are limited to such items as are of particular interest to the building and construction industries. Applicant admits that the only disasters reported consist of the destruction of buildings, bridges, railroads and the like, and that they are reported so as to get knowledge to the construction industry of the needs of the industry. No social or political news is reported, and there is no account of local events, casualties, hotel arrivals or departures, personal items and the like, such as might be expected would be found in a newspaper undertaking to publish intelligence of passing events and news items of interest to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">We are constrained to agree with appellant that the paper in this case is one that falls within the rule laid down in the case of <em>In re Herman, supra. </em>Clearly the publication involved in this case is not a newspaper of general circulation but is a newspaper devoted to the interests and published for the entertainment and instruction of a particular class, as those terms are defined in section 4460 of the Political Code. It follows that it must be held that the finding is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"ATg\">Tyler, P. J., and Cashin, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
