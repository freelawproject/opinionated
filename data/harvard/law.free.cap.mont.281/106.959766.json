We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-18\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s denial of Walls\u2019 claim for benefits is supported by substantial credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">On October 4, 1993, Jacqui Walls (Walls) began working as a cashier at BMC West/Poulsen\u2019s, Inc. (Poulsen\u2019s), a hardware, lumber and homeware retailer located in Great Falls, Montana. Walls submitted a workers\u2019 compensation claim to her employer, Poulsen\u2019s, alleging that on June 2, 1994, she injured her back while lifting a heavy lawn ornament. Poulsen\u2019s was enrolled under Compensation Plan II of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and its insurer was Travelers Indemnity Company (Travelers). Travelers refused to accept liability on Walls\u2019 claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, contending that her damages were not the result of a work-related injury. After both parties complied with the mediation procedure set forth in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, a mediation report and recommendation was submitted on September 22,1994. Travelers rejected this recommendation on October 19, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Subsequently, Walls filed a petition for hearing in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court on September 1, 1995. In her petition, Walls alleged that on June 2,1994, she suffered an industrial injury arising out of and in the course of her employment with Poulsen\u2019s. Specifically, she contended that she injured her lower back when she assisted Linda Wilson (Wilson), a customer, by lifting and carrying a heavy lawn ornament from its display to the cash register area. Travelers responded and denied that Walls had suffered a compensable work-related injury. Rather, Travelers argued that Walls injured her back while moving her personal belongings from her boyfriend\u2019s residence, not while working at Poulsen\u2019s assisting a customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Trial was held on January 10, 1996, before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. Walls testified in person and presented three other witnesses on her behalf: her former roommate, Carol LaRocque; her former boyfriend, Zane Carter; and her son, Chase Walls. Travelers presented six additional witnesses to defend against Walls\u2019 claim: the customer Walls assisted, Linda Wilson; Walls\u2019 supervisor, Van Crowe; and four other Poulsen\u2019s employees, including Vince Miranti and Dennis Olson. On January 17, 1996, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law and judgment denying Walls\u2019 claim. From this judgment, Walls appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Was the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s denial of Walls\u2019 claim for benefits supported by substantial credible evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>In its January 17,1996 judgment, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court entered detailed findings of fact and found that Walls did not injure her back while working at Poulsen\u2019s on June 2,1994. Based on these findings and relying on <em>Ricks v. Teslow Consolidated </em>(1973), 162 Mont. 469, 484, 512 P.2d 1304, 1313, the court determined that Walls had not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that she was entitled to compensation. Therefore, the court concluded that Walls was entitled to neither compensation, medical benefits nor attorney fees or costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Walls argues that the Worker\u2019s Compensation Court\u2019s decision to deny Walls\u2019 claim is unconscionable because the court relied only on the impeached testimony of Wilson, the customer that Walls assisted on June 2, 1994, and ignored all other evidence concerning Walls\u2019 claim. Walls asserts that Wilson\u2019s testimony was impeached by two other witnesses whose testimony contradicted her recollection of part of the events of June 2,1994. Walls explains that after Wilson testified that Walls gave no indication that she hurt her back while lifting and carrying a heavy lawn ornament from its display to the cash register area, Wilson subsequently gave incorrect testimony that Walls had also moved the lawn ornament from the cash register area to Wilson\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Walls insists that this part of Wilson\u2019s testimony \u201cwas designed to further indicate that Ms. Walls could not possibly have injured her back if she was then able to transport the [lawn ornament] from her checkout stand to Ms. Wilson\u2019s car.\u201d Furthermore, Walls points out that the store manager, Van Crowe, testified that cashiers do not assist customers by taking purchased items to their cars and that another store employee, Dennis Olson, testified that he, not Walls, had assisted Wilson by taking the lawn ornament from the cash register area to her car. Walls contends that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court should not have given Wilson\u2019s testimony any weight, not only because Wilson offered testimony that was later proven untrue, but because her testimony was \u201cdesigned specifically to prevent Ms. Walls from obtaining benefits for a work-related injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Additionally, Walls asserts that all other evidence supports Walls\u2019 claim that she injured her back at work. Specifically, Walls contends that she reported her injury to her employer and informed at least three friends on the date the injury occurred and also reported her injury to her physician. Walls argues that the trial court ignored this evidence. Furthermore, Walls accuses the trial court of framing its findings of fact in terms of witness credibility to prevent meaningful review of its decision by this Court and \u201c[t]o hamper [Walls\u2019] likeli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>hood of reversal.\u201d Walls urges this Court to reframe our standard of review by adopting a more reasonable and equitable standard to ensure meaningful appellate review of issues of witness credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Travelers responds that Walls\u2019 arguments lack merit and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision should not be disturbed. Travelers asserts that upon careful review of the trial court\u2019s findings, it is clear that the court did not rely solely on Wilson\u2019s testimony and ignore all other testimony presented. Rather, Travelers points out that the court carefully considered all testimony and drafted detailed findings to explain its decision. Specifically, Travelers refers to Finding of Fact No. 22, wherein the trial court summarized the conflicting testimony and explained what testimony it considered credible. Travelers argues that this finding, alone, shows that substantial credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Walls did not injure her back on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Additionally, Travelers argues that Wilson\u2019s inability to perfectly recall who assisted her by taking the lawn ornament from the cash register area to her car is insignificant and does not impeach her testimony. To support this argument, Travelers points out that in Finding of Fact No. 7, the trial court stated that resolving the conflict in testimony concerning who took the lawn ornament to Wilson\u2019s car \u201cis not central to my decision.\u201d Moreover, Travelers argues that Walls\u2019 assertion that Wilson had a motive to testify falsely is \u201cabsurd\u201d because Wilson had absolutely no stake in the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Finally, Travelers argues that Walls\u2019 assertion that the trial court purposely framed its findings in terms of witness credibility to avoid meaningful appellate review is unfounded. Travelers points out that the trial court recognized the conflicting nature of the testimony, and, therefore, based its decision upon witness credibility. Consequently, Travelers contends that because the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court was in the best position to observe the character and demeanor of the witness, we should not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">We review the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Wunderlich v. Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 404, 408, 892 P.2d 563, 566. We have defined \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as consisting of \u201cmore than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Wunderlich, </em>892 P.2d at 566. Furthermore, \u201c[w]here the findings are based on conflicting evidence, the Court\u2019s function is to determine whether there is substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>to support the findings and not to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support contrary findings.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Semitool, Inc. </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 286, 289, 829 P.2d 1, 3. We will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court when the issue concerns the weight given to certain evidence or the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Wunderlich, </em>270 Mont. 404, 892 P.2d at 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Walls requests that we reframe our standard of review concerning witness credibility by adopting a more reasonable and equitable standard. However, Walls, in essense, is requesting that we review the record to determine whether substantial credible evidence supports findings contrary to those of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. Clearly, this is not the appropriate standard. See <em>Nelson, </em>829 P.2d at 3. As is evident from the record, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court was presented with conflicting evidence, from witnesses testifying in person. Therefore, we will defer to the trial court\u2019s judgment concerning witness credibility and review the record only to determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial credible evidence. See <em>Wunderlich, </em>892 P.2d at 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Additionally, Walls alleges that Wilson had a motive to testify falsely and that Wilson\u2019s testimony was impeached by two other witnesses whose testimony conflicted with a portion of her own. Therefore, Walls argues that the trial court erred by giving Wilson\u2019s testimony any weight. We give due regard to the trial court not only to judge the credibility of the witnesses, but to resolve inconsistencies in witness\u2019 testimony. <em>Rafanelli v. Dale </em>(1996), [278 Mont. 28], 924 P.2d 242, 249. Furthermore, \u201ceven if a portion of a witness\u2019 testimony is shown to be false or unreliable, the trier of fact need not discount the entirety of that witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d <em>Rafanelli, </em>924 P.2d at 249 (citing <em>Kis v. Pifer </em>(1978), 179 Mont. 344, 350, 588 P.2d 514, 517-18).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">In this case, the Worker\u2019s Compensation Court was the trier of fact. The trial court noted, in Finding of Fact No. 7, that Wilson\u2019s testimony concerning who took the lawn ornament to Wilson\u2019s car conflicted with other witness testimony. However, the trial court stated that resolving this conflict \u201cis not central to my decision.\u201d It is clear from the trial court\u2019s findings that the trial court carefully considered Wilson\u2019s testimony and accepted her testimony concerning the circumstances surrounding Walls\u2019 alleged back injury. Furthermore, despite her allegation, Walls has presented absolutely no proof that Wilson was motivated to testify falsely to prevent Walls from obtaining benefits for her alleged work-related injury. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not err in relying on Wilson\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Furthermore, despite Walls\u2019 argument, the trial court did not rely solely on the testimony of Wilson. Rather, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court made detailed findings concerning specific testimony of numerous witnesses. Moreover, in Finding of Fact No. 22, the trial court summarized this conflicting testimony and recorded its decision concerning the credibility of the witnesses as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">After considering all of the testimony, especially the testimony recited in these findings of fact, and considering the demeanor of the witnesses, I find the testimony of Wilson, Crowe, Miranti and Dennis Olson credible and do not believe that claimant hurt her back at work. According to claimant, her alleged injury was witnessed by Wilson. Wilson, however, testified credibly that she saw no sign of any injury and that claimant did not report any injury to her. Claimant asserted that she told numerous people of her injury prior to her 4:30 p.m. meeting with Crowe but did not call a single witness who could verify her assertion. Olson, who has a close relationship with claimant, recalled claimant telling him of the incident the <em>next </em>day. Claimant\u2019s assertion that she called Dr. Dietrich\u2019s office at 3:00 p.m. on the day of her alleged injury did not ring true in light of the doctor\u2019s notes indicating that she did not call him until June 8th and that at the time he contemplated seeing her only if the medication he prescribed by telephone did not alleviate her symptoms. I find Crowe\u2019s testimony concerning his 4:30 p.m. meeting with claimant and his awareness that claimant was moving to be credible and convincing. Miranti\u2019s testimony that claimant told him that she hurt her back while \u201cmoving\u201d was also credible and convincing. While \u201cmoving\u201d could refer to \u201cmoving the [lawn] ornament,\u201d I find such explanation of her statement to be implausible, especially in light of claimant\u2019s assertion that she hurt her back when \u201clifting\u201d the ornament. Finally, the testimony of claimant\u2019s witnesses did not persuade me that claimant injured herself at work. Claimant told those witnesses of the alleged accident after she had been placed on probation and after she had already staked out a claim for a work-related injury. While their testimony about the move occurring after June 2nd was credible, claimant moved her furniture and effects over several days and I am persuaded that she in fact commenced moving things out of Carter\u2019s residence at the end of May when she admittedly made her decision to move. [Emphasis in the original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>After reviewing the record and the trial court\u2019s detailed findings, as referred to above, we conclude that the trial court did not ignore any witness testimony. Rather, the trial court considered all witness testimony, observed the demeanor of the witnesses, judged their credibility and concluded that the testimony of Travelers witnesses was more credible than the testimony of Walls\u2019witnesses. Based upon this determination, the trial court concluded that Walls did not injure her back at work, and, therefore, denied her compensation and medical benefits. The trial court\u2019s decision was grounded in the record, in its judgment of the credibility and demeanor of all the witnesses and in the law. Accordingly, we hold that substantial credible evidence in the record supports the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings of fact and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b133-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, HUNT and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
