The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division provides: \"The sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct, and the sentence will not be reduced or increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\" (Section 45-18-904(3), MCA.)
