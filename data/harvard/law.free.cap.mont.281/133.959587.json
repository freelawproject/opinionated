We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">Did the District Court err in failing to adequately inquire into Smith\u2019s complaints of ineffective assistance of counsel?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">On November 2, 1993, a Billings Police Officer stopped Smith for speeding. Upon suspicion that Smith was intoxicated, the officer conducted several field sobriety tests. The officer testified that Smith had difficulty following the instructions and performing the tests. Smith failed to produce the vehicle registration or proof of insurance upon request. Smith was arrested and transported to the Yellowstone Detention Center, where a videotaped interview was conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">In two separate proceedings initiated in the Billings City Court, Smith was charged with and convicted of driving while under the influence, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, and driving with no proof of vehicle insurance, in violation of \u00a7 61-6-301, MCA, and failure to carry vehicle registration, in violation of \u00a7 61-3-322, MCA. Smith appealed both City Court judgments to the District Court. The District Court consolidated the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">Smith filed a financial statement and request for appointment of counsel, and the District Court appointed the Yellowstone public defender\u2019s office to represent Smith. Trial <em>de novo </em>was set for February 21, 1995. Before trial, Smith\u2019s counsel filed a motion to continue the trial, and the District Court reset the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">A jury trial was held on June 6, 1995. Several times during the course of the trial, Smith asked the court for a continuance so that he could get a different attorney, stating that he did not feel his court-appointed attorney was prepared or representing his best interests. The court denied Smith\u2019s requests. The jury returned verdicts of guilty on all three charges and the court sentenced Smith to sixty days in jail for the DUI charge, with all but three days suspended on certain conditions which included payment of jury costs incurred in the City Court and District Court trials. The court sentenced Smith to pay certain fines and surcharges for the convictions of driving with no vehicle insurance and failure to carry vehicle registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">We have held that motions for continuance are addressed to the discretion of the district court and are reviewed on appeal for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>abuse of discretion. Section 46-13-202, MCA; <em>State v. Haskins </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 202, 207, 841 P.2d 542, 545 (citing <em>State v. LaPier </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 335, 790 P.2d 983). Likewise, it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to rule on the substitution of counsel and we will not overturn a decision absent a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Morrison </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 282, 284, 848 P.2d 514, 516; <em>State v. Martz </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 136, 139, 760 P.2d 65, 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">Did the District Court err in failing to adequately inquire into Smith\u2019s complaints of ineffective assistance of counsel?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Smith alleges that the District Court erred in failing to hold a hearing on his complaints of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to the assistance of counsel. The right to counsel is fundamental and applies with equal force to all persons, regardless of their ability to compensate an attorney. <em>State v. Enright </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 225, 228, 758 P.2d 779, 781 (citing <em>Gideon v. Wainwright </em>(1963), 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799). The assistance must be effective in order to give true meaning to that right and to the right to a fair trial. <em>See Enright, </em>758 P.2d at 781 (citing <em>State v. McElveen </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 500, 503, 544 P.2d 820, 821-22).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">A defendant is entitled to a hearing on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel where the defendant presents a \u201cseemingly substantial complaint\u201d about effective assistance. If the defendant presents a \u201cseemingly substantial complaint\u201d the court should hold a hearing on the request for substitution of counsel. <em>Kills On Top v. State </em>(1996), [279 Mont. 384], 928 P.2d 182, 190; <em>State v. Weaver </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 505, 511, 917 P.2d 437, 441; <em>State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 143, 915 P.2d 208, 218; <em>Morrison, </em>848 P.2d at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">We have held that the threshold issue in determining whether a \u201csubstantial complaint\u201d exists is \u201cnot whether counsel was ineffective, but whether the District Court erred in failing to make an adequate inquiry into [a defendant\u2019s] claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Weaver, </em>917 P.2d at 441. In determining if the defendant presented a seemingly substantial complaint about counsel, \u201cit follows that the district court must make an adequate inquiry into the defendant\u2019s complaints.\u201d <em>Finley, </em>915 P.2d at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">In those cases where this Court has found a district court\u2019s inquiry into a defendant\u2019s complaints about counsel adequate, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>court considered the defendant\u2019s factual complaints together with counsel\u2019s specific explanations addressing the complaints. <em>State v. Craig </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 140, 906 P.2d 683; <em>Morrison, </em>848 P.2d 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">In <em>Craig, </em>this Court found that the district court had adequately-inquired into the defendant\u2019s complaints by considering Craig\u2019s complaints together with counsel\u2019s explanation of the attorney-client relationship. Craig\u2019s lack of cooperation with counsel, his failure to allege any facts in support of his motion, and the specific explanation by Craig\u2019s counsel concerning Craig\u2019s allegations supported the district court\u2019s finding that no hearing was warranted on Craig\u2019s effective assistance of counsel complaint. <em>Craig, </em>906 P.2d at 689-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In <em>Morrison, </em>the defendant wrote a letter to the judge four months before trial expressing his concern that counsel had not yet contacted him. <em>Morrison, </em>848 P.2d at 516. The judge contacted counsel and requested that he speak to the defendant. The defendant made no further complaints until sentencing. <em>Morrison, </em>848 P.2d at 516. Upon the defendant\u2019s complaint at the sentencing hearing, the court questioned counsel who recounted to the court specific discussions he had had with the defendant. <em>Morrison, </em>848 P.2d at 516. The substance of the discussion convinced the district court that there had not been a breakdown of communication between attorney and client. Relying on counsel\u2019s comments and the fact that the defendant failed to reiterate his complaints at trial, the district court held that the defendant\u2019s complaints did not warrant a hearing. This Court held that the district court adequately inquired into Morrison\u2019s complaints. <em>Morrison, </em>848 P.2d at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">If a district court fails to address a defendant\u2019s complaints regarding effectiveness of counsel, the court may place a defendant in the untenable position of choosing between proceeding with ineffective counsel or proceeding <em>pro se. </em>\u201cSuch a set of options is in essence no choice at all.\u201d <em>Craig, </em>906 P.2d at 689 (citing <em>Enright, </em>758 P.2d at 782).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">This Court has found reversible error where a district court fails to make an initial inquiry into a defendant\u2019s complaints about counsel. In <em>Enright, </em>this Court held that it was reversible error for the district court to fail to question defendant about her complaints concerning counsel before allowing her to proceed <em>pro se. </em>This error, in effect, deprived Enright of the opportunity to make a meaningful choice to proceed <em>pro se. Enright, </em>758 P.2d at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">In another case, this Court found the lower court record \u201cdevoid of any indication that the court made even a cursory inquiry into [the defendant\u2019s] complaints about his counsel\u2019s representation.\u201d <em>Weaver, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>917 P.2d at 441. The district court had not considered or ruled upon the defendant\u2019s motion to \u201crelieve\u201d counsel; rather the court indicated that Weaver could pursue his allegations through habeas corpus proceedings. <em>Weaver, </em>917 P.2d at 441. We remanded the case so that the district court could make an adequate inquiry into Weaver\u2019s allegations and determine if he had presented substantial complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Finally, in <em>Finley, </em>we held that in determining whether Finley presented substantial complaints about the effectiveness of his counsel, the district court should have inquired into the complaints and made \u201csome sort of a critical analysis at the time the motion was filed.\u201d <em>Finley, </em>915 P.2d at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Finley complained about his counsel in a motion for change of venue, listing several factual reasons to support his allegations. <em>Finley, </em>915 P.2d at 218. The district court denied Finley\u2019s motion without a hearing. After trial, in which Finley was found guilty of burglary and sexual intercourse without consent, Finley wrote a letter to the county attorney\u2019s office alleging that his counsel was ineffective, that counsel refused to discuss terms of an appeal and refused to speak with him at all. <em>Finley, </em>915 P.2d at 212. After the State moved the district court for a hearing on the ineffective assistance claim, the court held a post-trial hearing in which it found that Finley\u2019s counsel had rendered effective assistance. <em>Finley, </em>915 P.2d at 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In a post-conviction petition Finley alleged that the district court erred in failing to conduct a hearing on his complaints of ineffective assistance alleged in his motion to change venue. The State argued that the district court\u2019s duty to grant a hearing on substantial complaints of ineffective assistance of counsel extended only to motions for substitution of counsel. <em>Finley, </em>915 P.2d at 218. It reasoned that because Finley\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion sought a change of venue, not dismissal or substitution of counsel, the court need not consider the necessity of a hearing on the ineffective assistance of counsel complaint. This Court held that \u201c\u2019[t]he legal effect of any court-filed paper \u2014 be it a motion, a pleading or some other instrument \u2014 is to be measured by its content rather than by the author-provided title.\u2019\u201d <em>Finley, </em>915 P.2d at 218 (quoting <em>Hulsey v. Mid-America Preferred Insurance Co. </em>(Okla. 1989), 777 P.2d 932, 936 n.14). We found that the substance of Finley\u2019s motion for change of venue indicated that he was in fact complaining about the assistance of counsel. Because the substance of the motion was a complaint of ineffective assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>of counsel it was necessary that the district court inquire into the validity of his complaints. <em>Finley, </em>915 P.2d at 218. We held that the district court failed to make an initial determination of whether Finley presented substantial complaints and, therefore, that the court erred. <em>Finley, </em>915 P.2d at 219. The error was held to be harmless because the district court conducted a post-trial hearing on Finley\u2019s complaints regarding his counsel\u2019s representation. <em>Finley, </em>915 P.2d at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Smith, like Finley, did not denominate his motion a \u201cRequest for Substitution of Counsel.\u201d However, as we said in <em>Finley, </em>a court-filed paper should be measured by its content rather than by its title. <em>Finley, </em>915 P.2d at 218. Likewise, Smith\u2019s motion for a continuance should be considered for its content rather than for its form. In this case, Smith asked for a continuance for the express purpose of finding new counsel because his present counsel was not familiar with the case. This request must be viewed as a complaint of ineffective assistance of counsel which requires an adequate inquiry by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The transcript reveals that Smith made more than conclusory allegations regarding his dissatisfaction with counsel. The court, however, cut him off without any inquiry into the allegations and gave him a choice between keeping his second court-appointed counsel and representing himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Smith expressed his concerns immediately after the judge made his opening remarks to the jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">THE DEFENDANT:... I still feel Mr. English does not represent my best interests, nor do I believe I am ready to defend myself. ... I tried to contact several attorneys yesterday, ... I would like to ... ask for a continuance so that I might find counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">THE COURT: Mr. Smith, your request for a continuance is denied.... You do not get a choice of an attorney, unless you choose to retain one yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">THE DEFENDANT: That is what I would like to do.... [W]e had a falling out yesterday. He calls me the day before the trial and is going to start to prepare for it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">After opening statements Smith again complained about counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">THE DEFENDANT:... From his opening statements I can see that I know more about this than he does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">MR. ENGLISH: Your Honor, may the record reflect I have consulted with Mr. Smith on two prior occasions. ... I have ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>quately prepared for this case. I\u2019m prepared for trial. Mr. Smith might have a difference of opinion as to what this case should be about and how it should be handled, but as his attorney, I\u2019m going to handle it the way I see fit. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">THE COURT: [After again giving Smith the choice of having English represent him or having English serve as stand-by counsel and Smith represent himself:]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">Those are your two choices. How would you like to proceed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">THE DEFENDANT: By the opening statement he said I refused\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">THE COURT: Mr. Smith, I don\u2019t want to get into the opening statement. Do you want Mr. English to represent you in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">THE DEFENDANT: As I stated, I do not want him to represent me. I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m capable representing myself. I do know more about this than he does. If he watched the movie he would know that I didn\u2019t refuse. He is saying the same thing she said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">THE COURT: Do you chose to represent yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">THE DEFENDANT: No, Your Honor. I would like to request a continuance so I may get a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">Contrary to the State\u2019s claim that \u201c[d] efendant was afforded several opportunities to discuss his complaints about Mr. English with the district court,\u201d the transcript reveals that the court did not allow Smith to substantiate his allegations that counsel was ill-prepared for the trial. Although counsel apparently convinced the court that he was not rendering ineffective assistance of counsel, the court did not allow Smith to elaborate on his complaints nor did it inquire into Smith\u2019s factual complaints regarding counsel\u2019s lack of knowledge of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">In prior decisions in which we held that an attorney's response to a defendant\u2019s complaints about counsel satisfied the court\u2019s inquiry, the attorney recited specific facts addressing the complaints revealing that there was adequate communication between the \u00e1ttomey and the defendant and that the attorney otherwise was effectively representing the defendant. Here, the court did not allow Smith to express his specific complaints and counsel\u2019s assurances that he was prepared were not adequate to rebut Smith\u2019s complaint that counsel was not familiar with the case and had not even watched the videotaped interview conducted by the police. Absent an initial inquiry into the complaints the court could not have determined whether Smith\u2019s complaints were \u201csubstantial\u201d enough to warrant a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">We hold that the District Court failed to adequately inquire into Smith\u2019s complaints about ineffective assistance of counsel and thereby foreclosed Smith\u2019s opportunity for a hearing on the matter. It is necessary, therefore, to remand this case to the District Court so that it can make an adequate inquiry into Smith\u2019s allegations and determine whether he had substantial complaints. If the court determines that Smith had substantial complaints, the court will proceed accordingly and conduct a hearing to determine the validity of Smith\u2019s complaints. If the court ultimately finds that Smith was denied effective assistance of counsel, the judgments and sentences against him are vacated, including the impositions of fines and costs, and a new trial is ordered. <em>See Weaver, </em>917 P.2d at 441-42. If, on the other hand, the court determines that Smith has not presented seemingly substantial complaints or, that upon a hearing, he was not denied effective assistance of counsel, then the judgment and conviction are affirmed, subject to Smith\u2019s right to appeal the District Court\u2019s determinations on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In the event the conviction is affirmed, that portion of the sentence imposing costs related to the proceedings in Justice Court is reversed. Section 46-17-311(1), MCA, provides that \u201call cases on appeal from a justices or city court must be tried anew in the district court ....\u201d In other words, an appeal to a district court for a trial <em>de novo </em>begins a new proceeding against the defendant. In appeals to the District Court, only costs in connection with the District Court proceeding may be imposed as part of a sentence. Section 46-18-201(l)(b), MCA; \u00a7 46-18-232, MCA. We hold that the costs associated with the Justice Court proceedings were not costs incurred in connection with the District Court proceedings against Smith and therefore, the imposition of such costs was an improper exercise of the District Court\u2019s sentencing authority which must be reversed in the event the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b161-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, TRIEWEILER and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
