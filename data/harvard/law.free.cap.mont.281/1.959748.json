Subsequently, Michael moved the court for a modification of child sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>port, and Kimberly moved the court for a modification of both child support and the parties\u2019 child custody arrangement. Michael appeals the District Court\u2019s disposition of the parties\u2019 respective motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">The following issues are presented for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">1. Did the District Court err in awarding Kimberly day care expenses incurred as an incident to her status as a student?</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">2. Did the District Court err in its defacto denial of Michael\u2019s motion for modification of child support?</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">3. Did the District Court err in granting Kimberly\u2019s motion for modification of child support?</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">4. Did the District Court err in failing to award Michael the exclusive right to claim the children as his dependents for federal and state income tax purposes?</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">5. Did the District Court err in its excessive modification of the custodial plan?</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">Kimberly and Michael were married in Minnesota in 1983. The couple have three children: Rebecca, born March 30, 1984; Kaydee, born May 11, 1986; and Amy, bom March 19, 1988. The Syverson family made Lewistown, Montana its home.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-13\">In 1992, Kimberly and Michael sought a dissolution of their marriage, and on July 24, 1992, the parties executed a \u201cProperty Settlement and Custody Agreement\u201d (Agreement). In relevant part, the Agreement provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children, and that they would divide as equally as possible the actual physical custody of the children; the Agreement provided that Michael would have physical custody of the children for a total of 160 days out of the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-14\">The Agreement also provided that Michael would be responsible for monthly child support payments of $475, but that, in light of Michael\u2019s anticipated job change, the parties\u2019 child support obligations could be reviewed upon the request of either party. In addition, the Agreement provided that Michael would be responsible for a share of the children\u2019s day care costs. The Agreement defined \u201cdaycare\u201d as \u201cthose child care costs incurred for the control and supervision of the child during the parent\u2019s hours of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-15\">Finally, the Agreement provided that each party would claim one child as a dependent for tax purposes, and that the parties would alternate annually claiming the third child as a dependent. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>adopted and incorporated the Agreement in its decree of dissolution dated July 28, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">At the time the marriage was dissolved, Michael was employed in the construction business, earning about $30,000 per year. Kimberly was a secretary for the local school district and earned almost $ 18,000 per year. Afew months after the marriage was dissolved, in February 1993, Michael, as was anticipated, changed employment. His income from his new employment with the Montana State Highway Department was $22,692 per year, which he supplemented by undertaking various construction jobs. On May 3, 1993, Michael filed \u201cAmended Motions\u201d for modification of child support, requesting that his child support payment obligation be lowered in accordance with his decreased salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">On August 10,1993, Kimberly filed a counter-motion for modification of visitation and child support, based on her intention of moving to Billings, Montana to attend school. Kimberly quit her secretarial position and on August 15, 1993, moved with the three children to Billings where she enrolled at Eastern Montana College as a full-time student. To manage her daily living expenses, and to pay for her tuition, Kimberly obtained student loans, federal tuition grants, subsidized housing, and other public assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">On November 18, 1993, the court heard the parties\u2019 pending motions. Counsel for Michael and Kimberly were present at the hearing, as was Ann Hefenieder, on behalf of the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services, Child Support Enforcement Division (Ms. Hefenieder became involved in the proceedings once Kimberly began receiving public assistance monies.) On November 29, 1993, Ms. Hefenieder filed a proposed child support calculation, which recommended that Michael\u2019s child support obligation be calculated at $183.41 per month, per child. Ms. Hefenieder calculated her child support obligation figures in part by imputing no income to Kimberly and by allowing Michael \u201cfour exemptions:\u201d himself and the three children as dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">On November 30, the court issued its partial findings of fact, conclusions of law and order, by which it set out a visitation schedule that provided Michael with 75 days of physical custody of the children, required Michael to continue paying his present share of child care costs while Kimberly was in school, and continued Michael\u2019s child support obligation previously established by the decree of dissolution. On December 15, 1993, the court issued its supplemental findings of fact, conclusions and order, setting Michael\u2019s child support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>obligation at $550.25 per month, based in part on Ms. Hefenieder\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">On February 8,1994, Michael filed a document entitled \u201cMotions,\u201d by which he requested the court to vacate and reconsider its partial findings of fact, conclusions of law and order, and its supplemental findings of fact, conclusions and order. In that document, Michael requested that he be allowed to claim all three children as dependents, and also offered essentially the same arguments on the same issues as we have been asked to review here. On March 25,1994, the District Court denied Michael\u2019s \u201cMotions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">On April 11,1994, Michael filed with this Court his notice of appeal of the District Court\u2019s partial findings of fact, conclusions of law and order, the court\u2019s supplemental findings of fact, conclusions and order, and the court\u2019s March 25,1994 order. On October 14,1994, we ordered that the case be remanded to the District Court for a hearing to determine if a case that this Court decided after the District Court\u2019s disposition of the matter, <em>In re the Marriage of Johnson </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 158, 879 P.2d 689, had any bearing on the court\u2019s modification of custody. The District Court held a hearing in accordance with our order, and on December 15,1995, issued its \u201cOrder and Memorandum on Remand Regarding <em>Johnson </em>Decision\u201d, concluding that <em>Johnson </em>did not apply to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Presently, the parties and Ms. Hefenieder have stipulated to the five issues presented by Michael for our review. The parties have farther stipulated that Ms. Hefenieder, on behalf of the Montana State Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services, Child Support Enforcement Division, shall address and brief issues one, two, and three, and that Kimberly shall address and brief issues four and five. The question of the applicability of <em>Johnson </em>is relevant to Issue Five and will be discussed in that portion of this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Did the District Court err in awarding Kimberly daycare expenses incurred as an incident to her status as a student?</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">In both its partial and supplemental findings and conclusions, the court ordered that Michael pay 65% of the daycare costs Kimberly incurs while she is in school. This is the same percentage of daycare that Michael initially agreed to pay pursuant to the Agreement. However, Michael argues that the court was in error because the Agreement provided that he only pay \u201cthose child care costs incurred for the control and supervision of the child during the custodial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>parent\u2019s hours of employment.\u201d Michael contends that because Kimberly, the custodial parent, is an unemployed student, the care of the children while she maintains that status is not \u201cdaycare\u201d as defined in the Agreement. Therefore, Michael argues, he is relieved of his daycare obligation so long as Kimberly is unemployed. Michael asserts that the court committed reversible error in requiring him to pay for daycare in spite of this provision in the Agreement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">The responsibility for child care costs is an important part of a parent\u2019s child support obligation. <em>See In re the Marriage of Noel </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 249, 875 P.2d 358. Our standard of review of a ruling establishing or modifying a child support obligation is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Noel, </em>875 P.2d at 359 (reviewing a ruling establishing a child support obligation); <em>In re the Marriage of Kovash </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 517, 521, 893 P.2d 860, 862-63 (reviewing an \u201coverall decision\u201d modifying a child support obligation). We must determine whether the court abused its discretion in requiring Michael to continue to pay a portion of the child care costs incurred while Kimberly is unemployed and in school.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Michael first argues that the Agreement signed by the parties only creates an obligation for child care costs incurred while the custodial parent is <em>employed. </em>However, it is well established in Montana that where the interests of minor children are concerned, a district court is not bound by an agreement reached by the parties pursuant to a dissolution proceeding. Section 40-4-201(2), MCA; <em>see also In re the Marriage of Carlson </em>(1984), 214 Mont. 209, 217, 693 P.2d 496, 500. That in this context the District Court\u2019s ruling was in any way inconsistent with the Agreement does not alone require us to find the court in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">However, Michael also argues that the definition of \u201cdaycare\u201d in the Agreement conforms to \u00a7 46.30.1525(l)(a), ARM (Child Support Guidelines), which allows child care costs to be considered in calculating a child support obligation when a custodial parent \u201cmust incur child care expenses for [the] child as a prerequisite to employment.\u201d Michael contends that the language of this rule prohibits the court from ordering him to pay a portion of the child care costs while Kimberly is an unemployed student. Michael\u2019s contention, strictly interpreting the language of the rule and the purpose of the Child Support Guidelines, misses the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">We have held that \u201ca district court must apply its discretion [in establishing a child support obligation] in a realistic manner, taking into account the actual situation of the parties.\u201d <em>Noel, </em>875 P.2d at 359 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>(citation omitted). Our review reveals that the court\u2019s ruling here addressed the reality of Michael\u2019s and Kimberly\u2019s respective situations. Michael is employed and earning income while Kimberly is attending school, attempting to obtain a degree. Kimberly claims that her school attendance is sparked by a desire to eventually improve her financial position. We recognize a parent\u2019s right to attempt to improve her financial position, even if doing so results in a temporary decrease in present income. <em>See In re the Marriage of Rome </em>(1981), 190 Mont. 495, 621 P.2d 1090. We note that the Child Support Guidelines are in accord in this respect, preventing, when calculating child support obligations, the imputation of income to a parent \u201cengaged in a plan of economic self-improvement, including but not limited to education and retraining, which will result, in a reasonable time, in an economic benefit to the children for whom the support obligation is being determined.\u201d Section 46.30.1513(2)(d)(iii), ARM.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Kimberly\u2019s studies require her to incur child care expenses. The court heard testimony concerning the amount of these expenses. The record clearly establishes the parties\u2019 respective financial situations. The District Court specifically found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-5\">though under the Uniform Child Support Guidelines, [Michael] would be required to pay 100% of the daycare costs in addition to his child support, such an order would be inequitable. Based upon the evidence and the facts and circumstances of this particular case, the Court orders that daycare costs be apportioned 65% to [Michael] and 35% to [Kimberly].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The District Court\u2019s apportionment of the parties\u2019 respective responsibilities for child care costs demonstrates the \u201cemployment of conscientious judgment.\u201d <em>See In re the Marriage of Goodman </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 446, 448, 723 P.2d 219, 220 (defining test of abuse of discretion). The District Court did not abuse its discretion in ordering Michael to continue paying a portion of the child care costs incurred while Kimberly is unemployed and attends school.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Did the District Court err in its defacto denial of Michael\u2019s motion for modification of child support?</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">Michael argues that the Agreement plainly provides that his change in employment triggers a modification of his child support obligation, upon his request. Michael contends that because the court did not modify his child support obligation as he recommended in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u201cMotions\u201d document, and as mandated by the Agreement, the court abused its discretion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">The provision in the Agreement to which Michael refers states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-5\">It is anticipated that [Michael] shall be changing employment in the foreseeable future; and that, upon such event and effective thereon, the child support obligations of the parties hereto shall be reviewed upon request of either party hereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The language here plainly requires only a review of the parties\u2019 child support obligations, not a particular modification of those obligations. In any event, we reiterate this Court\u2019s position that, with respect to matters concerning minor children, district courts are not bound by agreements reached by the parties. <em>Carlson, </em>693 P.2d at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">At the hearing on Michael\u2019s and Kimberly\u2019s respective motions, the court heard testimony concerning Michael\u2019s employment change and decreased salary, as well as testimony concerning Kimberly\u2019s school attendance and receipt of public assistance monies. Prior to issuing its supplemental findings and conclusions, the court received Ms. Hefenieder\u2019s recommendations regarding child support. The court reviewed all of this information and then ruled that Michael\u2019s monthly child support obligation be increased by about $100. That Michael may have initially assumed, reasonably or not, that the court would eventually modify his child support obligation so that he would be responsible for a lesser monthly amount is not a ground for reversal here; in ruling as it did, the court considered all of the information before it, including Michael\u2019s change of circumstances, as well as Kimberly\u2019s change of circumstances and Ms. Hefenieder\u2019s recommendations. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">Did the District Court err in granting Kimberly\u2019s motion for modification of child support?</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">As to this issue, Michael presents two basic arguments. First, Michael argues that the court had no jurisdiction over Kimberly\u2019s motion for modification of child support. This argument is premised on Michael\u2019s contention that the District Court should have granted his motion for modification of child support. We have already affirmed the court\u2019s disposition of Michael\u2019s motion. We need not further address this first argument raised by Michael.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">Alternatively, Michael argues that even if the court properly denied his motion and granted Kimberly\u2019s motion, it nevertheless erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>in its income calculations. Specifically, Michael contends that the cotut erroneously imputed no income to Kimberly, and erroneously attributed to him income from his construction \u201cside jobs.\u201d In addition, Michael contends that these errors constituted variances from the Child Support Guidelines, and that the court further erred in failing to state its reasons for the variances.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">At the outset, we must state our disagreement with Michael\u2019s argument that the court\u2019s allegedly erroneous income calculations were variances from the Child Support Guidelines, and that the court therefore had a duty to state its reasons for the variances. Our review of the record establishes that the income calculations here were made pursuant to the guidelines; the particular decisions the court made in its calculations, to include some income but exclude other income and to impute income to one party but not another, were made within the confines of the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Michael notes that Kimberly, as a student, receives various types of financial aid. While Michael concedes that most of this aid is in the form of loans, must be repaid, and thus cannot be considered income, he does argue that one financial aid payment, a Pell Grant, need not be repaid by Kimberly and thus must be considered income. Each semester, $958 of the $975 Pell Grant Kimberly received was used to pay tuition at Eastern Montana College; $17 remained each semester for Kimberly\u2019s personal use. Section 46.30.1513(2)(e), ARM, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">Although income is not imputed under subsection (2)(d), actual income, including grants, scholarships, third party contributions or other money <em>intended to subsidize the parent\u2019s living expenses </em>and which are not required to be repaid at some later date, should be included in gross income. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">According to this rule, the $17 that remained each semester for Kimberly\u2019s personal use should have been included as income. Ms. Hefenieder did not include this amount as income in her child support calculations, but this mistake, and the court\u2019s subsequent adoption of it, does not amount to reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">Michael also argues that Kimberly does not fall within the \u201cprotection\u201d of \u00a7 46.30.1513(2)(d)(iii), ARM, which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\">(d) Income should not be imputed if any of the following conditions exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-10\">(iii) the parent is engaged in a plan of economic self-improvement, including but not limited to education and retraining which will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>result, within a reasonable time, in an economic benefit to the children for whom the support obligation is being determined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av\">Michael contends that this rule cannot apply to Kimberly because she has no \u201cplanned course of study,\u201d failed to \u201cpresent evidence as to the job opportunities that she would gain through this education,\u201d and because she failed to \u201cpresent evidence as to what the entry level income would be for those job opportunities.\u201d Michael claims that Kimberly has \u201ccompletely failed to meet her burden of proof.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Kimberly sought to continue her education, education being one of a number of possible examples of a \u201cplan of self-improvement.\u201d Section 46.30.1513(2)(d)(iii), ARM. We do notread this rule as requiring a parent to present a blueprint of her intended career and earnings in order to \u201cmeet her burden of proof.\u201d Moreover, while the district courts must adhere to the applicable rules within the Child Support Guidelines, \u00a7 40-4-204(3)(a), MCA, the degree of discretion afforded district courts in family law matters is well established in Montana. <em>See In re the Marriage of Dishon </em>(1996), [277 Mont. 501], 922 P.2d 1186 (court\u2019s exercise of discretion in light of its duty to adhere to the Child Support Guidelines). The record shows that Kimberly, a freshman at the time of the proceedings, was considering a career in either education or social work. The District Court found that Kimberly entered school \u201cnot to avoid payment of child support, but rather to better herself economically which will benefit both her and the children in the future.\u201d The court also found that \u201c[i]t would not be equitable to impute income for the benefit of the children when the income does not exist.\u201d We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that Rule 46.30.1513(2)(d)(iii), ARM, applied to Kimberly, and in accordance with that rule did not impute income to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Michael also argues that the court erred in attributing to him income from his periodic construction side jobs. In addition to his salary from his employment with the Department of Highways, Michael received income from various side jobs he undertook \u201cout of financial necessity.\u201d Michael contends, citing \u00a7 46.30.1515(3)(a), ARM, that because these side jobs \u201cwere not accomplished over \u2018a period sufficient to accurately reflect the parent\u2019s earning ability,\u2019 \u201d the income received from these jobs should not have been considered in the child support calculations. Michael\u2019s contention is based on a misinterpretation of the rule; rather than arguing whether the court should or should not have averaged or projected his side job income, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Michael simply argues that his side job income should not have been included as gross income. The cited rule states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\">(3) To the extent possible, gross income and expenses should be annualized to avoid the possibility of skewed application of the guidelines based on temporary or seasonal conditions. Income and expenses may be annualized using one of the two following methods:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">(a) seasonal employment or fluctuating income should be averaged over a period sufficient to accurately reflect the parent\u2019s earning ability. However, income should not be averaged if a reduction is due to circumstances beyond a parent\u2019s control such as a plant closure; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">(b) current income or expenses may be projected when a recent increase or decrease in income is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. For example, when a student graduates and obtains permanent employment, income should be projected at the new wage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Section 46.30.1515(3), ARM. We briefly discussed this rule in <em>In re Pedersen </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 284, 862 P.2d 411, where we upheld a district court\u2019s determination of gross income, a determination reached by averaging the party\u2019s income over the prior two years. We stated that \u201c\u00a7 46.30.1515(3), ARM, expressly allows fluctuating income to be annualized by averaging it over a period sufficient to accurately reflect earning ability.\u201d <em>Pedersen, </em>862 P.2d at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The court here did not average Michael\u2019s income, because it was not prompted to do so. The financial information provided here established that Michael\u2019s Department of Highways salary was about $23,000, and that he received approximately $2,500 more from his side jobs. The calculations which the court adopted did not average Michael\u2019s side job income; rather, the calculations merely included as gross income the actual amounts that Michael stated that he had received. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46.30.1508, ARM. The court properly calculated the child support obligations based on the information before it. <em>Platt v. Platt </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 38,41, 881 P.2d 634, 636. Michael\u2019s argument misses the mark. The court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">Did the District Court err in failing to award Michael the exclusive right to claim the children as his dependents for federal and state income tax purposes?</p>\n<p id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The Agreement provides that Michael and Kimberly each claim one child as a dependent for tax purposes, and that the parties alternate on an annual basis claiming the third child as a dependent. However, Ms. Hefenieder, in calculating her child support recommendations in light of the parties\u2019 changed circumstances, assumed that Michael would be allowed to claim all three children as dependents, at least while Kimberly retained her unemployed student status. The court fully adopted Ms. Hefenieder\u2019s recommendations in ruling on the motions for modification before it. Later, Michael filed a motion in which he specifically requested that he be allowed to claim all three children as dependents. This motion, and all other post-hearing motions Michael filed, were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Michael argues that the court abused its discretion because although on the one hand it accepted Ms. Hefenieder\u2019s child support calculations, which were based in part on imputing no income to Kimberly and allowing Michael to claim the children as dependents, the court on the other hand later refused Michael\u2019s request to claim the children as dependents. In her brief submitted to us, Kimberly stipulates that Michael be allowed to claim the children as dependents while she attends school. As the District Court\u2019s denial of Michael\u2019s request to claim the children as dependents was cursory and without explanation, and as Kimberly and Ms. Hefenieder in fact agree with Michael as to this issue, we must reverse and remand this issue to the District Court so that the court may revise its order to allow Michael to claim the children as dependents while Kimberly attends school.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">ISSUE FIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Did the District Court err in its excessive modification of the custodial plan?</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Our resolution of this issue requires us to conduct two inquiries. First, we must review the District Court\u2019s determination, pursuant to our order of October 14, 1994, that the <em>Johnson </em>decision does not apply to or affect the instant case. Second, based on our conclusion as to the first inquiry, we must review the court\u2019s modification of the custodial plan, where the court reduced from 160 to 75 the number of days per year that Michael would have physical custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The court\u2019s conclusion that <em>Johnson </em>is inapplicable to and does not affect this case is a conclusion of law. The standard of review of a district court\u2019s conclusion of law is whether the court\u2019s interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>of the law is correct. <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 898 P.2d 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">By order dated October 14, 1994, we remanded this case to the District Court for a determination of whether the <em>Johnson </em>decision applies to this case. In <em>Johnson, </em>the custodial arrangement as established by the dissolution decree provided for joint custody, but awarded Jerome physical custody of the children and provided Barbara with the right of reasonable visitation. Following the dissolution of the marriage, Barbara moved from the family\u2019s hometown of Roy to Billings in order to attend college. Dining this time, the children resided, on a yearly basis, with Jerome for nine months and with Barbara for the remaining three summer months. Barbara did not complete college, but moved to Lewistown where she became a manager of a fast food restaurant. Barbara then moved the court to modify the custody arrangement, awarding her physical custody of the children and granting Jerome visitation rights. The court granted Barbara\u2019s motion. The issue in <em>Johnson </em>pertinent to our discussion here was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-5\">When a party to a former dissolution proceeding moves to amend the decree in a way that substantially changes the residential living arrangements of the former couple\u2019s children without seeking a change in the legal designation of \u201cjoint custody,\u201d is the District Court\u2019s decision governed by the \u201cbest interest\u201d standard found at \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA, or by the \u201cserious endangerment\u201d standard found at \u00a7 40-4-219(l)(c), MCA?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-6\"><em>Johnson, </em>879 P.2d at 691. After reviewing some of our prior decisions concerning custody modification, decisions which we characterized as \u201cnot necessarily consistent with the statutory scheme for modification, nor with each other,\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>879 P.2d at 692, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">Considering our statutory scheme for modification of custody arrangements, and the rationale for requiring a substantial showing before altering the living arrangements to which a child has become accustomed, and out of concern that the applicable standard for granting a motion to modify custody arrangements is not clear from our prior decisions, we adopt the following standard:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB\">Motions or petitions to modify a sole custody provision or terminate a joint custody provision must satisfy the jurisdictional prerequisites set forth in \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA. Likewise, a motion or petition to modify child custody provisions in a dissolution decree which have the effect of substantially changing the primary resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>dence of the parties\u2019 children, even though the formal designation of \u201cjoint custody\u201d is retained, are to be construed as motions or petitions to terminate joint custody and must satisfy the jurisdictional requirements set forth in \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA. Any effort to modify the physical custody arrangements in a decree which provided for joint custody, which does not seek a substantial change in the children\u2019s primary residence, may be considered by the district court according to the best interest standard set forth in \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-4\">We conclude that this approach is most consistent with the plain terms of Montana\u2019s Marriage and Divorce Act and is most likely to provide for the continuity and stability of children\u2019s living arrangements that the Legislature obviously determined to be important when it adopted that Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>879 P.2d at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">On remand, the District Court here concluded that <em>Johnson </em>did not apply to or affect the instant case. The court reasoned that <em>Johnson </em>could not apply where, as here, circumstances demanded that the existing custodial arrangement be reviewed and ultimately modified. The court noted that the existing custody arrangement provided for the children to reside with Kimberly for three weeks per month, and to reside with Michael for the remaining week in the month. At the time of the divorce decree, both Kimberly and Michael lived in Lewistown. Later, Kimberly moved to Billings to go to school; maintaining the same custody arrangement during the school year would require the children to attend a school in Billings for three weeks out of a month, and to attend a school in Lewistown for one week out of a month. The court impliedly concluded that common sense, if nothing else, required that modification under circumstances such as these be reviewed under the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d criteria, \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA; introducing \u00a7 -219\u2019s jurisdictional hurdle could lead to some unjust, if not absurd results. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\"><em>Johnson </em>clearly was referring to the transfer of physical custody from the primary custodian to the secondary custodian. <em>Johnson </em>is not applicable to a case where, due to change in circumstances of the joint custodians no longer living in the same community, the physical custody time allocation must, of necessity, be modified. In <em>Johnson </em>there was no such legal necessity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">We appreciate the District Court\u2019s concern that the application of <em>Johnson </em>to this case, to the extent that <em>Johnson </em>would require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, to govern the modification question, could lead to an unjust result; if none of the jurisdictional prerequisites of \u00a7 -219 can first be met, the court cannot reach the \u201cbest interest\u201d test and would be unable to modify a custody and visitation arrangement that clearly needs to be modified. Moreover, this is clearly a situation in which the best interests of the children should govern the modification. Finally, it is not modification that the parties dispute; in fact, both parties concede the need to modify the existing arrangement. Rather, it is the particular terms of the modification that the parties dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">However, <em>Johnson </em>does apply to this case, as <em>Johnson </em>would apply to any custody modification case; the <em>Johnson </em>decision clarifies this Court\u2019s variable approach to child custody cases, where the proper approach depends on the circumstances of the particular case. <em>Johnson </em>was intended to and does have blanket applicability, as our Opinion in that case contains complete coverage and analysis of the custody modification statutes. <em>Johnson </em>dictates that under circumstances like those found in this case, where modification would have the effect of substantially changing the children\u2019s primary residence, the court must first meet the jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 -219. However, <em>Johnson </em>is not the cause of the District Court\u2019s quandary. Rather, it is an inadequacy in \u00a7 -219 which has created confusion and frustration.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Under \u00a7 -219, a court may proceed to modify a custody decree according to the best interests of the child if it finds that \u201ca change has occurred in the circumstances of the child or the child\u2019s custodian,\u201d and if it further finds that the custodial parent has moved or intends to move with the child <em>to another state. </em>Section 40-4-219(l)(f), MCA (emphasis added). Section 219 does not expressly allow modification if the custodial parent and the child move <em>within the state of Montana, </em>nor does the statute expressly allow modification if the custodial parent and child move <em>to another country. </em>According to \u00a7 -219, if the custodial parent and the child move from Wibaux, MT, to Beach, ND, a distance of less than 50 miles, the court may modify the custody arrangement. If, however, the custodial parent and the child move from Wibaux, MT, to Libby, MT, a distance of nearly 500 miles, the court may not modify the custody arrangement. In addition, if the custodial parent and the child move from Wibaux, MT, to Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, the court may not modify the custody arrangement, as \u00a7 -219 does not provide for such a contingency. Clearly, \u00a7 -219 is inadequate. Under certain circumstances, a move within Montana\u2019s borders may well be more disruptive to the effectiveness of a custody decree than a move outside of Montana\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>borders. As well, a move outside of Montana\u2019s borders to another country would likely be more disruptive than a move outside of Montana\u2019s borders to another state.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">It is inconceivable to us that the application of \u00a7 -219 was ever intended to cause such absurd results as illustrated both in our hypothetical and in the case before us. While courts should in general interpret and apply statutes as they are written, they also have a duty to look beyond the language of a statute if literal application would lead to an absurd result. <em>In re Unit Portions of Delaware, Inc. </em>(Bkrtcy.E.D.N.Y. 1985), 53 B.R. 83, 84. \u201cCourts will not foolishly bind themselves to the plain language of a statute where doing so would \u2018compel an odd result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hughey v.

Therefore, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>avoid an absurd result in this case, and to prevent absurd results in other, similar cases, we establish the following rule:</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Our decision in <em>Johnson </em>remains fully applicable in custody modification cases; if a request for modification of a joint custody decree would have the effect of substantially changing the primary residence of the parties\u2019 children, the court, before engaging in modification, must first find that the requirements of \u00a7 -219 have been met. If the court finds that (1) <em>\u201ca </em>change has occurred in the circumstances of the child or the child\u2019s custodian,\u201d \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA, and (2) further finds that the custodial parent and the child or children have moved or are going to move from one location to a different location (whether inside or outside of Montana\u2019s boundaries), and that this move will hinder the effectiveness of the existing custody arrangement, then (3) \u00a7 -219\u2019s jurisdictional requirements shall be deemed to have been met, and the court may proceed to modify the custody arrangement according to the \u201cbest interest\u201d criteria set out in \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Applying the foregoing analysis to this case, we conclude that <em>Johnson </em>dictates that the requirements of \u00a7 -219 must be met; a modification that reflects both Kimberly\u2019s move with the children from Lewistown to Billings and an 85-day decrease in Michael\u2019s custody and visitation of the children certainly amounts to a \u201csubstantial change.\u201d We further conclude that \u00a7 -219\u2019s requirements have been met because (1) there has been a change of circumstances which affects the parties and their children, and (2) Kimberly\u2019s move with the children to Billings from Lewistown will hinder the effectiveness of the existing custody arrangement. We must now determine whether the District Court erred in its modification of the custodial arrangement, a modification which Michael characterizes as excessive because his custody of the children was reduced from 160 to 75 days annually. We consider Michael\u2019s characterization within the context of \u00a7 40-4-224(2), MCA, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah\">The allotment of time between the parents must be as equal as possible; however</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">(a) each case shall be determined according to its own practicalities, with the best interest of the child as the primary consideration; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">(b) when allotting time between the parents, the court shall consider the effect of the time allotment on the stability and continuity of the child\u2019s education.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The court employed the \u201cbest interest\u201d test, and made the following findings with respect to the custody modification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-4\">4. In August, 1993, [Kimberly] moved with the children to Billings to further her education. [Kimberly] is now a full time student at Eastern Montana College.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\">5. Since moving to Billings, [Michael] has had visitation of the children on the second and fourth weekends of each month. This has worked relatively well except for problems exchanging the children between the parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">6.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">[Michael] shall continue to have visitation on the second and fourth weekends of each month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">8. In addition to weekend visitations, [Michael] and [Kimberly] shall alternate the major holidays as set forth in the Property Settlement Agreement, and [Michael] shall have visitation of the children for the 1993 Thanksgiving break, and [Kimberly] shall have visitation of the children for the first half of the Christmas break, [Michael] to have visitation the second half. Thereafter, holiday vacations shall be alternated between the parties with the travel arrangements as set forth above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">10. Summer visitation by [Michael] shall be during the second week of each month beginning in June, as well as the last full weekend of each month during the summer months of June, July, and August. <em>The Court finds the parties\u2019children are relatively young and all girls, and it is in the best interests of the children that the </em>above visitation schedule be implemented. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">Michael argues in his opening brief that the court\u2019s findings with respect to the \u201cbest interest\u201d factors were insufficient. Michael contends that the court\u2019s \u201cdrastic modification\u201d was premised on only one \u201cbest interest\u201d finding, unsupported by evidence, that \u201cthe parties\u2019 children are relatively young and all girls, and it is in the best interests of the children that the above visitation schedule be implemented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">We review a district court\u2019s findings relating to custody or visitation modification to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re the Marriage of Elser </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 265, 270, 895 P.2d 619, 622 (citation omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds by Porter v. Galarneau, </em>275 Mont. 174, 185, 911 P.2d 1143, 1150 n.2. \u201cFindings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, the court misapprehends the effect of the evidence, or this Court\u2019s review of the record convinces it that a mistake has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>made.\u201d <em>Elser, </em>895 P.2d at 622 (citation omitted). This Court will reverse a court\u2019s decision to modify custody or visitation \u201conly where an abuse of discretion is clearly demonstrated.\u201d <em>Elser, </em>895 P.2d at 622 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">As to Michael\u2019s argument that the court erroneously made only one express finding that its modified visitation schedule was in the children\u2019s best interests, we have stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">[a] 11 the [\u201cbest interest of the child\u201d] statute requires is that the court consider the factors listed. It is not required to make specific findings concerning each element, though it must express \u201cthe essential and determining facts upon which its conclusions rest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AD\"><em>In re the Marriage of Fesolowitz </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 380, 388, 852 P.2d 658, 663 (citation omitted). In <em>Fesolowitz, </em>we held that the court\u2019s finding that the children \u201c \u201chave successfully adapted to shared custody\u2019 and \u201chave prospered by being with each parent a substantial amount of time each month\u2019 \u201d was the \u201cessential and determining fact.\u201d <em>Fesolowitz, </em>852 P.2d at 663. The court here similarly expressed \u201cthe essential and determining facts upon which its conclusions rest [ed],\u201d and therefore met this requirement of the \u201cbest interest\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Contrary to Michael\u2019s contention, the court\u2019s finding that its modification of the custody arrangement was in the children\u2019s best interests was supported by evidence in the record. The court heard testimony concerning, among other things: the parents\u2019 wishes regarding custody and visitation; the interaction between the parents and the girls; and the children\u2019s adjustment in each home. In addition, the paramount concern for both parties at the outset of these proceedings was that, after Kimberly\u2019s move to Billings, the need to maintain the stability of the children\u2019s education rendered the existing custody and visitation arrangement impractical. Michael does not claim that the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, and as our review of the record does not reveal any mistake made by the District Court, we must conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in its modification of the parties\u2019 custody arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b42-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES ERDMANN, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b42-9\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"Aa\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion on issue five.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>In <em>Johnson, </em>we focused on Montana\u2019s public policy, reflected in various legislative enactments, to promote continuity and stability in children\u2019s living arrangements. We determined that the legislature intended \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, to promote that public policy by requiring a substantial showing before significantly altering the living arrangements to which a child has been accustomed. We concluded, on that basis, that \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, is applicable to all situations which have the effect of substantially changing such living arrangements and, consequently, that the statutory jurisdictional requirements must be met before a district court may make such a change. <em>Johnson, </em>879 P.2d at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">As a result of <em>Johnson, </em>this Court has two \u2014 and only two \u2014 alternatives in resolving issue five in the present case. The first is to apply both <em>Johnson </em>and \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, pursuant to their terms. Choosing that alternative would require this Court to reverse the District Court because the plainly stated jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, are not met here \u2014 a fact which the Court concedes. The second available alternative is to create an exception to <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>applicability for circumstances such as those presented here; this alternative would enable us to properly affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Faced with this difficult choice, the Court staunchly refuses to do either. Instead, it determines that \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, is \u201cinadequate\u201d and then proceeds to rewrite it. The Court does so by deleting the language duly enacted by the Montana legislature regarding a move by the custodial parent and the children \u201cto another state\u201d and restating the jurisdictional requirement as a move to \u201ca different location\u201d which, in the view of a district court, \u201cwill hinder the effectiveness of the existing custody arrangement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The Court\u2019s action totally violates our most basic statutory obligation not to omit from a statute what is contained therein. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA. More importantly, the Court\u2019s action violates our most basic constitutional obligation \u2014 set forth in Article III, Section 1, of the 1972 Montana Constitution \u2014 to refrain from exercising power properly belonging to the legislative branch of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Moreover, the present case does not present an issue regarding the proper interpretation of \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, even assuming any judicial interpretation of the plainly stated alternative jurisdictional requirements contained in subsections (l)(a) through (l)(f) were appropriate. We remanded this case to the District Court to determine whether <em>Johnson </em>applies. The District Court determined that <em>Johnson </em>does not apply and this Court properly concludes that that determination was erroneous. As set forth above, that conclusion mandates either a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>reversal of the District Court or the creation by this Court of an exception to <em>Johnson. </em>Absolutely no basis exists for this Court to judicially rewrite a statute because it does not like the result reached in this case by applying its own judicial decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">I agree that applying <em>Johnson </em>here creates a difficult situation. I disagree entirely with the Court\u2019s means of addressing the difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Finally, I submit that the interests of Montana\u2019s children in the stability and continuity of their living arrangements cannot be well served by this Court purporting to make up the statutory law of Montana as it goes along. Indeed, the interests of all Montanans in having the three branches of government take actions appropriate to their constitutional spheres, and in the consistency and stability of the laws of this state, are harmed by the Court\u2019s action today.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">As written, and as the Court agrees, <em>Johnson </em>applies here. Absent a reinterpretation <em>o\u00ed Johnson </em>to address circumstances such as those presented in this case, we must reverse the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b44-7\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b44-8\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AH\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">I agree that \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, needs to be amended by the legislature to account for circumstances where a custodial parent moves within Montana or to another country. The examples set out in the majority opinion demonstrate very well the inadequacies and absurdities of \u00a7 40-4-219(l)(f), MCA, as presently written. Hopefully, the 1997 Legislature will find time, in what already appears to be a busy session, to address this problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">However, I also agree with Justice Gray\u2019s dissent. Having properly concluded that <em>Johnson </em>applies and that, therefore, the jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, must be met, we are not at liberty to simply rewrite the clear and unambiguous provisions of subparagraph (l)(f) by adding language that is not there and by ignoring the language that is there. Interpreting or applying a statute or a case to avoid an absurd result where the language at issue is capable of more than one interpretation or application is one thing; unashamedly rewriting the statute because the application of its clear language produces what we perceive to be an unacceptable result is a dog of a different breed, however. In those cases, if the statute needs to be fixed \u2014 and this one does \u2014 then, constitutionally, it falls to the legislative branch to accomplish that.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">That said, it strikes me that the problem in this case is our preoccupation in trying to affirm the District Court\u2019s elemental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>conclusion that the children are better off with their mother in spite of <em>Johnson </em>and the requirements of \u00a7 40-4-219(l)(f), MCA. I suggest that, perhaps, we are forgetting what prompted our decision in <em>Johnson </em>in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">Our decision in <em>Johnson </em>was grounded in the proposition that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">[A] child\u2019s sense of continuity and stability are equally threatened when that child is uprooted from the only community in which that child has ever resided and relocated in a new household and new school, whether we refer to the change as one of legal custody or merely physical custody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-6\"><em>Johnson, </em>879 P.2d at 693. Here, Kimberly\u2019s move to Billings was what caused the children to be uprooted from the community in which they lived and what caused them to be relocated to a new household and to a new school. Prior to her move, both parents pretty much had equal custody of and access to the children. It was Kimberly\u2019s move that disrupted the existing custody arrangement that everyone agreed was in the children\u2019s best interests, and it was that move that necessitated a different custody arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">If <em>Johnson </em>is applicable, and we all agree that it is, then it seems to me that simply applying the letter and spirit of our decision produces the correct result. Since Kimberly has failed to meet the jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, the children should not be required to move to Billings and to a new community, home and school with their mother, but rather they should be allowed to stay in Lewistown in their accustomed home, community and school with their father. In resolving the case in this fashion, the statute is upheld \u2014 as it is written; the rule in <em>Johnson </em>is not diluted; and the parent that precipitated this problem is forced to come to grips with the reality that she is going to have to make some hard decisions on where her priorities lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Obviously, this is not a perfect resolution for everyone; there rarely is in these sorts of cases. Nonetheless, given the statutory and case law that we are bound to enforce, I believe that it is the legally correct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">I dissent from our decision on Issue Five and would reverse on that issue and remand for further proceedings on the other issues consistent with our decision on the custody issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
