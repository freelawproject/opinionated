This fee is payable to the Clerk of Court. It is the finding of this Court pursuant to 46-18-201(3), Montana Code Annotated, the Court shall reject the elapsed time as credit against the sentence for the following reasons: 1. The Court concludes defendant while on supervised probation did not adequately follow the conditions and rules; therefore followed the recommendations of defendant\u2019s Supervising Officer, Steven K Hurd and counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">On August 23, 1996, the Defendant\u2019s application for review of that sentence was heard by the Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">The Defendant was present and proceeded Pro Se.

The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he did not wish to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the application shall be dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AdG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>DATED this 23rd day of September, 1996.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Done in open Court this 23rd day of August, 1996.</p>\n<judges id=\"b545-5\">Chairman, Hon.
