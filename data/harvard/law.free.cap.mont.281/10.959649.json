Defendant shall be immediately transferred to the Montana Women\u2019s Correctional Center as soon as possible. It is further ordered that all of the applicable terms and conditions of defendant\u2019s sentence which are applicable are reinstated. Payment of restitution shall be a condition of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-17\">On March 7,1996, the Defendant\u2019s application for review of that sentence was heard by the Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-18\">The Defendant was present and proceeded Pro Se. The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-19\">Before hearing the application, the Defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also to increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that she understood this and stated that she wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-20\">Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division provides: \"The sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct, and the sentence will not be reduced or increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\" (Section 45-18-904(3), MCA.) The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is inadequate or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-21\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-22\">Done in open Court this 7th day of March, 1996.</p>\n<judges id=\"b456-24\">Chairman, Hon.
