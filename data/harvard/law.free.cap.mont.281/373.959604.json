We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">Does an Order of Determination only become \u201cfinal\u201d under \u00a7 39-72-612, MCA, once an administrative review has been completed or once the time for seeking review has expired?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In 1993, Epperson, a long-time employee of St. Peter\u2019s Hospital, began working as a nurse in a newly constructed wing of the hospital. Over the next two years, Epperson developed upper respiratory symptoms including, cough, nasal congestion, shortness of breath, and watery eyes. In May of 1995, Epperson\u2019s physician, Dr. Earl Book, released her from work. In June of 1995, Epperson, without an attorney, filed a claim for occupational disease benefits. After receiving Epperson\u2019s claim, the Department of Labor &amp; Industry (the Department), directed Epperson to submit to a medical examination. In September of 1995, Epperson submitted to a medical examination conducted by Dr. Michael Sadaj (Dr. Sadaj) to determine if she suffered from an occupational disease. Although Dr. Sadaj did not find that Epperson had an occupational disease, he recommended further testing. Following this examination, the Department issued an \u201corder referring copy of medical reports to parties\u201d which indicated that Epperson\u2019s occupational disease claim would be denied. This order also notified Epperson of her right to a second examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Epperson did not request a second examination and on November 27,1995, the Employment Relations Division (ERD) issued an \u201corder of determination\u201d which denied her claim. This order also notified Epperson of a right to request a hearing within 20 days and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO2\">Pursuant to 39-72-612, MCA, the parties are hereby notified a party adversely affected by this Order of Determination has twenty (20) days from the date of this Order to request a hearing before the Department of Labor &amp; Industry Legal Division.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">The November 27, 1995, order also explained that failing to request a hearing would make the order final.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Epperson did not request a hearing within 20 days. However, after consulting with counsel, Epperson requested a hearing in January of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>1996. The insurer, Corroon, moved to dismiss this request as untimely and a Department hearing officer agreed and dismissed the case. Epperson appealed this decision to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court which overruled the hearing officer\u2019s decision and remanded the case for a hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">In its holding, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that the hearing officer erred in dismissing Epperson\u2019s claim because the Department\u2019s November, 1995 order was not a \u201cfinal\u201d order of determination within the meaning of \u00a7 39-72-612, MCA. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court explained that a Department order does not become final until after the Commissioner has completed her administrative review or after the time for seeking review expires. The court held that the time for seeking administrative review was 90 days and Epperson had filed her request within that time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">Does an Order of Determination only become \u201cfinal\u201d under \u00a7 39-72-612, MCA, once an administrative review has been completed or once the time for seeking review has expired?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">In reviewing Workers\u2019 Compensation Court decisions, we review the findings of fact to determine if they are supported by substantial, credible evidence and we review conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Turjan v. Valley View Estates </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 386, 390, 901 P.2d 76, 79 (citing <em>Caekaert v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 105, 111, 885 P.2d 495, 498). As this case exclusively deals with a single question of law, we will review the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine if it was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">In this appeal, Corroon contends that Epperson failed to request a hearing within the 20-day limit imposed by \u00a7 39-72-612(1), MCA. Section 39-72-612(1), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">(1) Within 20 days after the department has issued its order of determination as to whether the claimant is entitled to benefits under this chapter, a party may request a hearing. In order to perfect an appeal to the workers\u2019 compensation judge, the appealing party shall request a hearing before the department. The department shall grant a hearing, which may be conducted by telephone or by videoconference. The department\u2019s final determination may not be issued until after the hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">This section establishes the time frame within which to request a hearing. An untimely request for hearing must be dismissed. <em>Cf. First </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>Security Bank of Havre v. Harmon </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 168, 172, 841 P.2d 521, 524 (time limits fixed for appeal are mandatory and jurisdictional and failure to perfect an appeal within the time allowed requires dismissal of the appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\">Epperson sought to avoid the consequences of the above statute by arguing that she should receive the benefit of the more liberal 90-day time frame for requesting a hearing under the Department\u2019s administrative regulations. Section 24.29.215(2), ARM (1987). While recognizing that Epperson had properly read \u00a7 24.29.215(2) ARM (1987), (read in conjunction with \u00a7 24.29.207(6), ARM (1983)) as granting her 90 days to request a hearing, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court rejected this argument noting that this 90-day provision conflicts with the 20-day statutory period for requesting a hearing under \u00a7 39-72-612 MCA. The Department cannot adopt regulations contrary to or conflicting with an express statute, <em>Bick v. Montana Department of Justice </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 455, 457, 730 P.2d 418, 420. Thus, since the administrative grant of a 90-day period within which to request a hearing directly conflicts with the statutory limit of 20 days, the administrative regulation is void as applied to an occupational disease determination. <em>Michels v. Dept. of Social &amp; Rehab. Services </em>(1980), 187 Mont. 173, 177, 609 P.2d 271, 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The court then focused on the provisions of subsection (1) of \u00a7 24.29.215, ARM (1987), which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">(1) A party seeking administrative review under ARM 24.29.206 must make a written request for administrative review to the division [Department] within ninety days of notice of adverse action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Contrary to subsection (2) which pertains to requests for hearings, subsection (1) pertains to requests for administrative review. Requests for administrative review do not conflict with the \u201crequest for hearing\u201d language of \u00a7 39-72-612, MCA, and thus subsection (1), unlike subsection (2), is not void.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court reasoned, as we agree, that the Department\u2019s November 27th order was not an order of determination within the meaning of \u00a7 39-72-612, MCA. This section refers to the Department and \u201cits order of determination.\u201d As the court noted, \u201c[t]he quoted section connotes finality, with a hearing as the next recourse. The order contemplated by the section is the last and final order issued by the Department without hearing, and not some initial or non-final order.\u201d In this case, ERD\u2019s November 27, 1995 Order of Determination was not a final order so long as it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>subject to administrative review without a hearing under subsection (1) of \u00a7 24.29.215, ARM (1987). \u201cAdministrative review\u201d is an informal review of \u201cany division [Department] order\u201d by the Commissioner of Labor or her designee and is governed by \u00a7 24.29.206, ARM (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Under \u00a7 24.29.215(1), ARM (1987), Epperson had 90 days from the November 27, 1995 \u201cadverse action\u201d to request an administrative review. Epperson\u2019s January 30,1996, request was filed 64 days after the ERD\u2019s order, well within that 90-day time period. Epperson\u2019s January 30, 1996, filing was both a request for a hearing and, effectively, a waiver of her right to seek administrative review. With her right to administrative review having been waived, the ERD order became final on January 30, 1996, and her appeal was timely under \u00a7 39-72-612, MCA, since it was filed that same date.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The ERD notice to Epperson of its November 27, 1995 order erroneously stated that a failure to request a hearing within 20 days would make the order final. We hold that under \u00a7 39-72-612, MCA, the 20-day period for requesting a hearing does not commence until the order is \u201cfinal\u201d and that an order is not final until the Commissioner has completed her administrative review or until the time for seeking review expires.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b398-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, NELSON and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
