The defendant shall not be eligible for parole until he completes Phases I and II of the sex offender treatment program.

The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-24\">Before hearing the application, the Defendant was advised that the Sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also to increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AIFp\">DATED this 19th day of March, 1996.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division provides: \"The sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct, and the sentence will not be reduced or increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\" (Section 45-18-904(3), MCA.) The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is inadequate or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Done in open Court this 7th day of March, 1996.</p>\n<judges id=\"b449-9\">Chairman, Hon.
