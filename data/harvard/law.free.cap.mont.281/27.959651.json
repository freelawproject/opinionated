The defendant was discharged from Montana State Prison on November 22,1995, having served, with credit for good time, five (5) years of the original twenty (20) year sentence. A petition to Revoke Suspended Sentence was filed on October 26,1995. Hearings on the Petition were held on November 15,1995 and November 22,1995. Afinal hearing was held on November 29,1995. The defendant admitted and the Court finds that the Defendant has violated the terms of the Sentence and Judgment. Now, therefore, it is hereby ordered, adjudged and decreed, 1. The suspended portion of the Sentence and Judgment dated April 19, 1993, shall be revoked. 2.

Should the defendant become eligible for parole, the defendant shall comply with the terms and conditions as stated in the November 29, 1995 judgment.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AIJz\">DATED this 19th day of March, 1996.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">On March 8,1996, the Defendant\u2019s application for review of that sentence was heard by the Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The Defendant was present and proceeded Pro Se. The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Before hearing the application, the Defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also to increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division provides: \"The sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct, and the sentence will not be reduced or increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\" (Section 45-18-904(3), MCA.) The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is inadequate or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">Done in open Court this 8th day of March, 1996.</p>\n<judges id=\"b474-12\">Chairman, Hon.
