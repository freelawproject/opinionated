The judgment appealed from here, which dismissed the intervenor\u2019s petition on the merits, was entered upon the opinion and report of the same referee after lengthy hearings. The evidence adduced before the referee sustains his finding \u201c that the Soviet decrees of confiscation against the assets of Russian insurance companies were not intended to apply to such assets as were situated outside of Russia and in the United States, but were intended to apply only to' such assets as were situated in Russia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Present \u2014 Martin, P.
