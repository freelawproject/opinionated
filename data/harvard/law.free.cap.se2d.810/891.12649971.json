MIMS\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this appeal, we consider the extent to which a corporate taxpayer must include in its Virginia taxable income royalties paid to an intangible holding company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Background and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Kohl's Department Stores, Inc. (\"Kohl's\") is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware. It operates retail stores throughout the United States, including Virginia. Kohl's Illinois, Inc. (\"Kohl's Illinois\"), a corporation organized under the laws of Nevada, is an affiliate of Kohl's. Kohl's Illinois operates retail stores in select states, none of which are in Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Kohl's Illinois also owns, manages, and licenses certain intellectual property. Kohl's entered into a license agreement with Kohl's Illinois for the use of this intellectual property. Pursuant to this agreement, Kohl's paid $441,942,347 in royalties to Kohl's Illinois during the taxable year that ended on January 31, 2009 and $481,788,205 during the taxable year that ended on January 30, 2010. When calculating its federal taxable income for these years, Kohl's deducted these royalty payments from its income as an ordinary and necessary business expense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20162\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Conversely, Kohl's Illinois included the royalties as income in its taxable income calculations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   However, Kohl's Illinois did not ultimately pay state income taxes on a substantial portion of the royalties. Each state in which\n   Kohl's Illinois filed a return only taxed an apportionable share of its taxable income.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This left a substantial portion of the royalties untaxed, as they were not fairly attributable to Kohl's Illinois's activities in most states. In this capacity, Kohl's Illinois functions as an intangible holding company (\"IHC\"). James A.

Code \u00a7 58.1-400. In 2004, the General Assembly sought to close the IHC loophole by enacting an \"add back\" statute, Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a). Department of Taxation, 2004 Special Session I, Fiscal Impact Statement for HB 5018 (estimating that the add back statute would increase the Commonwealth's tax revenue by $34 million in 2005). Under Code \u00a7 58.1-402(A), corporate taxpayers calculate their Virginia taxable income by starting with their federal taxable income and then making certain adjustments. The add back statute requires corporations to add to their federal taxable income \"the amount of any intangible expenses and costs\" paid to their \"related members to the extent such expenses and costs were ... deducted in computing federal taxable income.\" Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties do not contest that Kohl's royalty payments were \"intangible expenses and costs\" paid to a \"related member.\" However, Kohl's claims that they fall within the \"subject-to-tax\" exception to the add back statute. This exception provides that the \"addition shall not be required for any portion of the intangible expenses and costs if ... [t]he corresponding item of income received by the related member is subject to a tax based on or measured by net income or capital imposed by ... another state.\" Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1). Kohl's Illinois included the royalties as income in each of its state tax returns. This income was then apportioned and taxed by each of these states. The royalties, in Kohl's view, therefore qualify for the subject-to-tax exception, and Kohl's did not add them back when calculating its Virginia taxable income for the taxable year that ended on January 31, 2009. Kohl's\n   further requested a refund for the royalties it mistakenly added back to its taxable income for the taxable year that ended on January 30, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In February 2011, the Virginia Department of Taxation audited Kohl's returns for both of the taxable years at issue. The auditor recognized that Kohl's Illinois paid income tax on a portion of the royalties, through the apportionment process, in many of the Separate Return States. The auditor allowed a \"partial exception\" to the add back statute corresponding to the amount of the royalties that was actually taxed in these states.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Kohl's Illinois did not pay taxes on most of the royalties, and the auditor required that this untaxed portion be added back to Kohl's taxable income. The Department then issued a Notice of Assessment to Kohl's for the taxable year that ended on January 31, 2009 in the amount of $1,165,318.16 in tax plus $120,682.26 in interest. For the taxable year that ended on January 30, 2012, the Department issued a Notice of Assessment in the amount of $681,582.84 in tax plus $29,466.79 in interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Kohl's appealed to the State Tax Commissioner, requesting corrections to both Notices of Assessment. The Commissioner found that the auditor correctly \"reduced the royalty add back exception to the portion of [Kohl's] royalties paid to [Kohl's Illinois] that corresponds to the portion of [Kohl's Illinois's] income subjected to tax in other states.\" Accordingly, the Commissioner upheld the assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Kohl's then filed an \"Application for Correction of Erroneous Assessment and Refund of Corporation Income Taxes\" in the circuit court. Kohl's primarily contended that the royalty payments only needed to be included in Kohl's Illinois's taxable income, regardless of whether they were actually taxed, to fall within the subject-to-tax exception. The Department responded that only the portion of the royalty payments that was actually taxed by other states qualifies for the exception. Kohl's alternatively argued that even if the exception only covers the amount that was actually taxed, the Department's calculation of that amount was incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties submitted a joint stipulation of facts, wherein they agreed that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   it shall not be necessary for Kohl's to put on evidence of the amounts of the [subject-to-tax] exception or the resulting additional [corporate income tax] and interest that\n   follows from [the circuit court's] ruling on the application of [the add back statute]. After [the circuit court's] ruling, the parties will confer and attempt to agree on any additional [corporate income tax] and interest amounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Both parties moved for summary judgment, agreeing \"that the sole issue for the [circuit court] to decide is the extent to which Kohl's is entitled to the [subject-to-tax] exception to the add back statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Kohl's Dep't Stores, Inc. v. Va. Dep't of Taxation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4134543\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-cir/91/499/#p504\">\n    91 Va.

The circuit court issued an opinion denying Kohl's motion for summary judgment and granting the Department's.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 506. It held that \"to fall within the [subject-to-tax] exception, the intangible expenses paid to a related member must not only be subject to a tax in another state, but that tax must actually be imposed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 505. The circuit court's opinion did not address Kohl's alternative argument.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 504-06. We granted Kohl's this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A. Applicability of the Subject-To-Tax Exception\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As in the circuit court, the primary contention between the parties on appeal is the extent to which Kohl's is entitled to the subject-to-tax exception of Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1). The statute provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   B. There shall be added to the extent excluded from federal taxable income:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   8. a. ... [T]he amount of any intangible expenses and costs directly or indirectly paid, accrued, or incurred to, or in connection directly or indirectly with one or more direct or indirect\n   transactions with one or more related members to the extent such expenses and costs were deductible or deducted in computing federal taxable income for Virginia purposes. This addition shall not be required for any portion of the intangible expenses and costs if one of the following applies:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (1) The corresponding item of income received by the related member is subject to a tax based on or measured by net income or capital imposed by Virginia [or] another state....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Kohl's argues that all of the royalties fall within the subject-to-tax exception because they were included in the taxable income of Kohl's Illinois. In its view, if income is included in the computation of a corporation's taxable income in another state, then it is \"subject to a tax based on or measured by net income.\" Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1). The Department responds that while all of the royalties were included in the taxable income of Kohl's Illinois, a substantial portion of these royalties was not attributable to any state in which Kohl's Illinois filed its returns and, as a result, not subject to a tax imposed by another state. In other words, Kohl's argues that the subject-to-tax exception applies on a \"pre-apportionment\" basis, while the Department argues that the subject-to-tax exception applies on a \"post-apportionment\" basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In resolving this dispute, we note that \"[w]hen a [tax] statute, as written, is clear on its face, this Court will look no further than the plain meaning of the statute's words.\"\n   <em>\n    Department of Taxation v.

Notably, the phrase \"subject to a tax\" is not defined by the Code. Seeking to provide a definition, Kohl's points out that the term \"taxable\" is defined as \"subject to taxation.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1688 (10th ed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   2014). From this definition, Kohl's reasons that the royalty payments need only be \"taxable\"-regardless of whether they are actually taxed-to fall within the subject-to-tax exception. But this does not settle the issue, for the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the United States Constitution mandate that only the amount of a corporation's income that is fairly apportionable to a given state is legally subject to that state's income tax.\n   <em>\n    Container Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 463 U.S. at 164,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6192779\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/159/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In fact, both of the parties' positions find support in the statute's language. Because the royalties were included in Kohl's Illinois's taxable income, they were, to a certain extent, \"subject to\" the income taxes of other states. At the same time, a substantial amount of the royalties was not apportioned to, and thereby not legally \"subject to\" the income tax of, any state in which Kohl's Illinois filed a return. Phrased differently, an income tax could only be \"imposed by\" another state on the post-apportioned amounts of the royalties. Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1). This principle is demonstrated in Kohl's 2009 Virginia Income Tax Return, which indicates that less than 4% of Kohl's \"taxable income\" was \"\n   <em>\n    apportioned\n   </em>\n   to Virginia,\" and that only this post-apportioned amount was \"\n   <em>\n    subject to\n   </em>\n   Virginia Tax.\" (S.J.A. 002) (emphases added). Thus, the General Assembly's decision to limit the applicability of the subject-to-tax exception to when the income is \"subject to\" an income tax \"imposed by\" another state suggests\n   that it intended the exception to apply on a post-apportionment basis. Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Therefore, looking only at the plain language of the statute, it is doubtful and uncertain whether the General Assembly intended the subject-to-tax exception to apply on a pre or post apportionment basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Newberry Station Homeowners Ass'n v.

Before the General Assembly passed this statute, the Department estimated in its fiscal impact statement that it would raise the Commonwealth's annual tax revenue, specifically by $34 million in 2005. Department of Taxation, 2004 Special Session I, Fiscal Impact Statement for HB 5018. Yet, accepting Kohl's argument would effectively negate the intended operation and undermine this expected revenue. Under a pre-apportionment interpretation, corporations could avoid application of the add back statute by paying royalties to a related member in a state in which its apportionment factor is insignificant. This would resurrect the loophole that the General Assembly intended to close.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Under these circumstances, we will not destroy the General Assembly's plainly ascertainable intention in the name of strict construction. 3A Sutherland,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 66:1, at 9; Cooley,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 505, at 1125 (\"Strict construction [of tax statutes] does not mean such a construction as to defeat the intention of the legislature.\"). We therefore hold that the subject-to-tax exception applies only to the extent that the royalty payments were actually taxed by another state. That is, the exception applies on a post-apportionment, rather than a pre-apportionment, basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   B. Kohl's Alternative Argument\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Kohl's alternatively argues that the Department erred in calculating the amount of the royalties that falls within the subject-to-tax exception. The Department allowed a \"partial exception\" to the add back statute to the extent that the royalty payments were apportioned and taxed in many of the Separate Return States. However, Kohl's Illinois's income was also included in Kohl's taxable income calculations in the Combined Return States. Additionally, Kohl's was required to add the royalties back to its taxable income when calculating its taxable income for Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts, and it added a portion of the royalties back when calculating its taxable income for Georgia and New Jersey (collectively, the \"Addback States\"). Kohl's argues\n   that to the extent the royalties were apportioned to and taxed by all of the above states, they fall within the subject-to-tax exception. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The subject-to-tax exception applies when \"[t]he corresponding item of income received by the related member is subject to a tax based on or measured by net income or capital imposed by Virginia [or] another state.\" Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1). This statute\n   only requires that the \"item of income received by the related member\"-in this case, the royalties-be taxed by another state. It does not require that that the related member be the entity that pays the tax on that \"item of income.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Nevertheless, the Department notes that the add back statute only applies to any intangible expenses paid to a \"related member,\" Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a), and that the subject-to-tax exception only applies to \"[t]he corresponding item of income received\n   <em>\n    by the related member\n   </em>\n   .\" Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(1) (emphasis added). From these provisions, the Department reasons that the Court can only look to Kohl's Illinois's tax returns when determining whether the royalty payments were subject to a tax in another state. In essence, this argument asserts that for the royalty payments to fall within the subject-to-tax exception, the tax must have been paid by the related member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Simply, Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1) contains no such requirement. To the extent that the royalties were actually taxed by the Separate Return States, Combined Return States, or Addback States, they fall within the subject-to-tax exception regardless of which entity paid the tax. The Department should have allowed this portion of the royalties to be excepted from the add back statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   III. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The circuit court correctly determined that only the portion of the royalties that was actually taxed by another state falls within the subject-to-tax exception. However, it erred by failing to hold, in accordance with Kohl's alternative argument, that Kohl's Illinois need not be the entity that pays this tax for the exception to apply. Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court's judgment and remand the matter for a determination of what portion of the royalty payments was actually taxed by another state and, therefore, excepted from the add back statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   JUSTICE McCLANAHAN, with whom CHIEF JUSTICE LEMONS and JUSTICE KELSEY join, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In its original opinion, the majority held that Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1) is ambiguous and, citing the principle that the interpretation given the tax statute by the Department of Taxation (the \"Department\") is entitled to \"great weight,\" resolved the ambiguity in favor of the Department, whose interpretation it deemed as \"reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Kohl's Dep't Stores, Inc. v.

The parties stipulated that \"[t]he royalties that Kohl's Illinois received from Kohl's were subject to a tax based on or measured by net income or capital in each of the Separate Return States.\" Thus, the addition to income was not required \"for\n   <em>\n    any portion\n   </em>\n   \" of the royalties that Kohl's paid to Kohl's Illinois.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12648248\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/803/336/#p340\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Although the majority states \"it is doubtful and uncertain whether the General Assembly intended\" Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1) to apply on a pre-apportionment or post-apportionment basis, this provision contains no apportionment language that would support its application on a post-apportionment basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The apportionment calculation was introduced into the statute by the Department. In 2007, when the Commissioner issued its first ruling interpreting Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1), the Commissioner limited application of the provision \"to the portion of the Taxpayer's royalty payments to its [affiliate] that correspond to the portion of the [affiliate's] income subjected to tax in other states, as evidenced by the apportionment percentages shown in the [affiliate's] tax returns filed with other\n   states.\" Va.

In limiting the provision's application in this manner, the Commissioner inserted an apportionment calculation into the provision that it does not contain. Therefore, while the majority has now excised from its opinion any reliance on the Department's interpretation of the statute, the fact remains that the majority has credited the Department's interpretation of the statute to create the ambiguity it now resolves in favor of the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Efforts to codify the Department's interpretation of Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1) through amendment of Code \u00a7 58.1-402 have been undertaken ever since the Virginia Tax Commissioner first issued a ruling imposing the apportionment limitation on the application of this provision. In 2010, a bill to amend and reenact Code \u00a7 58.1-402 was proposed, which would have revised Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a) to provide that the addition to taxable income for royalties paid to a related member shall not be required \"to the extent that\" the corresponding item of income received by the related member is subject to a tax.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.B. 407, Va.

The revised majority opinion now acknowledges the strict-construction canon governing ambiguities in tax statutes but nonetheless refuses to apply it for two reasons. First, citing cases from Tennessee, Kentucky, New Jersey, and Missouri, the majority concludes that the Virginia canon of strict construction must give way to a \"paramount\" goal: the judicial\n   discovery of\n   the true \"intention of the legislature.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, unrestrained by the canon, the majority then claims that it can delve into the statutory ambiguity and divine the true legislative intent of the statute. I cannot accept either rationale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   To begin with, the strict-construction canon serves as a limitation on the taxing power itself. Describing \"[c]ertain basic principles,\" we have emphasized that \"[t]he power of taxation is exercised by the legislature, 'and an executive officer who seeks to enforce a tax must always be able to put his finger upon the statute which confers such authority.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

It is for this reason that statutes imposing taxes be construed \"most strongly\" against the government and \"not be extended by implication\" beyond the statute's clear language.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20S.E.%20683\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The very danger that the canon warns against is taking place in the majority opinion.

Yet, \"the intent of the legislature is not to be derived by intuition, or any process of divination, but from the words used.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

The majority suggests that it must divine this intent because the \"guiding star\" of judicial interpretation, is \"the intention of the legislature.\" It is of course true that the point of statutory interpretation is to discover legislative intent. Virginia law, however, views the strict-construction canon as the most reliable astronomical chart leading to that star. Without that chart,\n   the choice between two equally plausible interpretations of a statute turns predominately, if not entirely, on the subjective views of the interpreters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Furthermore, the legislative history relied upon by the majority does not support its interpretation. The stated purpose of Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a) was to close a loophole in connection with Delaware holding companies, not corporations for which income is subject to tax. Though the majority initially characterizes the language of the statute as both \"doubtful\" and \"uncertain,\" it is able to intuit a \"plainly ascertainable intention\" from a fiscal impact statement. The fiscal impact statement referenced by the majority, Department of Taxation, 2004 Special Session I, Fiscal Impact Statement for H.B. 5018,\n   states that the addback statute \"[c]loses certain loopholes related to Delaware holding companies.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The legislative summary accompanying H.B. 5018 similarly states that the bill \"[r]equires additions to federal taxable income for certain deductions for intangible and interest expense,\n   but provides certain safe-harbors related to Delaware holding companies.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.B. 5018, Summary as Passed,\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=042&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb5018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the original purpose as stated in the legislative summary and fiscal impact statement accompanying H.B. 5018 reflect the General Assembly's intention to close loopholes related to holding companies for which income is not subject to tax in any state, such as Delaware holding companies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Construing Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1) to require the addition to income of royalties paid to a corporation for which income is subject to tax in another state would exceed the stated purpose of the legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The efforts to amend Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1) to impose an apportionment limitation on its application reveal that the currently applicable provision contains no such limitation. As discussed in Part I, the General Assembly failed to enact bills proposed during the 2010 and 2013 legislative sessions, both of which included language that would have codified the apportionment limitation adopted by the Department. Budget bills enacted in 2014 and 2016 contain provisions purporting to place an apportionment limitation on the application of Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1). It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that these efforts were not undertaken in vain, but rather to provide language that would codify the Department's adoption of the apportionment limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In sum, I would hold that Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1), by its plain language, does not apply on a post-apportionment basis. Even if there were doubt as to whether the provision contained such a limitation, Virginia statutory construction principles that have existed for more than a century require that we resolve it in favor\n   of Kohl's. For these reasons, I would hold that Kohl's is entitled to a full refund and would, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the circuit court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    In our initial opinion, we found that Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1) was ambiguous and resolved this ambiguity by looking to \"the occasion and necessity of the law, ... the causes which moved the Legislature to enact it.\"\n    <em>\n     Kohl's Dep't Stores, Inc. v.
