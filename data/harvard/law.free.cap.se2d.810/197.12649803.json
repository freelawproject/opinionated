A Clayton County jury found Timothy Kelly guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of one count each of rape, kidnapping, kidnapping with bodily injury, and battery, and two\n   counts of aggravated assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He appeals from the denial of his amended motion for new trial, arguing that the trial court erred in accepting his waiver of counsel.

On October 14, 2004, at around 3:00 a. m., N. G., a 19-year old woman, was punched in the face and raped at knife point next to a vacant building near her apartment. After the assault and rape, the assailant fled, and N. G. ran home. Someone at N. G.'s home contacted the police, and an officer with the Clayton County Police Department responded. N. G. was transported to a hospital. At the hospital, a registered nurse used a rape kit to perform a sexual assault examination on N. G. The examination results were entered into the Combined DNA Indexing System (CODIS) database in 2006. In 2013, the Clayton County Police Department received notice that a CODIS match had been made indicating that the DNA evidence matched a known sample from the Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2015, a jury found the Appellant guilty on all charges, and the trial court initially sentenced him to life with a possibility of parole, plus 20 years to be served concurrently. The Appellant filed an amended motion for new trial. After a hearing, the trial court vacated the Appellant's convictions on the kidnapping, kidnapping with bodily injury, battery and aggravated assault charges and resentenced him on the rape conviction to serve life with the possibility of parole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Generally, on appeal from a criminal conviction, the appellate court\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-11\">\n   view[s] the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and an appellant no longer enjoys the presumption of innocence. [The] Court determines whether the evidence is sufficient under the standard of\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Further, at the Appellant's request, the trial court instructed defense counsel to act as \"second chair\" during the trial to assist the Appellant upon request. Based on the foregoing, as a threshold matter, we find that the trial court properly questioned the Appellant and that the Appellant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel after being apprised of the dangers of self-representation.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    Toward the end of the\n    <em>\n     Faretta\n    </em>\n    hearing, the trial court asked the Appellant, \"[d]o you understand that once the trial begins, you cannot change your mind and decide that you want to be represented by a lawyer?\" The Appellant responded affirmatively \"[y]es, ma'am.\" The Appellant argues that the trial court's statement violated his right to counsel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Pretermitting whether the trial court's statement in this case was erroneous or misleading, the Appellant failed to object to the statement and, thus, waived appellate review of the issue. It is well settled in Georgia that\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n    a party may not fail to object to an erroneous ruling or statement of a trial court and then attack that ruling on appeal. A party's duty to object in these circumstances gives the trial court the opportunity to correct the alleged error, and avoids the possibility that a party may intentionally fail to object to a ruling and take a chance of a favorable outcome at trial based on the knowledge he or she stands a chance of obtaining a reversal on appeal.\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    We find the\n    <em>\n     Wilkerson\n    </em>\n    case, cited by both parties, dispositive of the issue presented. Here, as in\n    <em>\n     Wilkerson\n    </em>\n    , the Appellant was represented by counsel during the\n    <em>\n     Faretta\n    </em>\n    hearing and neither he nor his defense counsel objected to the trial court's statement.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    Also, as stated in\n    <em>\n     Wilkerson\n    </em>\n    , the trial court's statement as to whether the Appellant could later decide to represent himself is not part of the\n    <em>\n     Faretta\n    </em>\n    colloquy.\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Further, the record shows that the Appellant never asked to be represented by counsel during the course of the trial or re-visited the issue with the trial court in order to give the court an opportunity to correct its statement.\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n    Finally, at the motion for new trial\n    hearing, both the Appellant and defense counsel testified. Defense counsel testified that \"[a]t no time during the trial ... did [the Appellant] ever ask me any question relating to a witness or anything else.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Based on the foregoing, we find that the Appellant knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to counsel; that he waived any error in the trial court's statement; and that he never made a post-waiver request for counsel during trial. Thus, because he has failed to show that the trial court erred in accepting his waiver of counsel, we find that the trial court did not err in denying his motion for new trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    <em>\n     Judgment affirmed.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Ellington, P.
