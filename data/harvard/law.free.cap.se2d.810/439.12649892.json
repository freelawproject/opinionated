On appeal, Scott argues the family court erred because (1) the finding of disability by the SSA constituted a change in circumstances\n   necessary to stop, change, or modify the child support obligation; (2) the money awarded from the SSA should offset his child support obligations; and (3) it failed to properly keep and file documents submitted as evidence. We affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October 2011, the family court ordered Scott to pay $320 per month in child support. In February 2014, Scott sought a modification of his child support obligation and provided proof of a pending disability case with the SSA. The family court determined Scott's child support obligation would be reduced to approximately $66 per week. The enforcement of Scott's child support obligation was suspended for six months to determine his disability status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The SSA concluded Scott became disabled on September 26, 2013. It determined Scott was entitled to benefits of $1,069.40 per month beginning in March 2014. A cost-of-living adjustment increased Scott's monthly benefits to $1,087.50 in December 2014. Scott's child was also entitled to Social Security benefits and received a check for approximately $6,500 in past due benefits and an ongoing monthly check of $543.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In April 2015, Scott served the child's mother (Mother) and the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) with an amended complaint. Scott argued (1) his child support obligation should be terminated because of a change in circumstances; (2) his child support arrearages should be \"terminated in their entirety, or that any arrearage that accumulated after September 26, 2013[,] be terminated\"; and (3) he should be given credit for any \"social security payments made to the minor child from September 26, 2013[,] forward because of [his] disability, and that these payments be subtracted from any money [he] owe[d] in child support, including arrearages.\" Mother counterclaimed, requesting attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The family court found that Scott was required to pay the arrearage that accumulated before the date of his disability. The family court's order stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [T]he [c]ourt finds that [Scott] owes the outstanding arrearage as of September 26, 2013, that any part of the arrearage\n   that accumulated beyond that date is dismissed as the benefits that the [minor child] is receiving from Social Security are in lieu of [Scott]'s child support going forward and that [Scott] is to pay toward his arrearage that was in place as of September 26, 2013, at a rate of Seventy-Five Dollars ($75) per month due on first of the month thereafter to begin after this Order is clocked and filed with the [f]amily [c]ourt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES ON APPEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   1.

App. 1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   According to the family court's order, \"the benefits that the [minor child] is receiving from Social Security are in lieu of [Scott's] child support going forward.\" Nothing\n   in the family court's order increases the amount of Scott's child support obligation. Instead, the family court's order indicates Scott was no longer required to pay his monthly child support obligation because the minor child was receiving monthly Social Security benefits greater than Scott's child support obligation. Although the SSA deemed Scott disabled, he still has an obligation to support his child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peebles v.

In the instant case, the disability benefits exceeded Scott's monthly child support obligation, and the family court properly found he was not required to pay any support in addition to the disability benefits. Therefore, we find the family court properly considered Scott's disability when determining his child support obligation and did not err by indicating the disability payments were in lieu of child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    ARREARAGE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Scott contends he should receive credit toward his arrearage for any amount the child receives from Social Security that is in excess of Scott's existing child support obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Scott argues the child receives an overpayment of $261 per month and that amount should be credited toward his arrearage.
