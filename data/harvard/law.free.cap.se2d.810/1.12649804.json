Stat. \u00a7 52-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for criminal conversation and alienation of affection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The evidence at trial tended to show the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff and Jimenez were married 27 December 2007. Defendant, a family friend, attended the couple's wedding and often spent time with them. In December 2011, Plaintiff began to notice her marital relationship change. Due to her suspicions, Plaintiff checked Jimenez's phone records and discovered that he and Defendant were in regular contact through phone calls and text messages, including 120 contacts in a one-month period in early 2012. Plaintiff confronted Jimenez and Defendant about their increased communications, but both denied any wrongdoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to checking Jimenez's phone records, Plaintiff also found a credit card bill for Jimenez reflecting charges for stays at two different hotels on 30 and 31 January 2012, weekdays when Jimenez was supposed to be at work. Plaintiff also learned on 21 March 2012 that Jimenez was staying at one of the two hotels. She called the hotel, was told that her husband had been there with an unidentified woman, and obtained a copy of the bill from the hotel for that stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 8 April 2012, Jimenez told Plaintiff their relationship was over and moved out of the marital home. On 26 April 2012, Plaintiff gave birth to her and Jimenez's first child. Plaintiff and Jimenez discussed reconciliation in January 2013, but Jimenez refused to return to the relationship. Jimenez eventually began living with Defendant, who gave birth\n   to a child in October 2013. Plaintiff and Jimenez finalized their divorce in September 2014.\n   Following a bench trial on 11 July 2016, the trial court entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff. The court concluded that Defendant had maliciously and wrongfully injured a genuine marital relationship between Plaintiff and her spouse; Defendant committed criminal conversation with Plaintiff's spouse; and Plaintiff was entitled to recover $65,000 from Defendant. Defendant filed timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant challenges the trial court's finding of fact that Defendant had engaged in sexual conduct with Plaintiff's spouse prior to their date of separation, arguing that there was no competent evidence of pre-separation activity that gave rise to more than mere conjecture of sexual conduct.

In 2009, the General Assembly codified alienation of affection and criminal conversation in a statute specifically limiting these torts to arise only from acts committed prior to a married couple's separation: \"No act of the defendant shall give rise to a cause of action for alienation of affection or criminal conversation\n   <em>\n    that occurs after the plaintiff and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    the plaintiff's spouse physically separate with the intent of either the plaintiff or plaintiff's spouse that the physical separation remain permanent\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2052-13\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2015) (emphasis added). Stated simply, these torts now impose liability for conduct occurring only: (1) during the marriage and (2) prior to physical separation. Therefore, claims of alienation of affection and criminal conversation arising after the effective date of Section 52-13 cannot be sustained without evidence of pre-separation acts satisfying the elements of these respective torts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   What is less clear is whether evidence of post-separation acts is admissible to support an inference of pre-separation acts constituting alienation of affection or criminal conversation. With respect to the tort of criminal conversation, and with respect to the element of malice in an alienation of affection case being satisfied by criminal conversation, prior decisions in cases addressing evidence necessary to prove adultery are instructive, because criminal conversation is adultery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

Our Supreme Court observed in\n   <em>\n    Trogdon\n   </em>\n   a principle that transcends generations: \"Adultery is nearly always proved by circumstantial evidence ... as misconduct of this sort is usually clandestine and secret.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 148,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=409%20S.E.2d%20897\">\n    409 S.E.2d at 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). When there is no direct evidence of sexual intercourse between the defendant and the plaintiff's spouse, the plaintiff can prove criminal conversation by circumstantial evidence.

Although Defendant at times in her trial testimony denied living with Jimenez and claimed not to know who the father of her child was, the trial court found otherwise based on evidence including Plaintiff's testimony and inconsistencies in Defendant's testimony. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's finding that Defendant and Jimenez had sexual relations during a time when Plaintiff and Jimenez were married and not separated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Had the trial court found simply that Jimenez and Defendant had sexual relations while Plaintiff was married to Jimenez, its finding would on its face be insufficient to support Plaintiff's claims without specifying that such conduct occurred prior to the couple's separation. But the trial court also found that Defendant and Jimenez had sexual relations prior to a \"legal separation\" of Plaintiff and Jimenez. This finding, in the context of all evidence of record, is sufficiently specific to support the trial court's conclusions that Defendant\n   is liable to Plaintiff for alienation of affection and criminal conversation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant contends that the trial court's use of the term \"legal separation\" rendered its finding insufficient to support the trial court's conclusion that Defendant was liable for alienation of affection and criminal conversation because a legal separation could mean an event later than the married couple's physical separation, and thus beyond the scope of liability allowed by statute. On the facts before us, we disagree. Subpart (a) of Section 52-13 defines separation in legal terms by referring\n   to an occurrence in which \"the plaintiff and the plaintiff's spouse physically separate with the intent of either the plaintiff or plaintiff's spouse that the physical separation remain permanent.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2052-13\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2015). Although we acknowledge, as Defendant argues, that in other contexts legal separation may refer to spouses' execution of a separation agreement or entry of a court order for pendent lite relief pending divorce, in this case neither party presented evidence of any occurrence manifesting Jimenez's separation from Plaintiff other than his moving out of the marital home on 8 April 2012. So there is no basis to interpret the trial court's finding to refer to any other date or occurrence as the couple's \"legal separation.\" On this record, we hold that the trial court's factual findings and conclusions of law impose liability on Defendant for conduct that occurred within the limited time period allowed by the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, we hold that the trial court's findings were supported by the evidence, and that the trial court's conclusions were sufficiently supported by the findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Chief Judge MCGEE and Judge TYSON concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
