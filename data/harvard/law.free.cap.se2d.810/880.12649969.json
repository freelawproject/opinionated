LEMONS\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this appeal, we consider whether certain large customers can purchase electricity from any licensed supplier of energy in the Commonwealth under Code \u00a7 56-577(A)(5), without being subject to the notice requirement set forth in Code \u00a7 56-577(A)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. Facts and Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Virginia Electric and Power Company (\"VEPCO\") is a public service corporation authorized to sell electricity in the Commonwealth. VEPCO is the exclusive provider of electricity in a\n   geographic area known as its service territory, subject to limited exceptions that permit customers to purchase electricity from any licensed supplier of energy in the Commonwealth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7\u00a7 56-265.4, 56-577(A). Direct Energy Services, LLC (\"DES\") is licensed as a competitive service provider (\"CSP\"), which allows it to sell electricity to customers located in another utility's service territory under certain circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 26, 2016, DES filed a petition for a declaratory judgment (\"petition\") with the State Corporation Commission (\"Commission\"), seeking an order that it can sell electricity provided from 100% renewable energy to customers located in VEPCO's service territory pursuant to Code \u00a7 56-577(A)(5) (\"Section (A)(5)\"). As relevant here, DES sought clarification that customers who can purchase electricity from a CSP under Code \u00a7 56-577(A)(3) (\"Section (A)(3)\"), due to their high demand for electricity (\"large customers\"), can also purchase electricity produced with 100% renewable energy under Section (A)(5). Section (A)(3) provides that if a customer purchases electricity from a CSP, it cannot return to the incumbent utility in its service territory without providing five years' advance written notice. Section (A)(5) does not contain a notice requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Commission entered an order directing VEPCO to respond to the petition and providing DES with an opportunity to reply to VEPCO's response. VEPCO responded and asserted that Section (A)(3) governs all purchases of electricity by large customers from CSPs, regardless whether the electricity is produced with renewable energy. Accordingly, VEPCO asserted that large customers cannot invoke Section (A)(5) to circumvent the notice requirement in Section (A)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 11, 2016, Appalachian Voices, a nonprofit organization that advocates for renewable energy, filed a motion to participate as a respondent. The Commission granted the motion and Appalachian Voices filed comments in support of the petition. Appalachian Voices observed that Section (A)(5), unlike Section (A)(3), does not distinguish between customers based on the size of their demand for electricity, and therefore argued that large customers can purchase electricity under Section (A)(5). VEPCO filed an additional response with leave of the Commission, and reiterated its argument that large customers who purchase electricity\n   from CSPs do so under Section (A)(3), regardless of the source of the electricity. DES filed a reply arguing that because Section (A)(3) provides that it is \"subject to the provisions of subdivisions 4 and 5,\" the conditions and limitations in Section (A)(3) do not apply to purchases under Section (A)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In a final order dated March 15, 2017, the Commission held that large customers can purchase electricity provided from 100% renewable energy under Section (A)(5). The Commission explained that Code \u00a7 56-577 provides for three types of retail access to electricity, each subject to its own qualifications and limitations. Section (A)(3) \"permits retail access for certain large customers regardless of the type of electricity being sold.\" Code \u00a7 56-577(A)(4) (\"Section (A)(4)\") \"permits aggregation of non-residential customer load for the purpose of meeting the Section (A)(3) size limits, subject to Commission approval and, like Section (A)(3), permits retail access regardless of the type of electricity being sold.\" In contrast, Section (A)(5) contains \"no size or minimum stay requirements.\" It permits customers \"to purchase 100% renewable energy from a CSP if the incumbent utility does not offer ... 100% renewable energy.\" The Commission concluded that large customers can purchase electricity under Section (A)(5), and that they are \"not subject to a minimum stay provision if they are purchasing a 100% renewable energy product from a CSP under\" this section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   VEPCO moved for reconsideration of the final order. VEPCO acknowledged that Section (A)(5) contains no size or minimum stay requirements. However, VEPCO argued that because \"the more specific statute will control\" where \"two statutes govern the same thing,\" interpreting \"the lack of specific requirements for large customers in Section (A)(5) as negating the specific requirements for large customers in Section (A)(3) would allow the general rule to supplant the specific one.\" VEPCO further observed that the language \"subject to the provisions of subdivisions 4 and 5\" modifies the phrase \"only individual retail customers ... whose demand ... exceeded five megawatts ... shall be permitted to purchase electric energy from any supplier.\" VEPCO contended this language \"makes clear that customers other than large customers are eligible to procure service from Competitive Providers under Sections (A)(4) and (A)(5).\" Finally, VEPCO noted that the\n   Commission appeared to have interchanged the notice requirement in Section (A)(3) and the \"minimum stay period\" under 20 VAC \u00a7 5-312-80(Q) (\"Rule 80(Q)\"), and asked the Commission to clarify that its ruling did not impact Rule 80(Q).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Commission suspended its final order to consider the motion for reconsideration and then reaffirmed its holding by order dated April 26, 2017. The Commission noted that under\n   <em>\n    Covel v. Town of Vienna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=280%20Va.%20151\">\n    280 Va. 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 162,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=694%20S.E.2d%20609\">\n    694 S.E.2d 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 616 (2010), \"when one statute speaks to a subject generally and another deals with an element of that subject specifically, the statutes will be harmonized, if possible, and if they conflict, the more specific statute prevails.\" The Commission explained that Sections (A)(3) and (A)(5) are not in conflict:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Section (A)(3) only applies to large users of electricity, and it allows these users to purchase electric energy from a CSP regardless of how that electric energy is generated. Section (A)(5) applies to all retail customers \"regardless of customer class,\" and it allows these customers to purchase from a CSP if the electric energy is provided 100% from renewable energy. Unlike Section (A)(3), Section (A)(5) does not require five years' advance notice in order for a retail customer to purchase from its incumbent electric utility after such customer has chosen to purchase 100% renewable energy from a CSP. This\n   does not represent a conflict; this simply reflects different requirements imposed by the General Assembly for different competitive purchase options explicitly permitted by statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Accordingly, the Commission concluded that it is unnecessary to employ rules of statutory construction because the statute is unambiguous. The Commission reinstated its final order and clarified that its holding \"does not alter the minimum stay provisions in Rule 80(Q).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   VEPCO appealed to this Court as a matter of right, pursuant to Code \u00a7 12.1-39, on the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1. The Commission erred in its Final Order when it found that customers that are permitted to purchase\n   energy from a competitive service provider (\"CSP\") under Va.

The Commission erred in its Order on Reconsideration when it found that customers that are permitted to purchase energy from a competitive service provider (\"CSP\") under Va.

Code Section 56-577(A)(3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   4.

If a large customer purchases electricity from a CSP, it cannot return to the incumbent utility without providing five years' advance written notice. Section (A)(5) applies to \"individual retail customers of electric energy within the Commonwealth, regardless of customer class.\" Customers can purchase electricity from a CSP under Section (A)(5) if they purchase electricity provided 100% from renewable energy, and (i) the incumbent utility does not offer an approved tariff for such electricity or (ii) the purchase is pursuant to a power purchase agreement in effect on the date a tariff for such energy is filed with the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   VEPCO asserts that the phrase \"subject to the provisions of subdivisions 4 and 5\" in Section (A)(3) demonstrates that \"customers other than large customers have options to purchase electricity from CSPs\" under Sections (A)(4) and (A)(5). We have noted that \" 'subject to' means 'subordinate, subservient, inferior, obedient to; governed or affected by.' \"\n   <em>\n    Donnelly v.

In this context, the phrase \"subject to\" does not mean customers who can\n   purchase from a CSP under Section (A)(3) are excluded from Section (A)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The plain language of Sections (A)(3) and (A)(5) is clear and unambiguous. Section (A)(5) provides that \"individual retail customers\" can purchase electricity produced with 100% renewable energy from CSPs. Unlike Section (A)(3), Section (A)(5) does not contain a limitation based on the size of a customer's demand for electricity. Further, Section (A)(3) does not state that it governs all purchases of electricity by large customers from CSPs, and the phrase \"subject to\" clarifies that (A)(3) is not the only avenue under which a customer can purchase electricity from a CSP. Accordingly, we hold that customers who satisfy the size requirements\n   of Section (A)(3) can purchase electricity from a CSP under Section (A)(5), provided that they satisfy the separate conditions of Section (A)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   VEPCO maintains that this interpretation creates a conflict because it allows large customers who purchase electricity from a CSP to circumvent the notice requirement in Section (A)(3). Consequently, VEPCO contends that this Court should employ the \"cardinal rule of statutory interpretation\" that \"[w]hen one statute addresses a subject in a general manner and another addresses a part of the same subject in a more specific manner, the two statutes should be harmonized, if possible, and when they conflict, the more specific statute prevails.\"\n   <em>\n    Lynchburg Div. of Soc.

Rather, we agree with the Commission that Sections (A)(3) and (A)(5) are not in conflict. As the Commission observed, the fact that Section (A)(5) lacks a notice requirement does not create a conflict; it \"simply reflects different requirements imposed by the General Assembly for different competitive purchase options explicitly permitted by statute.\" Moreover, where, as here, the \"statutory terms are plain and unambiguous, we apply them according to their plain meaning without resorting to rules of statutory construction.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

That argument, however, is not supported by a plain reading of the statute. Section (A)(3) states that large customers can purchase electricity from any licensed supplier of energy \"subject to the following conditions.\" The notice requirement, contained in subsection (c), is one of four enumerated conditions. The phrase \"subject to\" and the fact that the notice requirement is a subsection of Section (A)(3) demonstrate that the notice requirement applies only to purchases made under Section (A)(3). There is no notice requirement for purchases under Section (A)(5), and no language that incorporates the notice\n   provision from (A)(3) into (A)(5). Accordingly, the notice requirement in Section (A)(3) does not apply to purchases made under Section (A)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   III.
