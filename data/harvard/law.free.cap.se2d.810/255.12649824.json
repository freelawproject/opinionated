Arnold (Mother) seeks review of the family court's order awarding Maxie\n   Burgess (Father) primary custody of their eight-year-old son (Son) should Mother relocate to Florida. Mother argues the family court erred by (1) creating a custody arrangement that penalizes Mother for relocating to Florida; (2) applying an initial custody analysis rather than a change-in-circumstances analysis; and (3) imposing a joint custody arrangement based on a finding that the parties had been operating under a joint custody arrangement prior to Father's filing of this action. In Father's cross-appeal, he challenges the family court's ruling that automatically reinstates Mother's primary custodian status if she returns to South Carolina after relocating to Florida. Father argues a substantial change in circumstances must be shown before the family court may change custody and the family court did not have jurisdiction to make such a ruling. We reverse and remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mother and Father were never married to each other, but they were in a committed relationship until Son was eighteen months old. Subsequently, Mother continued her sexual relationship with Father until 2012 \"in hopes they would become a family.\" Except for a few months in 2008, Father has not paid child support, and prior to this action, Mother never sought a court order imposing child support payments on Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mother met LaBaron Paschall, an Army Ranger instructor, in May 2012 during Bike Week. At that time, Paschall was stationed in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and was vacationing in Myrtle Beach. Both Mother and Father were living in Surfside Beach. Mother's relationship with Paschall became romantic in July 2012. Within the following few months, Paschall moved to Florida, but he continued his relationship with Mother. By early 2014, Mother and Paschall decided to marry, and they began discussing Mother's relocation to Florida; however, their wedding was postponed until June 27, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By May 2014, Father was concerned about Mother taking Son to Florida with her, and he filed this action seeking custody of Son. Mother later filed an answer and counterclaim seeking custody of Son. In June 2014, Mother sought counseling\n   for Son to address his anxiety over the possibility of moving to Florida as well as disciplinary issues between Mother and Son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The family court conducted a final hearing from August 3 through August 5, 2015. At the time of the hearing, Paschall was stationed at Elgin Air Force Base near Fort Walton Beach, Florida, and he had plans to retire by February 1, 2016, and start a private security business. Also, at this time, Mother was pregnant with Paschall's child. On September 28, 2015, the family court filed its final order granting Mother and Father joint custody of Son, with Mother having primary custody \"over all issues except education\" and granting Father primary custody of Son in the event that Mother relocated to Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mother and Father filed cross-motions to alter or amend the final order, and the family court granted in part and denied in part each motion. Specifically, as to the issues relevant to this appeal, the family court granted Father's request to address Mother's possible return to Horry County after relocating to Florida and ruled that Mother's primary custody of Son would be reinstated should such a contingency occur. The family court denied Mother's request to reconsider its finding that the parties had a joint custody arrangement before Father filed this action. The family court also rejected Mother's arguments that it should have applied a change-in-circumstances analysis to its custody determination and it should have awarded sole custody to Mother. These cross-appeals followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES ON APPEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   1.

The court also noted the family court \"fashioned the joint custody to alternate in four-week intervals\" that would not be as disruptive as shorter intervals.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"347760\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/354/118/#p125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, Son expressed a desire to continue the joint custody arrangement that was in place before this action was filed. However, the record indicates this arrangement has\n   been stressful for him due to Mother and Father's contrasting parenting styles. Further, Mother has indicated a willingness to allow Father generous visitation with Son even if she relocates to Florida. Father has also indicated a willingness to accommodate Mother's relationship with Son. Nevertheless, we are troubled by Father's recording of conversations in which Son recounted certain actions taken by Mother and Father questioned Son about the reasons for, and morality of, these actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The record also indicates Mother is more attuned to Son's emotional needs and more open-minded about her own need for self-improvement. Critically, Mother has recognized the need to have Son tested for Attention Deficit Disorder and the need for counseling to address his emotional needs, whereas Father has been close-minded about these concerns despite his active involvement in Son's education. While Father argues he has cooperated with Mother in these two areas, we are concerned that if he has primary custody of Son upon Mother's relocation to Florida, he would be less likely to follow through with counseling or testing. Moreover, whereas Mother's parenting style was initially undisciplined, she has recognized the need for more structure and consistency in her discipline of Son and her enforcement of school assignments, and she has improved in these areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On the other hand, the family court recognized that Father \"has a very controlling personality\" and \"[i]n his mind, his way is the right way and\n   <em>\n    he knows\n   </em>\n   what is best for his child.\" (family court's emphasis). The record supports the family court's assessment of Father's personality, including his troubling habit of recording conversations with Son and also with Mother without her knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Additionally, both the family court and the Guardian ad Litem expressed \"great concern\" over Son's \"perceived fear of [Father].\" The Guardian ad Litem noted Son was more comfortable expressing his feelings with Mother and seemed more relaxed with Mother. We are also concerned about Son's statement to his counselor that Father \"gets women pregnant, they have babies, and he leaves them\" and Son's perception that Father lies to him \"a great deal.\" While Son's fear of Father has not discouraged Son from wanting to spend time\n   with Father, Father's continued joint custody of Son, and the possible increase in time Son would spend with Father should Mother relocate to Florida, would eventually take its toll on Son's emotional well-being.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, the new reality of Mother's marriage to Paschall removes the primary reason for the parties' previous joint custody arrangement, i.e., the long hours and travel that Mother's job required of her. Both Mother and Paschall testified Paschall earns enough income to allow Mother to stay at home with Son and her other child. In the alternative, Mother will have the freedom to take a job that would not require her to work as many hours as her then-current job required. Any initial instability Son may experience in adjusting to a new custody arrangement will be outweighed not only by the long-term benefit of living with Mother and her new family but also the potential long-term harm to Son should the parties' joint custody arrangement continue. We further discuss Son's best interests in the following section addressing Mother's possible relocation to Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Mother's Relocation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mother asserts the family court erred by awarding Father primary custody of Son should Mother relocate to Florida because the court focused too heavily on Father's decreased time with Son rather than whether the relocation would be in Son's best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"[T]he question of whether relocation will be allowed requires a determination of whether the relocation is in the best interest of the children, the primary consideration in all child custody cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Rice v.
