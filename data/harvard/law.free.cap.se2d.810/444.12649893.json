ARTHUR KELSEY\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 1970, a jury found Sherman Brown guilty of first-degree murder of a four-year-old child. The child's mother (\"M.B.\") testified that, after she rejected Brown's demand for sex, he knocked her unconscious, and upon awaking, she discovered that she had been repeatedly stabbed. While she was unconscious, her four-year-old son had been stabbed to death. Brown did not testify at his trial or proffer any evidence suggesting that someone else committed the attack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2016, Brown filed a petition seeking a writ of actual innocence pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-327.1 to -327.6, which govern writs of actual innocence based on biological evidence. Brown asserts under oath that he is \"actually innocent\" of the crime, Code \u00a7 19.2-327.3(A)(ii), and that recent DNA testing by a private laboratory, Bode Cellmark Forensics (\"Bode\"), conclusively exonerates him with \"clear and convincing evidence\" such that \"no rational trier of fact would have found proof of guilt ... beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Code \u00a7 19.2-327.5. Reviewing this case under our original jurisdiction, we dismiss Brown's petition for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First, the governing statutes limit our review of allegedly exculpatory biological evidence to the findings of the Commonwealth's Department of Forensic Science (\"DFS\"). DFS analyzed a vaginal smear slide presented by Brown and was unable to identify sufficient amounts of DNA in order to render any conclusion\n   as to whether Brown could be included or excluded as a contributor to the DNA on the slide. The findings of DFS, therefore, do not support Brown's claim of actual innocence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Second, even if we were authorized to consider the private laboratory's results obtained by Brown, he would still have the burden of proving that the evidence submitted to us in this writ proceeding-DNA test results from the Bode laboratory, the factual proffers in Brown's petition, the post-trial evidence presented in the Commonwealth's response, and the evidence presented at the original trial-provide, in the aggregate, clear-and-convincing proof that \"no rational trier of fact would have found proof of guilt ... beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   We find this evidence falls far short of satisfying this clear-and-convincing statutory standard of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Our analysis begins with a restatement of first principles. We have no common-law authority to grant what amounts to a judicial pardon-that is, to set free a convict lawfully found guilty by a jury-based upon his later protestation that he was in fact innocent.

THE EVIDENCE AT THE 1970 TRIAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The record before us begins with the evidence presented by the Commonwealth at Brown's 1970 jury trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Witnesses established that M.B. was at home on October 1, 1969, with her two young children, a two-year-old and a four-year-old. After lunch, M.B. put the two-year-old in his crib for a nap. M.B. then put on a nightgown, read to her four-year-old in bed, and then turned off the light to join him for an afternoon nap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before either of them fell asleep, M.B.'s father arrived for a visit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During her father's visit, M.B. received a phone call from Brown.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He repeatedly asked her if he could come over to her home to talk. She said no each time and was unnerved by his persistent requests. After her father left, M.B. and the four-year-old returned to the bedroom intending to take the planned nap. Just as M.B. started to untie her robe, she heard the front gate of the fence in front of her residence swing open. She looked out the window, saw no one, and walked to the front door with the four-year-old. When\n   she cracked the front door slightly open, she saw Brown through an exterior screen door. He asked to come inside. She said no. He insisted, but she continued to refuse his request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While still standing outside, Brown asked M.B. if she would get him a cup of water. She walked to her kitchen to fetch a paper cup of water, and when she returned, Brown had opened the screen door and stepped into the home. She was upset to see him inside the home, but she handed him the cup of water anyway. Brown continued to insist that he wanted to talk to her and even asked her to give him a tour of her home, but she continued to refuse each of his requests. At one point, she \"thought that [she] smelled alcohol on his breath,\" and she \"asked him if he had been drinking,\" which he denied. Trial Tr. at 167. Eventually, Brown abruptly asked her, \"Will you have sex with me?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 162. Now \"terrified,\" M.B. replied, \"Of course not.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After Brown asked her why she would not have sex with him, M.B. answered that she was married, that Brown was not her husband, and that Brown should leave. M.B.'s four-year-old was also in the room with them at the time, and M.B. indicated that \"little ears were listening\" when she requested that Brown leave. Brown finally declared, \"I'm so sexed up I don't know what to do.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"I'm sorry,\" M.B. responded, \"you will have to go somewhere else. I'm not available.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   M.B.'s next memory was \"pitching forward\" after \"receiving very painful blows\" to her side, which rendered her unconscious.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 163. When she awoke, she was unable to move. Her sister-in-law arrived later that afternoon and found M.B. on the floor in a pool of blood. After she discovered that M.B.'s phone was hanging from its wires with its receiver broken in half, the sister-in-law drove to a neighbor's home to ask them to call both the rescue squad and her husband, who could pick up M.B.'s husband from his job. M.B.'s sister-in-law returned to M.B.'s home and found the two-year-old unharmed in his crib, but she discovered the four-year-old lying face down on a bloody bed. When the rescue squad arrived, they discovered that M.B. had been stabbed multiple times and still had a knife blade without its handle lodged in her chest. Her underwear had been taken off and were on the floor nearby. The medical examiner later declared the four-year-old dead from repeated stab wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   M.B. was taken to the hospital for emergency surgery. She had suffered knife wounds to her chest, lower back, and abdomen and had open scalp lacerations from what the surgeon assumed were \"blow[s]\" to her head.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119. One of the stab wounds went 12 to 14 inches through her abdominal wall and into her liver and spleen. The child victim was transported to the morgue. He had suffered two stab wounds piercing his heart, four lacerations to his scalp exposing his skull, stab wounds to his left lung and right wrist, and multiple contusions to his forehead, face, arms, legs, and ears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Commonwealth charged Brown with a single crime, the murder of M.B.'s four-year-old son. Witnesses at Brown's trial established that on the day of the murder, Brown spent the morning with his brother-in-law, Larry Waller, and Larry's cousin, William Waller. They drank a fifth of whiskey together while working on Brown's car and then drove to Ivy, a town just outside of Charlottesville, for lunch. At Brown's request, William dropped off Brown and Larry at Brown's father's house, which was directly\n   across the road from M.B.'s house. At Brown's father's house, Larry overheard Brown make a telephone call. Shortly after that call, Brown and Larry walked across the road so that Brown could jog in the field on M.B.'s property in front of her home. After watching Brown jog a few laps, Larry caught a ride on the school bus after 3:00 p.m. and left to visit a friend, who was about to get out of school for the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After spending about twenty minutes at his friend's house, Larry returned to his home, in which Brown also lived, at approximately 4:30 p.m. Larry discovered Brown in his own bedroom washing up. Brown turned to Larry and simply said, \"I messed up.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 232, 251. Larry did not know what Brown had meant by that statement, and Brown did not provide an explanation. Brown went to work that evening where he was arrested around 6:15 p.m. and then questioned by police about the murder of M.B.'s four-year-old son. After reading Miranda warnings to Brown,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 208, 214, officers drove Brown to M.B.'s home where an investigator asked him if he had been on M.B.'s property that day, which Brown denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Commonwealth's opening statement at Brown's trial focused entirely on the only charge against him, the murder of M.B.'s\n   son. The Commonwealth never once suggested in its opening statement that Brown raped M.B., and M.B. did not make that accusation during her testimony. Furthermore, none of the evidence offered at trial demonstrated vaginal pain, injury, or trauma, which often accompany rape. Instead, the Commonwealth's theory of the case was that Brown may have \"\n   <em>\n    attempted\n   </em>\n   to have intercourse with her\" before stabbing and beating her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 432 (emphasis added). Given the ambiguous circumstantial evidence, the Commonwealth conceded that whether \"he tried to rape [her] or did rape her[,] we will never know.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 402.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In his closing statement to the jury, Brown's counsel pointed out that the Commonwealth did not introduce any evidence of sperm found on Brown or M.B. \"You can be certain if they found [semen]\" on the victim, witnesses \"would have been here to testify to it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 418. That evidentiary omission, counsel argued to the jury, discounts any \"motive\" suggesting that Brown murdered M.B.'s four-year-old son and attempted to murder M.B. in order to cover up an actual \"rape,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 417-18, a theory of guilt the Commonwealth never advanced at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The jury found Brown guilty of first-degree murder of M.B.'s son and sentenced him to death. On appeal, we affirmed the death sentence and rejected Brown's challenge to the finding of guilt. In response to his sufficiency challenge, we stated that \"[a] detailed review of the evidence of the circumstances surrounding this murder and the evidence pointing to the defendant's guilt as the murderer leaves no doubt in our mind that this evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, amply supports the\n   jury's verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2115487\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/212/515/#p516\">\n    212 Va. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 516,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20S.E.2d%20786\">\n    184 S.E.2d 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 787 (1971),\n   <em>\n    vacated in part on other grounds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782823,1782911,1782987,1782924,1782989,1782702,1782929,1782838,1782871,1782745,1782844,1782878,1782815\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/940/\">\n    408 U.S. 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20S.%20Ct.%202877\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20763\">\n    33 L.Ed.2d 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the early 1970s, the United States Supreme Court interpreted the Eighth Amendment to declare capital punishment categorically unconstitutional.

As we just explained, the Attorney General's position is not a collateral attack. He is not seeking to vacate the circuit court's testing order.

This admixture of old and new evidence necessarily means that the petitioner and the Commonwealth are free to assert their respective theories of innocence or guilt that correspond to their competing versions of the aggregate fact pattern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Applying these principles, we find that Brown has failed to prove by clear-and-convincing evidence that no rational factfinder would find him guilty of the murder of M.B.'s four-year-old son in light of the totality of the evidence now before us. Several reasons account for this failure of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   To begin with, Brown's theory of exoneration based upon Bode's DNA test results rests on a flawed assumption. Brown sees this as a rape and murder case. Because his DNA was not found on M.B.'s vaginal sample, Brown syllogizes that he cannot be the rapist, and thus, he cannot be the murderer\n   of M.B.'s four-year-old son. Brown's syllogism falls apart on several levels.\n   This case is not and never was a rape case. Brown was never charged with rape, and M.B. never testified that she was raped. Nor did she testify to vaginal pain, injury, or trauma or offer any other physical evidence of nonconsensual intercourse. Neither the Commonwealth nor Brown mentioned the subject of rape in their opening statements or during the questioning of any of the witnesses. The subject of rape first appeared at trial during closing arguments when the Commonwealth told the jury that whether \"[Brown] tried to rape [her] or did rape her[,]\n   <em>\n    we will never know\n   </em>\n   .\" Trial Tr. at 402 (emphasis added). Brown's theory of actual innocence, to the extent that Bode's DNA test results have any weight at all, only proves,\n   <em>\n    at best\n   </em>\n   , that Brown did not vaginally rape M.B. Perhaps he did not do so. But that possibility does not prove that Brown did not bludgeon and stab M.B. almost to death and murder her child-either because she dared to refuse his sexual advances and he exploded his vengeance upon her and her child or because he violently, but unsuccessfully, attempted to rape M.B. and he murdered her child to eliminate the only witness to the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Also relevant, Brown's statements to the Parole Board undermine his present protestations of innocence. In a 1991 statement to the Parole Board, Brown confessed, \"I accept full responsibility for my crime and I feel sorry for the victim, but I can't undo what's been done.\" MTD Ex. 7, at 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12649651\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/809/651/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 5, at 1. Brown first offered a detailed account of how the crimes occurred in a 1984 statement to the Parole Board.

Brown has not identified who initially prepared the slide, who stained the slide for examination, or who handled the slide after it had been examined by the Department of Pathology. Brown also did not establish the conditions under which the slide was prepared, stained, or initially stored.
