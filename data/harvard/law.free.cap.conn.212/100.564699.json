The dispositive issue is whether the FOIC acted arbitrarily in concluding that certain portions of the CCVFC meetings were not \u201coperational\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 7-314 (b), and thus were subject to the open meeting provision of General Statutes \u00a7 1-21 (a). We conclude that the FOIC did not act arbitrarily and therefore we set aside the judgment and remand the case with direction to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. The CCVFC is a volunteer fire department in the Cos Cob section of the town of Greenwich. On April 2, 1987, the complainant, Lawrence Orrico, a nonmember, attended a meeting of the CCVFC. Orrico was asked to leave the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Orrico thereafter filed a complaint with the FOIC alleging that the CCVFC violated his right to attend the meeting as provided by General Statutes \u00a7 1-21 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The CCVFC responded that it was not subject to the provisions of \u00a7 1-21 (a) because it was not a public agency within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It further claimed that even if it were a public agency its meetings would be exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by reason of General Statutes \u00a7 7-314 (b) which provides that: \u201cAny operational meeting of active members of a volunteer fire department shall not be subject to the provisions of sections 1-15, l-18a, 1-19 to l-19b, inclusive, and 1-21 to l-21k, inclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The FOIC held a hearing on the matter and concluded that with respect to the bulk of its activities the CCVFC was a public agency within the meaning of \u00a7 l-18a (a). The FOIC also made the following factual findings: \u201c[T]his meeting included, among others, the following activities: a. a report by the chief on the fires responded to, including the number of fires and the manpower used[;] b. a report by the treasurer on the budget[;] c. a report by the house committee on the condition of the firehouse[;] d. reports by other committees . . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The FOIC concluded that these activities were not operational in nature \u201cand to the extent they [did] not concern fraternal activities, [were] subject fully to the open meetings provisions of the Freedom of Informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>tion Act.\u201d The FOIC found, however, that certain other activities were operational and therefore not subject to the open meeting requirement. The commission found that the meeting included \u201ce. [a] discussion of the current radio procedures and returning to a town-wide paging system[;] f. [and a] discussion of social activities.\u201d The FOIC concluded that the discussion of the radio procedures was an operational activity and, therefore, that portion of the meeting was not subject to the open meeting requirement. Finally, the FOIC found that \u201crespondents are not [acting as] public agencies within the meaning of \u00a7 l-18a (a) when they are performing purely fraternal or social functions,\u201d and thus concluded that the discussion of social activities was not subject to the open meeting provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">On July 8,1987, the FOIC accepted and adopted<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation and ordered the CCVFC to \u201callow the public to attend those portions of the meetings in which they undertake those \u201cnon-fraternal\u201d activities listed [above],\u201d i.e., the reports on the budget, the condition of the firehouse, and the fires to which the department responded. The plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The trial court agreed with the FOIC\u2019s conclusion that the CCVFC was a public agency but found that the FOIC had failed to adopt any definitive meaning for the term \u201coperational meeting.\u201d The trial court concluded that \u201cin failing to reveal the criteria it utilized in making its determination, [with respect to which activities on the agenda were \u2018operational,\u2019] the FOIC acted arbitrarily.\u201d The trial court sustained the appeal in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (g).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>FOIC appealed this decision to the Appellate Court and we thereafter transferred the case to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">On appeal the FOIC claims that the trial court erred in interpreting the term \u201coperational\u201d and in sustaining the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal and reversing the FOIC\u2019s decision. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u201cOrdinarily, the construction and interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the courts where the administrative decision is not entitled to special deference, particularly where, as here, the statute has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny or time-tested agency interpretations. <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>202 Conn. 583, 599, 522 A.2d 771 (1987) .... Nevertheless, \u2018 \u201cjudicial review of the conclusions of law reached administratively is also limited. The court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, <em>in light of the evidence, </em>the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d \u2019 . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>205 Conn. 767, 773-74, 535 A.2d 1297 (1988). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Words of a statute \u201cmust be construed according to their commonly approved usage. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a).\u201d <em>Van Norstrand </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>211 Conn. 339, 342-43, 559 A.2d 200 (1989). The term \u201coperational,\u201d although not defined by statute, is commonly understood to mean \u201c[o]f or pertaining to an operation or a series of operations.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. The FOIC found that various reports on the fires responded to, the budget, and the condition of the firehouse directly related to a governmental function and, thus, were not \u201coperational\u201d matters. Therefore, the FOIC concluded, those portions of the meetings were subject to the open meeting requirement of the FOIA. In disputing the accuracy of the FOIC\u2019s interpretation, the trial court supplied its own definition of \u201coperational meeting.\u201d The trial court concluded that \u201coperational meetings are those that deal with the operating or functioning of the fire company, i.e. all meetings at which fire department operations are discussed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">It is axiomatic that the trial court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (g); <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>208 Conn. 709, 717, 546 A.2d 830 (1988); <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 773; <em>C&amp;H Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>176 Conn. 11, 12, 404 A.2d 864 (1978); <em>DiBenedetto </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>168 Conn. 587, 589, 362 A.2d 840 (1975). In excluding \u201coperational meeting[s]\u201d of volunteer fire departments from the open meeting requirement, the legislature could have provided criteria for determining what activities constituted \u201coperational\u201d activities or it could have otherwise defined the term. It chose to do neither. Thus the FOIC was left to decide whether the facts and circumstances surrounding the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>meeting gave rise to a conclusion that the meeting, or certain portions of the meeting, were \u201coperational\u201d within the broad meaning of that term. When the legislature uses a broad term, such as \u201coperational meeting[s],\u201d in an administrative context, without attempting to define that term, it evinces a legislative judgment that the agency should define the parameters of that term on a case-by-case basis. See <em>West Hartford Education Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>DeCourcy, </em>162 Conn. 566, 295 A.2d 526 (1972). Thus we cannot agree with the trial court that the FOIC acted arbitrarily in failing to reveal the criteria it used in making its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u201cThe agency\u2019s practical construction of the statute, if reasonable, is \u2018high evidence of what the law is.\u2019 <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Ludgin, </em>[175 Conn. 545, 556-57, 400 A.2d 712 (1978)]; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>142 Conn. 646, 657, 116 A.2d 420 [1955].\u201d <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 544, 552, 436 A.2d 266 (1980). In Anew of the record as a whole, we conclude that the FOIC acted well within the discretion delegated to it in interpreting the term \u201coperational meeting\u201d and applying that term to the facts before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded Avith direction to render judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-21 (a) provides in part: \u201cMEETINGS OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO BE PUBLIC.
