We find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">From the evidence presented the jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On July 28,1986, at approximately 6:39 a.m., the body of the victim, John Lyons, was found lying across the front seat of his automobile, at the intersection of Milton and Grand Streets, in the city of West Haven. An autopsy revealed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the victim\u2019s death was caused by five gunshot wounds, resulting in injury to the heart, lungs and intestines. Inspection of the victim\u2019s automobile, by members of the West Haven police department, revealed that: (1) the windshield wipers were in operation and the dashboard lights were on; (2) there were three expended .380 caliber shell casings inside the vehicle; (3) the defendant\u2019s fingerprints were located on the outer portion of the vehicle\u2019s trunk; and (4) there was a piece of paper above the passenger side sun-visor, on which was written \u201cwhite V.W. Rabbit, 293,\u201d identifying a vehicle registered to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Two young girls, delivering newspapers, noticed the victim\u2019s automobile and saw a dark haired man, wearing blue clothing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> standing outside the door on the driver\u2019s side. One of the girls saw the man in the blue clothing put his hands on the \u201ctop\u201d of the victim\u2019s car. The girls heard noises like five firecrackers, heard a person in the victim\u2019s automobile scream, and then saw the man in the blue clothing get into a blue car and rapidly drive away. The defendant owned both a blue Datsun and a white Volkswagen.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In January, 1986, the defendant began an extramarital affair with the wife of the victim, seeing her once or twice each week until June, 1986. The defendant informed his own wife of this affair and told her that he wanted to obtain a divorce. In early June, in response to an inquiry by the victim concerning the duration of the affair between the defendant and his wife, the defendant visited the victim at his home. At this meeting the victim told the defendant to stay away from his house and to leave his children alone. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>June or July, 1986, the defendant told a co-worker that he was engaged in an affair with the victim\u2019s wife and that he was in the process of obtaining a divorce. The defendant asked this co-worker how he should go about purchasing a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">On July 24, four days before the victim\u2019s death, Jason Chiello, as the result of an advertisement he had placed in the Bargain News, sold a .380 caliber handgun to an individual identifying himself as \u201cGeorge Best.\u201d Chiello and two other persons, present at the time of the sale, identified the defendant as the purchaser of this handgun. Chiello provided the police with empty shell casings that had been expended, during an earlier test-firing session, from the weapon sold to the defendant. Ballistics tests revealed that these shell casings and those found in the victim\u2019s automobile had been ejected from the same weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Also on July 24, Stephen Prindle, a firearms dealer, sold a customer one box of .380 caliber ammunition. In accordance with recordation requirements, he asked the purchaser for his driver\u2019s license and, thereafter, entered the identification information in an ammunition sales logbook. The next morning, Prindle discovered that his store had been broken into and that the ammunition sales logbook had been taken. A ladder, found outside the window that had been used to gain entry into the shop, was identified as being similar to one that was discovered missing from the defendant\u2019s place of employment. From an array of photographs, Prindle identified the defendant as the purchaser of the ammunition, although he was \u201cnot one hundred percent sure\u201d of his identification. Prindle remembered, however, that the purchaser\u2019s first name was \u201cEugene,\u201d and that the letters \u201cH,\u201d \u201cO,\u201d and \u201cE\u201d were at the beginning of the last name.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>On July 29, the day after the victim\u2019s death, the defendant was interviewed at the West Haven police station. The defendant told police officers that: he had never been to the victim\u2019s house; he did not know if the victim\u2019s wife had been engaged in an extramarital affair; he had never had any contact with the victim; and he did not know the victim\u2019s wife other than as a result of their being co-workers. The defendant testified on his own behalf at trial and admitted, during cross-examination, that he had lied when making those statements to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The defendant first claims that by preventing him from eliciting, during cross-examination, evidence of possible bias on the part of a witness for the state, the trial court impermissibly restricted his constitutionally guaranteed right of confrontation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">During cross-examination by the defendant, Prindle testified that, in addition to himself, one person worked at his firearms store as a paid employee. Defense counsel then asked whether Prindle had \u201cany other persons who might help [him] out who [weren\u2019t] paid.\u201d The state objected to this question on the basis of relevance, whereupon counsel for the defendant stated that he was attempting to show bias on the part of Prindle. During an offer of proof, conducted outside the presence of the jury, Prindle testified that a member of the West Haven police department occasionally helped him in his store. Prindle also stated that he had conducted business with \u201cperhaps two or three\u201d members of the West Haven police department on a regular basis, and with \u201cquite a few\u201d members of the same department \u201c[o]ver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>a period of time.\u201d After the defendant had elicited the names of several such customers, the \u25a0 state again objected to the introduction of this line of testimony, claiming that it was irrelevant and that no connection had been shown between the officers named and the investigation into the victim\u2019s death. Defense counsel argued that \u201cpart of [Prindle\u2019s bias] might be the fact that he does business with the West Haven Police Department, be it that they be actually involved in this investigation here or not.\u201d The trial court sustained the state\u2019s objection and noted the defendant\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u201cCross-examination to elicit facts tending to show motive, interest, bias and prejudice is a matter of right and may not be unduly restricted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>188 Conn. 715, 720, 453 A.2d 765 (1982). \u201c[A] major reason underlying the constitutional confrontation rule is to give a defendant charged with crime an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses against him.\u201d <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 406-407, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965); <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 418, 85 S. Ct. 1074, 13 L. Ed. 2d 934 (1965). It has been well \u201crecognized that the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>George, </em>194 Conn. 361, 481 A.2d 1068 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1191, 105 S. Ct. 963, 83 L. Ed. 2d 968 (1985). \u201cTo comport with the constitutional standards embodied in the confrontation clause the defendant in exercising his right of cross-examination must be allowed to \u2018expose to the jury the facts from which jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, quoting Davis v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra, 318. \u201cAlthough the scope of cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>rests generally within the discretion of the trial court, the preclusion of all inquiry upon a particular subject matter tending to show bias is erroneous.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>211 Conn. 555, 573, 560 A.2d 426 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Despite the trial court\u2019s preclusion of all inquiry on the subject, the state argues that, since there was no connection shown between the officers named by Prindle and the investigation of this case, the evidence offered was irrelevant to the existence of possible bias on the part of Prindle. We do not agree that such a connection is a prerequisite to the introduction of evidence from which jurors might infer that a witness for the state is either biased in favor of police officers in general, or, in particular, biased in favor of members of the police department whose investigation resulted in the defendant being charged with a criminal offense. \u201cPartiality, or any acts, relationships or motives reasonably likely to produce it, may be proved to impeach credibility.\u201d C. McCormick, Evidence (3d Ed.) \u00a7 40, p. 85; see C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence \u00a7 7.20.1; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>204 Conn. 377, 382, 528 A.2d 794 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>204 Conn. 156, 162, 527 A.2d 1157 (1987) (when important testimony from police officers is anticipated, such that a juror might reasonably be more, or less, inclined to credit their testimony, questions concerning whether a juror would have such an inclination are proper during voir dire).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">We find error in the trial court\u2019s ruling barring cross-examination of Prindle concerning his business dealings with various members of the West Haven police department. The defendant\u2019s attempt to show that Prindle was biased in favor of the police because of these dealings was precluded by the court\u2019s ruling. While, in the opinion of the trial court, the evidence sought to be presented may have been not particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>persuasive, its weight was a matter properly to be resolved by the jury and was not a basis for its exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">We conclude, nevertheless, that the trial court\u2019s erroneous ruling was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cThe correct inquiry is whether, assuming that the damaging potential of the cross-examination were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 684, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Milner, </em>206 Conn. 512, 529, 539 A.2d 80 (1988). Our resolution of this question involves consideration of \u201cthe importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s cas <em>e.\u201d Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>supra. Applying these factors to the instant case, we conclude that the testimony of Prindle, although damaging to the defendant, was not' a very important component of the state\u2019s proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Prindle\u2019s testimony, concerning the defendant\u2019s purchase of ammunition, was not especially significant to the state\u2019s case. Other evidence was presented from which the jurors could reasonably have concluded that the defendant had purchased the murder weapon four days prior to the victim\u2019s death. Three witnesses identified the defendant as \u201cGeorge Best,\u201d the purchaser of the .380 caliber handgun, and the ballistics tests linked that handgun to the shell casings found in the victim\u2019s automobile. With this evidence before the Jurors, Prindle\u2019s testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s purchase of .380 caliber ammunition was not of major <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>significance. Prindle\u2019s testimony, concerning the break-in at his store and the theft of his ammunition sales logbook was far less important than the ballistics evidence linking the shell casings found in the victim\u2019s car to the weapon purchased by the defendant. Moreover, this testimony concerning the break-in and theft was partially cumulative of independent evidence that the ladder used to facilitate the break-in had been taken from the defendant\u2019s place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Further, the trial court\u2019s ruling did not otherwise prevent the defendant from conducting an extensive cross-examination of Prindle. Even if the jury had been made aware of Prindle\u2019s relationship with some members of the West Haven police department as a basis for inferring bias on his part, the verdict undoubtedly would have been the same. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s erroneous ruling was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The defendant\u2019s second claim of error, denial of a fair trial due to prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments, we also find unpersuasive. The defendant bases this claim upon statements made by the prosecutor characterizing the defendant as a \u201cliar,\u201d \u201ccoward,\u201d \u201cspoiled killer with a gun,\u201d and as an individual who \u201chas no principles.\u201d The defendant also asserts that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of several of the state\u2019s witnesses, and further, expressed to the jurors his personal feelings about the case. The defendant, having failed to raise any objection at trial, concedes that he did not properly preserve this claim for review, but argues, nonetheless, that he is entitled to relief under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), or the plain error doctrine. See Practice Book \u00a7 4185.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Rule 3.4 (e) of the Rules of Professional Conduct provides that a lawyer shall not \u201c[i]n trial, allude to any matter that the lawyer does not reasonably believe is relevant or that will not be supported by admissible evidence, assert personal knowledge of facts in issue except when testifying as a witness, or state a personal opinion as to the justness of a cause, the credibility of a witness ... or the guilt or innocence of an accused.\u201d Although such invective is wholly unprofessional and has no place in a Connecticut courtroom, we conclude that the comments by the prosecutor characterizing the defendant as a liar, coward, and a person without principles were supported by the evidence presented in this case. The jurors heard the defendant testify concerning numerous lies he had told to various persons both before and after the death of the victim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this situation, it was certainly permissible for the jurors to infer, and for the prosecutor to argue, that the defendant\u2019s prior lies were relevant to the credibility of his testimony at trial. Likewise, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of the defendant as a coward was not impermissible in light of evidence that the victim was unarmed and seated in his automobile at the time he was shot. Finally, with ample evidence having been presented concerning the defendant\u2019s open and adulterous relationship with the victim\u2019s wife, we also conclude that the prosecutor was not out of bounds in arguing that the defendant was lacking in principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Nevertheless, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comment that the defendant was a \u201cspoiled killer with a gun\u201d went beyond proper argument concerning the evidence presented at trial and was, instead, a pejorative statement, implying the prosecutor\u2019s personal opinion of the guilt of the defendant, in violation of Rule 3.4 (e). \u201c \u2018No man on trial for murder can be officially characterized as a murderer or as \u201ca cold-blooded killer,\u201d until he is adjudged guilty of murder or pleads guilty to that charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 562, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985). \u201cBut that is not the end of the inquiry. Because the right implicated is the defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial, we proceed next to an examination of the remarks to determine their likely impact.\u201d Id. Our review of the record reveals that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was not part of a pattern of strident and repeated misconduct throughout the trial; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987); and did not, in and of itself, deprive the defendant of a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. James, supra, 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">We also conclude that the prosecutor made several inappropriate remarks concerning his belief in the credibility of various witnesses. For example, the prosecutor informed the jurors that witnesses for the state were \u201chonest,\u201d \u201cvery honest,\u201d \u201ccandid\u201d or \u201ctelling the truth.\u201d In addition, in response to defense counsel\u2019s argument concerning the specific time at which the defendant was seen at his place of employment on the morning of the victim\u2019s death, the prosecutor stated to the jurors, \u201cI submit to you [the state\u2019s witness is] the one that tells you the truth about sighting the defendant,\u201d and further, that he \u201cabsolutely believefd]\u201d the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u201cThe prosecutor may not express his own opinion, either directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>nesses.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 541; <em>State </em>v. <em>Boone, </em>15 Conn. App. 34, 53, 544 A.2d 217, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 811, 550 A.2d 1084 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>10 Conn. App. 361, 365, 523 A.2d 1323 (1987). While the prosecutor is permitted to .comment upon the evidence presented at trial and to argue the inferences that the jurors might draw therefrom, he is not permitted to vouch personally for the truth or veracity of the state\u2019s witnesses. \u201cThe personal evaluations and opinions of trial counsel are at best boring irrelevancies and a distasteful cliche-type argument. At worst, they may be a vague form of unsworn and irrelevant testimony.\u201d <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>402 F.2d 656, 659 (D.C. Cir. 1968). \u201cThe fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is [however,] the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 562, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983). Thus, \u201cimproper summation results in a denial of due process when the improper statements cause substantial prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>663 F.2d 1173, 1181 (2d Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Our review of the prosecutor\u2019s summation reveals that his comments that particular witnesses were \u201ctelling the truth\u201d or being \u201chonest,\u201d \u201cvery honest,\u201d or \u201ccandid,\u201d were made immediately prior to a recapitulation of the witnesses\u2019 testimony. Although objectionable and improper, these comments did not constitute serious misconduct on the part of the prosecutor. Furthermore, these comments are not a reflection of, nor does the defendant claim, a pattern of prosecutorial misconduct throughout the course of the trial. We conclude, therefore, that these comments \u201ccould not reasonably have had any significant effect on the verdict or have risen to the level of a violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>We are much more troubled, however, by the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, during his rebuttal argument, concerning his absolute belief in the testimony of one particular witness, as well as his submission to the jury that the same witness was telling the truth. Our review of the record reveals that on the morning of the victim\u2019s death, the witness in question saw the defendant at his place of employment at a time that was consistent with the defendant\u2019s commission of the murder but still allowed sufficient time for him to complete the drive to his work place. This testimony was contrary to the defendant\u2019s testimony as well as that of one of his witnesses, that he had spent the night at his work place and was seen there ten minutes earlier than the time given by the witness for the state. In these circumstances we find the prosecutor\u2019s comments concerning the truthfulness of the state\u2019s witness to be inexcusable as well as absolutely superfluous in light of the other significant evidence linking the defendant to the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Our review of the record also reveals, however, that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were occasioned, at least in part, by the actions of defense counsel, who in his own summation directly impugned the truthfulness of one of the state\u2019s witnesses, and most significantly, told the jurors that the defendant \u201cnever lied to you. He got up on that witness stand and he told the truth.\u201d While the actions of defense counsel certainly do not excuse the behavior of the prosecutor, they are to be considered in our evaluation of the prejudice, if any, suffered by the defendant as a result of the comments made by the prosecutor. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">We also note that the jurors were instructed that \u201c[ajnything that either counsel have said about the facts or evidence should be considered by you only to the extent to which their recollection agrees with yours. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>It is only your own recollections of the facts and evidence which should have weight in your deliberations.\u201d Taking into consideration the overwhelming strength of the state\u2019s case, we are not persuaded that the comments made by the prosecutor resulted in prejudice to the defendant sufficient to warrant a reversal of his conviction. This conclusion is buttressed by the defendant\u2019s failure to make any claim of prosecutorial misconduct at trial, or to object to those portions of the prosecutor\u2019s summation complained of on this appeal. Accordingly, no further review of this claim is warranted. <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides in part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\"> One girl described this clothing as a blue suit, while the other said that the person was wearing blue pants and a blue shirt.
