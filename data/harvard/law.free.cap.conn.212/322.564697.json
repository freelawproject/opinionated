The present matter is before us pursuant to our order of remand for an articulation of the trial court\u2019s disposition of the plaintiff\u2019s claim on cross appeal for attorney\u2019s fees. Id., 750-51. The trial court subsequently filed an articulation denying the plaintiff s claim for attorney\u2019s fees. We now affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">In its\u2019 cross appeal, the plaintiff claimed that the trial court erred in failing to award it reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. It argued that its right to attorney\u2019s fees is expressly provided in the language of the installment note stating that \u201c[i]n the event of default hereunder the undersigned agree to pay all costs of collection including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Because the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>court had failed to address the plaintiffs claim for attorney\u2019s fees in its original memorandum of decision, we remanded the case for further articulation on this issue alone. Id. Thereafter, the trial court filed an articulation, stating that it had denied the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees. It found that despite the guaranty instrument\u2019s express provision for recovery of attorney\u2019s fees in event of the defendants\u2019 default, the parties had not intended that the defendants were guaranteeing more than the sum of $35,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The trial court did not err in concluding that the plaintiff was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. In <em>Boxed Beef Distributors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rexton, Inc., </em>7 Conn. App. 555, 556, 509 A.2d 1060 (1986), the plaintiff obtained a personal guaranty from the defendant on the defendant\u2019s debt. The guaranty instrument provided that the guaranty would be for a maximum of $20,000, and also provided that the defendant would be liable for \u201c \u2018any costs of collection thereof including but not limited to attorney fees.\u2019 \u201d Id., 558-59. The Appellate Court held that the trial court erred in awarding the plaintiff costs of collection. Id., 560. \u201c[T]he costs of suit incurred by the plaintiff in obtaining its judgment against the corporation and [the guarantor] cannot be added to [the guarantor\u2019s] indebtedness if doing so would exceed the limit placed upon his guaranty. The terms of the guaranty included, as part of [the guarantor\u2019s] obligation thereunder, the costs of collection. That same guaranty, however, specifically limited [the.guarantor\u2019s] liability to $20,000. Thus, by the express terms of the guaranty, costs of collection are subject to the limitation in the guaranty since no distinction with respect to the maximum obligation is made between the principal debt and the costs of collection.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The \u201cinstallment note\u201d in the present case did not indicate whether the defendants would be liable for $35,000 exclusive or inclusive of costs of collection and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees. The trial court, however, may have reasonably determined that the guaranty agreement in toto, as evidenced by the \u201cinstallment note\u201d and the oral communications of the parties, subjected the defendants\u2019 liability for costs of collection and attorney\u2019s fees to the $35,000 limitation. <em>Boxed Beef Distributors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rexton, Inc., </em>supra. The trial court expressly found that the \u201cdefendants never intended to guarantee more than the sum of $35,000.00.\u201d The question of the parties\u2019 intent was a question of fact. The plaintiff\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Boxed Beef Distributors, Inc., </em>from the present case on the ground that the language in the \u201cinstallment note\u201d did not specifically limit liability to $35,000 is an attempt to relitigate this question of fact. On the basis of the evidence relied on by the trial court in its memorandum of decision and subsequent articulation, we cannot conclude that the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
