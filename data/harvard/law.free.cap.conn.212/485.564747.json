See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vallas, </em>16 Conn. App. 245, 547 A.2d 903 (1988). We granted the defendants\u2019 petition for certification limited to the narrow question whether, under applicable provisions of the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act, General Statutes \u00a7 54-41d et seq., the wiretap panel\u2019s failure to make a written determination of probable cause that a \u201cspecial need\u201d existed to intercept wire communications over a public telephone requires the suppression of evidence of those communications. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vallas, </em>210 Conn. 803, 554 A.2d 744 (1989). We affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The relevant facts are as follows. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vallas, </em>supra, 16 Conn. App. 248-50, 256. On January 28, 1986, the state\u2019s attorney for the judicial district of New Haven applied to the state judicial wiretap panel for authorization to intercept the telephonic communications made by specified known and unknown persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>to and from telephone facilities located at Calash\u2019s Branford residence. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-41b.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The supporting affidavit, submitted by state police detective William Schaeffer, Jr., and Branford police department detective George Nobile, alleged that Calash was involved in a cocaine trafficking network. The investigators sought the wiretap order to aid in discovering the source of the cocaine and the configuration of the distribution network. According to the affidavit, Schaeffer and Nobile had been unsuccessful in obtaining evidence by other means of surveillance or by the use of undercover police officers. On January 31, 1986, the judicial wiretap panel issued order 86-01, authorizing the interception of communications over two telephones in the Calash home from January 31 to February 14,1986. The Calash phones were tapped from January 31 to February 11,1986, when the interceptions were terminated because of information received by the state police that Calash had moved to Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The intercepted conversations together with other information indicated that Calash and Girolomoni were business partners in the Rendezvous Cafe located in Branford, and that when Calash left for Florida, he authorized Girolomoni to handle the cocaine business along with running the cafe. Because of information gleaned from police surveillance, informants and wiretap order 86-01, the state police decided to seek additional wiretap orders. On February 20,1986, the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>attorney, relying on additional affidavits submitted by Schaeffer and Nobile, made two applications to the judicial wiretap panel. On February 26, 1986, the judicial wiretap panel issued order 86-03, authorizing interception of communications to and from a telephone in Girolomoni\u2019s Branford home from February 26 to March 12, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">On that same day, the panel also issued order 86-04, the order at issue in this appeal. Order 86-04 authorized interception of communications to and from two telephones, one private and one public, located at the Rendezvous Cafe, from February 26 to March 12,1986. Order 86-04 expressly indicated that the panel had found probable cause to authorize the wiretap of both telephones with respect to eight of the nine probable cause requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 54-41d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>These included the panel\u2019s express findings that there was probable cause to believe that the defendants and others unknown were committing the specified narcotics offenses, that interception of communications over both telephones would provide material evidence that those crimes were being committed, that \u201cother normal investigative procedures with respect to the offenses have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous to employ,\u201d and that both telephones were being used in the commission of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In correspondence with subsection (7) of \u00a7 54-41d, the panel also expressly stated in item B (7) of its order that \u201cone of the facilities from which the wire communication is to be intercepted is public and the other facility is not public.\u201d The order made no express reference, however, as to whether the panel had found probable cause to believe that a \u201cspecial need exists to intercept wire communications over\u201d the public telephone. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-41d (7).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 54-41e,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the order concluded that \u201c[t]his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>order shall be executed as soon as practicable, shall be conducted in such a way as to minimize the interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception . . . and shall terminate upon attainment of the authorized objective ... or in any event within 15 days next succeeding the date of issuance of this order.\u201d Thereafter, the investigators intercepted communications pursuant to orders 86-03 and 86-04. The investigators included conversations intercepted under all three orders in affidavits filed in support of the arrest warrant applications. The defendants subsequently were arrested and charged with the narcotics offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Prior to trial, the defendants moved to suppress evidence obtained from the wiretap conducted pursuant to order 86-04. In their motions, Calash and Vallas spe-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>eifically claimed that the wiretap order was unlawful because the panel had failed to make a finding that there was probable cause to believe that a \u201cspecial need\u201d existed to tap the public telephone. Vallas and Rogers also specifically claimed that order 86-04 was facially invalid since it contained no express finding of special need. The trial court rejected these arguments. It ruled that although the panel had found that the telephone was public, the panel was not required under \u00a7\u00a7 54-41d or 54-41e to determine whether the subject facility is public or, if so, whether there is probable cause to believe that there is a special need to tap it. The court found, nevertheless, that the underlying affidavit, \u201cincorporated in the order, contained sufficient facts to warrant a determination and finding by the panel of probable cause that a special need existed.\u201d It concluded that \u201c[tjhe nature and use of the public telephone in the small bar involved here clearly warranted the authorized interception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, all defendants claimed that order 86-04 was facially invalid for failing to contain a written statement that the panel had found a \u201cspecial need\u201d to tap the public telephone. In addition, Girolomoni argued that the accompanying affidavit contained inadequate information to support a finding of probable cause of special need. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vallas, </em>supra, 16 Conn. App. 253-54. The Appellate Court rejected both claims, and affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the motions to suppress. It held that, although \u00a7 54-41d (7) requires the panel to find that there is probable cause \u201cto believe that a special need exists to intercept wire communications over public facilitiesf, tjhere is no statutory requirement contained ... in that section or in \u00a7 54-41e . . . mandating a <em>written </em>finding of special need.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 254-55. It ruled, further, that the \u201cissuance of order 86-04 carries with it the implicit conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the statutory criteria [have] been met.\u201d Id., 256. The court also concluded that the affidavit submitted with the application for order 86-04 supported a finding of probable cause to believe that a special need existed to intercept the public telephone conversations. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">On certification to this court, the defendants renew their claim that \u00a7\u00a7 54-41d and 54-41e require the wiretap panel to make an express written finding of \u201cspecial need.\u201d According to this argument, \u00a7 54-41e requires, at a minimum, a pro forma written statement that fully tracks the statutory language of \u00a7 54-41d (1) through (9). The defendants argue, therefore, that the absence of a written finding of special need constitutes an \u201cunlawful\u201d and a \u201cfacially invalid\u201d order requiring suppression under General Statutes \u00a7 54-41m,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> even if the wiretap panel did, in fact, have probable cause to find a \u201cspecial need.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Contrary to the trial court\u2019s conclusion, \u00a7 54-41d (7) plainly requires the issuing panel to find probable cause that a special need exists to intercept public facility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>communications. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chiarizio, </em>8 Conn. App. 673, 678-79, 514 A.2d 370, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 809, 515 A.2d 379 (1986) (where nothing in affidavit indicates that facility was public, panel\u2019s order referring to finding of probable cause of special need \u201cif applicable\u201d did not render order facially invalid). That section provides that the panel may issue an ex parte order \u201cauthorizing the interception of wire communications ... if the panel determines on the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant that there is probable cause to believe that ... (7) if the facilities from which a wire communication is to be intercepted are public, a special need exists to intercept wire communications over such facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Whether the panel\u2019s finding of probable cause under \u00a7 54-41d (7) must be in writing is less clear. The required contents of the panel\u2019s order are set forth in \u00a7 54-41e. \u201cEach order authorizing the interception of any wire communication shall be accompanied by a written statement of the issuing panel setting forth in detail its determination made in accordance with the provisions of section 54-41d and the grounds therefor and shall specify: (1) The identity of the person, if known . . . .\u201d Section 54-41e thereafter lists ten more items that the issuing panel must specify in its written order.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> None of the eleven items specified in \u00a7 54-41e refers to the necessity of making a \u201cwritten statement\u201d that, if the subject facility is public, the panel has found probable cause of a special need to intercept such communications. Further, nothing in \u00a7 54-41d indicates that the probable cause finding of special need must be in writing. The defendants nevertheless argue that the prefatory language of \u00a7 54-41e, stating that the written statement shall set forth \u201cin detail [the panel\u2019s] determination made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>accordance with the provisions of section 54-41d and the grounds therefor,\u201d establishes that the panel must make an express written statement of the finding of probable cause of special need under \u00a7 54-41d (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">We find it unnecessary to address whether \u00a7\u00a7 54-41d and 54-41e, when read together, require a <em>written </em>statement that the panel had found probable cause of a special need to intercept communications over a public telephone. Even if we assume that those sections do require such a written statement, we are persuaded that the absence of such a written statement in the present case does not require suppression under \u00a7 54-41m.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Section 54-41m provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny aggrieved person . . . may move to suppress the contents of any intercepted wire communication, or evidence derived therefrom, on the grounds that the communication was unlawfully intercepted under the provisions of this chapter; [and] the order of authorization or approval under which it was intercepted is insufficient on its face . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In interpreting Connecticut\u2019s wiretapping statutes, this court has in the past relied on federal case law interpreting cognate provisions of the federal statutes relating to the interception of wire communications, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510 et seq. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>191 Conn. 360, 380, 464 A.2d 799 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1006, 104 S. Ct. 999, 79 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Assuntino, </em>180 Conn. 345, 350-51, 429 A.2d 900 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>176 Conn. 17, 25, 404 A.2d 873 (1978). While it is true \u201cthat our own wiretap statute is in many ways more stringent than the federal act\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 371; id., 372 (minimization provisions stricter); the lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>guage of the suppression sections in both is virtually identical. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518 (10) (a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, we are properly guided by federal interpretation of the parallel suppression provisions of the federal wiretap statutes. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The decisions of the United States Supreme Court and other courts demonstrate that suppression of otherwise relevant and admissible evidence for \u201cunlawfulness\u201d or \u201cfacial insufficiency\u201d is not required for every facial defect in an interception order. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>429 U.S. 413, 433-34, 97 S. Ct. 658, 50 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chavez, </em>416 U.S. 562, 574-75, 94 S. Ct. 1849, 40 L. Ed. 2d 380 (1974); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vento, </em>533 F.2d 838, 860-61 (3d Cir. 1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vigi, </em>515 F.2d 290, 293 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 912, 96 S. Ct. 215, 46 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1975); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>436 N.W.2d 758, 767 (Minn. 1989). \u201c[T]he United States Supreme Court [has] delineated the standard for suppression in terms of whether the breached statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>requirement \u2018directly and substantially implements] the congressional intention to limit the use of intercept procedures to those situations clearly calling for the employment of this extraordinary investigative device.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Giordano, </em>416 U.S. 505, 527, 94 S. Ct. 1820, 40 L. Ed. 2d 341 [1974]; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>[supra, 435]. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chavez, </em>[supra, 575] . . . the court determined that a failure to abide by a requirement which \u2018[does] not affect the fulfillment of any of the reviewing or approval functions required by Congress\u2019 [does] not require suppression.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 25. Further, as <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant </em>makes clear, this inquiry applies to all grounds for suppression under \u00a7 54-41m. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">On the basis of its analysis of <em>Giordano </em>and <em>Chavez, </em>the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has articulated a more particularized test to determine whether suppression is warranted. \u201c[T]he court\u2019s inquiry should be directed toward determining, among other things, whether the particular procedure involved is a central or functional safeguard to prevent abuses in electronic surveillance as opposed to a procedural or reporting mechanism; <em>[United States </em>v. <em>Chavez, </em>supra, 578]; whether the purpose that the particular procedure was designed to effect has been accomplished in spite of the error; (id. at 575); and, whether the statutory require- ' ment was deliberately ignored and, if so, whether this was done to gain an unfair tactical advantage. (Id. at 572-73).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>367 Mass. 224, 269-70, 327 N.E.2d 819 (1975); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>supra, 434-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">We first note that the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress on the ground that the \u201ccommunication was unlawfully intercepted under\u201d the wiretap statute is inapplicable to the present case. As in the federal statute, the \u201cunlawful interception\u201d and \u201cfacial insufficiency\u201d grounds are distinctly stated in our wiretap statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>and therefore contemplate distinct varieties of violations. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>supra, 432 n.22 (supression remedy provides alternative grounds of suppression); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chavez, </em>supra, 575 (not every failure to follow statutory procedures requires suppression for \u201cunlawful interception\u201d; otherwise, grounds of facial insufficiency and nonconforming execution would be superfluous). There may be instances in which the form or execution of the order implicate more than one ground of suppression. The crux of the present defendants\u2019 argument, however, is that the absence of a written finding of probable cause to believe that a special need existed to tap a public telephone would require suppression even if there was, in fact, probable cause for such a belief. While the interception of communications without probable cause would constitute an \u201cunlawful interception\u201d; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>194 Conn. 447, 481 A.2d 730 (1984); the absence of an express written probable cause statement, where probable cause does in fact exist, reasonably implicates only an \u201capproval . . . which ... is insufficient on its face.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-41m.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Appyling the analysis of <em>Giordano </em>and <em>Chavez, </em>supra, we conclude that order 86-04\u2019s lack of a written statement concerning \u201cspecial need\u201d does not require suppression on the ground that the order was facially defective. There is no doubt that \u00a7 54-41d\u2019s requirement that the judicial panel find probable cause to believe that there is a special need to intercept public facility communications \u201c \u2018directly and substantially implement[s] the congressional intention to limit the use of intercept procedures to those situations clearly calling for the employment of this extraordinary investigative device.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Giordano, </em>supra; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 459-60 (panel\u2019s determination of probable cause under \u00a7 54-41d is subject to \u201cpenetrating review\u201d since probable cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>requirement expresses legislature\u2019s efforts to fully protect implicated privacy values). The requirement of a <em>written </em>determination of such a finding, however, surely is more akin to a procedural or reporting mechanism than to a substantive limitation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>supra. Further, while a written finding of special need provides some indication of the panel\u2019s findings, we are not persuaded that the absence of such a written statement impairs \u201c \u2018the fulfillment of any of the reviewing or approval functions [of the authorizing entity] required by Congress\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chavez, </em>supra. The wiretap panel\u2019s factual determination that there is probable cause to believe that a special need exists to tap a public facility necessarily precedes its entry of any written statement under \u00a7 54-41e. On the other hand, the existence of a written statement of special need alone does not ensure that there was, in fact, probable cause to believe that a special need existed to tap a public facility. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We further note that the absence of such a finding is fundamentally different from the absence of a written statement in the order directing the investigators to minimize interceptions or to terminate interceptions at the required time. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra. There can be no question that the minimization and termination provisions\u2014provisions expressly required to be in writing under \u00a7 54-41e\u2014implement substantive limitations on the execution of this \u201cextraordinary investigative device.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Giordano, </em>supra. Assuming, however, that the supporting material and affidavits in any particular case support a finding of probable cause to believe that a special need exists to tap a public telephone, the added requirement of a \u201cwritten statement\u201d reflecting that finding has no impact on whether \u201cthis extraordinary device\u201d has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>been appropriately authorized. Further, such a written finding obviously places no conditions on the execution of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Even if we assume that a written statement of the required \u00a7 54-41d (7) finding is a \u201ccentral or functional safeguard to prevent abuses in electronic surveillance\u201d; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>supra; it is apparent that the purposes of a written finding of special need were fully satisfied in this case, despite the absence of such a written statement. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chavez, </em>supra, 575; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>supra. \u201cThe purpose of the statutory requirement that the panel set forth in detail its grounds for the issuance of the order is two-fold: (1) to ensure that the panel will give its full attention to the issue of whether an order should issue; and (2) to permit a reasonable review by the trial court or an appellate court of the propriety of the order.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Chiarizio, </em>supra, 683. In the present case, the Appellate Court held that the panel\u2019s issuance of order 86-04 carried \u201cwith it the implicit conclusion that the statutory criteria [have] been met.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vallas, </em>supra, 16 Conn. App. 256. While we agree with the defendant that uniform application of this proposition would effectively negate the language of \u00a7 54-41e requiring a \u201cwritten statement. . . setting forth in detail [the] determination made in accordance with . . . section 54-41d and the grounds therefor,\u201d we need not rely on so far-reaching a rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">As noted above, the panel\u2019s written statement in the order did \u201ctrack\u201d the language of \u00a7 54-41d, and the findings made in the order corresponded to the statute\u2019s numbering system. In item (B) (7) of the order, the panel stated that \u201cone of the facilities from which the wire communication is to be intercepted is public and the other facility is not public.\u201d Although that written statement did not \u201ctrack\u201d verbatim the language of \u00a7 54-41d (7) respecting \u201cspecial need,\u201d the panel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>indication in item (B) (7) of its order that one of the facilities was public is strong inferential evidence that the panel was aware of the requirements of \u00a7 54-41d (7) and made the proper findings. Cf. <em>Rosenblit </em>v. <em>Danaher, </em>206 Conn. 125, 134, 537 A.2d 145 (1988) (unless contrary appears, appellate court entitled to presume that trial court acted properly, \u201cincluding considering the applicable legal principles\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the panel\u2019s failure to state in writing that it had found a \u201cspecial need\u201d undermined the statute\u2019s objective of ensuring that the panel give plenary consideration to the pertinent probable cause inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">This conclusion is reinforced by the record, which adequately supports a finding of probable cause to believe that a special need existed to tap the public telephone. In stating that a written statement of the \u00a7 54-41d findings enables the trial court or an appellate court to review the panel\u2019s actions, the Appellate Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Chiarizio, </em>supra, recognized that the legality of the order must be evaluated in light of the affidavits submitted in support of the wiretap application. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 460-68 (testing sufficiency of wiretap order by reference to underlying affidavit). In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>present case, Schaeffer and Nobile asserted in their affidavit that, through their own investigation and from information given to them from other police officers, they had concluded that Girolomoni and Calash were engaged in the sale of narcotics with others using the two telephones in the Rendezvous Cafe. The affiants also disclosed that they had previously set up a \u201ccontrolled buy\u201d with Girolomoni to take place at the cafe, and that the controlled buy subsequently did, in fact, take place there. Pursuant to wiretap order 86-01, investigators intercepted five telephone calls made from the public telephone to Calash\u2019s residence over four days in early February, 1986. Further, on two occasions, an undercover police officer working in the cafe answered the public telephone, during which the caller had asked for Girolomoni. In addition, Robert Iaquessa, a \u201cdoor man\u201d at the cafe, had been identified as involved in narcotics conversations intercepted under order 86-01. On the basis of these facts, we agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court did not err in determining that the affidavit supported a finding of probable cause to believe that there was a special need to intercept communications over the public telephone. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vallas, </em>supra, 16 Conn. App. 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Finally, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the affiants attempted to disguise the fact that one of the target telephones in the cafe was a public telephone, or that any unfair tactical advantage was either attempted or gained. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chavez, </em>supra, 572-73; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>supra. Indeed, in addition to disclosing that the telephone was public, the affiants informed the panel that the general public routinely used the telephone. Accordingly, the affiants established that \u201cinterceptions of conversations on [the public] facility . . . will only be conducted when it can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>be established that one or more of the principals named in the affidavit are on the premises of the Rendezvous Cafe ... or that an incoming call is being made by one of the principals named in this affidavit. ... No interception of conversations over [the public] facility . . . will be made unless those requirements are fulfilled.\u201d Further, as noted above, the wiretap panel\u2019s order directed the investigators to comply with the minimization provisions of the wiretap statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The defendants included in their motions to suppress the claim that investigators failed \u201cto properly minimize non-pertinent telephone conversations occurring over . . . public telephones.\u201d The trial court found, however, that in executing order 86-04, the investigators only monitored calls on the public telephone when a principal was present at the cafe. The defendants did not appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of their motions on the ground of improper minimization. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vallas, </em>supra, 16 Conn. App. 250-51. We agree with the defendants that the \u201cminimization\u201d requirements of the statute are distinct from the \u201cspecial need\u201d requirement regarding public facilities. We are persuaded, however, that actual attainment of the privacy objectives implicit in \u00a7 54-41d\u2019s requirement of \u201cspecial need\u201d to tap a public facility is relevant in determining whether the absence of a written statement of a finding of \u201cspecial need\u201d constitutes reversible error. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chavez, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>supra; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 364, 380-81 (holding that state\u2019s effort or lack of effort to minimize interceptions will have impact on whether evidence should be suppressed in part or in toto).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Appellate Court did not err in holding that the wiretap panel\u2019s failure to make a written determination of special need under \u00a7 54-41d (7) was not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In this opinion Callahan, Covello and Santaniello, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 21a-277 (a) provides: \u201cpenalty for ILLEGAL MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION, SALE, PRESCRIPTION, DISPENSING, (a) Any person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any controlled substance which is a hallucinogenic substance other than marihuana, or a narcotic substance, except as authorized in this chapter, for a first offense, shall be imprisoned not more than fifteen years and may be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars or be both fined and imprisoned and for each subsequent offense, shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than one hundred thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of conspiracy when, with intent that conduct constituting a crime be performed, he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct, and any one of them commits an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 21a-279.

J., with whom Shea and Hull, Js.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIpS\">join dissenting. I respectfully dissent. Our legislature has enacted wiretap statutes that impose strict limitations on electronic surveillance. Until today, we have regularly obeyed both the letter and the spirit of these statutes, requiring strict compliance with their procedural and substantive mandates. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>194 Conn. 447, 458-59, 481 A.2d 730 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>191 Conn. 360, 372, 464 A.2d 799 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1006, 104 S. Ct. 999, 79 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Assuntino, </em>180 Conn. 345, 349, 429 A.2d 900 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>176 Conn. 17, 25-26 n.3, 404 A.2d 873 (1978). No reason has been advanced why, in this case, we should depart from this well-beaten path.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The statutes that are involved in these proceedings contain unmistakable instructions for the issuance of wiretap orders. Three features of these statutes are of particular significance: (1) the issuance of wiretap orders requires a judicial determination of probable cause by the unanimous vote of a three judge panel; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41b, 54-41d; (2) a wiretap order for a public telephone requires a judicial determination of probable cause that \u201ca special need exists to intercept wire communications over such facilities\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 54-41d (7); and (3) wiretap orders must be \u201caccompanied by a written statement <em>of the issuing panel </em>setting forth <em>in detail </em>its determination made in accordance with the provisions of section 54-41d <em>and the grounds therefor </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 54-41e.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The statement of the wiretap panel that issued order 86-04 did not, on its face, comply with these statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>provisions. Although the panel\u2019s statement tracked the other requirements of \u00a7 54-41d, with respect to \u00a7 54-41d (7), it made no mention whatsoever of a special need to intercept, noting only that \u201cone of the facilities from which the wire communication is to be intercepted is public and the other is not public.\u201d Despite this obvious deviation from the mandates of \u00a7\u00a7 54-41e and 54-41d (7), the majority opinion concludes that the wiretap order was nonetheless valid and enforceable. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The majority opinion assigns great weight to its conclusion that the affidavits presented to the wiretap panel would have established a factual foundation of a finding of probable cause that there was a special need to wiretap a public telephone. I think this argument puts the cart before the horse. If the issue were simply the sufficiency of the affidavits, then the role of the judicial panel that issues wiretap orders would be that of ministerial functionaries, charged only with checking out the investigatory enterprise of the police. That is not the law. This court, and the Supreme Court of the United States, have repeatedly emphasized the significance of the interposition of an <em>independent </em>judicial determination that particularized circumstances warrant a search and seizure that would otherwise be constitutionally suspect. <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States District Court for the F.D. of Michigan, S.D., 407 </em>U.S. 297, 317, 92 S. Ct. 2125, 32 L. Ed. 2d 752 (1972); <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 356-57, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 376; <em>State </em>v. <em>Assuntino, </em>supra, 352. The question before us is what the wiretap panel did and not what it might have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The majority opinion concludes that the statutory mandate for a written finding of a special need to wiretap a public telephone is not especially compelling because the statutory requirement is more procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>than substantive. We have, however, strictly construed even the purely procedural requirements of our wiretap statutes, such as the need to produce affidavits under oath. <em>State </em>v. <em>Assuntino, </em>supra, 352-54; <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 26. Further, the legislature was entitled, as a matter of public policy, to decide that the wiretap of a public telephone carried with it a significant potential for intrusion into private conversations unrelated to the crime or crimes that the police were legitimately investigating. Balancing the risk of unwarranted intrusion against the risk of undue interference with criminal investigations, the legislature chose to impose a requirement for public telephone wiretaps that went beyond the requirements that otherwise govern the electronic interception of communications. I would characterize this legislative mandate as imposing a substantive constraint on the issuance of a wiretap order. Whatever the proper characterization, however, the imposition of an additional constraint bears evidence of a legislative differentiation between an ordinary wiretap and a public telephone wiretap to which, under familiar principles of statutory construction, we must defer. <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>432 U.S. 464, 479, 97 S. Ct. 2376, 53 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bunkley, </em>202 Conn. 629, 640, 572 A.2d 793 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>198 Conn. 273, 282, 502 A.2d 911 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Finally, the language employed by the wiretap panel in issuing order 86-04 manifests no awareness of its statutory obligation to make a reasoned determination of a special need to wiretap a public telephone. I am entirely unpersuaded that the panel\u2019s statement that \u201cone of the facilities from which the wire communication is to be intercepted is public\u201d is the functional equivalent of a \u201cwritten statement . . . setting forth in detail . . . [the] determination\u201d that \u201ca special need exists to intercept wire communications over [public] facilities.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41e, 54-41d (7). More <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>likely, the panel\u2019s statement merely reflected the affi-ants\u2019 disclosure of the public nature of one of the telephones that the police sought to wiretap. This disclosure should have triggered a further inquiry into \u201cspecial need,\u201d but there is no \u201cwritten evidence\u201d that it did so. Our customary strict construction of the mandates of our wiretap statutes requires the conclusion that this wiretap order was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">For these reasons, in my view the Appellate Court should have found error in the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress the evidence of communications obtained pursuant to wiretap order 86-04 insofar as those communications were intercepted from a public telephone. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
