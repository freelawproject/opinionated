On January 6,1986, both the Red Hill Coalition, Inc., and the CFE intervened in the administrative proceedings pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a). According to the coalition and the CFE the subdivi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>sion and subsequent development of the land in question would result \u201cin the irreversible elimination of major portions of prime agricultural land. . . .\u2019\u2019Public hearings were held by the TPZ on June 25, 1986, and July 15,1986, at which it heard testimony regarding the proposed subdivision from the corporation, the plaintiffs and members of the general public. At the close of the public hearings, the TPZ did not take action on the corporation\u2019s application because it was awaiting a report from the Glastonbury conservation commission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On September 3, 1986, having received a favorable-report from the conservation commission concerning the development proposed by the corporation, the TPZ held a public meeting at which time additional comments were received from the corporation. Although the coalition and Fitzgerald were present at this final meeting, the CFE and Steffens did not attend. Subsequently, the TPZ conditionally approved the corporation\u2019s application, allowing the land to be subdivided into thirty lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">On September 24, 1986, the plaintiffs appealed the decision of the TPZ to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 8-28 (a), amended by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Public Acts 1985, No. 85-284, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In a memorandum of decision dated October 11,1988, the trial court upheld the TPZ\u2019s approval of the corporation\u2019s subdivision application. Shortly thereafter, the coalition, Fitzgerald and Steffens filed a petition for certification to appeal in the Appellate Court. The CFE also filed a petition for certification. The Appellate Court granted both petitions on December 8, 1988. We subsequently transferred both appeals to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and, because the issues involved are identical, have consolidated them for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a) provides that \u201c[i]n any administrative . . . proceeding . . . any person . . . may intervene as a party on the filing of a verified pleading asserting that the proceeding or action for judicial review involves conduct which has, or which is reasonably likely to have, the effect of unreasonably polluting, impairing or destroying the public trust in the air, water or <em>other natural resources </em>of the state.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In the present appeal the plaintiffs claim as the basis for intervention that the land in question is prime agricultural land. Arguing that agricultural land is a natural resource, the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>contend that (1) they had a right to intervene in the TPZ proceedings under \u00a7 22a-19 (a), and (2) by virtue of their intervention in those proceedings under \u00a7 22a-19 (a), the TPZ was required under \u00a7 22a-19 (b) to consider any unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction of the alleged agricultural land being subdivided, and to explore all feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed subdivision that would preserve some or all of the agricultural land in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The defendants contend that the appeals of those plaintiffs whose standing is based solely upon their status as petitioners under \u00a7 22a-19 (a) should be dismissed because (1) the statute does not authorize intervention in a subdivision application proceeding conducted by a municipal planning commission, and (2) the legislature never intended that the term \u201cother natural resources,\u201d the alleged pollution, impairment or destruction of which authorizes intervention, include \u201cprime agricultural land,\u201d the basis relied upon in the petitions to intervene filed by the plaintiffs. Although we agree with the plaintiffs that they had the right to intervene under \u00a7 22a-19 (a) in order to raise the environmental issues alleged in their petitions, we agree with the defendants that the term \u201cnatural resources\u201d as used in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>statute does not include agricultural land. Accordingly, we conclude that the TPZ was not required to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation of pollution, impairment or destruction of agricultural land pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19 (b) or the availability of reasonable alternatives to the proposed subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Contrary to the defendants\u2019 position, \u00a7 22a-19 (a) does authorize intervention in a subdivision review proceeding conducted by a municipal planning commission. It plainly provides that intervention is authorized in <em>\u201cany </em>administrative, licensing or other proceeding, and in any judicial review thereof made available by law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Proceedings before planning and zoning commissions are classified as administrative. See, e.g., <em>Vose </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>171 Conn. 480, 483, 370 A.2d 1026 (1976). Accordingly, the plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7 22a-19 (a) permits intervention in proceedings conducted by a municipal planning commission. <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 133, 141, 509 A.2d 1050 (1986). \u201c Tt is well settled that a statute must be applied as its words direct. . . .\u2019 \u2018Where the language used is clear and unambiguous, we will not speculate as to some supposed intention. . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>The defendants\u2019 additional argument that the plaintiffs were not entitled to intervene pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19 (a) because agricultural land is not a natural resource puts the cart before the horse. Section 22a-19 (a) makes intervention a matter of right once a verified pleading is filed complying with the statute, whether or not those allegations ultimately prove to be unfounded. We have declared that the statute \u201cpermits any person, on the filing of a verified pleading, to intervene in any administrative proceeding for the limited purpose of raising environmental issues.\u201d <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>192 Conn. 247, 248 n.2, 470 A.2d 1214 (1984). In <em>Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>175 Conn. 483, 490, 400 A.2d 726 (1978), we concluded that one who filed a verified pleading under \u00a7 22a-19 (a) became a party to an administrative proceeding upon doing so and had \u201cstatutory standing to appeal for the limited purpose of raising environmental issues.\u201d \u201cIt is clear that one basic purpose of the act is to give persons standing to bring actions to protect the environment.\u201d <em>Belford </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>170 Conn. 46, 53-54, 364 A.2d 194 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">We agree with the trial court that the plaintiffs, being entitled under \u00a7 22a-19 (a) to intervene for the purpose of raising environmental issues on the basis of the allegations of their verified pleadings, had standing to appeal from the action of the TPZ in approving the subdivision application.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the TPZ failed to comply with the edict of \u00a7 22a-19 (b) to \u201cconsider the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction of the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state,\u201d as well as feasible alternatives to the proposed subdivision, raises the issue of whether agricultural land or \u201cprime agricultural land\u201d as alleged, constitutes a natural resource within the intention of the statute. The duty of an administrative agency under \u00a7 22a-19 (b) is limited to the consideration of the effects of a proposal upon \u201cair, water or other natural resources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">In determining whether agricultural land is a natural resource under \u00a7 22a-19, we note that \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective in construing a statute is to carry out the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>201 Conn. 115, 118, 513 A.2d 139, cert. denied sub nom. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>479 U.S. 964, 107 S. Ct. 466, 93 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1986). \u201cAs is true in every case involving the construction of a statute, our starting point must be the language employed by the legislature.\u201d Ver<em>don </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>187 Conn. 363, 366, 446 A.2d 3 (1982). Agricultural land is not specifically referred to in \u00a7 22a-19 (a). Therefore, to determine whether the legislature meant to include agricultural land within the term \u201cnatural resources,\u201d we turn to the statute\u2019s legislative history and other extrinsic sources to attempt to ascertain the intent of the legislature. <em>Caltabiano </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>211 Conn. 662, 667, 560 A.2d 975 (1989); <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986). A perusal of the legislative history of \u00a7 22a-19 fails to disclose any indication of an intent to include agricultural land within the term \u201cnatural resources of the state.\u201d See generally 14 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1971 Sess., pp. 1082-97; 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., pp. 733-65. Moreover, agricultural land is not mentioned in any other section of the Environmental Protection Act (EPA). General Statutes \u00a7 22a-14 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>The legislature\u2019s failure to provide for agricultural land in \u00a7 22a-19 or in any other section of the EPA is significant because in other statutes where the legislature has chosen to protect agricultural land it has done so expressly. For example, the Agricultural Protection Act; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22-26aa through 22-26\u00dc; and General Statutes \u00a7 12-107a, which affords owners of farmland a form of tax relief, both recognize the importance of farm and agricultural land and make special provisions to protect it. Furthermore, General Statutes \u00a7 22a-l, which is part of the Environmental Policy Act; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-1 through 22a-13; specifically states that \u201cair, water, <em>land </em>and other natural resources\u201d (emphasis added) are, as a general policy, to be conserved and protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Given this background, we believe that if the legislature had desired to include agricultural land as a natural resource and thus to trigger the application of \u00a7 22a-19 (b) of the EPA it would have explicitly so provided. <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>192 Conn. 591, 596, 473 A.2d 787 (1984). \u201cAbsent such language by the legislature, this court cannot \u2018engraft amendments into the statutory language.\u2019 <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>[184 Conn. 317, 325, 439 A.2d 1008 (1981)]; <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners. in Podiatry, </em>[208 Conn. 709, 727, 546 A.2d 830 (1988)]. ... As we have stated in numerous other cases, \u2018it is not the province of a court to supply what the legislature chose to omit. The legislature is supreme in the area of legislation, and the courts must apply statutory enactments according to their plain terms.\u2019 <em>Federal Aviation Administration </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>[196 Conn. 546, 549-50, 494 A.2d 564 (1985)]; <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, Illinois, </em>179 Conn. 102, 107, 425 A.2d 588 (1979); <em>Weingarten </em>v. <em>All</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number><em>state Ins. Co., </em>169 Conn. 502, 507-508, 363 A.2d 1055 (1975).\u201d <em>Glastonbury Co. </em>v. <em>Gillies, </em>209 Conn. 175, 181, 550 A.2d 8 (1988).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">Furthermore, we note that \u201c \u2018[i]n construing a statute, common sense must be used and courts will assume that [the legislature intended to accomplish] a reasonable and rational result . . . .\u2019 <em>Norwich Land Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>170 Conn. 1, 4, 363 A.2d 1386 (1975).\u201d <em>Caltabiano </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 667. \u201cThe unreasonableness of the result obtained by the acceptance of one possible alternative interpretation of an act is a reason for rejecting that interpretation in favor of another which would provide a result that is reasonable. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>380 U.S. 563, 571, 85 S. Ct. 1162, 14 L. Ed. 2d 75 (1965); <em>Citerella </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>158 Conn. 600, 609, 266 A.2d 382 (1969); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>180 Conn. 557, 563, 429 A.2d 960 (1980). \u2018When two constructions are possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>ble, courts will adopt the one which makes the [statute] effective and workable, and not one that leads to difficult and possibly bizarre results.\u2019 <em>Muller </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>145 Conn. 325, 331, 142 A.2d 524 (1958); <em>see Milano </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>166 Conn. 178, 187, 348 A.2d 590 (1974).\u201d <em>Maciejewski </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>194 Conn. 139, 151-52, 480 A.2d 519 (1984). If we were to interpret \u201cnatural resources\u201d in \u00a7 22a-19 to include agricultural land we would potentially be requiring the consideration of alternatives pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19 (b) for every subdivision application in the state.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We will not presume that the legislature intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The plaintiffs attempt to mitigate the negative implications of holding agricultural land to be a natural resource under \u00a7 22a-19 by arguing that a decision favorable to them in this case would not stand for the proposition that \u00a7 22a-19 (b) would be applicable in all subdivision proceedings, but rather, only in those involving prime agricultural land. What the plaintiffs have overlooked, however, is that whether land is prime agricultural land is a question of fact because neither the legislature, nor any other state agency, has mapped out and designated certain areas of the state as \u201cagricultural land.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, if we were to adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, it would be possible for any person or group to claim that \u00a7 22a-19 (b) applies to any subdivision proceeding or judicial review thereof in which agricultural land may possibly be destroyed thereby requiring the factfinder to take evidence and determine whether such land is indeed involved. Further, in making its factual finding, the planning commission or court would probably be obliged to apply General Statutes \u00a7 22-3 (b) or \u00a7 22-26bb (a), which are the only statutory definitions of agricultural land existing to date. The sections are similar and \u00a7 22a-3 (b) states that agricultural land is \u201cany land in the state suitable with reference to soil types, existing and past use of such land for agricultural purposes and other relevant factors, for the cultivation of plants, for the production of human food and fiber or other useful and valuable plant products and for the production of animals, livestock and poultry useful to man and the environment and may include adjacent pastures, wooded land, natural drainage areas and other adjacent open areas.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This definition is so broad that it could arguably include almost any land and would do little to narrow the negative implications of a holding that agricultural land is a natural resource within the meaning of \u00a7 22a-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Since the legislature did not specifically provide for the protection of agricultural land in \u00a7 22a-19 or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>other section of the EPA, and its inclusion in the term \u201cnatural resources\u201d could lead to wide reaching and very likely unintended results, we conclude that such land is not a natural resource protected under that act. The TPZ, therefore, was not obliged to comply with \u00a7 22a-19 (b) by considering alternatives to the subdivision application submitted by the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">The only remaining claim in the present case is made by the coalition, Steffens and Fitzgerald.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> They contend that the trial court erred in concluding that their due process rights were not violated when the TPZ allegedly received additional evidence after the close of the public hearings. It is not necessary to address this issue on appeal because it is rendered moot by our holding that the plaintiffs had no right to invoke the application of \u00a7 22a-19 (b) with respect to agricultural land. An examination of the appeal petition filed by the coalition, Steffens and Fitzgerald reveals that they were contesting the TPZ\u2019s approval of the corporation\u2019s subdivision application only because they allegedly feared the possible destruction of prime agricultural land. They articulated no other arguments. Therefore a reversal of the trial court\u2019s decision that the TPZ\u2019s action did not constitute a due process violation would serve no useful purpose because the coalition, Steffens and Fitzgerald have no viable underlying claim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-11\"><em> </em>The Red Hill Coalition, Inc., is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to the preservation of the Red Hill section of Glastonbury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b750-12\"> The CFE is a nonprofit corporation \u201cdedicated to the conservation and preservation of the state\u2019s natural resources.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b751-5\"> The commissioner of agriculture and the commissioner of environmental protection were granted permission to file a brief as amici curiae in support of the plaintiffs.

In <em>Delaney, </em>the Superior Court held that the plaintiffs had no right to intervene under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a) in a subdivision review proceeding because such a proceeding was not a permit procedure or process. Specifically, the court stated that because the planning and zoning commission was required to approve a subdivision application if it conformed to the conditions stated in the applicable regulations, the commission had no discretion to consider environmental issues. In the present case the trial court concluded that because the TPZ considered environmental issues by reviewing the conservation commission\u2019s report, intervention in a zoning commission hearing was appropriate under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>\u00a7 22a-19 (a). The trial court declined, however, to state whether \u00a7 22a-19 (a) \u201capplies to ab initio subdivision review without the mandatory prior determination of environmental issues\u201d as was decided by the Superior Court in <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra. We decline to adopt the reasoning set forth in <em>Delaney, </em>as we conclude that the language in \u00a7 22a-19 (a) clearly and unambiguously allows intervention in \u201cany\u201d administrative hearing or other proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b759-5\"> In support of their argument that agricultural land is a natural resource under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19, the plaintiffs cite cases from other jurisdictions that find it to he so. See <em>Hicklin </em>v. <em>Orbeck, </em>565 P.2d 159, 173 (Alaska 1977), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 437 U.S. 518, 98 S. Ct. 2482, 57 L.

App. 3d 219, 370 N.E.2d 1283 (1977); <em>Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Commission </em>v. <em>Washington Business Park Associates, </em>294 Md. 302, 449 A.2d 414 (1982); <em>Board of County Commissioners </em>v. <em>Gaster, </em>285 Md. 233, 248, 401 A.2d 666 (1979); <em>1000 Friends of Oregon </em>v. <em>Marion County, </em>64 Or. App. 218, 668 P.2d 412 (1983). Further, the plaintiffs cite several cases broadly construing the term \u201cnatural resources.\u201d See <em>New York </em>v. <em>Exxon Corporation, </em>633 F. Sup. 609 (S.D.N.Y. 1986); <em>Portage </em>v. <em>Kalamazoo County Road Commission, </em>136 Mich. App. 276, 355 N.W.2d 913 (1984); <em>Kimberly Hills Neighborhood Assn. </em>v. <em>Dion, </em>114 Mich. App. 495, 320 N.W.3d 668 (1982); <em>Michigan United Conservation Clubs </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>90 Mich. App. 99, 280 N.W.2d 883 (1979). We are not bound by the cited cases and do not find them controlling in view of the legislative history and wording of our statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b760-5\"> Air and water are natural resources that are not, generally speaking, \u201cowned\u201d by anyone. Land, however, in most instances, is privately owned. If the legislature had intended to make the inroads on private property rights advocated by the plaintiffs, we believe it would have done so with particularity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b760-6\"> The plaintiffs claim that only 12 percent of the state\u2019s land is agricultural. The plaintiffs\u2019 12 percent figure, however, is based on data compiled by the Soil Conservation Service. In the present case the TPZ did not make a finding of fact that the land in question was \u201cagricultural land.\u201d Although the plaintiffs submitted numerous documents that classify the Red Hill land as agricultural land, the acceptance or rejection of testimony and the weight to be given evidence is a matter for the factfinder. <em>Greenwich Contracting Co. </em>v. <em>Bonwit Construction Co., </em>156 Conn. 123, 129, 239 A.2d 519 (1968). The mere existence of the plaintiffs\u2019 documents does not necessarily make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>their contents indisputable. Id.; see also <em>Lashgari </em>v. <em>Lashgari, </em>197 Conn. 189, 190-91 n.1, 496 A.2d 491 (1985); <em>Crunschlag </em>v. <em>Ethel Walker School, Inc., </em>189 Conn. 316, 320, 455 A. 2d 1332 (1983) (\u201c \u2018[a] reference made merely in the \u201cstatement of facts\u201d in the brief, without support in the finding [in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision], does not constitute a fact in the case\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, even if we were to hold that agricultural land is a natural resource under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19, the case would have to be remanded for a factual finding as to whether the land in question in this case is \u201cagricultural land.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b761-6\"> Farmland is defined even more broadly in General Statutes \u00a7 12-107b (a) as \u201cany tract or tracts of land, including woodland and wasteland, constituting a farm unit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\"> The CFE did not raise the due process issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\"> Although we decline to address the due process claim, we agree with the trial court that the facts in the instant ease do not substantiate this claim and that, even if there were a violation, the coalition, Steffens and Fitzgerald suffered no prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
