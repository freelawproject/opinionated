J.</author>\n<p id=\"at2-dedup-0\">This appeal raises three principal issues: the validity of a conviction based upon a unilateral conspiracy, the admissibility of a warrant-less wiretap procured with the consent of one of the parties, and the constitutionality of a statutory exemption for drug dependent persons. A jury found the defendant, Pedro Grullon, guilty on one count of possession of cocaine with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (a) and one count of conspiracy to possess and transport cocaine with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-277 (a) and 53a-48 (a). The trial court thereupon sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of thirteen years for each count, to run concurrently. The defendant appealed this judgment to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We find error and remand for a new trial on the conspiracy count.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The jury could reasonably have found the following. The defendant\u2019s half brother, Edwin Caraballo (the brother), was arrested by the Manchester police on January 12, 1986, on drug charges unrelated to the defendant. The brother, while in police custody, agreed to cooperate with the police and made two calls to the defendant, which he permitted the police to record. The brother arranged for the defendant and a third party to bring one pound of cocaine from New York to the brother in Manchester. These conversations were in Spanish. In subsequent unrecorded telephone calls forwarded to the brother in the police facility where he was being held, the brother learned that, to implement the drug delivery, the defendant and another Hispanic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>male planned to arrive in Hartford on a Trailways bus scheduled to depart New York at about 5:30 p.m. on January 14 and, on arrival, to take a taxi cab to the brother\u2019s home at 17 Hazel Street in Manchester, where they would deliver the cocaine. The brother relayed this information and a description of the defendant to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Detective Joseph Morrissey, a Manchester police officer, was stationed at the Trailways bus station when the bus arrived. He saw the defendant, whom he recognized from the brother\u2019s description, and another man, Francisco Lora, go to a pay phone and heard the defendant make a telephone call in Spanish, which Mor-rissey could not understand. He then saw the defendant give the telephone to Lora, who also spoke in Spanish. The only recognizable word that Morrissey heard Lora say was \u201cHazel.\u201d The defendant and Lora then took a taxi to 17 Hazel Street in Manchester where the police searched the defendant\u2019s shoulder bag, discovered eighteen ounces of cocaine, and arrested him and Lora.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred in: (1) charging the jury that the defendant could be guilty of conspiracy with his brother; (2) admitting into evidence the transcripts of telephone conversations between the defendant and his brother; (3) charging the jury as to entrapment; (4) admitting hearsay evidence; and (5) holding that General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 does not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to equal protection. We find error in the trial court\u2019s instructions on the conspiracy charge and no error on the other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">The defendant makes a tripartite claim of error with regard to the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury on the conspiracy count. He contends that: (a) a defendant cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>be guilty of conspiracy pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 SSa-A\u00e1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> unless the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he conspired with another who is not a police informant or agent, because the statute requires that there be an agreement between the co-conspirators; (b) the court\u2019s instructions erroneously permitted the jury to convict him on this count on the theory of his having conspired with his brother, who was acting as a police informant; and (c) the court erroneously denied his motion for acquittal of the conspiracy charge, because there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of his having conspired with any person other than his brother. We agree with the first two contentions, but not with the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Our examination of the definition of the crime of conspiracy in \u00a7 53a-48 convinces us that the legislature has determined that conspiracy requires a showing that two or more coconspirators intended to engage in or cause conduct that constitutes a crime. Under our statute, therefore, a defendant cannot be guilty of conspiracy if the only other member of the alleged conspiracy lacks any criminal intent. Accordingly, we reject the state\u2019s argument to the contrary, that the requirements of \u00a7 53a-48 are satisfied by proof that the defendant himself intended to engage in criminal conduct without any coconspirator sharing his criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 53a-48 is informed by the \u201cwell defined principles of statutory interpretation that require us to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Blasko, 202 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>541, 553, 522 A.2d 753 (1987); see also <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986). In ascertaining that intent, \u201c[i]f the words are clear and unambiguous, \u2018it is assumed that [they] express the intention of the legislature\u2019; <em>Mazur </em>v. <em>Blum, </em>184 Conn. 116, 118-19, 441 A.2d 65 (1981); and we need inquire no further.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>199 Conn. 667, 674, 509 A.2d 20 (1986); see also 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984) \u00a7 48.01. The words of the statute are to be given \u201ctheir ordinary meaning unless their context dictates otherwise.\u201d <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>209 Conn. 191, 196, 550 A.2d 309 (1988). \u201cAny latent ambiguity in the statutory language itself is normally resolved by turning for guidance to the legislative history and the purpose the statute is to serve.\u201d <em>Capalbo </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>208 Conn. 480, 486, 547 A.2d 528 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>206 Conn. 421, 428, 538 A.2d 193 (1988). Further, \u201c[p]enal statutes are to be construed strictly . . . and not extended by implication to create liability that the legislature did not purport to create.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hufford, </em>205 Conn. 386, 392, 533 A.2d 866 (1987); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Dupree, </em>196 Conn. 655, 660, 495 A.2d 691, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 951, 106 S. Ct. 318, 88 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMartin, </em>171 Conn. 524, 544, 370 A.2d 1038 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Section 53a-48 (a) states that a person is guilty of conspiracy if he \u201cagrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of [conduct corn stituting a crime].\u201d The dispositive issue, therefore, is the meaning to be attributed to the word \u201cagree\u201d as used in \u00a7 53a-48. \u201cAgree\u201d is defined by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979) as: \u201cTo concur; come into harmony; give mutual assent; unite in mental action; exchange promises; make an agreement; arrange; to settle,\u201d and by Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary (1974) as \u201cadmit, concede; to settle upon by common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>consent.\u201d That ordinary meaning supports the defendant\u2019s contention that the statute contemplates a criminal intent on the part of those with whom the defendant is alleged to have conspired.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The state maintains, however, that we should not give \u201cagree\u201d its ordinary meaning, but should instead interpret it to include situations in which only one party actually intends that the illegal activity occur. The state urges this construction on the ground that our legislature modeled \u00a7 53a-48 upon the New York conspiracy statute, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 105, which the courts of New York have interpreted as encompassing a unilateral conspiracy theory. <em>People </em>v. <em>Schwimmer, </em>66 App. Div. 2d 91, 411 N.Y.S.2d 922 (1978), aff\u2019d, 47 N.Y.2d 1004, 394 N.E.2d 288 (1979). Although much of the language of the New York and Connecticut statutes is virtually identical,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the New York statute contains a section, not contained in the Connecticut statute, that specifically states that it is not a defense to a conspiracy charge that the defendant\u2019s coconspirator lacked the mental state necessary to himself be guilty of conspiracy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In light of this significant difference between New York\u2019s governing statute and \u00a7 53a-48, we conclude that New York cases do not establish reliable precedents for the construction of our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In describing the constituent elements of conspiracy, our own cases have regularly described conspiracy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>bilateral terms. \u201c \u2018 \u201cTo establish the crime of conspiracy under [\u00a7 53a-48], the state must show that there was an agreement between two or more persons to engage in conduct constituting a crime . . . . \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rouleau, </em>204 Conn. 240, 258, 528 A.2d 343 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>186 Conn. 696, 707, 443 A.2d 915 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>169 Conn. 642, 645, 363 A.2d 1091 (1975); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Beccia, </em>199 Conn. 1, 3, 505 A.2d 683 (1986). \u201c \u2018[T]he essence of [conspiracy] is an agreement to commit an unlawful act. . . . The prohibition of conspiracy is directed not at the unlawful object, but at the process of agreeing to pursue that object.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Beccia, </em>supra, 3, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>508 F. Sup. 1188, 1196 (W.D. La. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">A bilateral construction of our conspiracy statute finds support in similar decisions by the federal courts, which hold that one cannot conspire with an informant as a matter of law. <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>United States, </em>853 F.2d 83, 85 (2d Cir. 1988); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Escobar de Bright, </em>742 F.2d 1196, 1198-1200 (9th Cir. 1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>372 F.2d 453, 459 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 907, 87 S. Ct. 1688, 18 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1967); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moss, </em>591 F.2d 428, 434 n.8 (8th Cir. 1979); <em>Sears </em>v. <em>United States, </em>343 F.2d 139, 142 (5th Cir. 1965).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under federal law, a conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more people \u201cwhich arguably requires some form of a \u2018meet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ing of minds.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Escobar de Bright, </em>supra, 1199, quoting <em>Krulewitch </em>v. <em>United States, </em>336 U.S. 440, 448, 69 S. Ct. 716, 93 L. Ed. 790 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring). \u201cThere is neither a true agreement nor a meeting of minds when an individual \u2018conspires\u2019 to violate the law with only one other person and that person is a government agent.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Escobar de Bright, </em>supra. \u201cIn short, the formal requirements of the crime of conspiracy have not been met unless an individual conspires with at least one bona fide co-conspirator.\u201d Id. \u201c[T]he <em>Sears </em>[v. <em>United States] </em>rule [that a defendant cannot be found guilty of conspiring with an informant] responds to the same concern that underlies the entrapment defense: the legitimate law enforcement function of crime prevention \u2018does not include the manufacturing of crime.\u2019 <em>Sherman v. United States, </em>356 U.S. 369, 372, 78 S. Ct. 819, 2 L. Ed. 2d 848 (1958) .... Allowing a government agent to form a conspiracy with only one other party would create the potential for law enforcement officers to \u2018manufacture\u2019 conspiracies when none would exist absent the government\u2019s presence.\u201d Id., 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the defendant is correct in his assertion that the crime of conspiracy under \u00a7 53a-48 requires the state to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he and another person agreed to engage in conduct constituting a crime. Unless the state proved that some other person, with culpable intent, agreed with the defendant to violate the law, the defendant was entitled to acquittal on this count.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The defendant maintains that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that it could find the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>ant guilty of conspiracy on the basis of an agreement between the defendant and his brother. Because this alleged coconspirator was concededly acting as a police agent at the time when he called the defendant, the defendant claims that this misleading instruction requires at least reversal of his conviction on this count. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">To determine whether an error in the charge to the jury exists, we review the entire charge to determine if, \u201ctaken as a whole, the charge adequately guided the jury to a correct verdict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 268-69, 502 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1143, 106 S. Ct. 1797, 90 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1986); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>187 Conn. 199, 206, 445 A.2d 314 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>182 Conn. 262, 268, 438 A.2d 80 (1980). \u201c \u2018 \u201cIn appeals not involving a constitutional question the court must determine whether it is reasonably probable that the jury [was] misled\u201d \u2019 \u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Avis, </em>209 Conn. 290, 305, 551 A.2d 26 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>188 Conn. 653, 660, 453 A.2d 427 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra; but \u201c \u2018in appeals involving a constitutional question, [the standard is] whether it is reasonably possible that the jury [was] misled.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra; see also <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705, reh. denied, 386 U.S. 987, 87 S. Ct. 1283, 18 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1967). A failure to provide adequate instructions on the elements of a crime, because of its potential for violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>supra, 270; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 268-69; invokes the \u201creasonably possible\u201d standard of review. In this case, because the alleged error relates to the elements of the crime charged, reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction and a new trial are mandated if, in the context of the charge as a whole, it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>supra, 269; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>197 Conn. 574, 581, 500 A.2d 539 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 558, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The court, in its instructions on conspiracy,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> discussed the telephone conversations between the defendant and his brother and then stated \u201cit will be for you to review all the evidence to determine whether in fact the State has proved the existence of the requisite agreement.\u201d The court informed the jury that the state was also claiming that a third party, Lora, was a member of the conspiracy. The court did not, however, inform the jury that it could not find the defendant guilty of conspiracy unless both the defendant and at least one co-conspirator intended to engage in or cause the commission of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Viewing the charge as a whole, we conclude that it is reasonably possible that the trial court misled the jury to believe that it could find the defendant guilty of conspiracy with the brother, a police informant, to transport cocaine. We conclude, therefore, that the court\u2019s charge to the jury did not fulfill its mandate to \u201c \u2018be accurate in law, adapted to the issues and ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>quate to guide the jury in reaching a correct verdict\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 269; <em>Berniere </em>v. <em>Kripps, </em>157 Conn. 356, 358, 254 A.2d 496 (1969); and that, therefore, the jury was possibly misled. Consequently, the defendant is entitled to a new trial on this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The defendant contends further that he should be acquitted on the conspiracy charge because the state has failed to prove his involvement in any legally sufficient conspiracy. He argues that the state introduced insufficient evidence to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he conspired with the other alleged co-conspirator, Lora. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">In determining whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a verdict, we must inquire whether a rational trier of fact could reasonably have concluded, from the facts established and from inferences reasonably drawn, that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avis, </em>supra, 308-309; <em>State </em>v. <em>Braxton, </em>196 Conn. 685, 691, 495 A.2d 273 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Scielzo, </em>190 Conn. 191, 197-98, 460 A.2d 951 (1983). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, as we must; <em>State </em>v. <em>Avis, </em>supra, 309; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>205 Conn. 456, 468, 534 A.2d 230 (1987); we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the defendant conspired with Lora. The state presented evidence from which the jury could reasonably have inferred that Lora was the owner of the drugs and that Lora came to Connecticut for the purpose of transporting the drugs to the defendant\u2019s brother. The jury\u2019s verdict did not indicate whether the defendant had been found to have conspired with his brother, with Lora or with both of them. Although a retrial is required because the jury may have been misled into erroneously finding the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>guilty of conspiracy with a police agent, on this record the defendant is not entitled to an outright acquittal on the conspiracy count.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The defendant next contends that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the transcripts of his telephone conversations with the brother, which he had moved to suppress prior to trial, because (a) the wiretap constituted an unreasonable search, and (b) there is no exception to the Electronic Surveillance Act (ESA), General Statutes \u00a7 54-41a et seq., for wiretaps with the consent of one party. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The defendant contends that the wiretap of his first conversation with the brother was an unreasonable search because it was \u201cexecuted without any cause to believe a crime had been or was being committed\u201d and was, therefore, prohibited by the United States constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the fourth amendment to the United States constitution protects conversations from illegal seizure; <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967); <em>Berger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>388 U.S. 41, 87 S. Ct. 1873, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1040 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMartin, </em>171 Conn. 524, 534, 370 A.2d 1038 (1976); the United States Supreme Court has explicitly held that this protection does not extend to wiretaps conducted with the consent of one of the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>ties to the conversation. \u201cNeither the Constitution nor any Act of Congress requires that official approval be secured before conversations are overheard or recorded by Government agents with the consent of one of the conversants.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Caceres, </em>440 U.S. 741, 744, 99 S. Ct. 1465, 59 L. Ed. 2d 733 (1979); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>401 U.S. 745, 752, 91 S. Ct. 1122, 28 L. Ed. 2d 453, cert. denied, 402 U.S. 990, 91 S. Ct. 1643, 29 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1971) (plurality opinion). Just as an undercover police agent, without having first obtained a warrant, may take notes reciting a conversation with a defendant, so the agent may simultaneously record the conversation or transmit it to recording equipment. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Caceres, </em>supra, 750-51; <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 751. \u201c \u2018If the conduct and revelations of an agent operating without electronic equipment do not invade the defendant\u2019s constitutionally justifiable expectations of privacy, neither does a simultaneous recording of the same conversations made by the agent or by others from transmissions received from the agent to whom the defendant is talking and whose trustworthiness the defendant necessarily risks.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Caceres, </em>supra, 751; <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra; <em>see State </em>v. <em>DeMartin, </em>supra, 537-38. Consistent with this constitutional analysis, consensual recording is specifically excluded from wiretaps protected by federal law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">It is undisputed that, in this case, the defendant\u2019s brother, one party to the conversation, consented to the wiretap. Accordingly, the wiretap did not constitute an unreasonable search for the purposes of the fourth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The defendant\u2019s contention that the ESA required that the transcripts be excluded from evidence is equally unavailing. This court adressed the admissibility of consensual wiretaps in <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMartin, </em>supra, and held that consensual wiretaps were admissible into evidence without a wiretap order. Id., 543-44. In <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMartin, </em>the court concluded that the ESA was enacted to respond to decisions of the United States Supreme Court including <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, and <em>Berger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, and held that neither the constitution nor the ESA, properly construed, prohibited an undercover police officer from taping a telephone conversation with a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The defendant argues that <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMartin </em>is not controlling because it applied to a \u201cdifferent statutory scheme for wiretaps than that which currently exists.\u201d The defendant is correct that, subsequent to <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMartin, </em>the legislature replaced the penal statute governing wiretaps, General Statutes \u00a7 53-140, with \u00a7 53a-187.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The legislature has not, however, significantly amended \u00a7 54-41a et seq., the ESA, the statute that explicitly governs the admissibility of recordings or transcripts of wiretaps.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">We conclude that the substitution of \u00a7 53a-187 for \u00a7 53-140 does not provide a sufficient basis for distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>guishing <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMartin. </em>In <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMartin, </em>supra, 544 n.13, we noted that \u00a7 53-140 had been repealed in 1971 and that \u201cthe prohibitions of [that] statute were carried over into [\u00a7\u00a7 53a-187 through 53a-189].\u201d In discussing the new statute, we assumed, in effect, that its enactment would not alter the rules governing the admissibility of tape recordings or transcripts of consensual wiretaps.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Further, \u00a7 53a-187 explicitly limits \u201c[m]echanical overhearing of a conversation\u201d to overhearing or recording \u201cwithout the consent of at least one party thereto\u201d and its legislative history reflects a legislative awareness and acquiescence in a construction of \u00a7 53-140 permitting wiretaps with the consent of one party.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>14 S. Proc., Pt. 2,1971 Sess., p. 877, remarks of Senator Joseph J. Fauliso.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Accordingly, although we agree with the defendant that the ESA represents \u201cthe legislature\u2019s comprehensive efforts to protect fully the privacy values which the operation of the statute implicates\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>194 Conn. 447, 459, 481 A.2d 730 (1984); we conclude that \u201c[t]he competing interests of the community in effective law enforcement and of the individual in his privacy are, in a unique way, drawn into question by police wiretapping. Clearly, our statutes are aimed at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>balancing these competing interests.\u201d Id., 458. The defendant\u2019s arguments that the legislature intended that the ESA apply to consensual wiretaps are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in several respects in its instructions to the jury regarding entrapment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He failed to except at trial to the portion of the charge he now challenges, but claims a right to appellate review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69-70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). Such review is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">\u201cOnly in most exceptional circumstances can and will this court consider a claim, constitutional or otherwise, that has not been raised and decided in the trial court.\u201d Id., 69. Such \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d arise only \u201cwhere a new constitutional right not readily forseea-ble has arisen between the time of trial and appeal\u201d or \u201cwhere the record adequately supports a claim that a litigant has clearly been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial.\u201d Id., 70. The defendant does not assert that any relevant new constitutional right has arisen. Further, the defense of entrapment \u201cis not of constitutional dimension.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Devino, </em>195 Conn. 70, 73, 485 A.2d 1302 (1985); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Preyer, </em>198 Conn. 190, 197, 502 A.2d 858 (1985). Accordingly, we decline to review these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The defendant also contends that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay evidence, which he claims was highly prejudicial. Although the defendant did not object to this evidence at trial, he now claims that admitting this evidence was plain error. The state concedes that the testimony at issue was hearsay, but contends that the trial court did not commit plain error in admitting that testimony. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u201cWe invoke the power to review a ruling of the trial court as plain error only in extraordinary circumstances \u2018where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 483, 522 A.2d 249 (1987), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>198 Conn. 77, 87-88, 502 A.2d 388 (1985). That is not this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The defendant challenges the testimony by one of the police officers, Detective Morrissey, that the brother had said that the defendant was one of his cocaine sources and that the defendant had given him a telephone number to use to arrange the cocaine purchase.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The brother had previously testified that he had telephoned the defendant because the defendant could obtain a large quantity of cocaine for him in a short <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>time. In addition, it had been previously established that the brother had the defendant\u2019s telephone number. We cannot characterize as plain error the admission by the trial court, without objection by either party, of evidence that may have been reliable and that, because it restated previously admitted testimony, may not have been prejudicial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra. We therefore decline to review further the admission of the hearsay testimony in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> violates his constitutional right to equal protection. He alleges that by prosecuting him pursuant to \u00a7 21a-278, which applies only to defendants who are not drug-dependent and imposes a mandatory minimum sentence, rather than General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the state has punished him more severely for his status as a person who is not drug-dependent. He also contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>that the prosecutor\u2019s ability to prosecute him pursuant to either of two statutes for one act is impermissible. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u201c \u2018Under traditional equal protection principles, a State retains broad discretion to classify [conduct as criminal] as long as its classification has a reasonable basis.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>161 Conn. 536, 549-50, 290 A.2d 338 (1971), vacated and remanded for resentencing, 408 U.S. 940, 92 S. Ct. 2879, 33 L. Ed. 2d 764 (1972) (not unreasonable to divide convicted persons into classifications according to heinousness of offenses committed), quoting <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 371, 91 S. Ct. 1848, 29 L. Ed. 2d 534 (1971).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018[W]here there is some natural and substantial difference germane to the subject and purposes of the legislation, there is no illegal discrimination between those within an established class and others not so included.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>supra, 550; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Rollinson, </em>203 Conn. 641, 658, 526 A.2d 1283 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The legislature has often decided as a matter of policy to create special exemptions for substance-abusing criminal defendants. With respect to \u00a7 21a-278, this court, construing its statutory predecessor, concluded that a defendant\u2019s status as a person who is not drug-dependent is not an essential element of the offense charged, but rather operates to exempt those who are drug-dependent from the operation of the statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 167, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981). Furthermore, General Statutes \u00a7 19a-387 (a)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> provides that a court may, if it finds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>a person convicted of certain crimes is drug-dependent and that his crime was for the primary purpose of sustaining his drug dependence, sentence the person, as an alternative to the sentence specified for the crime, to \u201can indeterminate term not to exceed three years or the maximum term for the offense, whichever is the lesser, and, at any time within such indeterminate term <em>and without regard to any other provision of law regarding minimum term of confinement, </em>the commissioner of correction may release the convicted person so sentenced subject to such conditions as he may impose including, but not limited to, supervision by suitable authority.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In addition, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-7<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> provides that evidence of intoxication may be offered to negate an element of the crime charged, and thereby exempts a defendant from lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>bility for specific intent crimes if he was intoxicated at the time of the crime. Another protection for drug-dependent defendants is provided by General Statutes \u00a7 19a-383,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> which protects defendants from the use as evidence in any court, grand jury or administrative proceeding of information obtained during their treatment or rehabilitation for drug dependence.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The legislature may have decided to provide an exemption from the operation of \u00a7 21a-278, and not from \u00a7 21a-277, because the former statute provides an enhanced penalty and a mandatory minimum sentence for the possession of a larger quantity of drugs.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The legislature may rationally have concluded that such enhanced penalties were in tension with its goal of appropriate treatment for those who are drug-dependent. By exempting drug-dependent persons from prosecution under \u00a7 21a-278, and from its mandatory minimum sentence, the legislature empowered the court to exercise greater discretion in individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>cases to determine the appropriate balance between treatment and punishment. Accordingly, we find no illegal discrimination in the legislature\u2019s determination to distinguish in this fashion between those who are drug-dependent and those who are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that he was impermissibly subject to prosecution under either of two statutes for the same act is equally unpersuasive. So long as the state does not avail itself of overlapping criminal statutes in a manner that discriminates against any class, the state may legally choose to prosecute the defendant under either applicable statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chetcuti, </em>173 Conn. 165, 168, 377 A.2d 263 (1977). \u201c \u2018Absent a showing of a selection deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion or other arbitrary classification.. . . conscious selectivity in enforcement of the law is not in itself a constitutional violation.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>211 Conn. 258, 287, 559 A.2d 164 (1989), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 474, 450 A.2d 828 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">There is error in part, the judgment as to the conspiracy charge is set aside and the case is remanded for a new trial on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-48.
