(Metro Mobile), and the Connecticut siting council (council), to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Because the plaintiffs failed to comply with the service requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), we conclude that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal and, therefore, did not err in granting the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">On October 20, 1987, Metro Mobile, a Connecticut corporation, applied to the council<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pursuant to the Connecticut Public Utility Environmental Standards Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need (certificate) that would allow it to construct, operate and maintain cellular telephone antenna towers and related equipment at designated sites in Greenwich, Fairfield and Wilton. In December, 1987, the council gave notice of its intention to hold public hearings on Metro Mobile\u2019s application; General Statutes \u00a7 16-50m (c); and received written comments from the Connecticut department of environmental protection on Metro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Mobile\u2019s application as required by General Statutes \u00a7 16-50j (g). Hearings were held on Metro Mobile\u2019s application on December 14, 1987, and December 21, 1987. On February 19,1988, the council sent notice to all parties of record informing them that it had granted Metro Mobile a certificate for two sites, one in Greenwich and the other in Fairfield. See General Statutes \u00a7 16-50p. The Greenwich site is the subject of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">On February 26, 1988, the plaintiffs, Michael and Lynne Tarnopol,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> filed a petition for judicial review in the Superior Court claiming that they were \u201caggrieved by the decision of the defendant council in that the value of their property [which abuts the site approved by the council, would] be diminished, and in that the proposed tower [would] have a visual impact on their property and [would] impair the use and enjoyment of their property.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 petition was accompanied by an order of notice, signed by an assistant clerk of the court, purportedly approving service of process by certified mail on the council and the thirty-one parties who participated in the administrative hearing. The parties who were listed in the order were individuals, private and municipal corporations and voluntary associations, all of which resided in or had agents located in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">On April 7,1988, the council and Metro Mobile filed separate motions to dismiss claiming that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal because they had not complied with the service requirements of \u00a7 4-183 (b). On June 1, 1988, the trial court granted both motions. The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>We subsequently transferred the appeal to ourselves, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The plaintiffs claim on appeal that the trial court erred in granting the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss because service of process by certified mail on the council and each of the parties listed in the order of notice was proper under the UAPA. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Judicial review of orders issued by the council either granting or denying applications for certificates is governed by General Statutes \u00a7 16-50q, which provides that appeals must be filed \u201cin accordance with the provisions of section 4-183.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-183, which is part of the UAPA, establishes the method for commencing appeals from administrative agencies. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 4-183 governs the service of process in such appeals and states in relevant part that \u201c[c]opies of the petition <em>shall be served </em>upon the agency and all parties of record within thirty days after mailing of [the] notice [of the final decision of the agency].\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cExcept as otherwise provided, process in any civil action shall be served by leaving a true and attested copy of it, including the declaration or complaint, with the defendant, or at his usual place of abode, in this state.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-57 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The person to whom in hand or abode service must be made when an entity such as a municipality, corporation or voluntary association is named as a defendant in a civil, action is set forth in \u00a7 52-57 (b) through (e). The only exception to in hand or abode service on defendants that reside in or have agents located in Connecticut, is specifically set out in \u00a7 4-183 (b) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>allows parties appealing from an administrative decision to make service on the defendant agency by \u201cmailing a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, without the use of a sheriff or other officer, to the office of the commissioner of the agency or to the office of the attorney general in Hartford.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">As previously noted, the UAPA requires that the agency <em>and </em>\u201call parties of record\u201d be served. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b). A \u201cparty\u201d is defined under the UAPA as \u201ceach person or agency named or admitted as a party, or properly seeking and entitled as of right to be admitted as a party.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (5). In the present case, therefore, all of the parties who were named or admitted as parties in the administrative proceeding were \u201cparties of record\u201d whom the plaintiffs were obliged to serve in bringing their appeal. See <em>Hillcroft Partners </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; </em>Opportunities, 205 Conn. 324, 533 A.2d 852 (1987). The plaintiffs\u2019 failure to serve those parties properly renders their appeal subject to dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. Id., 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 application for an order of notice in the present case indicates that all of the parties of record were individuals who resided in Connecticut or were municipalities, corporations or voluntary organizations having in-state agents. With the exception of the council, which is an agency qualifying for service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>by certified mail, therefore, it was incumbent upon the plaintiffs under \u00a7\u00a7 4-183 (b), 52-54 and 52-57 to make in hand or abode service on each of the remaining parties. The plaintiffs did not do so. Rather, they served each party, or the party\u2019s attorney,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> by certified mail. This was improper as \u201c[t]here is no substitute for \u2018in hand\u2019 or abode service . . . where jurisdiction over the person of a resident individual is sought\u201d unless a statute provides otherwise. <em>White-Bowman Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc. </em>v. <em>Biafore, </em>182 Conn. 14, 16-17, 437 A.2d 833 (1980). Because the \u201cappeal provisions of the statute are jurisdictional in nature\u201d; <em>Basilicato </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>197 Conn. 320, 324, 497 A.2d 48 (1985); the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with \u00a7\u00a7 4-183 (b), 52-54 and 52-57 renders their appeal subject to dismissal for want of jurisdiction. <em>Andrew Ansaldi Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>207 Conn. 67, 73, 540 A.2d 59 (1988) <em>(Shea, J., </em>concurring); <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>201 Conn. 350, 356, 514 A.2d 749 (1986) (\u201cWe note at the outset that appeals from administrative agencies exist only under statutory authority. <em>Farricielli </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>186 Conn. 198, 201, 440 A.2d 286 (1982). \u2018A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>statutory right to appeal may be taken advantage of only by strict compliance with the statutory provisions by which it is created.\u2019 Id.\u201d); <em>Basilicato </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The plaintiffs argue, however, that service of process by certified mail was authorized in this case because they had obtained an order of notice from an assistant clerk. According to the plaintiffs, that order of notice validated what was otherwise a statutorily defective manner of service thereby conferring jurisdiction on the court to hear their appeal. We disagree. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-68 (a),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> an order of notice may be utilized as an alternative means of service only \u201cwhen the adverse party, or any persons so interested therein that they ought to be made parties thereto, reside out of the state, or when the names or residences of any such persons in interest are unknown to the party instituting the proceeding.\u201d In the present case, it is evident from the record that all of the adverse and interested parties resided in, or had agents located in, Connecticut. Furthermore, the names and addresses of the parties were known or easily available to the plaintiffs. Under the circumstances, therefore, the plaintiffs\u2019 use of an order of notice was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>The plaintiffs contend, however, that the trial court sanctioned service of process by certified mail when it signed their application for an order of notice. This being so, the plaintiffs argue that the court cannot thereafter claim that it lacks jurisdiction to hear their appeal. In rejecting this argument, we note that it was an assistant clerk and not the trial court that signed the order of notice. That practice is authorized under Practice Book \u00a7 199.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The assistant clerk cannot, however, be held responsible for ensuring that the plaintiffs employ the proper method of service of process. While the trial court can show some degree of leniency toward a party when there is evidence that it was misguided by court personnel, \u201cthe court cannot disregard established and mandatory requirements which circumscribe jurisdiction in the first instance.\u201d <em>Basilicato </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 324.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Finally, the plaintiffs claim that \u201c[t]he absence of an affirmative showing of prejudice by the defendants . . . means that [their] arguments [in support of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal] are mere rubric which should have been rejected out of hand by the trial court in the interests of common sense and justice.\u201d In support of this argument the plaintiffs rely on <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra. In that case we held that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>court did not err in exercising jurisdiction over the plaintiffs appeal from the decision of the commission on human rights and opportunities where the plaintiff had commenced its appeal with the proper method of service but had used the wrong writ of summons form. Id., 355-57. In so holding, we stated that whenever there is a question involving the jurisdiction of the trial court in an administrative appeal, it is imperative that the plaintiff strictly comply with the procedural statutes. Id., 356. Failure to do so renders the plaintiff\u2019s appeal subject to dismissal. Since the plaintiff\u2019s use of an incorrect writ of summons form in <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc., </em>did \u201cnot call into question the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to entertain the appeal,\u201d however, we concluded that it did not warrant dismissal as the defendants did not make \u201can affirmative showing of prejudice.\u201d Id., 357. In contrast to <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, the plaintiffs\u2019 failure in the instant case to make proper service on all of the parties of record did call into question the jurisdiction of the trial court. Consequently, the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 4-183 (b) renders their appeal subject to dismissal regardless of whether the defendants were prejudiced. See <em>Andrew Ansaldi Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 74-75 <em>(Shea, J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">We conclude that because the plaintiffs failed to comply with \u00a7 4-183 (b), the trial court did not err in granting the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss their appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 4-183 (b) provides: \u201cAPPEAL TO SUPERIOR COURT. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u201c(b) Proceedings for such appeal shall be instituted by filing a petition in superior court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain or for the judicial district wherein the aggrieved person resides or if such person is not a resident of this state to the court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain within forty-five days after mailing of the notice of the final decision of the agency or, if a rehearing is requested, within forty-five days after mailing of the notice of the decision thereon. Copies of the petition shall be served upon the agency and all parties of record within thirty days after mailing of such notice or, if a rehearing is requested, within thirty days after mailing of the notice of the decision thereon, except that service upon an agency may be made by the appellant mailing a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, without the use of a sheriff or other officer, to the office of the commissioner of the agency or to the office of the attorney general in Hartford.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\"> The council is an agency of the state of Connecticut with exclusive jurisdiction over the location and type of certain statutorily defined utility and telecommunications facilities.

The motion, however, did not come to the trial court\u2019s attention until some time later. On May 2, 1989, the trial court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion and issued an articulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b183-11\"> The exceptions noted in the statute would not permit service by certified mail in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b184-7\"> The plaintiffs urge us to look to Public Acts 1988, No. 88-317, as \u201ca clarification of the legislative intent\u201d of General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b). Public Acts 1988, No. 88-317, \u00a7 23, however, completely rewrites \u00a7 4-183 (b). For example, under the new act service may be made on parties by notifying them, by either certified mail or personal service, \u201cat the address shown in the decision\u201d of the agency. Public Acts 1988, No. 88-317, \u00a7 23 (c). Such a drastic change in the method of service of process cannot be viewed as a mere clarification of legislative intent. Because Public Acts 1988, No. 88-317, does not become effective until July 1, 1989, it has no bearing on the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b185-5\"> Of the thirty-one parties named in the order, the plaintiffs requested that sixteen of them, including Metro Mobile, be served in the care of their attorneys. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b) requires that a party instituting an administrative appeal serve copies of the petition on all parties of record. An attorney does not qualify as a party under the UAPA. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">When the person upon whom service is to be made is designated by statute, service upon any other person as a purported representative is inadequate. <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Richard, </em>145 Conn. 24, 25-26, 138 A.2d 527 (1958). This defect cannot be cured by an amended service. Id.
