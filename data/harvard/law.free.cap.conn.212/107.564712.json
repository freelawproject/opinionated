The defendants contend on appeal, as they did at trial, that they had no obligation to convey the property in question to the plaintiff because: (1) their agreement was merely an option and not a bilateral purchase and sale contract; (2) the plaintiff did not satisfy its burden of proving its entitlement to a decree of specific performance; and (3) the plaintiff did not exercise its option to purchase in timely fashion. After considering the agreement itself, the testimony of the parties regarding their intent, and several letters exchanged between the parties\u2019 attorneys at or near the date set for closing, the trial court found that the agreement is \u201ca bilateral contract for the purchase of the defendants\u2019 property.\u201d The trial court thereupon granted the plaintiff\u2019s request for a decree of specific performance of the terms of the agreement, i.e., the conveyance of the property to the plaintiff in exchange for the purchase price specified in the contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>On September 19, 1984, the parties entered into an agreement concerning the sale of a piece of property owned by the defendants on Sheldon Street in Hartford. A review of the contents of the agreement reveals the following relevant terms and provisions. The thirteen page agreement, entitled \u201cOption Agreement,\u201d sets forth a $1,000,000 purchase price for the property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Apart from its use in the title, the word \u201coption\u201d appears only once in the body of the agreement. Throughout the agreement, the plaintiff and the defendants are referred to as \u201cPurchaser\u201d and \u201cSeller\u201d respectively. An unnumbered paragraph on the first page of the agreement, purporting to obligate the defendants to sell the property to the plaintiff, reads as follows: \u201cSeller does hereby promise and agree to and with Purchaser that immediately upon the faithful performance of Purchaser\u2019s agreement hereinafter made, Seller will on or before the 20th day of September, 1985,\u201d convey the property to the plaintiff. The only language expressly purporting to obligate the plaintiff to buy the property appears in the last paragraph (paragraph 20) of the agreement, wherein it states that \u201c[e]xcept as stated above, the Purchaser agrees to purchase the real property comprising the Premises \u2018as is\u2019 and \u2018where is\u2019 as of the date of the execution of this Agreement, reasonable wear and tear excepted.\u201d The agreement also provides that the sole remedy of the sellers in the event of a breach by the purchaser is retention of any deposits previously paid by the purchaser: \u201cIn the event Purchaser, through no fault of Seller, fails to perform any of the obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>hereinbefore set forth, Purchaser shall forfeit all claims to the Premises described herein, and all deposits previously paid in pursuance of this Agreement prior to said default by the Purchaser shall be construed as full liquidated damages to Seller and Purchaser shall be discharged of any and all liability to Seller under this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">An option contract and a contract of sale are in fact two separate and distinct contracts, namely, an option contract, and an agreement to sell. \u201cAn option, originally, is neither a sale nor an agreement to sell. It is not a contract by which one agrees to sell and the other to buy, but it is only an offer by one to sell within a limited time and a right acquired by the other to accept or reject such offer within such time.\u201d 77 Am. Jur. 2d, Vendor and Purchaser \u00a7 28; see <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hevro Realty Corporation, </em>199 Conn. 330, 336, 507 A.2d 980 (1986). \u201cThe distinction between a contract to purchase and sell real estate and an option to purchase is that the contract to purchase and sell creates a mutual obligation on the one party to sell and on the other to purchase, while an option merely gives the right to purchase within a limited time without imposing any obligation to purchase.\u201d 77 Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7 29. Whether the agreement in question is to be construed as a mutually binding contract of purchase and sale or a mere option to purchase is \u201ca question of the intent of the parties, to be determined, as a matter of fact, from the language of the contract, the circumstances attending its negotiation, and the conduct of the parties in relation thereto.\u201d <em>Kakalik </em>v. <em>Bernardo, </em>184 Conn. 386, 393, 439 A.2d 1016 (1981). As a finding of fact, the trial court\u2019s determination that the parties intended to enter into a mutually binding purchase and sale contract \u201cis a determination that we must sustain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>unless it was clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the record as a whole.\u201d Id.; see Practice Book \u00a7 4061.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The defendants stress three points about the contents of the agreement which they claim establish its nature as an option contract: first, the denomination of the agreement as an \u201cOption Agreement\u201d in its title; second, the alleged lack of an obligation to purchase on the part of the plaintiff; and third, the presence of a liquidated damages clause as the defendants\u2019 sole remedy in the event of the plaintiff\u2019s breach of the agreement. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The fact that the agreement is entitled \u201cOption Agreement\u201d is not determinative of its character. \u201cWhether the nature of a contract is an option or a bilateral obligation to purchase is to be determined not by the name which the parties have given it, but by the nature of the obligations which it imposes. Where it appears that the general intention of the parties was to consummate a sale, that intention should be effectuated.\u201d <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Haynes, </em>216 Miss. 485, 496, 62 So. 2d 779 (1953); see <em>McGuire </em>v. <em>Andre, </em>259 Ala. 109, 115, 65 So. 2d 185 (1953) (nature of a contract labeled \u201coption\u201d to be determined by the terms of the contract and not by name given to it); <em>DeFeyter </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>43 Colo. App. 299, 301, 606 P.2d 453 (1979) (fact that word \u201coption\u201d appears in title does not mandate determination that instrument is an option contract). The trial court was entitled to find, as it did, that the heading of the agreement did not reflect the actual intent of the parties as to the nature of the agreement. This is particularly true where, as here, the word \u201coption\u201d appears only once in the body of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The defendants next claim that the agreement lacks a provision obligating the plaintiff to purchase the property and that this establishes its character as an option <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>contract. It is true that a distinguishing feature of an option contract is that it imposes no binding obligation on the option holder to complete the purchase. See, e.g., <em>McGuire </em>v. <em>Andre, </em>supra, 114; <em>State </em>v. <em>New Jersey Zinc Co., </em>40 N. J. 560, 576, 193 A.2d 244 (1963); 77 Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7 29. We disagree, however, with the defendants\u2019 assertion that the agreement fails to impose an obligation upon the plaintiff to purchase the property. As noted above, paragraph 20 of the agreement expressly provides that \u201cthe Purchaser agrees to purchase the real property\u201d of the defendants. This express obligation is unconditional. It is not prefaced by language indicating that purchase of the property by the plaintiff is optional. The defendants have offered no reasons why this explicit language of obligation should not be given its apparent intended effect. Accordingly, we find without merit the defendants\u2019 claim that the agreement fails to impose a binding obligation upon the plaintiff to purchase the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The defendants also contend that the presence of a forfeiture provision and the specification that it shall be the defendants\u2019 sole remedy in the event of a breach by the plaintiff establishes the nature of the agreement as an option contract. In support of their contention the defendants point to three jurisdictions that have adopted a bright line rule stating that where an agreement concerning the sale of real estate provides, as the sole remedy for the seller, a provision for liquidated damages or a provision calling for the forfeiture of sums already paid, the agreement shall be construed as an option contract. See <em>Dodek </em>v. <em>CF 16 Corporation, </em>537 A.2d 1086, 1094 (D.C. App. 1988); <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Haft, </em>253 Md. 692, 696, 253 A.2d 715 (1969); <em>Broady </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>572 S.W.2d 36, 40 (Tex. Civ. App. 1978). Our research discloses, however, that several jurisdictions have rejected such a bright line approach. See, e.g., <em>Platte Valley Bank v. B &amp; J Construction, Inc., </em>44 Colo. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>App. 21, 606 P.2d 455 (1980); <em>Vance </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>96 Fla. 379, 118 So. 205 (1928); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bakers Basin Realty Co., </em>138 N.J. Super. 33, 350 A.2d 236 (1975), aff'd, 74 N.J. 103, 376 A.2d 1189 (1977); <em>Interactive Properties Corporation </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Greater New York, </em>114 Misc. 2d 255, 450 N.Y.S.2d 1001 (1982). These courts stress that the ultimate focus should be on the intent of the parties, and that the presence or absence of a liquidated damages or forfeiture clause is merely one factor to be considered in deriving that intent. We conclude that the view of these latter jurisdictions is the better one. Accordingly, we refuse to adopt the bright line approach urged by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Having concluded that none of the defendants\u2019 arguments establishes per se that the agreement in question is an option contract, we now look to the factors cited by the trial court in support of its determination that the parties entered into a bilateral purchase and sale contract. In reaching its conclusion, the trial court found the following factors to be persuasive: the plaintiff and the defendants are referred to throughout the agreement as \u201cPurchaser\u201d and \u201cSeller\u201d rather than as \u201cOptionee\u201d and \u201cOptioner\u201d; the word option appears nowhere in the agreement except the title;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the agreement is devoid of any language granting the plaintiff an option; Anthony F. Cutaia, president of the plaintiff, testified that his company rarely takes options on property and generally enters into binding contracts to pin-chase; several letters exchanged between the parties\u2019 attorneys near the date of closing indicate the nature of the agreement as a bilateral purchase and sale contract; and, the fact that the principal documents that would be required from the plaintiff at the time of closing were attached to the agreement, i.e., the $700,000 promissory note, the purchase money mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>gage deed, and a personal guarantee of the mortgage note by Cutaia. We are satisfied that the trial court\u2019s determination that the parties intended to enter into a bilateral purchase and sale contract is amply supported by the record and is therefore not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The defendants\u2019 final claim relates to the trial court\u2019s award of a decree of specific performance in favor of the plaintiff. \u201c \u2018[A]n action for specific performance of a contract to sell real estate is an equitable action and is to be determined by equitable principles.\u2019. . : The granting of specific performance of a contract to sell land is a remedy which rests in the broad discretion of the trial court depending on all of the facts and circumstances when viewed in light of the settled principles of equity.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Frumento </em>v. <em>Mezzanotte, </em>192 Conn. 606, 615, 473 A.2d 1193 (1984). It is settled law, however, that in an action for specific performance the plaintiff has the burden of proving all of the essential elements of his cause of action and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>burden is primarily on him to show his right in equity and good conscience to the relief sought. See <em>DiBella </em>v. <em>Widlitz, </em>207 Conn. 194, 199-200, 541 A.2d 91 (1988); <em>Frumento </em>v. <em>Mezzanotte, </em>supra, 615-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In evaluating whether the plaintiff was entitled to specific performance of the terms of the contract in this case, the trial court stated that it would grant such a remedy upon the application of a party \u201cunless it would be unjust, oppressive, or otherwise inequitable to do so.\u201d The defendants claim that this standard employed by the trial court effectively relieved the plaintiff of its lawful burden of proving an entitlement to specific performance and improperly placed the onus upon the defendants to demonstrate that this remedy was not warranted in this case. We disagree. Although an inference might be drawn from the above-quoted language that the court shifted the burden to the defendants to prove that the plaintiff was not entitled to specific performance, the trial court\u2019s subsequent analysis of the issue in its memorandum of decision clearly indicates otherwise. The trial court undertook a proper balancing of the equities in deciding that a decree of specific performance was justified in this case and, when read as a whole, the memorandum of decision persuades us that the burden of proof was properly placed upon the plaintiff. We are not inclined to find error on the basis of an inference that the trial court improperly shifted the burden of proof where such inference is clearly refuted by the substantive analysis of the trial court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., Glass and Covello, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\"> In the alternative, the trial court found that even if the agreement could be construed as an option contract, the plaintiff had timely exercised its option to purchase. In view of our disposition of this case, it is unnecessary for us to address this alternative finding of the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-5\"> The agreement calls for the following payment schedule: an \u201cinitial deposit\u201d of $7500 to be made upon the execution of the agreement; a \u201csecond deposit\u201d of $42,500 to be paid on December 19,1984; a \u201cthird deposit\u201d of $25,000 to be paid on March 19, 1985; a \u201cfourth deposit\u201d of $25,000 to be paid on June 8, 1985; a $700,000 promissory note to be executed by the plaintiff at the time of closing; and the balance of the purchase price to be paid by certified check, bank check or cash at the time of closing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b135-6\"> The word \u201coption\u201d does in fact appear once in the thirteen page agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\"> The record reveals that the plaintiff notified the defendants that it would not be ready, willing and able to purchase the property until October 3, 1985, or almost two weeks after the agreed upon closing date of September 20,1985. The validity of the contract, however, is not affected by this relatively brief delay. \u201cIn real estate contracts, \u2018the fact that a specific time is fixed for payment or for conveyance does not make \u201ctime of the essence\u201d\u2014\u00e1t least, it does not make performance at the <em>specified </em>time of the essence. Failure to pay at that time is not per se sufficient to terminate the seller\u2019s duty to convey; and failure to convey on the exact date does not per se discharge the buyer.\u2019 3A Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 716, p. 365 (1960).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Kakalik </em>v. <em>Bernardo, </em>184 Conn. 386, 392, 439 A.2d 1016 (1981). The agreement does not specify that \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d with respect to the date set for closing. Moreover, we conclude that the thirteen day delay was not an unreasonable one. See <em>John J. Brennan Construction Corporation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>187 Conn. 695, 714, 448 A.2d 180 (1982). Accordingly, the contract is not invalidated because of the plaintiffs inability to perform on the date set forth in the agreement for closing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\"> We are also reluctant to find error based upon an inference that the burden of proof was improperly shifted where the defendants failed to avail themselves of the opportunity to erase any ambiguity on this point by filing a motion for articulation. See Practice Book \u00a7 4051.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Shea, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AW8\">concurring. I disagree with the conclusion of the majority that the agreement between the parties, despite its title, \u201cOption Agreement,\u201d and the inclusion of provisions expressly discharging the plaintiff of liability in the event of its failure to purchase the property, imposed \u201ca binding obligation upon the plaintiff to purchase the property.\u201d Paragraph 16 of the written contract is as follows: \u201cIn the event Purchaser, through no fault of Seller, fails to perform any of the obligations hereinbefore set forth, Purchaser shall forfeit all claims to the Premises described herein, and all deposits previously paid in pursuance of this Agreement prior to said default by the Purchaser shall be construed as full liquidated damages to Seller and Purchaser shall be discharged of any and all liability to Seller under this Agreement. The parties agree that such deposits that have been previously paid to the Seller shall be considered as full liquidated damages by reason of the fact that the parties will be unable to agree on actual damages suffered by the Seller by removal of the Premises from the sales market.\u201d In contrast, paragraph 17 provides that, upon default of the seller, \u201cPurchaser may at its option: (a) enforce the terms hereof by action for specific performance; or (b) terminate this Agreement in which event all deposits and any and all interest thereon tendered by Purchaser to Seller shall be released and returned to Purchaser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The majority concedes that \u201ca distinguishing feature of an option contract is that it imposes no binding obligation on the option holder to complete the purchase.\u201d Because the \u201cOption Agreement\u201d provided for forfeiture as \u201cfull liquidated damages\u201d of the deposits made by the plaintiff as the purchaser upon its failure to complete the purchase of the property and, in such event, discharged it from \u201call liability\u201d under the agreement, no obligation to purchase has been imposed on the plaintiff beyond forfeiture of the deposits. In the same way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>no obligation is imposed on the holder of a standard option to purchase property beyond loss of the price paid for the option. Therefore, I would follow the cases that have treated agreements like the one before us, which incorporate an option provision into a contract of sale in the form of a provision releasing the buyer from liability for failure to perform but forfeiting the deposit as liquidated damages, as having essentially the same legal consequences as an option contract. <em>Dodek </em>v. <em>CF 16 Corporation, </em>537 A.2d 1086, 1094 (D.C. App. 1988); <em>Green Manor Corporation </em>v. <em>Tomares, </em>266 Md. 472, 295 A.2d 212 (1972); <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Haft, </em>253 Md. 692, 696, 253 A.2d 715 (1969); <em>Broady </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>572 S.W.2d 36, 40 (Tex. Civ. App. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">I agree with the result, nevertheless, because the alternative ground relied upon by the trial court, that the plaintiff did effectively exercise its option to purchase within the time contemplated is adequately supported by the evidence. There was evidence that the parties were negotiating over modifications of the terms of their agreement and that the defendants made a counterproposal on the date originally scheduled for performance concerning an extension of the time of performance. These negotiations, as the court found, \u201cbelie any claim on the part of the seller that time was of the essence\u201d while the parties were attempting to agree upon a modification of the \u201cOption Agreement.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
