The trial court ruled that \u00a7 52-199 created a privilege against self-incrimination for corporations and that General Statutes \u00a7 35-42 (d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> specifically incorporated that privilege into the Connecticut Anti-Trust Act.

General Statutes \u00a7 35-32.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The act provides that the attorney general \u201cshall investigate suspected violations and institute proceedings, for any violation of the provisions of\u201d the act.

In the event that any person duly served with a subpoena or interrogatory fails to comply therewith, the attorney general may apply to the trial court for an order requiring compliance.

XXII, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4; see 1E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure \u00a7 138 (f); and the pertinent language has not undergone significant revision since then. Section 52-198 presently provides: \u201cIf a corporation is party to an action, the opposite party may examine the president, treasurer, secretary, clerk or any director or other officer thereof in the same manner as if he were a party to the suit.\u201d Section 52-199 provides: \u201c(a) In any hearing or trial, a party interrogated shall not be obliged to answer a question or produce a document the answering or producing of which would tend to incriminate him, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>to disclose his title to any property if the title is not material to the hearing or trial, (b) The right to refuse to answer a question, produce a document or disclose a title may be claimed by the party interrogated or by counsel on his behalf.\u201d Section 35-42 (d) of the antitrust statute provides that no demand for documentary material requires the submission of material \u201cthe contents of which would be privileged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The respondent, Reliable Refuse Company, Inc. (Reliable), is engaged in the business of refuse hauling. On March 25, 1987, during an investigation of alleged antitrust violations in Connecticut\u2019s refuse hauling industry, the attorney general served interrogatories and a subpoena duces tecum on Reliable. On July 11, 1987, Reliable\u2019s counsel informed the attorney general that it would not respond. On August 27, 1987, the attorney general commenced this action pursuant to \u00a7 35-42 (f) by filing an application in the trial court for an order requiring Reliable to comply with the interrogatories and subpoena duces tecum. Reliable replied with an answer and special defenses, asserting as its principal defense the statutory privilege against self-incrimination contained in \u00a7 52-199. On July 13,1988, the trial court ruled that \u00a7 52-199 provided no \u201cblanket\u201d privilege against self-incrimination, and ordered Reliable to comply with the attorney general\u2019s demands \u201csubject to protection afforded Reliable by \u00a7\u00a7 52-199 and 35-42 (d), if any, as to individual questions asked or documents requested.\u201d Thereafter, Reliable complied with the order of the trial court by interposing its claimed privilege as to each interrogatory and request for production.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">On October 4, 1988, the attorney general renewed his application, arguing that \u00a7 52-199 did not create a privilege against self-incrimination for corporations, and that the absence of a pending civil action precluded the application of \u00a7 52-199. For the purposes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>application, the attorney general conceded that Reliable\u2019s answers to the interrogatories or production of the subpoenaed documents \u201cmay . . . tend to incriminate it.\u201d On December 8, 1988, the trial court ruled \u201cthat section 52-199 created a privilege against self-incrimination in favor of corporations and section 35-42 (d) specifically incorporated that privilege into the Connecticut Anti-Trust Act.\u201d The court also found that the hearing on the attorney general\u2019s action to compel Reliable to comply with its discovery demands was itself a \u201chearing\u201d to which the privilege applied. Accordingly, the trial court denied the attorney general\u2019s application. The attorney general appealed from this decision to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">On appeal, the attorney general claims that the trial court erred in ruling that \u00a7 52-199 applies to corporations, arguing that, despite its use of the word \u201cparty,\u201d the statute merely incorporates the common law rule making the privilege against self-incrimination available only to natural persons. Reliable contends, however, that the plain language of \u00a7 52-199 makes its privilege against self-incrimination available to any \u201cparty,\u201d including corporations. We agree with the attorney general that \u00a7 52-199 does not grant a corporation a privilege against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>We first note that Reliable has not raised any claim that it has a federal or state constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. It is well established that the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination is \u201climited to its historic function of protecting only the natural individual from compulsory incrimination through his own testimony or personal records.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>322 U.S. 694, 701, 64 S. Ct. 1248, 88 L. Ed. 1542 (1944); <em>Braswell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>487 U.S. 99, 102, 108 S. Ct. 2284, 101 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1988); <em>Bellis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>417 U.S. 85, 88, 94 S. Ct. 2179, 40 L. Ed. 2d 678 (1974); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>221 U.S. 361, 31 S. Ct. 538, 55 L. Ed. 771 (1911); see also Me v. <em>Henkel, </em>201 U.S. 43, 74-75, 26 S. Ct. 370, 50 L. Ed. 652 (1906); <em>State </em>v. <em>Biller, </em>190 Conn. 594, 600, 462 A.2d 987 (1983) (corporation has no fifth amendment privilege). Moreover, the common law privilege, embodied in the phrase \u201cnemo tenetur seipsum accusare,\u201d meaning \u201cno one is bound to accuse himself\u201d; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary; was coextensive with the constitutional privilege, and did not apply to \u201ccollective groups,\u201d 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence (McNaughton Rev. Ed. 1961) \u00a7 2259a, p. 354. That the privilege extended to only natural persons is evident from our observation in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>109 Conn. 490, 496, 146 A. 828 (1929), that \u201c[t]he history of the development of the privilege discloses that the object sought to be obtained thereby was the prevention of the employment of legal process to extract from the <em>person\u2019s own lips </em>an admission'of his guilt which would then take the place of other evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Because there is no constitutional privilege against self-incrimination asserted in this case, our task is limited to determining whether \u00a7 52-199 grants such a privilege to corporations. \u201cIn the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>and technical words and phrases, and such as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood accordingly.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). \u201cWhen the words of a statute are plain and unambiguous, we need look no further for interpretive guidance because we assume that the words themselves express the intention of the legislature. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>196 Conn. 309, 316, 493 A.2d 846,(1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1063, 106 S. Ct. 813, 88 L. Ed. 2d 787 (1986); <em>Mazur </em>v. <em>Blum, </em>184 Conn. 116, 118-19, 441 A.2d 65 (1981).\u201d <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986). We interpret statutory terms by reading them in context and not in isolation. See <em>Greenwich Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>129 Conn. 211, 222, 27 A.2d 166 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Although \u201c[cjourts are bound to accept the legislative definition of terms in a statute\u201d; <em>Toll Gate Farms, Inc. v. Milk Regulation Board, </em>148 Conn. 341, 347, 170 A.2d 883 (1961); there is no definition of the word \u201cparty\u201d or the term \u201cparty interrogated\u201d in either the civil discovery sections or the general definitional sections of the general statutes. Further, analyzing the word \u201cparty\u201d by its \u201ccommonly approved usage\u201d is inappropriate. Ordinarily, the word \u201cparty\u201d has a technical legal meaning, referring \u201cto those by or against whom a legal suit is brought . . . the party plaintiff or defendant, whether composed of one or more individuals and whether natural or legal persons.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, citing <em>Golatte </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>394 F. Sup. 1203, 1207 (D.C. Ala. 1975); <em>see Hardware Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Premo, </em>153 Conn. 465, 474, 217 A.2d 698 (1966) (technical words and phrases include technical legal terms). Thus, the word \u201cparty\u201d in isolation ordinarily encompasses \u201cnatural or legal persons,\u201d and therefore includes corporations. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (k) (\u201cperson\u201d may include corporation); General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 35-25 (b) (\u201cperson\u201d in antitrust statute includes natural persons or any legal or commercial entity).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Section 52-199, however, is ambiguous. As noted above, that statute provides that \u201ca party interrogated shall not be obliged to answer a question or produce a document the answering or producing of which would tend to incriminate <em>him.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The word \u201chim\u201d is a pronoun connoting masculinity. With certain ancient and idiosyncratic exceptions, the English language ordinarily does not use pronouns of gender to refer to inanimate objects or entities, such as corporations. It is significant that the definitional sections of the General Statutes provide that \u201c[w]ords importing the masculine gender may be applied to females and words importing the feminine gender may be applied to males.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (g). We are unaware of any similar section providing that a pronoun of gender may be applied to an inanimate object or legal entity. Further, because \u00a7 1-1 (g) specifically addresses \u201cwords importing . . . gender,\u201d but does not recognize that a pronoun of gender may refer to an inanimate object or legal entity, we hesitate to infer from the inclusion of \u201ccorporation\u201d in the definition of \u201cperson\u201d in \u00a7 1-1 (k) that the use of the word \u201chim\u201d in \u00a7 52-199 was meant to include nonnatural \u201cpersons\u201d within the phrase \u201cparty interrogated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Further, in discussing nonstatutory bases of the privilege against self-incrimination, this court has used the term \u201cparty\u201d to refer solely to natural persons. \u201cThe object of the [privilege against self-incrimination] is to afford to a <em>party, </em>called upon to give evidence in a proceeding inter alios, protection against being brought by means of his own evidence within the penalties of the law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Clancy, </em>110 Conn. 482, 489, 148 A. 551 (1930). The use of \u201cparty\u201d in <em>McCarthy </em>at the very least demonstrates that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>appearance of that word in the context of the privilege against self-incrimination does not decide whether \u201cparty\u201d must include nonnatural \u201cpersons.\u201d We conclude, therefore, that the language of \u00a7 52-199 creates an ambiguity as to whether its privilege against self-incrimination applies to corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">\u201cWhen we are confronted . . . with ambiguity in a statute, we seek to ascertain the actual intent by looking to the words of the statute itself; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>[199 Conn. 667, 673, 509 A.2d 20 (1986)]; <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>192 Conn. 207, 214, 471 A.2d 1368 (1984); the legislative history and circumstances surrounding the enactment of the statute; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 673; <em>DeFonce Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>State, </em>198 Conn. 185, 187, 501 A.2d 745 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158, 161, 496 A.2d 186 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>[185 Conn. 517, 522, 441 A.2d 158 (1981)]; and the purpose the statute is to serve. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 64, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985); <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Sivertsen, </em>188 Conn. 213, 221, 448 A.2d 1344 (1982); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 8, 434 A.2d 293 (1980).\u201d <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra. \u201c \u2018It is an elementary rule of construction that statutes should be considered as a whole, with a view toward reconciling their separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation; the application, moreover, of common sense to the statutory language is not to be excluded. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>supra, 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The attorney general advances a multipronged attack against a construction of \u00a7 52-199 that would give corporations a privilege against self-incrimination. He argues that chapter XXII of the 1889 public acts codified, but did not change, the common law rule that the privilege against self-incrimination applied only to natural persons. He also asserts that, since \u00a7 52-198 provides for the examination of specified officers of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>\u201cparty\u201d corporation \u201cas if [the officer] were a party to the suit,\u201d and since a corporation can only \u201cspeak\u201d through its agents, \u00a7 52-199\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination for \u201cthe party interrogated\u201d applies only to a corporate agent and not to the corporation itself. He further avers that recognizing a corporate privilege against self-incrimination under \u00a7 52-199 would \u201cvirtually nullify\u201d his power to investigate alleged antitrust violations by corporations. Reliable argues, however, that the prefatory language of \u00a7 52-198, providing that \u201c[i]f a corporation is party to an action,\u201d establishes that \u00a7\u00a7 52-198 and 52-199 contemplate that the privilege of \u00a7 52-199 shall apply to corporations. Further, it asserts that the attorney general\u2019s construction would render \u00a7 52-199 meaningless, since the constitution ensured and continues to ensure to natural persons a privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">We agree with the attorney general that the language and background of \u00a7\u00a7 52-198 and 52-199 fairly suggest that the privilege of \u00a7 52-199 codified, but did not expand, the common law and constitutional law limitation that the privilege against self-incrimination can be claimed only by natural persons. Although not dis-positive, we find authoritative the following comments regarding the civil discovery statutes in issue in Professor Stephenson\u2019s treatise on Connecticut civil practice: \u201c[Public Acts 1889, c. XXII,] is no more nor less than a codification of the rules of equity applicable to discovery, rules which had been incorporated in the motion practice, by reference, in [a prior statute enacted in 1836]. The statute codified but did not change the law.\u201d 1 -E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (2d Ed.) \u00a7 137 (c); see also <em>Downie </em>v. <em>Nettleton, </em>61 Conn. 593, 596, 24 A. 977 (1892) (1889 statute \u201cwas not designed to enlarge the scope of an equitable discovery principle, but simply to enable a court of law, in administering legal remedies, to exercise a clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>defined power of a court of equity\u201d). Further, in addition to the ambiguity presented by \u00a7 52-199\u2019s reference to the \u201cparty interrogated\u201d as \u201chim,\u201d the language of \u00a7 52-198 similarly suggests that the privilege does not apply to corporations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As noted above, \u00a7 52-198 states that \u201c[i]f a corporation is a party to an action, the opposite party may examine [a specified officer] in the same manner as if he were a party to the suit.\u201d As Reliable concedes, this language implemented the legislature\u2019s recognition that the legal entity known as a \u201ccorporation\u201d could not speak for itself, but only through its agents. See <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>13 Conn. 202, 211 (1839). Reliable argues, however, that the language of \u00a7 52-198 making a corporation\u2019s agent subject to examination \u201cas if he were a party to the suit\u201d does not displace the corporation as the \u201cparty\u201d to which the \u00a7 52-199 privilege applies. Reliable asserts, instead, that \u00a7\u00a7 52-198 and 52-199 establish that both the corporation <em>and </em>its examined agents may claim a privilege against self-incrimination in civil actions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Reliable\u2019s argument distorts the apparent range of the statutes. If, in enacting \u00a7 52-198, the legislature\u2019s precise and limited intent had been simply to give recognition to the reality that a corporation may speak only through its agents, its choice of language would be most peculiar. That limited objective would have been met had the statute read: \u201cIf a corporation is a party to an action, the opposite party may examine [a specified officer].\u201d In employing the ultimate clause, \u201cin the same manner as if he were a party to the suit,\u201d however, it is more reasonable to infer that the legislature intended to affirm that any corporate officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>could claim the privilege of \u00a7 52-199 on his own behalf when summoned to testify or produce documentary material in connection with a suit in which his corporation is a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Further, Reliable\u2019s sweeping asssertion that \u00a7\u00a7 52-198 and 52-199 must be read as extending the privilege to both the corporation\u2019s agent <em>and </em>the corporation itself is undermined by \u00a7 52-199\u2019s use of the term \u201cparty <em>interrogated.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Just as the last phrase in \u00a7 52-198 would have been unnecessary to accomplish the limited goal of acknowledging that a corporation may speak and act only through its agents, the word \u201cinterrogated\u201d in \u00a7 52-199 would be superfluous unless that word is interpreted to modify \u201cparty.\u201d See <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Tonken, </em>192 Conn. 581, 589, 473 A.2d 782 (1984) (there is a presumption that every word in a statute has meaning). It must be remembered here that a \u201ccorporation\u201d is but a fictional \u201cperson,\u201d created by statute and endowed only with those attributes given by statute. See General Statutes c. 599; <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Henkel, </em>supra, 74-75. A corporation \u201cspeaks\u201d only by virtue of personification. Only its agents in reality can be \u201cinterrogated,\u201d answer questions, and produce documents. The word \u201cinterrogated\u201d in \u00a7 52-199 obviously contemplates the actual examination conducted pursuant to the civil discovery provisions. We find nothing in the statute suggesting that the word \u201cinterrogated\u201d is meant figuratively or metaphysically. The use of that word, therefore, contemplates \u201cthe person\u2019s own lips.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>supra. Corporations may have figurative \u201clips,\u201d but they do not have anatomical \u201clips.\u201d Reliable\u2019s interpretation of \u201cparty interrogated,\u201d consequently, further personifies corporations in a manner contrary to common sense and without express statutory basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The fact that a corporation can be a party to litigation, and is, through its officers, susceptible to the nor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>mal rules of discovery, does not shed any light on whether the corporation has been given a statutory privilege against self-incrimination. There is no presumption in favor of extending personal privileges to corporations, which, as creatures of the state, are subject to pervasive state regulation. Indeed, such a privilege would be so unusual that one would expect it to have been clearly expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Finally, we agree with the attorney general that application of the privilege against self-incrimination of \u00a7 52-199 to a corporation would exenterate the attorney general\u2019s capacity to investigate alleged antitrust violations by corporations. As Justice Parskey, then a trial court judge, wrote in <em>Ajello </em>v. <em>Hartford Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn., </em>32 Conn. Sup. 198, 205, 347 A.2d 113 (1975), \u201c[t]he purpose of the state Anti-Trust Act is to enable the attorney general, who is charged with the enforcement of the state\u2019s antitrust laws, to obtain documentary information to determine if there has been a violation of the antitrust laws . . . .\u2019\u2019The purposes underlying <em>any </em>privilege against self-incrimination are extremely attenuated with respect to corporations. As the United States Supreme Court observed in <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Henkel, </em>supra, 75, \u201c[i]t would be a strange anomaly to hold that a State, having chartered a corporation to make use of certain franchises, could not in the exercise of its sovereignty inquire how these franchises had been employed, and whether they had been abused, and demand the production of the corporate books and papers for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">We recognize that the attorney general is empowered to investigate any \u201cperson,\u201d including natural persons, under the antitrust act. There is no doubt, of course, that \u00a7 52-199 would apply to natural persons subject to antitrust investigation under the appropriate circumstances. Extension of that privilege to corporations, however, without an unequivocal statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>basis for doing so, would cripple the attorney general\u2019s bona fide efforts to extirpate corporate antitrust violations. We are not persuaded that \u00a7 52-199 is intended to so compromise the attorney general\u2019s responsibilities and authority under the antitrust act. We are mindful here of the canon of statutory construction that \u201c[w]hen two statutes appear to be repugnant, it is the duty of the court to construe them so that both are operative, if that is reasonably possible.\u201d <em>Toll Gate Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milk Regulation Board, </em>supra, 347. Since \u00a7 52-199 may be reasonably construed as applying only to natural persons, our construction of the discovery and antitrust statutes makes both operative without frustrating the discernible legislative intent of either. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>197 Conn. 436, 445, 497 A.2d 974 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Our decision today, of course, does not preclude the legislature from determining, as a matter of policy, that it wishes to extend the benefits of a statutory privilege against self-incrimination to corporations, even though the availability of such a privilege would pose difficulties for the investigatory activities of state regulatory agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">There is error, the judgment denying the attorney general\u2019s application is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">In this opinion Peters, C.

Reliable argues, however, that the proceeding held on the attorney general\u2019s motion to compel compliance with its discovery demand was a \u201chearing\u201d to which the privilege applies.

The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether General Statutes \u00a7 52-199 provides a statutory privilege against self-incrimination for corporations. An examination of the plain and unambiguous language of this statute and its companions disclose that such a privilege exists. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-197, 52-198 and 52-199 were enacted together in 1889 as part of a new pretrial discovery procedure. 1 E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (2d Ed.) \u00a7 138f. All three statutes use the word \u201cparty.\u201d Section 52-198 provides: <em>\u201cIf a corporation is party to an action, </em>the opposite party may examine the president, treasurer, secretary, clerk or any director or other officer thereof in the same manner as if he were a party to the suit.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, \u201cparty\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-198 clearly contemplates and includes corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">It is inconceivable to me, therefore, that the word \u201cparty\u201d in \u00a7 52-199 the very next statute in numerical sequence, a statute dealing with the same subject matter, and a statute enacted at the same time, would not also include corporations. In construing a statute, \u201cwe must consider the statutory scheme as a whole . . . . Where, as here, more than one statute is involved, we presume that the legislature intended them to be read together to create a harmonious body of law.\u201d <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Tonken, </em>192 Conn. 581, 589, 473 A.2d 782 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">It is a fundamental tenet of statutory construction that a corporation is a \u201cperson.\u201d Both General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-1 (k) and 35-25 (b) specifically state that a \u201c \u2018[pjerson\u2019 [means] . . . corporation.\u201d It is also fundamental that a \u201ccorporation . . . may sue and be sued . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 33-291 (b). This being so, a corporation is therefore a party within the meaning of the rules of practice that govern these proceedings. Practice Book \u00a7 216 (2) states that a \u201c \u2018party\u2019 means (a) a person named as a party in the action</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Finally, General Statutes \u00a7 35-42 (d), the specific antitrust statute here in issue, recognizes the existence of privileges that can act as a limitation on the powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>otherwise conferred upon the attorney general. Section 35-42 (d) provides: \u201cNo such demand shall require the submission of any documentary material, <em>the contents of which would be privileged, </em>or precluded from disclosure if demanded in a grand jury investigation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) While this particular reference is to documentary material, it connotes a legislative recognition that the attorney general\u2019s powers under the antitrust act are not to transcend in all events otherwise applicable privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Accordingly, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the attorney general\u2019s application to compel the defendant to respond to interrogatories and to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
