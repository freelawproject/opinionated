(taxpayers), from a decision of the Superior Court dismissing their appeal from the assessment of sales and use taxes by the department of revenue services (department) for the period June 1, 1982, through May 31,1985. The sales and use taxes in question were assessed against the taxpayers for machinery used in the production of baked goods at their in-store bakeries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The taxpayers disputed the department\u2019s assessments against them claiming that the machinery assessed was exempt from sales and use taxes under General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 (34)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>because, it was used directly in a \u201cmanufacturing production process.\u201d After a hearing, the department refused to revise its assessment and the taxpayers appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 12-422.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Superior Court dismissed the taxpayers\u2019 appeal and the taxpayers subsequently appealed to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The facts are not in dispute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The taxpayers are supermarkets engaged in the retail sale of food products at various locations in Connecticut. At several of these locations, the taxpayers own and operate bakeries on the premises that produce baked goods for retail sale over the counter to the general public. The taxpayers\u2019 bakery operations are carried on in discrete areas of their supermarkets. The machinery upon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the commissioner levied an assessment is utilized solely to mix and bake the ingredients necessary to produce bakery products suitable for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">A relatively small portion of the taxpayers\u2019 store area and resources is devoted to the production and sale of bakery products. Only 2 to 2.5 percent of the taxpayers\u2019 total sales, 3.5 percent of employees\u2019 hours, 3.1 percent of the total number of employees, 4.4 percent of floor space and 2.6 percent of the taxpayers\u2019 total costs are attributable to their in-store bakery operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">In correspondence with the taxpayers, the department stated that it refused to revise the assessment against them because \u201can establishment [in order to qualify for an exemption under \u00a7 12-412 (34)] must have manufacturing as its main purpose and be generally recognized to be an industrial plant.\u201d The department went on to note that the \u201cbaking of the products on the premises does not change the primary purpose of the store as a retail establishment to that of an industrial plant. The manufacturing aspect of the baking is incidental to the retail characteristics and, as a consequence, such establishment is not eligible for exemption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The Superior Court, in dismissing the taxpayers\u2019 appeal, agreed with the department and concluded that \u201cthe baking of the products on the premises does not change the primary purpose of the store as a retail establishment to that of an industrial plant.\u201d We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 (34) provides an exemption from sales and use taxes for the \u201c[s]ales of and the storage, use or other consumption of machinery used directly in a <em>manufacturing </em>or agricultural production process.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Further, \u00a7 12-426-l.lb (b) (3)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides that \u201c[t]he [sales and use] tax does not apply to sales of and the storage, use or other consumption in this state of machinery used in a <em>manufacturing production process . </em>. . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) If, therefore, the taxpayers\u2019 bakery operations fit within the definition of a \u201cmanufacturing production process,\u201d any machinery used in that process would be exempt from sales and use taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Section 12-426-llb (a) (ll)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides that a \u201c \u2018[m]anufacturing production process\u2019 shall mean any one of a series of production activities, beginning with the movement of the raw materials after their receipt, inspection and storage, to the first production machine and ending with the completion of the finished product, including any packaging operations, for its sale to the ultimate consumer. . . . \u2018Manufacturing production process\u2019 <em>shall occur solely at an industrial plant.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The department concedes that the process by which the taxpayers convert raw materials into finished baked goods is \u201cone of a series of production activities.\u201d The department argues, however, that because the taxpayers\u2019 activities take place at a supermarket and not at an \u201cindustrial plant,\u201d the taxpayers are not engaged in a \u201cmanufacturing production process\u201d within the meaning of the regulations. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>An \u201cindustrial plant\u201d is defined in the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, \u00a7 12-426-llb (a) (7)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as \u201ca <em>manufacturing facility </em>at which a manufacturing production process is occurring. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) The question to be resolved, therefore, is whether the taxpayers\u2019 supermarkets containing on-premise bakeries are \u201cmanufacturing facilities]\u201d and, therefore, \u201cindustrial plant[s]\u201d in which a \u201cmanufacturing production process is occurring.\u201d If they are, the machinery purchased for use in the taxpayers\u2019 bakeries is exempt from the imposition of sales and use taxes. General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 (34).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The taxpayers first argue that the department and the trial court applied a regulation repealed in 1980 in order to determine that their supermarkets were not \u201cindustrial plants\u201d and therefore did not qualify for an exemption under \u00a7 12-412 (34). The taxpayers claim that because the repealed regulation, the former \u00a7 12-426-11 (g),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> embodied a \u201cprimary purpose test\u201d to determine whether an establishment was an \u201cindustrial plant,\u201d its repeal was conclusive evidence that that test was abrogated and could not be used by the department or the trial court to arrive at their respective decisions. After its repeal, \u00a7 12-426-11 (g) was replaced by \u00a7 12-426-llb (a) (7). As previously noted, \u00a7 12-426-llb (a) (7) defines an \u201cindustrial plant\u201d as a \u201cmanufacturing facility at which a manufactur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>ing process is occurring.\u201d The term \u201cmanufacturing facility\u201d in the regulation is not further defined in either the statutes or the regulations. That term, therefore, was required to be interpreted by the trial court to effect a resolution of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">We see no reason why, in interpreting the present regulation, the trial court could not have ascribed to the term \u201cmanufacturing facility\u201d its ordinary meaning and commonly approved usage. <em>Connecticut Water Co. </em>v. <em>Barboto, </em>206 Conn. 387, 345, 537 A.2d 490 (1988); <em>Kilpatrick </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>206 Conn. 25, 28, 535 A.2d 1311 (1988); <em>Federal Aviation Administration </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>196 Conn. 546, 550, 494 A.2d 564 (1985). The application of that meaning, we conclude, would have required the trial court, as it does this court, to arrive at a result contrary to that espoused by the taxpayers. Indisputably, the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cmanufacturing facility\u201d connotes a place where manufacturing is carried on either primarily or exclusively. No disinterested observer would think of a supermarket, containing a bakery section occupying a minute portion of its premises, as a \u201cmanufacturing facility\u201d or an \u201cindustrial plant.\u201d Further, if the taxpayers were to prevail in their contention that a \u201cmanufacturing facility\u201d is any place where a manufacturing production process is carried on, it would render superfluous and meaningless the sentence in \u00a7 12-426-llb (a) (11), which states that a \u201c \u2018[mjanufacturing production process\u2019 shall occur solely at an industrial plant.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Harris Data Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>183 Conn. 194, 197, 438 A.2d 1178 (1981); <em>Green </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>178 Conn. 700, 703, 425 A.2d 122 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>While \u00a7 12-426-11 (g) has been repealed, the absence of the word \u201cprimarily\u201d from the present regulation does not signify a change in substance in the scope of the exemption. The present regulation continues to require machinery to be used in a \u201cmanufacturing production process\u201d that must occur \u201csolely at an industrial plant.\u201d The repeal of \u00a7 12-426-11 (g) did not delete the word \u201cprimarily\u201d from the English language, and absent some indication of legislative or agency intent to the contrary, if its use is appropriate as a component in formulating a reasonable interpretation of an undefined term in the current regulations we see no reason for its prohibition. There is no error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The taxpayers next maintain that the interpretation of the term \u201cmanufacturing facility\u201d by the department and the trial court to exclude the taxpayers\u2019 supermarkets from an exemption constituted a \u201cregulation\u201d promulgated in violation of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act and was therefore invalid. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The ordinary meaning of the terms \u201cmanufacturing facility\u201d and \u201cindustrial plant\u201d as stated in the regulations renders it at least implicit, if not explicit, that those terms did not apply to supermarkets. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>187 Conn. 458, 460-61, 446 A.2d 822 (1982). Further, in defining those terms the department and the trial court, rather than promulgating a \u201cregulation,\u201d reasonably interpreted the existing regulations. It is clear that they have the authority to do so. <em>Quin-nipiac Counsel, Boy Scouts of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>204 Conn. 287, 293 n.5, 528 A.2d 352 (1987); <em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 489, 497, 512 A.2d 199 (1986); <em>Connecticut Mobile Home Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Jensen\u2019s, Inc., </em>178 Conn. 586, 589, 424 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>A.2d 285 (1979); <em>Ouellet </em>v. <em>Shapiro, </em>3 Conn. Cir. Ct. 268, 272, 212 A.2d 708 (1965); 1 Am. Jur. 2d, Administrative Law \u00a7 186 and vol. 2, \u00a7 233. We find no merit to this claim of the taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Finally, the taxpayers contend that at trial they clearly demonstrated that the department\u2019s interpretation of the terms \u201cindustrial plant and manufacturing facility was unreasonable.\u201d This claim requires no further discussion other than to note that any statute creating a tax exemption must \u201cbe strictly construed against the party claiming an exemption\u201d; <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>183 Conn. 566, 571, 440 A.2d 767 (1981); and that the taxpayers bore the burden of proving the assessment was in error. <em>H. B. Sanson, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tax Commission, </em>187 Conn. 581, 586, 447 A.2d 12 (1982). They failed to sustain that burden.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-8\"> The appeal also protested the assessment of sales and use tax on \u201cmaterials\u201d used in the taxpayers\u2019 bakeries. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 (18). In its brief, however, the department states that it levied an assessment of sales and use taxes <em>only </em>on \u201cmachinery.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 (34). The exemption under \u00a7 12-412 (34) is therefore the only exemption at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b477-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 (34) provides: \u201cmachinery used in manufacturing or agricultural production.

In <em>Ziperstein, </em>this court upheld the trial court\u2019s determination that the appellee was entitled to an exemption for electricity consumed in fabricating products on premises and sold at retail over-the-counter at a Dairy Queen outlet. <em>Ziperstein, </em>however, was decided under the repealed \u00a7 12-426-11 (g) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies and the percentage of the appellees\u2019 resources and space devoted to manufacturing its product in <em>Ziperstein </em>was much greater than that in the present case. Further, although we were unable to locate any legislative history, the timing (1980) indicates that the present regulation, \u00a7 12-426-llb (a) (7), was promulgated to make it more difficult for retail outlets to qualify for exemptions as industrial plants.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
