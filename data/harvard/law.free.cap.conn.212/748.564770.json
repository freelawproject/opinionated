On July 30,1984, her employers assigned her to work in the Green Street area. At approximately 8 a.m., as she walked along Green Street, she observed a man on the opposite sidewalk who appeared to be looking for directions. She crossed the street to offer assistance. As she came near, the man, a stranger, reached into a satchel, removed a gun, and held it against her. He forced her from the sidewalk through a paved vacant lot that abutted the street. The man then forced her onto adjacent property owned by the named defendant (hereinafter defendant) some fifty to seventy feet from the sidewalk. The defendant\u2019s property extended approximately six and three-quarter feet from the side of his building to the lot boundary parallel to the building. The area into which the plaintiff was forced was bounded by the defendant\u2019s building on one side and a retaining wall in the rear. On the other side, overgrown sumac bushes and tall grass shielded the area from view from the sidewalk and street.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Behind the sumac bushes, the abductor viciously assaulted and raped the plaintiff for thirty minutes. In the commission of the assault, the abductor used various items, including a rope and rubber gloves, which he had carried with him in his satchel. His possession of these items suggested that the sexual assault had been planned. The assailant fled after committing the crime and has never been identified or caught. The effect of the sexual assault upon the plaintiff has been severe. She has attempted suicide on several occasions. Her emotional and psychiatric problems have required and continue to require hospital confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for personal injuries sustained in the assault. The complaint alleged causes of action based on common law negligence, statutory negligence and public nuisance. In essence, she claimed that the defendant had failed to remove the overgrown vegetation although he knew or should have known that, because the neighborhood was a high crime area, third persons might use the overgrowth to conceal the perpetration of crimes against pedestrians. She asserted that, had the overgrowth not been present, the area in which the assault occurred would have been visible to passing motorists and pedestrians. Consequently, she alleged, the overgrowth caused and contributed to the assault and the duration of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The action was tried to a jury before the court, <em>Walsh, J. </em>Several witnesses described the neighborhood where the sexual assault had been committed as a high crime area. Another rape had occurred in a neighborhood building about three months prior to the sexual assault against the plaintiff. Approximately fourteen months prior to the assault, Clara Manheimer, the defendant\u2019s ninety year old mother, had been bound, gagged and robbed in the package store at the front <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>of the huilding on the defendant\u2019s property. Prostitution and drug dealing were more prevalent in that section of New London than in other sections. Further, derelicts and homeless people frequented the site where the assault occurred and the adjacent vacant lot through which the plaintiff had been forced from the sidewalk. Various debris littered the area, including liquor and wine bottles and cans. Street people had scattered cardboard boxes, mattresses and blankets that they used when they slept there at night. There was also evidence that on occasion, some of those people had been compensated with free liquor for cleaning the vacant lot. The police frequently had removed from the area people too drunk to care for themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In addition to testimony concerning the assault and the condition of the site, the plaintiff presented George Rand, an environmental psychologist. Rand testified that he personally examined the location of the assault, the surrounding neighborhood, and, for lack of a better term, the cultural activities and history of the area. He testified that, in his opinion, the physical configuration of the specific site increased the risk of violent crimes between strangers by creating a \u201cprotective\u201d zone that reduced or eliminated visibility and, hence, served as an inducement for crime. He summarized the results of his study by testifying that \u201cI\u2019ve analyzed the local site, the sub area, the presence of adult entertainment, activities, sexually oriented businesses. I\u2019ve looked at prior crimes. . . . The fact that it is an area of the city with a relatively high incidence of crime. And I . . . assumed as a result of those observations that there was a persistent and inappropriate use of that site based on the evidence that it was periodically and frequently used by drunks .... There was fighting. Police came. A history of complaints. All those things <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>indicate a condition of environmental disorder that I would contend is potentially related to increasing the risk of crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Melvin Jetmore, a building official for the city of New London and one of the authors of the housing code, testified for the plaintiff that the site of the defendant\u2019s property where the rape had occurred violated the housing code due to the presence of an \u201cobnoxious\u201d overgrowth of sumac trees and brush, and various debris including papers, shingles and broken glass. Jetmore testified that prior to the assault, New London had notified the defendant in March, 1983, and again in February, 1984, of the housing code violations, and that Jetmore had specifically told the defendant to remove all the debris and broken glass and \u201ccut all the bushes and trees down.\u201d The defendant, however, did not correct the violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The plaintiff also presented conflicting testimony concerning the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the pertinent housing code provisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jetmore testified that the relevant provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>sions of the city housing code were designed to prevent deterioration and \u201cblight\u201d and to keep property clear of \u201cnuisances and hazards to the safety of occupants, pedestrians and so forth.\u201d Further, Robert Finn, a housing code officer for the town of Plainville, testified initially that in his opinion, it was a function of the housing code to eliminate such hazards as \u201cpossible places for concealment of criminal activity.\u201d On recross-examination, however, Finn contradicted himself, and testified that it was not a purpose of the housing code to prevent the concealment of persons who intend to commit criminal activity. He concluded, \u201cI can\u2019t say that those trees should be removed because of an anticipated crime. But, they should be removed because they violate the code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the defendant rested without presenting evidence and moved for a directed verdict. The trial court reserved a decision on the defendant\u2019s motion. Thereafter, the jury returned a general verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and awarded her $540,000 in damages. The parties did not seek separate verdicts on either count, or request the submission of interrogatories to the jury. Subsequently, however, the trial court set aside the verdict on the defendant\u2019s motion. In setting aside the verdict, the trial court first observed that \u201c [without the shielding [of the overgrowth], the rape most probably would not have occurred [on the defendant\u2019s property].\u201d The court implicitly found that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care, stating that, \u201c[i]n the neighborhood described in the present case, a trier of fact may . . . find the occurrence of violence reasonably foreseeable in such a sheltered location to be perpetrated by someone lying in ambush or by someone also using the public right of way who harbors an intent to drag into concealment and out of public view some other party also using the public right of way to inflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>harm.\u201d It also found that the \u201cbreach of duty whether common law or statutory or the creating or permitting of a public nuisance was the position of the sumac bush.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Despite finding a legally cognizable duty and a breach of that duty, the trial court nevertheless ruled that \u201cthe shielded bushing did not cause the injury. The rape and assault caused the injury and damages.\u201d \u201cThat shielding [which was described as the building, a retaining wall and sumac trees and/or bushes] could have been provided in that same place and time by some other validly positioned or placed apurtenance.\u201d The court concluded, therefore, that as a matter of law, the jury could not find that the defendant\u2019s maintenance of overgrowth on his property was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in producing the plaintiff\u2019s injuries and, hence, the plaintiff had failed to establish proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court granting the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict. We transferred the case to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in setting aside the verdict on the ground that the plaintiff had not established proximate cause as a matter of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She asserts that evidence pertaining to the condition of the defendant\u2019s property, in connection with evidence that the neighborhood was a high crime area and that the specific site was frequented by trespassing street people and derelicts, created a question of fact for the jury whether the harm the plaintiff had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>suffered was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant. She avers, therefore, that the trial court erred in concluding that the criminal act of the unknown assailant was the supervening cause of the plaintiffs injuries as a matter of law. Further, she argues that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the condition of the defendant\u2019s property was not a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in causing the plaintiff\u2019s injuries was inconsistent with its prior finding that \u201cthe occurrence of violence [was] reasonably foreseeable in such a sheltered location\u201d and that \u201c[without the shielding, the rape most probably would not have occurred there.\u201d Consequently, she claims, the court erred in setting aside the jury\u2019s verdict in her favor on the ground that she had failed to prove proximate cause. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">\u201cProximate cause\u201d is an element of proof of all three causes of action asserted by the plaintiff. See, e.g., <em>Catz </em>v. <em>Rubenstein, </em>201 Conn. 39, 44, 513 A.2d 98 (1986) (elements of negligence are duty, breach, causation and damages); <em>Madenford </em>v. <em>Interstate Lumber &amp; Mill Corporation, </em>153 Conn. 62, 64, 212 A.2d 588 (1965) (to be actionable, violation of statute must proximately cause injury);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton, </em>204 Conn. 177, 183, 527 A.2d 688 (1987) (actionable nuisance must proximately cause injuries).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>tiff has not argued that a different proximate cause analysis may or should apply to the different causes of action alleged. Therefore, although the jury\u2019s general verdict requires us to \u201cpresume that the jury found every issue in favor of the prevailing party\u201d; <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>202 Conn. 190, 202, 520 A.2d 208 (1987); <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Bastarache, </em>188 Conn. 201, 204, 449 A.2d 142 (1982); <em>Collucci </em>v. <em>Pinette, </em>185 Conn. 483, 489, 441 A.2d 574 (1981); our analysis of the proximate cause issue embraces the plaintiff\u2019s separate claims of common law negligence, statutory negligence and public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Ordinarily, \u201cthe decision to set aside a verdict involves the exercise of a broad legal discretion by the trial court which, in the absence of a clear abuse, will not be disturbed; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>[171 Conn. 1, 3, 368 A.2d 11 (1976)]; and further, that in reviewing the exercise of that discretion every reasonable presumption should be indulged in favor of its correctness. <em>Angelica </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>174 Conn. 534, 535, 391 A.2d 167 (1978); <em>Ardoline </em>v. <em>Keegan, </em>140 Conn. 552, 555, 102 A.2d 352 (1954).\u201d <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Goodspeed, </em>180 Conn. 415, 416, 429 A.2d 915 (1980). The trial court\u2019s discretion, however, is circumscribed by our recognition that the \u201cissue of proximate cause is ordinarily a question of fact for the trier. <em>Tetro </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>189 Conn. 601, 605, 485 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>5 (1983). \u2018Conclusions of proximate cause are to be drawn by the jury and not by the court.\u2019 <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>189 Conn. 484, 489, 546 A.2d 1196 (1983). \u2018 \u201cIt becomes a conclusion of law only when the mind of a fair and reasonable man could reach only one conclusion; if there is room for a reasonable disagreement the question is one to be determined by the trier of fact.\u201d . . . \u2019 \u201d <em>Trzcinski </em>v. <em>Richey, </em>190 Conn. 285, 295, 460 A.2d 1269 (1983). Thus, the trial court\u2019s judgment setting aside the jury\u2019s verdict may stand only if there was no \u201croom for a reasonable disagreement\u201d on the question of proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">To prevail on a negligence claim, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201clegally caused\u201d the injuries. <em>Wu </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>204 Conn. 435, 438, 528 A.2d 364 (1987); <em>Hearl </em>v. <em>Waterbary YMCA, </em>187 Conn. 1, 4, 444 A.2d 211 (1982); W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed.) \u00a7 41, p. 263. As we observed in <em>Kowal </em>v. <em>Hofher, </em>181 Conn. 355, 359, 436 A.2d 1 (1980), \u201c[l]egal cause is a hybrid construct, the result of balancing philosophic, pragmatic and moral approaches to causation.\u201d The first component of \u201clegal cause\u201d is \u201ccausation in fact.\u201d \u201c \u2018Causation in fact\u2019 is the purest legal application of . . . legal cause. The test for cause in fact is, simply, would the injury have occurred were it not for the actor\u2019s conduct.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The second component of \u201clegal cause\u201d is proximate cause, which we have defined as \u201c \u2018[a]n actual cause that is a substantial factor in the resulting harm . . . .\u2019 <em>Coburn </em>v. <em>Lenox Homes, Inc., </em>186 Conn. 370, 383, 441 A.2d 620 (1982).\u201d <em>Boehm </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>201 Conn. 385, 391, 517 A.2d 624 (1986). The \u201cproximate cause\u201d requirement tempers the \u201cexpansive view of causation [in fact] ... by the pragmatic . . . shaping [of] rules which are feasible to administer, and yield a workable degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>of certainty. 2 Harper &amp; James, Torts \u00a7 20.4, p. 1133. Remote or trivial [actual] causes are generally rejected because the determination of the responsibility for another\u2019s injury is much too important to be distracted by explorations for obscure consequences or inconsequential causes.\u201dKowal <em>v.Hofher, </em>supra, 359-60. \u201cIn determining proximate cause, the point beyond which the law declines to trace a series of events that exist along a chain signifying actual causation is a matter of fair judgment and a rough sense of justice. See generally Palsgraf <em>v. Long Island R.R. Co., </em>248 N.Y. 339, 352, 354-56,162 N.E. 99 (1928) (Andrews, J., dissenting).\u201d <em>Boehm </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>supra, 391-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">This court has often stated that the \u201ctest\u201d of proximate cause is whether the defendant\u2019s conduct is a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in producing the plaintiff\u2019s injury. <em>Wu </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 438; <em>Boehm </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>supra; <em>Tetro </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra; see also <em>Ferndale Dairy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Geiger, </em>167 Conn. 533, 538, 356 A.2d 91 (1975) (defining \u201csubstantial factor\u201d as one which \u201cmust have continued down to the moment of the damage or, at least, down to the setting in motion of the final active injurious force which immediately produced or preceded the damage\u201d); but see W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, p. 278. That negligent conduct is a \u201ccause in fact,\u201d however, obviously does not mean that it is also a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d for the purposes of a proximate cause inquiry. The \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test, in truth, reflects the inquiry fundamental to all proximate cause questions; that is, \u201c \u2018whether the harm which occurred was of the same general nature as the foreseeable risk created by the defendant\u2019s negligence.\u2019 <em>Merhi </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>[164 Conn. 516, 521, 325 A.2d 270 (1973)]; <em>see Palsgraf </em>v. <em>Long Island R.[R.] Co., </em>[supra, 354].\u201d <em>Coburn </em>v. <em>Lenox Homes Inc., </em>supra, 384. In applying this test, we look \u201c \u2018from the injury to the negligent act complained of for the necessary causal connection. <em>Collins </em>v. <em>City </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number><em>National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>131 Conn. 167, 171, 38 A.2d 582 [1944].\u2019 \u201d <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Oxford, </em>189 Conn. 740, 749, 459 A.2d 100 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The \u201cscope of the risk\u201d analysis of \u201cproximate cause\u201d similarly applies where, as here, the risk of harm created by the defendant\u2019s negligence allegedly extends to an intervening criminal act by a third party. See <em>Tetro </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra, 605; <em>Coburn </em>v. <em>Lenox Homes, Inc., </em>supra. \u201cWe have consistently adhered to the standard of 2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 442B (1965) that a negligent defendant, whose conduct creates or increases the risk of a particular harm and is a substantial factor in causing that harm, is not relieved from liability by the intervention of another person, <em>except </em>where the harm is intentionally caused by the third person <em>and </em>is not within the scope of the risk created by the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Kiniry </em>v. <em>Danbury Hospital, </em>183 Conn. 448, 455, 439 A.2d 408 (1981); <em>Merhi </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>[supra, 522]; <em>Miranti </em>v. <em>Brookside Shopping Center, Inc., </em>159 Conn. 24, 28, 266 A.2d 370 (1969).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Tetro </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra. \u201cThe reason [for the general rule precluding liability where the intervening act is intentional or criminal] is that in such a case the third person has deliberately assumed control of the situation, and all responsibility for the consequences of his act is shifted to him.\u201d 2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 442B, comment c. \u201cSuch tortious or criminal acts may in themselves be foreseeable, [however,] and so within the scope of the created risk . . . .\u2019\u2019Id.; see also 2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7\u00a7 448 and 449.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Applying these principles, we first note that the defendant has not argued that his conduct was not a \u201ccause in fact\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The trial court found that the sexual assault most probably would not have occurred <em>where it actually occurred </em>had the overgrown vegetation not been present. The court also found that the jury could have found from the evidence that the rapist \u201cby design and plan premeditated that the sexual assault would occur in that exact location.\u201d Further, there was evidence from which the jury could reasonably have found that the assault would not have lasted thirty minutes absent the shielding provided by the overgrowth. \u201cThe conception of causation in fact extends not only to positive acts and active physical forces, but also to pre-existing passive conditions which have played a . . . part in bringing about the event.\u201d W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, p. 265. Under the circumstances, we have no reason to question the trial court\u2019s finding that the injury would not have occurred, where it actually occurred, were it not for the shielding created by the overgrowth. <em>Boehm </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>supra; <em>Kowal </em>v. <em>Hofher, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">We disagree with the plaintiff, however, that there was room for reasonable disagreement over the question whether the condition on the defendant\u2019s property proximately caused her injuries. <em>Trzcinski </em>v. <em>Richey, </em>supra. The plaintiff argues that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the impaired visibility created by the overgrowth, in conjunction with the manner in which the defendant\u2019s property was used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>and the unseemly character of the neighborhood, increased the risk of violent crime between strangers. She claims, therefore, that under \u00a7 442B of the Restatement, the assailant\u2019s act was within the \u201cscope of the risk\u201d created by the condition of the defendant\u2019s property. We are persuaded, however, that the plaintiff\u2019s application of \u00a7 442B of the Restatement is unduly broad. Contrary to her assertion, the harm she suffered cannot reasonably be understood as within the scope of the risk created by the defendant\u2019s conduct. We reach this conclusion on the basis of the applicable standards established in our cases as well as by reference to factually analogous precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">First, we decline to accept the plaintiff\u2019s argument suggesting that it was within the \u201cscope of the risk\u201d that the condition of the defendant\u2019s land might catalyze a criminal assault. The plaintiff presented expert testimony that conditions of \u201cenvironmental disorder,\u201d such as those present on the defendant\u2019s property and within the surrounding neighborhood, stood in a direct and positive relationship with an increased risk of violent crimes between strangers. She also presented evidence tending to indicate that the assailant had planned the crime around the site. Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s theory of liability turns in part on the argument that because the overgrowth was instrumental, in a psychological and sociological sense, in fostering the criminal act, the defendant should be held liable!</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">This argument envisages the rapist\u2019s conduct as a \u201cdependent intervening force\u201d; that is, a predictable response or \u201creaction to the stimulus of a situation for which the actor has made himself responsible by his negligent conduct.\u201d 2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 441, comment c. This position is untenable. First, it is clear that \u00a7 442B contemplates <em>reasonably foreseeable </em>intervening misconduct, rather than <em>all </em>conduct that actually proceeds from a situation created by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>defendant. <em>Coburn </em>v. <em>Lenox Homes, Inc., </em>supra, 375, 384. We are not persuaded that a landowner should reasonably foresee that a condition on his property such as overgrown vegetation might provide a substantial incentive or inducement for the commission of a violent criminal assault between strangers. This is true although once such an incident does occur, it necessarily \u201ccould\u201d have occurred. Violent crimes are actuated by a host of social and psychological factors. Although, as a matter of fact, it may be true that one of those actuating factors is mere opportunity for concealment, common experience informs us that such a factor is at most incidental. A prudent person who owns land abutting a public way would not, in our opinion, infer from his ordinary experience the possibility that overgrown vegetation will prompt or catalyze a violent criminal act. This theory ascribes far too much speculative imagination to a \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201cprudent\u201d person. A person of ordinary caution is not required to be accomplished at making such recondite associations.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Moreover, in the present case, there was no evidence tending to demonstrate that the defendant had had any past experience that might reasonably have led him to perceive and act on the atypical association between \u201cnatural shields\u201d such as overgrown vegetation and violent criminal activity. Indeed, the evidence showed that the prior \u201ccriminal activity\u201d occurring in the vacant lot abutting his property and the scene of the crime generally was nonviolent, involving vagrancy and the public consumption of alcohol. The plaintiff has not directed our attention to evidence that any of the individuals who frequented the vacant lot threatened or assaulted any passersby or local residents, except to the extent that their mere presence and appearance was \u201cthreatening.\u201d Moreover, evidence that the defendant\u2019s mother had been robbed in the liquor store on the defendant\u2019s premises, and that a rape had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>occurred in a nearby building more than two months prior to the assault on the plaintiff, does not require a different conclusion. Both incidents occurred indoors. The fact that criminals will rob liquor stores is an unfortunate, but not extraordinary, fact of contemporary life, and cannot reasonably be seen as exciting the imagination of a prudent person to suppose that a violent sexual crime will occur behind nearby overgrown vegetation in the area of a vacant lot. Further, even if it is assumed that the defendant knew or should have known of the rape in the nearby building, the plaintiff has not presented evidence demonstrating anything distinctive about that inherently atrocious incident that might be reasonably understood as eliciting the type of sensitivity for which she would now hold the defendant accountable. In addition, that experts in environmental psychology such as George Rand are attuned to the association between conditions of \u201cenvironmental disorder,\u201d such as overgrown vegetation in a poor neighborhood, and crime is surely a product of special training, knowledge, interest and, especially, perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Further, the theory of \u201ccatalyst\u201d liability suggested by the plaintiff is far too ambitious. We are persuaded that such a principle would eliminate the role of \u201cproximate cause\u201d in \u201cshaping rules which are feasible to administer, and yield a workable degree of certainty.\u201d <em>Kowal </em>v. <em>Hofher, </em>supra, 359-60. Indeed, under this principle, for example, parents of a violent adult child might well be held liable to third persons injured by that child\u2019s crime if the victim only establishes a positive relationship between the parents\u2019 poor parenting skills and the child\u2019s violence. We have little doubt that, in any particular case, such a victim could establish a \u201ccause in fact\u201d in such a case. This hypothetical illustrates the fundamental weakness of the plaintiff\u2019s position: it renders \u201cproximate cause\u201d coextensive with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>\u201ccause in fact.\u201d \u201cProximate cause,\u201d however, deals with liability, not physics. W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, p. 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">No different result ensues from the plaintiffs less dramatic argument that the condition on the defendant\u2019s property, in connection with the \u201csocio-chemistry\u201d of the area, created a foreseeable \u201copportunity\u201d for the commission of a violent crime and, hence, the harm inflicted on the plaintiff was within the \u201cscope of the risk.\u201d Our cases make it clear that, to be within the \u201cscope of the risk,\u201d the harm actually suffered must be of the same \u201cgeneral type\u201d as that which makes the defendant\u2019s conduct negligent in the first instance. <em>Coburn </em>v. <em>Lenox Homes, Inc., </em>supra. It is unexceptional to impose upon a landowner liability resulting from injuries caused directly and without intervening criminal conduct by \u201cdangerous conditions\u201d on the land. Thus, where the plaintiff stumbles on accumulated debris on the defendant7 s land, and injures himself, the defendant may be liable. <em>Miranti </em>v. <em>Brookside Shopping Center, Inc., </em>supra. We are not prepared, however, to extend the scope of the foreseeable risk presented by \u201cobnoxious overgrowth\u201d or accumulated debris beyond injury produced by physical contact with such conditions. Thus, the harm suffered by the plaintiff in this case was not of the same general type that allegedly made the defendant negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Even if liability could extend beyond injury caused by physical contact with \u201cdangerous conditions\u201d on a defendant\u2019s property, the relationship between the \u201copportunity\u201d of shielding and the plaintiff\u2019s harm in this case was accidental. As the trial court found, there could have been any number of natural or nonnatural conditions on the defendant\u2019s property that would have shielded the assault. We do not understand the plaintiff to contend that every conceivable item that could have shielded the occurrence of a violent crime should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>be deemed a basis for negligence because of the potential for crime endemic in an urban neighborhood. Indeed, although there was evidence that the \u201covergrowth\u201d violated the New London housing code because it created the appearance of \u201cblight,\u201d the plaintiff does not bring to our attention any testimony, or any provision of the housing code, that demonstrates that the code would prohibit the maintenance of neatly trimmed vegetation, such as a hedge, that also could serve to screen the commission of a violent crime. Further, we would be offending common sense if we failed to recognize that the objects in the world behind which a criminal act may be concealed are manifold. The plaintiff, therefore, has not established a necessary relationship between the defendant\u2019s negligence\u2014that is, the maintenance of overgrown vegetation\u2014and the \u201ccausative force\u201d or shielding. Thus, she has failed to remove the issue of causation from the realm of speculation and conjecture. Cf. <em>Pisel </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>180 Conn. 314, 341-42, 430 A.2d 1 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Our conclusion is supported by many cases in which we have declined to hold that the defendant\u2019s conduct in contributing to the harm, principally caused \u201cin fact\u201d by another person or force, was a \u201cproximate cause\u201d of the harm. In <em>Nolan </em>v. <em>Morelli, </em>154 Conn. 432, 436, 226 A.2d 383 (1967), we recognized the common law rule that \u201cno tort cause of action lay against one who furnished, whether by sale or gift, intoxicating liquor to a person who thereby voluntarily became intoxicated and in consequence of his intoxication injured the person or property either of himself or of another.\u201d We held that \u201c[t]he reason generally given for the rule was that the proximate cause of the intoxication was not the furnishing of the liquor, but the consumption of it by the purchaser or the donee. The rule was based on the obvious fact that one could not become intoxicated by reason of liquor furnished him if he did not drink <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>it.\u201d Id., 436-37; see also <em>Boehm </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>supra, 389; <em>Kowal </em>v. <em>Hofher, </em>supra, 357-58; <em>Slicer v. Quigley, </em>180 Conn. 252, 255, 429 A.2d 855 (1980) (all reaffirming <em>Nolan). </em>Similarly, in <em>Vastola </em>v. <em>Connecticut Protective System, Inc., </em>133 Conn. 18, 21, 47 A.2d 844 (1946), we reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment for the plaintiff on the ground that the plaintiff did not prove that the nonactivation of a burglar alarm installed in the plaintiff\u2019s premises was a proximate cause of a burglary. In reasoning directly applicable to the present case, we observed that whether the ringing of the alarm would have prevented the loss was \u201cpure speculation.\u201d \u201c \u2018Whether that would have been the result had the apparatus been in working order can never be known. It would depend upon contingencies without number, any one of which would have been sufficient to disappoint it.\u2019 \u201d Id., 22; see also <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>140 Conn. 414, 418, 420, 101 A.2d 491 (1953) (under common law principles, a telephone company operator\u2019s negligence in placing emergency fire call to remote rather than nearby fire department not proximate cause of extent of fire damage).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Our subsequent adoption of \u00a7 442B of the Restatement in <em>Miranti </em>v. <em>Brookside Shopping Center, Inc., </em>supra, does not undermine the value of these prior precedents. In <em>Cardona </em>v. <em>Valentin, </em>160 Conn. 18, 20-21, 273 A.2d 697 (1970), decided after <em>Miranti, </em>the defendant was the owner of a pool hall. The pool hall manager, Morales, got into a fist fight with the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, Cardona, a customer who refused to pay. The owner interceded and broke up the fight. As the owner escorted Cardona out of the pool hall, however, Cardona\u2019s brother Angel and his friends entered the pool room and began to throw various objects. In the ensuing fight, Morales stabbed and killed Cardona. The decedent\u2019s father brought an action against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>pool hall owner, alleging, inter alia, negligence in his failure to hire adequate security. Id., 23. The trial court found, however, that even if the defendant had been negligent, his negligence was not the proximate cause of Cardona\u2019s death. On appeal, we applied \u00a7 442B of the Restatement, and held that \u201cthe court could reasonably conclude that the actions of Angel Cardona and his friends were the proximate cause of the death rather than any alleged negligence on the part of the defendant . . . .\u201d Id., 25. Thus, in <em>Cardona, </em>we assumed that the defendant had been negligent in creating a condition that constituted a \u201ccause in fact\u201d of Cardona\u2019s death, and yet we nevertheless upheld the trial court\u2019s determination that the intervening intentional misconduct of Angel Cardona, who instigated the second brawl, superseded the defendant\u2019s negligence. <em>Cardona </em>reflects, therefore, that our \u201cfair judgment and . . . sense of justice\u201d; <em>Boehm </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>supra; in applying \u00a7 442B requires a fairly strong degree of certainty that a criminal or intentional intervening act is within the \u201cscope of the risk\u201d of a negligent actor\u2019s conduct. See also 2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 442B, comment c, illus. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\"><em>Miranti </em>v. <em>Brookside Shopping Center, Inc., </em>supra, on which the plaintiff places much reliance, is factually dissimilar to the present case. In <em>Miranti, </em>the plaintiff, a fifteen year old boy, was chased and knocked down by a dog, and fell over an accumulation of trash and debris on property alleged to be under the control of the defendants. The trial court, concluding that the proximate cause of the fall and resulting injury was solely the action of the dog in knocking the plaintiff down rather than the accumulation of trash and debris, rendered judgment for the defendants on their motion for summary judgment. We reversed, holding that the pleadings raised contested issues as to whether an accumulation of trash and debris did, in fact, exist, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>if it did, as to whether it created a condition productive of a foreseeable harm of the general nature of that suffered by the plaintiff, and as to which the defendants could be held legally responsible for the condition in any one or more of the ways claimed by the plaintiff. Unlike <em>Miranti, </em>where the plaintiff was injured when he fell over the trash and debris on the defendants\u2019 property, in this case the plaintiff was injured by the criminal act of her abductor. The sumac trees, the bushes, debris or litter on the defendant\u2019s property did not injure the plaintiff. Nor, unlike <em>Miranti, </em>does the \u201cscope of the risk\u201d presented by the \u201cdangerous\u201d condition on the defendant\u2019s property extend to the harm of the general nature suffered by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">We note here that the courts of other jurisdictions have not exhibited any unanimity in dealing with the question of liability under these circumstances. Compare <em>Parker </em>v. <em>D/U Realty Co., </em>141 App. Div. 2d 301, 530 N.Y.S.2d 137 (1988) (where decedent taken from street to defendant\u2019s parking lot and murdered, no liability where no. connection between decedent and premises independent of crime itself), <em>Waters </em>v. <em>New York City Housing Authority, </em>116 App. Div. 2d 384, 501 N.Y.S.2d 385 (1986), aff\u2019d, 69 N.Y.2d 225, 505 N.E.2d 922, 513 N.Y.S.2d 356 (1987) (no liability where passerby forced from street to nearby building of defendant), and <em>Goldberg v. Housing Authority, </em>38 N.J. 578, 186 A.2d 291 (1962) (holding no duty of housing authority to police housing project and, therefore, no liability for plaintiff\u2019s injuries sustained in robbery), with <em>Copithorne </em>v. <em>Framingham Union Hospital, </em>401 Mass. 860, 520 N.E.2d 139 (1988) (whether hospital\u2019s negligence proximate cause question of fact where it had actual notice of visiting staff physician\u2019s past sexual misconduct and physician drugged and raped employee in employee\u2019s apartment), and <em>Daniel </em>v. <em>Days Inn of America, Inc., </em>292 S.C. App. 291, 356 S.E.2d 129 (1987) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>(holding that hotel\u2019s failure to provide security was proximate cause of rape of invitee of hotel guests). We have examined the cases from other jurisdictions upon which the plaintiff relies, however, and find them to be factually distinguishable. See, e.g., <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Chicago Housing Authority, </em>91 Ill. App. 3d 544, 414 N.E.2d 1133 (1980), aff\u2019d, 89 Ill. 2d 122, 431 N.E.2d 1038 (1982) (question of fact whether defendant liable where it negligently sealed vacant floor in area in which rapes were frequent, and tenant subsequently raped and murdered); <em>Loeser </em>v. <em>Nathan Hale Gardens, Inc., </em>73 App. Div. 2d 187, 425 N.Y.S.2d 104 (1980) (where tenant was raped in landlord\u2019s unlighted parking lot, proximate cause established since evidence documenting relationship between crime and absence of light \u201cemphatically confirmed by common experience\u201d); <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Mr. Property Management Co., </em>690 S.W.2d 546 (Tex. 1985) (rape of plaintiff in defendant\u2019s vacant apartment building). Thus, this is not a case in which it is apparent that a significant number of other jurisdictions would support the plaintiff\u2019s arguments. Cf. <em>Tetro </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra, 606-607 (where vehicle pursued by police collides with plaintiff, court follows \u201cemergent majority view\u201d of other jurisdictions that intervening negligent or reckless driving of automobile pursued by police will not relieve town of liability as a matter of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Finally, we disagree with the plaintiffs assertion that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the occurrence of violence in such a sheltered location was reasonably foreseeable, and that the rape would not have occurred where it did absent the overgrowth, undermined its conclusion that the condition of the defendant\u2019s property was not a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s harm. A review of the trial court\u2019s memorandum indicates that the court\u2019s prior remarks addressed the issues of duty and factual cause rather than proximate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>cause. We condude, therefore, that there was no \u201croom for a reasonable disagreement\u201d that the plaintiff did not establish that the condition on the defendant\u2019s land was a proximate cause of the sexual assault. <em>Trzcinski </em>v. <em>Richey, </em>supra. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in setting aside the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the plaintiff. <em>See Magarian </em>v. <em>Bessoni, </em>160 Conn. 442, 280 A.2d 357 (1971); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-7\"> Section 411 of the New London housing code in effect at the time of the incident provided in pertinent part: \u201cAll exterior property areas shall be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition free from any accumulation of rubbish or garbage.
