We agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling that such a provision contravenes the public policy of this state and is therefore unenforceable. Accordingly, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The procedural and factual history of these appeals is not in dispute. On July 24,1986, the defendant, Automobile Insurance Company of Hartford,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued to Manuel Mendes an automobile insurance policy covering two vehicles owned by him. The plaintiff, Luis Mendes, was an insured under this policy. The policy provides that uninsured and underinsured motorist claims shall be resolved by arbitration. Specifically, where the amount in demand is $40,000 or less, the arbitration proceeding is to be conducted by a single arbitrator agreed upon by the insured and the defendant. Where the amount in demand is more than $40,000, the insured and the defendant are each to select an arbitrator, who are then to agree upon a third arbitrator. The policy then provides: \u201cThe decision made by the arbitrator(s) will be binding. However, either party may make a written demand for a trial if the amount of damages awarded is greater than the minimum limit for bodily injury liability specified by the financial responsibility law of the state in which your covered auto is principally garaged. If this demand is not made within 60 days of the decision of the arbitrators), the amount of damages awarded by the arbitrators) will be binding.\u201d The minimum coverage limit for bodily injury liability in Connecticut is $20,000. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38-175c, 14-112. Thus, the quoted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>policy provision (escape clause) purports to grant either party the right to demand a trial de novo where an uninsured or underinsured arbitration award exceeds $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">On or about November 17, 1986, the plaintiff sustained personal injuries when, as a pedestrian, he was struck by an automobile driven by Margaret Monterosso. At the time of this accident there was $20,000 in bodily injury liability coverage on the Monterosso vehicle, which was collected from Monterosso\u2019s insurance carrier. Thereafter, pursuant to the arbitration provision contained in the defendant\u2019s insurance policy, the plaintiff submitted a demand for arbitration to the defendant seeking recovery of underinsured motorist benefits for injuries received in the accident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsequently, the plaintiff\u2019s claim was arbitrated before a three person arbitration panel. On September 21,1988, the arbitration panel unanimously awarded the plaintiff $50,000 in underinsured motorist benefits. Relying upon the escape clause, the defendant notified the plaintiff by letter dated October 19, 1988, that it had \u201cchosen not to be bound\u201d by the arbitrators\u2019 decision and that it was demanding a trial de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">On October 21,1988, the defendant filed in the Superior Court an application to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant argued that because the arbitration award exceeded $20,000, it was entitled to a trial de <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>novo under the express language of the escape clause. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-417,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff on October 26, 1988, filed with the Superior Court an application seeking to confirm the arbitration award and requesting that an order be issued directing the defendant to pay the full amount of the award, plus interest from the date of the award. By way of a single memorandum of decision dated December 23,1988, the trial court ruled upon both applications. Relying upon cases in other jurisdictions that have addressed the validity of similar escape clauses, the trial court concluded that the provision at issue unfairly favored the defendant insurer and therefore was unenforceable as against public policy. Accordingly, the trial court granted the plaintiffs application to confirm the arbitration award and denied the defendant\u2019s application to vacate the arbitration award. From these judgments the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In reaching its conclusion that the escape clause at issue is unenforceable, the trial court relied heavily on General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c, which requires every uninsured motorist insurance policy that contains a provision for binding arbitration to include \u201ca provision for final determination of insurance coverage in such arbitration proceeding.\u201d The insurance policy in this case provides that the decision of the arbitrator or arbitrators \u201cwill be binding.\u201d The statute is nonetheless not precisely on point, because it applies only to determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>nations of \u201cinsurance coverage,\u201d while the underlying issue in these appeals apparently concerns the amount of damages. Undeniably, however, \u00a7 38-175e manifests a strong public policy in favor of final arbitral resolution of disputes concerning uninsured motorist insurance policies. That policy is undermined by an escape clause allowing the defendant at will to set aside arbitral awards in excess of $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The trial court found further support for its conclusion in three out-of-state cases that have held similar escape clauses invalid. See <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Midwest Family Mutual Ins. Co., </em>413 N.W.2d 178 (Minn. App. 1987), aff'd en banc, 426 N.W.2d 870 (Minn. 1988); <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>15 Ohio St. 3d 107, 472 N.E.2d 1061 (1984); <em>Pepin </em>v. <em>American Universal Ins. Co., </em>540 A.2d 21 (R.1.1988). There appears to be little difference between the escape clauses held invalid in these cases and the escape clause at issue on this appeal. All of them purport to grant a trial de novo by request of either the insured or insurer if an uninsured or underinsured motorist arbitration award exceeds the state statutory minimum bodily injury insurance requirement, but make binding any award less than that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The court in <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Midwest Family Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 180, held such a provision invalid for the following reasons: \u201c[The] provision . . . skews the trial de novo remedy in favor of the insurer, which is more likely to be dissatisfied with an award above $25,000 [the statutory minimum bodily injury requirement]. Conversely, the insured is more likely to be dissatisfied with an award below $25,000, which could not be tried de novo.\u201d The <em>Schmidt </em>court went on to state that \u201c[t]he trial de novo provision not only favors the insurer, in a contractual relationship which in most situations is one of unequal bargaining power and little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>opportunity for negotiation, but also contravenes public policies favoring arbitration and judicial economy.\u201d Id., 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\"><em>In Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>supra, 110, Justice Sweeney, in a concurring opinion, had the following to say with regard to the validity of a similar escape clause: \u201cThe effect of Endorsement 1604 is to create binding arbitration for awards below the $12,500/$25,000 statutory coverage minimums and to create non-binding arbitration for awards in excess of those minimums. Nationwide asserts that the foregoing arbitration agreement is entirely fair because <em>both </em>the insured and Nationwide have the right to avoid an arbitration award in excess of $12,500/$25,000. This \u2018facial equality\u2019 is not a true equality, however, because both parties are bound only by low awards, which are likely to be in Nationwide\u2019s favor. High awards can be avoided by either the insured or Nationwide, but it is unlikely that an insured would ever seek to avoid a high award, even if he was unsatisfied with it, because by avoiding the award and seeking a trial the insured would incur additional legal expense while also placing at risk the entire award that he already has received. Thus, the real impact and effect of Endorsement 1604 is to give Nationwide the power to avoid high arbitration awards, regardless of whether those awards are fair and just.\u201d Id., 111. In addition to the provision\u2019s inherent unfairness, Justice Sweeney noted that the escape clause contravened Ohio\u2019s strong public policy in favor of final and binding arbitration. Id. In striking down a similar escape clause as against public policy, the court in <em>Pepin </em>v. <em>American Universal Ins. Co., </em>supra, 22, stressed that such a provision circumvented \u201c[t]he whole purpose of arbitration, namely, providing an expedient and inexpensive mechanism for finally resolving disputes . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>We find the reasoning of these out-of-state cases highly persuasive. Certainly, these authorities would appear to render untenable the defendant\u2019s position that the escape clause contained in its policy is valid and enforceable. The defendant strongly asserts, however, that the above-noted cases are not germane because the escape clauses in those cases were examined in the context of arbitration schemes fundamentally different from the one found in the defendant\u2019s policy. Specifically, the defendant points out that the arbitration schemes discussed in those other jurisdictions provide that <em>either party </em>has the right to submit the dispute to arbitration. Consequently, the insurance carrier could compel any and all claimants to submit to arbitration and subject them to an escape clause that clearly favored the carrier. In contrast, the defendant notes that under the arbitration provisions contained in its policy it cannot compel a claimant, such as the plaintiff, to submit to arbitration; rather, <em>only the claimant </em>has the right to submit the dispute to arbitration. If a claimant chooses not to have his claim arbitrated, he may seek relief directly in the courts. This distinction is of critical importance, the defendant argues, because \u201calthough it may be unfair to allow an insurer to force an insured to go through the time and expense of arbitration while retaining the right to render the results a nullity [pursuant to an escape clause], the same rationale does not apply when the option of going to arbitration rests entirely with the insured.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">We agree with the defendant that its inability to compel the plaintiff to submit to arbitration is a factor that was not present in the arbitration schemes discussed in the cases cited above. We disagree, however, that this distinguishing feature ameliorates the unfairness of the escape clause to such a- degree that it may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>permitted to stand. We acknowledge that many claimants may take advantage of the right provided them in the defendant\u2019s policy to avoid arbitration altogether. Our concern, however, is focused not on those claimants sagacious enough to exercise that right, but on the individuals who unwittingly submit to arbitration under the good faith belief that any award will be final and binding. We make this statement fully aware of the fact that most claimants choosing arbitration are doing so on the advice of counsel who are presumed to know the risks involved in an arbitration proceeding featuring an escape clause like the one at issue. Nevertheless, we are mindful of the fact that arbitration is a process open to laymen not represented by counsel, and it is from the vantage point of such laymen that we must judge the fairness of the defendant\u2019s arbitration scheme in general and the escape clause in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The arbitration section of the defendant\u2019s policy states that \u201cthe covered person may make a written demand for arbitration within 2 years of the date of accident.\u201d Thereafter, the pertinent language of the escape clause provides that \u201c[tjhe decision made by the arbitrator(s) will be binding.\u201d In typical boilerplate fashion characteristic of insurance policies, the escape clause then states that either party may demand a trial \u201cif the amount of the damages awarded is greater than the minimum limit for bodily injury liability specified by the financial responsibility law of the state in which your covered auto is principally garaged.\u201d In our view it is wishful thinking on the part of the defendant to believe that a layman of average intelligence is adequately put on notice by such language that arbitration awards in excess of $20,000 are nonbinding. The net effect of this lack of notice is that the unwary claimant is lured into an arbitration process favored by our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>legislature as a swift, fair and inexpensive means for final settlement of his claim, only to find out after the fact that, pursuant to an escape clause, his award in excess of $20,000 is nonbinding and that the defendant may demand a trial de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">We see little difference between the scenario just described and the cases discussed above in which the insurance carrier compels a claimant to submit to arbitration. In each case, the claimant is subjected unfairly to an arbitration process rendered inequitable by the presence of an escape clause. In sum, we find without merit the defendant\u2019s contention that any unfairness created by the presence of an escape clause in its arbitration scheme is remedied by the right provided a claimant under its policy to avoid arbitration altogether. Because the language of the defendant\u2019s policy does not adequately apprise all potential claimants of the true nature of the escape clause and its effect on arbitration awards in excess of $20,000, the protection offered a claimant by the right to avoid arbitration is largely illusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">We also note that in addition to the creation of the manifest inequities described previously, an escape clause like the one at issue may be used as leverage by an insurance carrier to coerce a claimant who has received an arbitration award in excess of $20,000 to accept a settlement or compromise less than the amount awarded upon the threat of a demand for a trial de novo. This state has evinced a strong public policy against such unfair claim settlement practices with the enactment of General Statutes \u00a7 38-61 (6) (k).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the escape clause contained in the defendant\u2019s insurance policy is unenforceable as against public policy. Accordingly, the trial court acted correctly in granting the plaintiff\u2019s application to confirm the arbitration award and in denying the defendant\u2019s application to vacate the arbitration award.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-6\"> We recognize that Automobile Insurance Company of Hartford is the plaintiff on one appeal and the defendant on the other.
