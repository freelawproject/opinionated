The defendants moved to dismiss, claiming that sovereign immunity barred the plaintiffs action. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion concluding that (1) the doctrine of sovereign immunity barred the complainant\u2019s claim against the state, and (2) the state is not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>The plaintiff appealed to the Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>late Court. Thereafter, we transferred the appeal to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">On June 12, 1985, Stephen F. Krozser died while incarcerated at the New Haven Community Correctional Center. On June 10, 1986, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-147 and 4-165b,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the plaintiff filed a notice of claim with the claims commissioner seeking permission to sue the state of Connecticut. In his notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>claim and his subsequent complaint to the Superior Court, the plaintiff alleged that while the plaintiffs decedent was incarcerated at the correctional center the defendants were deliberately indifferent to, and failed to provide for, his serious medical needs. The plaintiff further alleged that the defendants\u2019 conduct was a violation of his decedent\u2019s rights under the eighth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and directly resulted in his decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">For reasons that are not clear from the record, the claims commissioner never acted upon the plaintiff\u2019s request to sue the state.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, the plaintiff filed the instant action in the Superior Court, apparently because the two year statute of limitations for wrongful death, embodied in General Statutes \u00a7 52-555, was about to expire.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff asserts that the trial court had the authority to waive the state\u2019s sovereign immunity in a \u00a7 1983 suit for money damages and therefore it erred when it dismissed his action. The plaintiff\u2019s argument is three-pronged. He first contends that a complainant need not exhaust his \u201cadministrative remedies\u201d prior to bringing a \u00a7 1983 action in the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>court. He next claims that the state trial court may \u201cborrow\u201d applicable state law, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, to supplement federal law. In this regard, the plaintiff argues that the Superior Court may \u201cborrow\u201d and apply General Statutes \u00a7 4-160 (a), which sets forth the standard to be used by the claims commissioner, to determine whether to authorize suit against the state. Finally, the plaintiff contends that chapter 53 of the General Statutes<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cdiscriminates\u201d against the assertion of his decedent\u2019s federal rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u201c \u2018We have long recognized the common-law principle that the state cannot be sued without its consent. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 623, 376 A.2d 359 (1977); <em>Textron, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>167 Conn. 334, 339, 355 A.2d 307 (1974). We have also recognized that because the state can act only through its officers and agents, a suit against a state officer concerning a matter in which the officer represents the- state is, in effect, against the state. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>supra; <em>Textron, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>supra; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>162 Conn. 295, 297, 294 A.2d 290 (1972); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>151 Conn. 259, 262, 196 A.2d 596 (1963); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Argraves, </em>146 Conn. 316, 320, 150 A.2d 295 (1959). Therefore, we have dealt with such suits as if they were solely against the state and have referred to the state as the defendant. <em>Anselmo </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>135 Conn. 78, 79-80, 60 A.2d 767, cert. denied, 335 U.S. 859, 69 S. Ct. 132, 93 L. Ed. 405 (1948); <em>Rusch </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>130 Conn. 26, 34, 31 A.2d 457 (1943).\u2019 (Footnote omitted.) <em>Sentner </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>[184 Conn. 339, 342-43, 439 A.2d 1033 (1981)].\u201d <em>Fetterman </em>v. <em>University of Connecticut, </em>192 Conn. 539, 550-51, 473 A.2d 1176 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The absolute bar of actions against the state on the ground of sovereign immunity has been modified by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>statute and by judicial decisions. \u201cSovereign immunity does not bar suits against state officials acting in excess of their statutory authority or pursuant to an unconstitutional statute. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>[supra, 624].\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>204 Conn. 17, 31, 526 A.2d 1318 (1987). In addition, the state cannot use sovereign immunity as a defense in an action for declaratory or injunctive relief. Id. However, \u201c[i]n the absence of legislative authority . . . we have declined to permit any monetary award against the state or its officials. <em>Fetterman </em>v. <em>University of Connecticut, </em>[supra, 550]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>176 Conn. 362, 365, 407 A.2d 987 (1978).\u201d Id., 32. Further, \u201c \u2018[statutes in derogation of sovereignty should be strictly construed in favor of the state, so that its sovereignty may be upheld and not narrowed or destroyed.\u2019 <em>Berger, Lehman Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>178 Conn. 352, 356, 422 A.2d 268 (1979), quoting <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Constantino, </em>168 Conn. 563, 570, 362 A.2d 871 (1975).\u201d <em>Duguay </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>191 Conn. 222, 232, 464 A.2d 45 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">When sovereign immunity has not been waived, the claims commissioner is authorized by statute to hear monetary claims against the state and determine whether the claimant has a cognizable claim. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-141 through 4-165b. The claims commissioner, if he deems it \u201cjust and equitable,\u201d may sanction suit against the state on any claim \u201cwhich, in his opinion, presents an issue of law or fact under which the state, were it a private person, could be liable.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-160 (a). \u201cThis legislation expressly bars suits upon claims cognizable by the claims commissioner except as he may authorize, an indication of the legislative determination to preserve sovereign immunity as a defense to monetary claims against the state not sanctioned by the commissioner or other statutory provisions. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-148 (b), 4-160.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>supra, 35-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The plaintiff is unable to point to any statute that waives the state\u2019s sovereign immunity in the present case. In addition, the plaintiff concedes that he has never received permission from the claims commissioner to sue the state. He argues, however, that under <em>Patsy </em>v. <em>Florida Board of Regents, </em>457 U.S. 496, 102 S. Ct. 2557, 73 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1982), he is not required to obtain the consent of the claims commissioner prior to bringing his \u00a7 1983 claim in the Superior Court. In <em>Patsy, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cexhaustion of state administrative remedies should not be required as a prerequisite to bringing an action pursuant to \u00a7 1983.\u201d Id., 516. Consequently, the plaintiff contends he need not obtain permission prior to proceeding against the state in a \u00a7 1983 action. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u201e Section 1983 does not abrogate the common law doctrine of sovereign immunity. \u201cIn <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Independence, </em>445 U.S. 622, 100 S. Ct. 1398, 63 L. Ed. 2d 673, reh. denied, 446 U.S. 993, 100 S. Ct. 2979, 64 L. Ed. 2d 850 (1980), the United States Supreme Court stated that \u2018[w]here the immunity claimed by the defendant was well established at common law at the time Section 1983 was enacted, and where its rationale was compatible with the purposes of the Civil Rights Act, we have construed the statute to incorporate that immunity.\u2019 Id., 638. The doctrine of sovereign immunity was well established at common law at the time \u00a7 1983 was enacted. It is supported by a strong policy reason; that is, to prevent the imposition of enormous fiscal burdens on states. As concluded by the court in <em>Quern </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 99 S. Ct. 1139, 59 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1979), Congress did not intend \u2018by the general language of Section 1983 to override the traditional sovereign immunity of the States.\u2019 Id., 341.\u201d <em>Fetterman </em>v. <em>University of Connecticut, </em>supra, 551-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>The plaintiff, however, contends that the trial court and the claims commissioner have concurrent jurisdiction to authorize suits against the state and therefore he should not be required to first exhaust what he denotes as his \u201cadministrative remedy\u201d under chapter 53 of the General Statutes prior to commencing suit. We disagree. Before a claimant may pursue any monetary claim against the state, if the doctrine of sovereign immunity is applicable, the state must consent to be sued. <em>Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital </em>v. <em>Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 100, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1984); <em>Fetterman </em>v. <em>University of Connecticut, </em>supra, 550. The claims commissioner, as previously noted, may waive that immunity, pursuant <em>to </em>General Statutes \u00a7 4-160 (a), and consent to suit. Until that happens, however, the Superior Court has no jurisdiction to hear any such monetary claim. \u201c \u2018A statute giving a right to costs in general terms will not be construed to include an award against the State, because the State is invested with the immunities from legal process, mesne and final, which at common law belonged to the King and there would be no power in the court to enforce its decree.\u2019 <em>[State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>supra, 365]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>82 Conn. 392, 393-94, 73 A. 751 (1909). \u2018[I]t is a general principle that what courts cannot enforce they cannot decree.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 393; see <em>Pellegrino </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>193 Conn. 670, 683, 480 A.2d 476, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 875, 105 S. Ct. 236, 83 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1984).\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>supra, 32-33. \u201cThe question whether the principles of governmental immunity from suit and liability are waived is a matter for legislative, not judicial, determination. <em>Rogan </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>178 Conn. 579, 582, 424 A.2d 274 (1979); <em>Bergner </em>v. <em>State, </em>144 Conn. 282, 286-87, 130 A.2d 293 (1957).\u201d <em>Duguay </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>supra, 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>In keeping with that premise, the entire legislative scheme of chapter 53, which authorizes claims against the state, makes clear that it is the claims commissioner, pursuant to legislation, that can waive sovereign immunity and not the courts. The legislation pertinent to this appeal expressly provides that, \u201c[wjhen the claims commissioner deems it just and equitable, he may authorize suit against the state\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 4-160 (a); and that when \u201cany inmate of any institution of the department of correction\u201d brings a claim against the state for an injury which results in a fatality, that claim must be heard and decided in accordance with the provisions of chapter 53. General Statutes \u00a7 4-165b. The Superior Court, therefore, has no authority to hear a claim for monetary damages against the state when the doctrine of sovereign immunity is applicable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That jurisdiction, in the first instance, resides by statute solely in the claims commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The plaintiff maintains, however, that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 confers jurisdiction on the Superior Court to waive the state\u2019s sovereign immunity and allow it to be sued. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that \u00a7 1988 authorizes the trial court to \u201cborrow\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-160 (a) to determine whether his claim presents an issue under which the state, were it a private person, could be liable. The plaintiff claims that by thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>allowing the trial court to authorize suit against the state we would be fostering the \u201cgoal of compensation\u201d underlying \u00a7 1983. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Section 1988 \u201crecognizes that in certain areas \u2018federal law is unsuited or insufficient \u201cto furnish suitable remedies\u201d federal law simply does not \u2018cover every issue that may arise in the context of a federal civil rights action.\u2019 <em>Moor </em>v. <em>County of Alameda, </em>411 U.S. 693, 703 [93 S. Ct. 1785, 36 L. Ed. 2d 596] (1973) [reh. denied, 412 U.S. 963, 93 S. Ct. 2999, 37 L. Ed. 2d 1012 (1973), overruled on other grounds, <em>Monell </em>v. <em>New York City Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1978)], quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>1988.\u201dRobertson v. Wegmann, </em>436 U.S. 584, 588, 98 S. Ct. 1991, 56 L. Ed. 2d 554 (1978). \u201cThe century-old Civil Rights Acts do not contain every rule of decision required to adjudicate claims asserted under them.\u201d <em>Burnett s. Grattan, </em>468 U.S. 42, 47, 104 S. Ct. 2924, 82 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1984). Federal courts under \u00a7 1988 may therefore look to state law to fill the void. Id., 48; <em>Robertson s. Wegmann, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\u201cMost decisions concerning the borrowing of state law . . . have arisen from [a] need to borrow provisions, such as statutes of limitations, tolling policies, and survival rules, that serve the exclusive purpose of defining that point where the right to maintain a cause of action ends.\u201d <em>Brown v. United States, </em>742 F.2d 1498, 1505 (D.C. Cir. 1984), cert. denied sub nom. <em>District of Columbia v. Brown, </em>471 U.S. 1073, 105 S. Ct. 2153, 85 L. Ed. 2d 509 (1985). Section 1988 \u201cinstructs federal courts as to what law to apply in causes of actions arising under federal civil rights acts. But . . . the section, without more, was [not] meant to authorize the wholesale importation into federal law of state causes of action\u2014not even one purportedly designed for the protection of federal civil rights.\u201d <em>Moor v. County of Alameda, </em>supra, 703-704. Section 1988 applies only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>when federal law is inapplicable or in some way deficient. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 1504. The fact that the plaintiff cannot, without consent, sue the state in an action under \u00a7 1983 for money damages is not, however, simply a matter of a deficiency in federal law. Sovereign immunity is a matter of substantive state law that has been consistently recognized as not having been abrogated by \u00a7 1983. See discussion, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Next, the plaintiff claims that chapter 53 discriminates against the assertion of his federal rights. In support of his argument, the plaintiff relies primarily on the recent United States Supreme Court case of <em>Felder </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>U.S. , 108 S. Ct. 2302, 101 L. Ed. 2d 123 (1988). <em>Felder </em>is inapposite. The state notice-of-claim statute struck down in <em>Felder </em>produced \u201cdifferent outcomes in \u00a7 1983 litigation based solely on whether the claim [was] asserted in state or federal court . . . . \u201d Id., 138. <em>Felder </em>involved a claim under \u00a7 1983 against the city of Milwaukee and its police officers. The notice-of-claim statute in question in that case imposed restrictions on a claimant which raised a \u00a7 1983 cause of action against a municipality and its officers in the state court, but did not apply to such claims if brought by the claimant in the federal court. Id., 142-45. Consequently, the statute made it more difficult for the claimant to sue under \u00a7 1983 in the state court. The present case poses no such problem. As the plaintiff conceded at oral argument, the eleventh amendment would be a complete bar to his cause of action in the federal court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Pennhurst State School </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>&amp; Hospital </em>v. <em>Halderman, </em>supra, 98; <em>Fitts </em>v. <em>McGhee, </em>172 U.S. 516, 524, 19 S. Ct. 269, 43 L. Ed. 535 (1899); <em>Hans </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>134 U.S. 1, 10 S. Ct. 504, 33 L. Ed. 842 (1890). Likewise, the doctrine of sovereign immunity would bar the plaintiffs cause of action in the state court. The plaintiff, therefore, is treated equally in both jurisdictions, avoiding the problem addressed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Felder </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-8\"> Initially, the city of New Haven was named as a defendant.

Any person wishing to present a claim against the state shall file with the clerk of the office of the claims commissioner a notice of claim, in duplicate, containing the following information: (1) The name and address of the claimant; the name and address of his principal, if the claimant is acting in a representative capacity, and the name and address of his attorney, if the claimant is so represented; (2) a concise statement of the basis of the claim, including the date, time, place and circumstances of the act or event complained of; (3) a statement of the amount requested, and (4) a request for permission to sue the state, if such permission is sought. A notice of claim, if sent by mail, shall be deemed to have been filed with the office of the claims commissioner on the date such notice of claim is postmarked. Claims in excess of one thousand dollars shall be accompanied by a check or money order in the sum of twenty-five dollars payable to the treasurer, state of Connecticut. Claims for one thousand dollars or less shall be accompanied by a check or money order in the sum of ten dollars payable to the treasurer, state of Connecticut. Fees may be waived by the commissioner for good cause but such action by the commissioner shall not relieve the claimant from the obligation of filing his notice of claim in timely fashion within the statute of limitations under section 4-148. The clerk of the office of the claims commissioner shall promptly deliver a copy of the notice of claim to the attorney general. Such notice shall be for informational purposes only and shall not be subject to any formal or technical requirements, except as may be necessary for clarity of presentation and facility of understanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 4-165b. claims against the state by inmates of state coeeectional and eefoematoey institutions, (a) On and after May 3,1976, any inmate of any institution of the department of correction or the department of children and youth services who suffers an injury which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>results in a fatality or in a permanent handicap may file a claim against the state. Such claim shall be heard and decided in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"abt-dedup-1\">\u201c(b) All matters pending before the committee established pursuant to section 18-95 of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1975, on May 3,1976, shall be construed as pending with the same status with the claims commissioner on said date.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b441-13\"> The plaintiff blames the death of the claims commissioner and the resultant delays for the lack of activity on his claim. The state claims that the plaintiffs allegation is \u201cmisleading in that it fails to disclose that the plaintiff has yet to comply with discovery requests filed by the defendants in March, 1987.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b441-14\"> At oral argument, the question was posed from the bench whether the plaintiff would be barred by the statute of limitations from asserting his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim against the state. Neither party briefed the issue. Accordingly, we will not decide it at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b442-7\"> Chapter 53 includes General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-141 through 4-165b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b446-6\"> Moreover, this reading of the statute is consistent with our interpretation of chapter 53 in <em>Circle Lanes of Fairfield, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>195 Conn. 534, 489 A.2d 363 (1985). In <em>Circle Lanes of Fairfield, Inc., </em>we concluded that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction to hear appeals from the claims commissioner because General Statutes \u00a7 4-164a expressly exempted the claims commissioner from the operation of General Statutes \u00a7 4-183, the provision of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act that permits an appeal to the Superior Court. Further, when the commissioner recommends payment of a claim against the state in excess of $7500, it is the legislature, not the court, that reviews the commissioner\u2019s decision. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-159.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b448-6\"> The eleventh amendment to the United States constitution provides that \u201c[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">We note that in <em>Patsy </em>v. <em>Florida Board of Regents, </em>457 U.S. 496, 102 S. Ct. 2557, 73 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1982), the United States Supreme Court did not address whether the eleventh amendment would nevertheless bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>the suit on the basis of the sovereign immunity of the state. \u201cNothing in this opinion precludes the Board of Regents from raising its Eleventh Amendment claim on remand.\u201d Id., 515-16 n.19.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
