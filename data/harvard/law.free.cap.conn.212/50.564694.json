A jury convicted the defendant of burglary in the third degree, conspiracy to commit burglary in the third degree, attempted assault in the first degree and larceny in the sixth degree. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-103 (a), 53a-48 (a), 53a-49 (a), 53a-59 (a) (1), 53a-125b. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court from the trial court\u2019s judgment, raising four claims of error. The Appellate Court found no error in the trial court\u2019s judgment; <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>14 Conn. App. 309, 541 A.2d 880 (1988); and we granted certification limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court err in upholding the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s request for an examination of the psychiatric records of a key state witness, on the basis that there had been no preliminary showing that denial was likely to impair his right to confrontation?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>209 Conn. 802, 548 A.2d 439 (1988). We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On October 29,1985, the complainant, a seventy-nine year old Guilford woman, discovered that the rear door to her house had been smashed. One of the complainant\u2019s neighbors told police that she had seen a heavy set white male in dark clothing, later identified as Albert Knous, run down the driveway and enter a dark colored car with a white top. Approximately forty-five minutes later, a police officer spotted the defendant and Knous in a car matching the neighbor\u2019s description. <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>supra, 14 Conn. App. 310-11. After further investigation linking both the defendant and Knous to the incident, the police charged the defendant with burglary, conspiracy to commit burglary in the third degree, attempted assault in the first degree, carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle and larceny in the sixth degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">At the defendant\u2019s trial, Knous testified for the state that he was picking apples on the day of the incident when the defendant approached him to tell him he had broken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>into the complainant\u2019s home, that a companion had cut the brake lines to the car stored in the garage<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the defendant had stolen a metal tool box. Knous also stated that the defendant reported having seen a television set in the house, which he wanted Knous to help him steal so that they could sell it and divide the proceeds. Knous testified that the pair then went to the house and he entered through the rear door, which he claimed had been smashed previously. He then searched the house for valuables, looked in the medicine cabinet for drugs and left without taking anything when he heard a car in the driveway. Id., 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Prior to cross-examination and outside the jury\u2019s presence, defense counsel questioned Knous about his treatment for alcoholism at Connecticut Valley Hospital. Knous stated that, as a condition of his probation stemming from previous charges, he had been admitted to a twenty-eight day alcohol program. He admitted he had been drinking heavily for two years prior to entering the alcohol program and had occasionally used other drugs. He also admitted he had been drinking on the day of the incident. Defense counsel inquired whether he had been drinking excessively that day, to which Knous answered, \u201cI had been drinking. Excessive, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Id., 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Defense counsel then asked Knous a series of questions regarding his diagnosis, the psychiatric reasons for his hospitalization and the reasons why the program directors had recommended that he enter a halfway house.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court sustained all of the state\u2019s objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>tions to these questions on the ground of the witness\u2019 psychiatric privilege. The defendant then requested access to Knous\u2019 psychiatric records or, alternatively, that the court inspect the records in camera to determine if they contained any impeaching material. The court denied the defendant access to the records and declined to examine them itself, concluding that counsel had failed to make a preliminary showing that the failure to inspect the records would deny the defendant his right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">After the trial court rendered judgment on his convictions, the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court arguing that the trial court had violated his sixth amendment right to confrontation by precluding him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>from cross-examining the state\u2019s key witness on facts highly probative of the witness\u2019 credibility, capacity to perceive and ability to recall facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Appellate Court found no error in the trial court\u2019s rulings, holding that the court had provided the defendant wide latitude in cross-examining Knous and that the defendant had failed to make the necessary preliminary showing that the failure to produce the records would likely impair his constitutional right to confrontation. Id., 317. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The people of this state enjoy a broad privilege in the confidentiality of their psychiatric communications and records, including those pertaining to their diagnosis, prognosis or treatment for alcohol abuse or alcoholism. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-155bb (b), 52-146d, 52-146e.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A criminal defendant has a constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>right to cross-examine state witnesses, however, which may include impeaching or discrediting them by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>attempting to reveal to the jury the witnesses\u2019 biases, prejudices or ulterior motives, or facts bearing on the witnesses\u2019 reliability, credibility, or sense of perception. <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 19, 106 S. Ct. 292, 88 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1985) (per curiam); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Storlazzi, </em>191 Conn. 453, 457, 464 A.2d 829 (1983). Thus, in some instances, a patient\u2019s psychiatric privilege must give way to a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to reveal to the jury facts about a witness\u2019 mental condition that may reasonably affect that witness\u2019 credibility.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Hufford, </em>205 Conn. 386, 401-402, 533 A.2d 866 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>201 Conn. 211, 227, 514 A.2d 724 (1986); see also <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra, 320 (defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine for bias is paramount to state\u2019s policy of protecting juvenile offender\u2019s identity). The defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination does not, however, allow him to discredit and impeach \u201cin whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Fensterer, </em>supra, 20; <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 73 n.12, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980). We have therefore directed trial courts to engage in a specific procedure designed to accommodate this inherent tension.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>If, for the purposes of cross-examination, a defendant believes that certain privileged records would disclose information especially probative of a witness\u2019 ability to comprehend, know or correctly relate the truth, he may, out of the jury\u2019s presence, attempt to make a preliminary showing that \u201cthere is a reasonable ground to believe\u201d that the failure to produce the records would likely impair his right to impeach the witness. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>supra, 225; <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 179, 471 A.2d 949 (1984). If in the trial court\u2019s judgment the defendant successfully makes this showing, the state must then obtain the witness\u2019 permission for the court to inspect the records in camera. A witness\u2019 refusal to consent to such an in camera inspection entitles the defendant to have the witness\u2019 testimony stricken. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burak, </em>201 Conn. 517, 524, 518 A.2d 639 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>197 Conn. 326, 331, 497 A.2d 758 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1119, 106 S. Ct. 1635, 90 L. Ed. 2d 181 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 179-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Upon inspecting the records in camera, the trial court must determine whether the records are especially probative of the witness\u2019 capacity to relate the truth or to observe, recollect and narrate relevant occurrences. <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 176; <em>State </em>v. <em>Storlazzi, </em>supra, 459 n.4. If the court determines that the records are probative, the state must obtain the witness\u2019 further waiver of his privilege concerning the relevant portions of the records for release to the defendant, or have the witness\u2019 testimony stricken. If the court discovers no probative and impeaching material, the entire record of the proceeding must be sealed and preserved for possible appellate review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hufford, </em>supra, 404; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>supra, 228. Once the trial court has made its inspection, the court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s access to the witness\u2019 records lies in the court\u2019s sound discretion, which we will not dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>turb unless abused. <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>210 Conn. 78, 109, 554 A.2d 686 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 380, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In this case, in order to induce the trial court to inspect the records in camera, the defendant had to make a threshold showing that there was a reasonable probability that the records would reveal that \u201cat any pertinent time\u201d Knous\u2019 alcohol problem affected his testimonial capacity \u201cto a sufficient degree to warrant further inquiry.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>supra, 225-26; <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 180.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Upon reviewing the record, the Appellate Court agreed with the trial court that the defendant had failed to make such a showing. <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>supra, 14 Conn. App. 317. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Defense counsel established no more than that Knous had been an alcoholic for two years prior to the incident, had undergone court ordered alcohol treatment, including group and individual therapy, had occasionally used other drugs and had consumed alcohol on the day of the incident. The court received no information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>regarding how Knous\u2019 alcohol or drug use, or any other psychological disorder, might have affected his testimonial capacity sufficiently to require an inspection of his psychiatric records in camera. Thus, neither the trial court nor the Appellate Court erred in concluding that the defendant had not made the requisite showing. A history of alcohol or drug treatment does not automatically make a witness fair game for disclosure of psychiatric records to a criminal defendant. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burak, </em>supra, 524-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The ultimate propriety of the conclusions reached by the trial court and the Appellate Court depends, however, upon a predicate inquiry: was the defendant afforded a fair opportunity to make the preliminary showing necessary for an in camera inspection? Although the availability of such an opportunity also involves a determination that is, in the first instance, within the trial court\u2019s discretion, we have urged trial courts to permit the defendant a certain latitude in his attempt to make such a showing. On this point, <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>supra, offers a useful analogy. In that case the state charged the defendant with sexually assaulting the complainant, a thirteen year old boy. After the complainant himself had testified for the state, his therapist testified regarding the boy\u2019s account of the assault. Id., 221. In cross-examining the therapist, the defendant sought to discover any mental aberrations of the complainant that might have reflected upon his credibility. Id., 226-27. To this end the defendant asked the therapist whether he had recently treated the complainant and his mother for \u201cparent-child conflicts,\u201d as a hospital record indicated. The defendant intended the question to elicit an answer that would help make a preliminary showing to the trial court that the therapist had further information of the complainant\u2019s mental condition affecting his credibility. The trial court upheld the therapist\u2019s claim that responding to a ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>tion about the treatment\u2019s purpose would violate the psychiatrist-patient privilege. Id., 221. We found error, explaining that \u201c[without any opportunity to ascertain whether such information exists, it would ordinarily be impossible for a defendant to lay the groundwork demanded by [our cases] as preliminary to a fair judicial determination of the availability of evidence of the mental condition of a witness significantly related to his testimonial capacity or credibility.\u201d Id., 226-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Although the instant case involves privileged records rather than privileged communications, the same principle applies. By sustaining the state\u2019s objections, on grounds of psychiatric privilege, to questions posed by defense counsel while she voir dired Knous, the court may well have effectively prohibited counsel from making the showing prerequisite to the court inspecting the records in camera. Specifically, when the court disallowed counsel from inquiring whether Knous had received a diagnosis as a result of his stay at the Connecticut Valley Hospital, whether there were psychiatric reasons for his hospitalization and why counselors thought he should enter a halfway house upon release from the alcohol program, the court may have precluded her from making an already difficult showing. \u201cThe privilege cannot be permitted to bar the court from access to such information as is necessary to decide whether the occasion is one where the witness must waive the privilege or have his testimony expurgated from the case.\u201d Id., 227; see also State v. <em>Whitaker, </em>202 Conn. 259, 272, 520 A.2d 1018 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">On the present record, we cannot conclude that the court\u2019s error, which implicates the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to impeach and discredit state witnesses, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. As the defendant\u2019s alleged accomplice, Knous was the state\u2019s most vital witness. If his testimony had been discredited or stricken altogether, we cannot be certain that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>jury would have returned the same guilty verdicts. Cf. <em>State </em>v. Gonzales, 186 Conn. 426, 435, 441 A.2d 852 (1982).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">We conclude that this case must be remanded and the defendant given an opportunity to make a preliminary showing that the failure to produce Knous\u2019 psychiatric records would likely impair his right to impeach the witness. To the extent that certain of the defendant\u2019s questions relevant to making this showing infringe to some degree on Knous\u2019 psychiatric privilege, the state must secure Knous\u2019 limited waiver of the privilege. If,, in the trial court\u2019s judgment, the defendant fails to make this showing, the defendant\u2019s convictions will stand. Should the court find, however, that the defendant has made the requisite showing, the state must obtain Knous\u2019 further waiver for the court to conduct an in camera inspection of the records. If in reviewing the records the court, in its discretion, finds no material especially probative of the witness\u2019 capacity to relate the truth, the convictions will stand and the court must seal the records for possible further appellate review. Should the court find such probative material, however, the state must obtain Knous\u2019 further waiver for release of the relevant portions of his records to the defendant and the court must grant the defendant a new trial. A new trial will also be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>required if at any juncture Knous refuses to waive his privilege. See <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>supra, 58; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>supra, 229; <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 179-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-6\"> The defendant and the complainant had been involved in an auto accident the previous day and the defendant had damaged his car extensively.

Ct. 3440, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1193 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>14 Conn. App. 309, 317, 541 A.2d 880 (1988). The Appellate Court apparently gleaned this standard from <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 58 n.15, 107 S. Ct. 989, 94 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1987), which quoted from <em>ValenzuelaBemal </em>after stating: \u201cRitchie, of course, may not require the trial court to search through the [witness\u2019] file without first establishing a basis for his claim that it contains material evidence.\u201d However, \u201cabsent any knowledge of the contents of [his] psychiatric records, it is impossible to determine whether they included relevant impeaching evidence that was not cumulative or was contrary to [his] testimony.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>201 Conn. 211, 226, 514 A.2d 724 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>197 Conn. 326, 332, 497 A.2d 758 (1985). Thus, such a showing must, perforce, consist of a certain amount of speculation. We do not read <em>Ritchie </em>or <em>Valenzuela-Bemal </em>to require a defendant to make a greater showing than our cases have previously required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b84-7\"> The state contends that we can find harmless error because when asked if there were any psychiatric reasons for his hospitalization, the witness answered \u201cNo,\u201d before the state could object. This was only one of three erroneous rulings, however. In any case, the court made clear by its rulings that it did not intend to allow, even during voir dire, any questions that touched in any fashion upon Knous\u2019 psychiatric privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">In remanding this case, we anticipate that the trial court may well offer the defendant an opportunity to pursue this line of questioning beyond the three questions previously posed to the witness. Although placing a limit on such questioning is a matter within the trial court\u2019s discretion, the record below may well reflect trial counsel\u2019s decision to abort a line of questioning prematurely in order to comply with adverse rulings from the bench.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
