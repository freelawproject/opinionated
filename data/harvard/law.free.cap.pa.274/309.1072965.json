It seems that the amendment is effective from its own date, rather than from the date of the original ordinance.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-8\">3. It makes no difference as to which date the amendment became effective, if it appears that the construction of a hospital within thirty feet but more than twenty feet of a dwelling had progressed no further than a slight disturbance of the soil when it was stopped by a preliminary injunction, inasmuch as such injunction must be dissolved, because the renewal of the work would be after the date of the amended ordinance.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-9\">4. The court will not assume that the hospital will make itself a nuisance sometime in the future, nor will it continue the injunction to meet such a possibility.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>Municipalities </em>\u2014 Ordinance\u2014Presumption <em>as to validity </em>\u2014 Evi<em>dence.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b334-4\">5. Until proof to the contrary is shown a city ordinance will be presumed to have been duly passed, in entire good faith, by the city councils.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b334-5\">Argued April 12,1922.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AGBa\">Appeal, No. 389, Jan.

If started now, it starts under the new ordinance, and there is nothing to prevent its being constructed where it has been located......We cannot assume that defendant will make of itself a nuisance sometime in the future, or continue the injunction to meet such a possibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">It need be added only that, until proof to the contrary is shown, it must be assumed that the ordinance under attack was duly passed, in entire good faith, by the city councils.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">The decree is affirmed at cost of appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
