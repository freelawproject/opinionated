The sum total of proof to show ownership and agency consisted of plaintiff\u2019s testimony, \u2018Schreiner\u2019s truck hit me,\u2019 to which another witness added, \u2018Schreiner\u2019s car came up the hill and bumped him.\u2019 There was not a scintilla of proof that the \u2018Schreiner\u2019 referred to in this testimony was John W. Schreiner, the defendant......We refused a motion for nonsuit, but gave binding instructions, in favor of defendant, at the close of the testimony, on ground of the above-stated infirmity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Counsel for plaintiff, having convinced the court below, on his motion for a new trial, that he was misled, by the refusal of a nonsuit, into the belief that his evidence was sufficient to take the case to the jury, and that, if given another opportunity, he could strengthen his proofs by showing the \u201cSchreiner\u201d mentioned in his testimony to be the defendant, the motion was granted, \u201con condition, however, that plaintiff pay defendant\u2019s costs for the term.\u201d The order granting the new trial is now assigned for error.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In Hess v. Gusdorff, 274 Pa. 123, we recently said: \u201cOn appeal from an order such as the one here complained of, we never reverse unless it clearly appears the trial court abused its discretion by acting arbitrarily or under a plain mistake of law\u201d; this statement, when applied to the present case, calls for the following disposition of the appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
