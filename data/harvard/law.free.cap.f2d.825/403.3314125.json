Naporano and Beatrice Naporano, Andrew J. Naporano and Sharon Naporano appeal the judgment of the United States Claims Court, No. 440-79T (November 21, 1986), denying their petition for attorney fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A), (2)(B) (Supp. Ill 1985), on the grounds that the government\u2019s position was substantially justified and the fee application was inadequately supported. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">We agree with Judge Tidwell\u2019s thorough analysis of the lack of itemization in the documents accompanying Naporano\u2019s fee request. Because that opinion is unpublished, we set out a portion of his opinion here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-6\">The EAJA requires that anyone seeking an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses shall submit, among other things, \u201can itemized statement ... stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses are computed.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B) (1982). Petitioners\u2019 petition for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses included an affidavit of Colin M. Danzis, Esquire, the partner in charge of the case, stating that the total fees sought were $117,490 and attendant disbursements of $6,545. He stated, \u201c[bjecause 70 percent, more or less, of the time expended in this matter was expended by senior members of the firm, an <em>average </em>hourly rate of $115.00 is a close approximation of actual hourly rates____\u201d (emphasis added). An additional sum sought was $8,033.00 for expert witness fees. Attached thereto were periodic billings to Naporano Iron and Metal Company generally indicating the total billing for the month and alloca-ble \u201cDisbursements\u201d for the billed period. An example is the bill from petitioners\u2019 attorney dated December 16, 1982, to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-8\">For Legal Services Rendered through November 30, 1982</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-9\"><em>In all </em>................................$5,360.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-10\">Disbursements ....................... 328.09</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-11\">Total Amount Due $5,688.09</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-13\">Such a showing is inadequate to support an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company v. United States, </em>4 Cl.Ct. 762, 771 (1984). Much more detail is needed. <em>See, e.g., White v. City of Richmond, </em>713 F.2d 458, 461 (9th Cir.1983). The court needs contemporaneous records of exact time spent on the case, by whom, their status and usual billing rates, as well as a breakdown of expenses such as the amounts spent copying documents, telephone bills, mail costs and any other expenditures related to the case. In the absence of such an itemized statement, the court is unable to determine whether the hours, fees and expenses, are reasonable for any individual item. <em>St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance, </em>4 Cl.Ct. at 771.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-14\">Slip op. at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-15\">We agree that under EAJA contemporaneous records of attorney\u2019s time and usual billing rates, as well as a breakdown of expenses, are necessary in order to determine the reasonableness of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-16\">Naporano agrees that the charges for individual items of work need to be considered in reviewing fee awards. Nevertheless, Naporano criticizes the trial court\u2019s focus on the lack of specific hourly billings. In its view the fee sought here is clearly reasonable since the total dollar amount divided by an hourly rate of $115.00 averages out to three hours a week over the course of this litigation. In other words, Naporano simply calculates backwards and points to success in the law suit to justify the work which was done. We disagree, as did the trial court, that the statutory requirement for an \u201citemized statement\u201d of work has so little substance. Only by knowing the specific task performed can the reasonableness of the number of hours required for any individual item be judged. The statute does not permit an interpretation that an unreasonable charge for an item is somehow made reasonable by the total amount requested. Also contrary to Naporano\u2019s view, the Claims Court could not simply allow less than the amount re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>quested. The statutory consent to fee awards requires specificity for an award to be made at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Naporano suggested at oral argument before this court that the Claims Court could have read the documentation in its fee application together with the Claims Court\u2019s docket sheet and thereby determined the specific work involved in any given bill. We reject unequivocally any suggestion that the Claims Court had an obligation to reconstruct the bills for Naporano. In any event, Naporano\u2019s argument, that the particulars required to support a fee award under EAJA would thereby be supplied, is specious.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b833-6\"> Our affirmance on the ground of lack of specificity makes it unnecessary to decide whether the government\u2019s position was substantially justified.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
