We find that an existing customer can effectively terminate an \u201cestablished business relationship\u201d for purposes of the TCPA by requesting to be placed on a \u201cdo not call\u201d list.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">{\u00b6 2} Plaintiff-appellant Philip J. Charvat filed this action against defendantsappellees Dispatch Consumer Services, Inc., and the Dispatch Printing Company, Inc. (collectively, \u201cthe Dispatch\u201d), alleging that the Dispatch had engaged in improper telephone solicitations in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d), Section 227, Title 47, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">{\u00b6 3} Charvat claims that the Dispatch made unsolicited phone calls to him asking him to purchase a weekday newspaper subscription. On August 2, 1996, Charvat requested that the Dispatch cease making telemarketing sales calls to his home. At the time, Charvat was already a Dispatch subscriber on a Sunday only basis. After Charvat\u2019s \u201cDo Not Call\u201d (\u201cDNC\u201d) demand, the Dispatch made at least two additional calls in the next twelve months to Charvat\u2019s household soliciting a subscription to the Dispatch\u2019s weekday newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">{\u00b6 4} On August 4, 1998, Charvat filed suit against the Dispatch. Charvat alleged that the Dispatch had violated the TCPA by continuing to solicit him by telephone after his DNC request. Charvat also alleged other violations of state consumer protection statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">{\u00b6 5} On September 8, 1998, the Dispatch filed a motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment seeking dismissal of all of Charvat\u2019s claims. In its September 15, 1999 decision, the trial court granted the Dispatch\u2019s motion, finding that the Dispatch was .exempted from the TCPA as to Charvat because it enjoyed an \u201cestablished business relationship\u201d with him. The Act, designed to protect consumers from unwanted telephone solicitations, excludes from the definition of \u201ctelephone solicitation\u201d calls made to someone with whom the caller has an \u201cestablished business relationship.\u201d Section 227(a)(3)(B), Title 47, U.S.Code. The trial court also found in the Dispatch\u2019s favor on Charvat\u2019s state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">{\u00b6 6} Charvat appealed only the portion of the decision concerning his TCPA claim. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">{\u00b6 7} The cause is before this court upon the allowance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">{\u00b6 8} Telemarketing has become a garish billboard planted firmly in the center of the cultural landscape, and has become the target of professional and water-cooler social commentators throughout the nation:</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">{\u00b69} \u201c\u2018SEINFELD: (PHONE RINGING) Hello.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c \u2018(TELEMARKETER): Hi. Would you be interested in switching over to TMI long-distance service?</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c \u2018SEINFELD: Oh, gee, I can\u2019t talk right now. Why don\u2019t you give me your home number and I\u2019ll call you later?</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">{\u00b6 12} * *</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c \u2018(TELEMARKETER): Well, I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019re not allowed to do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c \u2018SEINFELD: I guess you don\u2019t want people calling you at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c\u2018(TELEMARKETER): No.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c \u2018SEINFELD: Well, now you know how I feel.\u2019 \u201d Shannon, Combating Unsolicited Sales Calls: The \u201cDo-Not-Call\u201d Approach to Solving the Telemarketing Problem (2001), 27 J. Legis. 381, fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">{\u00b6 17} We are not called upon to judge the telemarketing industry. We are not asked to balance its obvious failings against the employment it creates and the economic efficiencies it can engender. Instead, we are called upon simply to apply a statute, and in turn to determine what level of deference this court owes to the governmental agency that has created regulations based upon the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">{\u00b6 18} In response to the burgeoning use of telephone solicitations to market goods and services in the United States, and the concomitant frustration of the American public, Congress passed the TCPA in 1991. P.L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat. 2394. At that time, Congress found that 18 million Americans each day received a telephone solicitation. Not surprisingly, Congress also determined that \u201c[m]any consumers are outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance calls to their homes from telemarketers.\u201d 137 Cong.Rec. 518781-02; 137 Cong. Rec. H11307-01. The federal government stepped in to address the problem because individual states were unable to regulate telemarketers\u2019 interstate operations. P.L. No. 102-243 Section 2,105 Stat. 2394.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">{\u00b6 19} The TCPA was the result of Congress\u2019s effort to balance individual privacy with freedom of speech and trade. The teeth of the Act, which allows consumers to sue overzealous telemarketers, is at issue in this case. Section 227(c)(5), Title 47, U.S.Code provides a private right of action to \u201c[a] person who has received more than one telephone call within any 12-month period by or on behalf of the same entity in violation of the regulations prescribed under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>subsection.\u201d The regulations prescribed under the statute include Section 64.1200(e)(vi), Title 47 C.F.R, which forbids telemarketers from soliciting by telephone anyone who has previously requested to be put on a DNC list. In this case, Charvat alleges that the Dispatch made telephone solicitations at least twice after his DNC request.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">{\u00b6 20} Congress created an exception to the purview of the Act as a part of its balancing of commerce and privacy. Section 227(a)(3)(B), Title 47, U.S.Code excludes from the definition of \u201ctelephone solicitation\u201d a call made \u201cto any person with whom the caller has an established business relationship.\u201d Thus, a consumer has no right of action under Section 227(c)(5) against a caller with whom he has an \u201cestablished business relationship\u201d (\u201cEBR\u201d). The trial and appellate courts in this case found that an EBR existed between Charvat and the Dispatch because Charvat subscribed to the Sunday Dispatch at the time of the telephone calls at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">{\u00b6 21} The TCPA itself does not define what constitutes an EBR. That question is central to this case, as well as the issue of how an EBR can be terminated. The Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) has undertaken to resolve both of those issues pursuant to its rulemaking authority delegated by Congress. But is this court bound by how the FCC has resolved these issues?</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">{\u00b6 22} The United States Supreme Court instructs us that courts do owe deference to an agency\u2019s rulemaking authority. In <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 837, 843-844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694, the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c \u2018The power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created * * * program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.\u2019 <em>Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 231 [94 S.Ct. 1055, 39 L.Ed.2d 270] (1974). If Congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation. Such legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute. Sometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit rather than explicit. In such a case, a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.\u201d (Footnote omitted; ellipses sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">{\u00b6 24} Here, the TCPA is the skeleton of a system designed to rein in the proliferation of telemarketing calls. Much of the detail was left to the FCC. Congress\u2019s delegation was both explicit and implicit. In Section 227(c), Congress explicitly set forth the FCC\u2019s role in implementing the overarching aim of the Act:</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>{\u00b6 25} \u201c[T]he Commission shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding concerning the need to protect residential telephone subscribers\u2019 privacy rights to avoid receiving telephone solicitations to which they object.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">{\u00b6 26} This explicit delegation of the FCC\u2019s role creates implicit powers where Congress fails to fill in the blanks. Congress did not define \u201cestablished business relationship\u201d within the TCPA, either in its definitional section, Section U.S.C. 227(a), or elsewhere. The FCC stepped into that breach and defined what constitutes an EBR in Section 64.1200(f)(4), Title 47, C.F.R.:</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThe term \u2018established business relationship\u2019 means a prior or existing relationship formed by a voluntary two-way communication between a person or entity and a residential subscriber with or without an exchange of consideration, on the basis of an inquiry, application, purchase or transaction by the residential subscriber regarding products or services offered by such person or entity, which relationship has not been previously terminated by either party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">{\u00b6 28} <em>Chevron </em>requires this court to defer to the agency regulation as to the definition of an EBR. Certainly, the FCC\u2019s definition is a reasonable one given the Act\u2019s purpose of regulating telemarketing. The definition is not an exhaustive one for use in all contexts, but it reflects Congress\u2019s purpose. It allows businesses to contact individuals who have previously invited or acquiesced to calls without violating the TCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">{\u00b6 29} While establishing that the EBR exemption exists only if the \u201crelationship has not been previously terminated by either party,\u201d the FCC does not explain within its regulations what it takes to terminate a relationship. However, in interpreting its own rules, the FCC did undertake to set forth how an EBR can be severed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">{\u00b6 30} The regulation defining an \u201cestablished business relationship\u201d first appeared in the FCC\u2019s Report and Order (1992), 7 F.C.C.R 8752, 1992 WL 690928, Appendix B. In its Report and Order, the FCC discussed public comments it had received on the proposed rule and its own interpretation of the rule as adopted. As a part of that discussion and interpretation, the FCC directly addressed the issue present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cWe emphasize, however, that a business may not make telephone solicitations to an existing or former customer who has asked to be placed on that company\u2019s do-not-call list. A customer\u2019s request to be placed on the company\u2019s do-not-call list <em>terminates the business relationship betioeen the company and that customer for the purpose of any future solicitation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. at fn. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>{\u00b6 32} The FCC makes clear that an existing customer who requests to be put on a do-not-call list retains the same rights as a noncustomer who makes a similar demand:</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cThe definition of \u2018telephone solicitation\u2019 in \u00a7 227(a)(3) also excludes calls made to parties with whom the caller has an established business relationship and calls for which the calling party has received the called party\u2019s prior express invitation or permission. We emphasize, however, that subscribers may sever any business relationship, i.e., revoke consent to any future solicitations, by requesting that they not receive further calls from a telemarketer, thus subjecting that telemarketer to the requirements of \u00a7 64.1200(e).\u201d Id. at fn. 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">{\u00b6 34} Thus, the FCC, the agency entrusted with the development of rules for the interpretation of the TCPA, has set forth its opinion that a consumer can sever its EBR with a business such that the telemarketer loses its exemption from the TCPA. The FCC firmly answers that current customers can gain the protection of the TCPA by requesting to be put on a DNC list.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">{\u00b6 35} But are an agency\u2019s interpretations of its own regulations also subject to deference by courts? In <em>Stinson v. United States </em>(1993), 508 U.S. 36, 44-45, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598, the court held that an agency\u2019s commentary regarding its own rules is due even greater deference than the court gives rules in <em>Chevron:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cCommentary * * * has a function different from an agency\u2019s legislative rule. Commentary, unlike a legislative rule, is not the product of delegated authority for rulemaking, which of course must yield to the clear meaning of a statute. * * * Rather, commentary explains the guidelines and provides concrete guidance as to how even unambiguous guidelines are to be applied in practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cThe functional purpose of commentary * * * is to assist in the interpretation and application of those rules, which are within the [Sentencing] Commission\u2019s particular area of concern and expertise and which the Commission itself has the first responsibility to formulate and announce. * * * As we have often stated, provided an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations does not violate the Constitution or a federal statute, it must be given \u2018controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">{\u00b6 38} Pursuant to <em>Stinson, </em>we must follow the FCC\u2019s commentary unless it is at odds with the regulation it explains. We find the agency\u2019s interpretation to be perfectly in line with the regulation. Section 64.1200(f)(4), Title 47, C.F.R. defines an EBR, but also states that the privileges associated with an EBR exist only until the relationship terminates. The agency commentary explains how that relationship ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>{\u00b6 39} The FCC opines that a person can sever an established business relationship simply by asking to be put on a DNC list. The DNC does not destroy every aspect of a relationship; instead, it \u201cterminates the business relationship * * * for the purpose of any future solicitation.\u201d 7 F.C.C.R. 8752, fn. 63, 1992 WL 690928. The FCC does not require that the subscriber stop purchasing from a company associated with the telemarketer. It requires only that the consumer seek to cease the \u201cvoluntary two-way communication\u201d that is the definitional heart of the \u201cestablished business relationship.\u201d Section 64.1200(f)(4), Title 47, C.F.R. That is enough to overcome the assumed acquiescence to receiving telemarketing calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">{\u00b6 40} Appellees argue that giving established customers the benefit of the Act after a DNC request list renders the EBR exception a nullity. They argue that there is no distinction then between how telemarketers must treat established customers and other people receiving telephone calls. It is true that <em>after </em>a DNC request an established customer and a noncustomer enjoy the same protections under the TCPA. However, as the FCC report points out, it is not until a person who has an EBR with a telemarketer requests to be placed on a DNC list that a company must comply with the dictates of Section 64.1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">{\u00b6 41} Without an EBR, telemarketers may not call before 8:00 a.m. or after 9:00 p.m. [Section 64.1200(e)(1), Title 47, C.F.R.], must provide the name and the address or phone number of the caller [Section 64.1200(e)(2)(iv) ], may not make an unrequested prerecorded solicitation call [Section 64.1200(a)(2) ], and may not send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine [Section 64.1200(a)(3) ].</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">{\u00b6 42} By contrast, an entity making calls only to persons with whom it already has an EBR does not have to comply with the DNC list requirements of Section 64.1200(e)(2). A company that called only existing customers would not have to have a written policy for maintaining a DNC list [64.1200(e)(2)(i) ], would not be required to train personnel regarding those lists [64.1200(e)(2)(ii) ], and would not have to maintain a DNC list [64.1200(e)(2)(vi) ].</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">{\u00b6 43} Thus, an EBR does provide a business with tangible benefits that it can enjoy prior to an existing customer\u2019s DNC request. Only after an existing customer ends the EBR do the requirements and restrictions of Section 64.1200, Title 47, C.F.R. come into play as to that customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">{\u00b6 44} The regulation and the commentary are both consistent with the statute at issue. The purpose of the Act is to reduce the nuisance aspect of telemarketing. Maintaining some limited commercial tie to a business should not leave consumers at the mercy of unbridled telemarketing efforts. An EBR gives a business the benefit of the doubt, not an unlimited license to call. It is not consistent with the Act that a person who subscribes to the daily newspaper in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>one-newspaper town must be prisoner to telephone pitches for a publisher\u2019s panoply of products.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AqH\">Philip J.

Little, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AKHx\">Robert Biggerstaff, pro se, urging reversal as amicus curiae.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">{\u00b6 45} We defer to and agree with the positions of the FCC on these matters. We accept its definition of an EBR as a relationship formed by a voluntary two-way communication. We agree that when that relationship becomes involuntary and one-sided, the consumer can put an end to telephone solicitation calls. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b674-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
