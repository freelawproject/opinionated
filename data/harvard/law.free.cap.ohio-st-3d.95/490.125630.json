Dixon of Cleveland, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0060090, for acts violating numerous Disciplinary Rules and for initially failing to cooperate in the disciplinary investigation. The board recommends that we indefinitely suspend Dixon from the practice of law in Ohio. For the reasons that follow, we decline to follow the board\u2019s recommendation and instead disbar Dixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">{\u00b6 2} The parties entered into detailed factual stipulations that formed the basis for the panel report, which in turn formed the basis of the board\u2019s certified report to this court. These stipulations indicate that in September 1996, Dixon began to represent Bertha Heim, both individually and as the administrator of the estate of Heim\u2019s deceased husband, Otto. Dixon also represented Heim\u2019s son for limited purposes. During the course of her relationship with Heim, Dixon obtained power of attorney, which Dixon used to sign probate documents and to transfer both probate and non-probate funds or assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-13\">\n<em>Neglect</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b652-14\">{\u00b6 3} Dixon admits that she lacked the experience to handle the probate matter. Among other errors, she failed to identify accurately funds valued at $33,950.65; failed to file accurate accounts in a timely fashion, resulting in a citation against Heim; failed to deliver assets to beneficiaries in a timely fashion; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>and failed to provide full information in a timely fashion to both the court and her client. Eventually, a probate court magistrate judge contacted the Cleveland Bar Association over concerns that Heim had expressed to him about Dixon\u2019s usurping estate assets valued between $200,000 and $500,000 and about a potential conflict of interest arising from Dixon\u2019s representing the estate, of which both Heim and her son were beneficiaries, while also representing Heim personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">{\u00b6 4} The parties stipulated that Dixon\u2019s conduct violated DR 6 \u2014 101(A)(1) (a lawyer shall not handle a legal matter that she knows or should have known she is not competent to handle without associating herself with a lawyer who is competent to handle it), 6-101(A)(2) (a lawyer shall not handle a legal matter inadequately), 6-101(A)(3) (a lawyer shall not neglect an entrusted legal matter), 1-102(A)(5) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), 7-101(A)(2) (a lawyer shall not fail to carry out a contract of legal employment with a client for professional services), and 7-102(A)(3) (a lawyer shall not knowingly fail to disclose that which the law requires to be revealed).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">\n<em>Failure to Account for Fiduciary Funds</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A3p\">{\u00b6 5} In the course of the attorney-client relationship, Dixon had assumed nearly total control over all assets belonging to the estate and to Heim. The parties stipulated that Dixon\u2019s mishandling of the assets violated DR 9 \u2014 102(B)(2) (failure to label all assets properly), 9-102(B)(3) (failure to render appropriate accounts to the client), and 9-102(B)(4) (failure to pay or deliver to the client promptly property that was in lawyer\u2019s possession).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">\n<em>Improper Transfers of Fiduciary Funds</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aeqy\">{\u00b6 6} In the second month of her representation of Heim, Dixon opened a joint and survivorship checking account in both their names. Although Dixon used this account to receive various fiduciary monies and to pay fiduciary bills, Dixon also withdrew $252,406.80 from that account for her own use. Exhibits accompanying the stipulations show that Dixon had written several checks payable to \u201cCash.\u201d Another was payable to a university scholarship fund, while yet others were payable to relatives of Dixon. Although Dixon periodically reimbursed the account, she twice deposited her own funds into the account and identified them as \u201cloans,\u201d even though Heim did not require such loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">{\u00b6 7} The parties stipulated that Dixon\u2019s conduct violated DR 9-102(A) (commingling funds), 1-102(A)(4) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 1-102(A)(6) (engaging in conduct adversely reflecting on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), and 7-101(A)(3) (intentionally prejudicing or damaging her client in the course of their professional relationship).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">{\u00b6 8} During her second year of representing the estate and Heim, Dixon transferred $110,000 from Heim\u2019s assets to Dixon\u2019s brother and another individual. The two men used the money to purchase real property. Dixon prepared a promissory note and open-ended mortgage for the transaction that identified the lender as \u201cBertha Heim c/o her Attorney, Debra J. Dixon.\u201d The stipulations state that Dixon \u201cadmits she has no records evidencing disclosure of this loan to Bertha Heim.\u201d The parties stipulated that Dixon\u2019s conduct violated DR 5-105 (representing conflicting interests).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">{\u00b6 9} Upon reaching a settlement with the estate\u2019s conservator, who had filed a concealment of assets action, Dixon repaid that portion of the principal that she had not already redeposited, paid interest on the principal, and paid the conservator\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">\n<em>Charging an Excessive Fee</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">{\u00b6 10} By two payments in February and June 1997, Dixon paid herself a total of $15,000 from non-probate funds. Dixon recorded the payments as \u201cfunds management.\u201d Later, during the course of the conservator\u2019s legal action against her, Dixon submitted a fee invoice in the amount of $18,205 plus additional expenses. As part of the settlement agreement, Dixon waived payment of her fees. The parties stipulated that Dixon attempted to charge an excessive fee in violation of DR 2-106(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">\n<em>Failure to Cooperate with Disciplinary Investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">{\u00b6 11} The Cleveland Bar Association first notified Dixon in February 1999 of a grievance against her. Despite repeated requests by the bar association, Dixon failed to provide full information for months. Finally, following the estate conservator\u2019s filing of the civil action against Dixon, Dixon retained counsel who facilitated Dixon\u2019s cooperation with the disciplinary investigation. The parties stipulated that Dixon\u2019s conduct constitutes misconduct under Gov.Bar R. V(6)(A)(1) in that she failed to cooperate as required by Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">{\u00b6 12} The matter proceeded to a hearing before a board panel. At the hearing, the bar association confirmed that it was withdrawing other alleged violations that were not resolved by stipulation, as well as an amended complaint that it had filed alleging additional violations. After hearing mitigation testimony, the panel adopted the parties\u2019 stipulations as its findings of fact and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>conclusions of law and recommended an indefinite suspension. The board then adopted the findings, conclusions, and recommendation of the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">{\u00b6 13} Dixon now objects to a portion of the board\u2019s findings and to a condition of the recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">{\u00b6 14} With one exception, Dixon does not object to the factual findings and conclusions adopted by the board. Nor does she suggest that the imposition of an indefinite suspension is unwarranted in light of her admitted violations of numerous Disciplinary Rules. Rather, Dixon urges this court to find that mental illness contributed to her misconduct and to permit her to apply for reinstatement from indefinite suspension upon a determination by mental health professionals that she is fit to resume the practice of law rather than upon the expiration of Gov.Bar R. V(10)(B)(l)\u2019s two-year waiting period. We need not address Dixon\u2019s argument regarding early reinstatement from an indefinite suspension, however, because the facts of this case warrant disbarment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">{\u00b6 15} Because misappropriation of client funds is among Dixon\u2019s acts of admitted misconduct, we must begin our consideration with the presumptive sanction of disbarment. See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Wise </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 169, 171, 707 N.E.2d 852. See, also, <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Glatki </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 381, 384, 726 N.E.2d 993; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Connaughton </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 644, 645, 665 N.E.2d 675. \u201cHowever, on some occasions because of mitigating circumstances, we have given weight to a board recommendation of a lesser sanction.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 171, 707 N.E.2d 852, citing <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Kurtz </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 55, 693 N.E.2d 1080. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>considering whether such sufficient mitigating circumstances exist, we are guided by Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Medley </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 474, 477, 756 N.E.2d 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">(\u00b6 16} Dixon posits that an indefinite suspension would be an appropriate lesser sanction because numerous Section 10 mitigating factors exist in this case: the absence of a prior disciplinary record; evidence of her otherwise good character and good works; the fact that the misconduct was limited to a single representation; her mental illness, which she labels as a \u201csignificant contributing factor\u201d to her dishonesty and which she is making an effort to overcome; and the fact that she made \u201cfull restitution prior to any court ordered compulsion to do so.\u201d The panel and board found the presence of several of these mitigating factors, including restitution, no prior discipline, and positive character witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">{\u00b6 17} We agree that a lack of prior discipline and the fact that Dixon\u2019s misconduct was limited to single representation constitute some mitigation. See Section 10(B) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline. We also accord some weight to Dixon\u2019s character references. But for the following reasons, we find Dixon\u2019s claim to each remaining mitigating factor less compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">\n<em>Mental Illness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">{\u00b6 18} Although Section 10(B)(2) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline does not explicitly reference mental illness as a mitigating factor, Section 10(B) of that rule requires consideration of \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining an appropriate sanction for misconduct. We have historically considered an attorney\u2019s mental state in determining an appropriate sanction for misconduct. <em>Glatki, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 384, 726 N.E.2d 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">{\u00b6 19} Here, both the panel and the board explicitly <em>rejected </em>the existence of Dixon\u2019s psychological issues as a mitigating factor. The board specifically found that Dixon\u2019s psychological problems were \u201cperipherally related\u201d to her misconduct and concluded that Dixon\u2019s \u201cmental state did not cause and does not justify her dishonest conduct.\u201d \u201cWhile this court is not bound by the findings of fact of the board and panel, we give them some deference in light of the reality that the panel observed the witnesses firsthand.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Cleary </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 191, 198, 754 N.E.2d 235. We have independently reviewed the testimony and written report of the clinical and forensic psychologist that Dixon presented on her behalf. Both contain evidence of unfortunate circumstances in Dixon\u2019s history that have resulted in mainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>personality and interpersonal relationship difficulties. Neither, however, contains a sufficiently compelling causal link between Dixon\u2019s stated psychological issues and her misappropriation of over $250,000. Accordingly, we decline to credit Dixon\u2019s claim to mitigation in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">\n<em>Restitution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">{\u00b6 20} We discount the mitigating value of Dixon\u2019s having made \u201cfull restitution prior to any court ordered compulsion to do so.\u201d Though the board found Dixon\u2019s restitution to constitute a mitigating factor, the board also found the <em>circumstances </em>behind the restitution to constitute an <em>aggravating </em>factor. We agree. While Dixon had indeed made restitution before a court ordered her to do so, she completed it well over a year after learning of the grievance \u2014 and only <em>after </em>the conservator of the estate of Otto Heim had initiated legal action to reclaim the misappropriated funds, <em>after </em>the conservator had issued a <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>requiring Dixon to produce records of the accounts, securities, and other assets held by the estate and Bertha Heim, and <em>after </em>Dixon had retained counsel and negotiated a settlement in which she paid the estate $151,960.50 in exchange for a release of all claims against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">{\u00b6 21} Despite the delay in making restitution, Dixon testified before the panel that she had promptly paid the $151,960.50 to the estate upon the conservator\u2019s determination of the total amount of principal, interest, and conservator fees due, implying that she acted timely and in good faith. Yet, given her firsthand knowledge of how much money she had misappropriated, Dixon could have, and should have, repaid the monies owed to the estate (except the conservator\u2019s fee) even prior to completion of the <em>conservator\u2019s </em>calculation. Dixon\u2019s delayed payment therefore constitutes less than a \u201ctimely good faith effort to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct.\u201d Section 10(B)(2)(c) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline. Although Dixon\u2019s having made restitution provides <em>some </em>mitigation, the circumstances surrounding the repayment determine its weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">\n<em>Remorse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">{\u00b6 22} In addition to those mitigating factors set forth above, the board also cited as mitigating Dixon\u2019s expression of remorse for her conduct. Dixon, however, does not assert remorse in her list of mitigating factors to this court. We note nonetheless that Dixon testified before the board that \u201cwords cannot describe\u201d her degree of remorse and that she feels \u201cashamed for having marred * * * one of the most honorable professions around.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">{\u00b6 23} We also note that Dixon testified that she had \u201cnever meant, under any circumstances, to harm Mrs. Heim. On the contrary, [Dixon\u2019s] goals and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>* * * motivations for getting involved were to help her.\u201d Further, Dixon testified that she had never intended to deprive Bertha Heim of her money or property, and that she recognizes that the problem in making the loan to her brother was that \u201c[a]s a practical matter and for ethics purposes [she] was representing both sides of a transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">{\u00b6 24} Dixon is correct in identifying issues related to representing both sides of a transaction \u2014 if we accept for the sake of argument that making a loan without Heim\u2019s knowledge constitutes \u201crepresenting\u201d the client. But Dixon fails to acknowledge the deeper nature and severity of her misconduct. The panel found that \u201c[n]o disclosure of this loan was made to Bertha Heim.\u201d The board in turn adopted this factual finding, and Dixon does not object to the finding here. By acknowledging <em>only </em>the conflict of representing both sides in the loan, Dixon has failed to identify the larger issue: <em>the money was never hers to lend in the first place.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">{\u00b6 25} Similarly, Dixon\u2019s expression of remorse is undercut by the confusion that Dixon exhibited as to whether she believes that she had indeed initially charged an excessive fee. First, she testified that her $18,651 fee was <em>not </em>excessive for the labor and services that she rendered. Dixon then testified that she had agreed to the stipulation because she realized that she \u201chad botched from top to bottom the Heim matter. * * * [T]he reason that I agreed to that particular stipulation was I guess a fundamental belief that if you don\u2019t provide services in a meaningful [manner], one that advances the cause of the client, it is excessive. Anything is excessive.\u201d Such contradictory testimony highlights Dixon\u2019s inability to identify and appreciate the full scope of her errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">{\u00b6 26} Further, the bar association argues in its brief that \u201cDixon\u2019s request to be considered for readmission in less than the two-year period proscribed [sic] by Gov.Bar R. V(10)(B) raises the serious question whether she truly appreciates the degree to which she violated the Code of Professional Responsibility, abused a client\u2019s trust, and abused the public\u2019s trust.\u201d In her objections to this court, Dixon continued to seek potential early reinstatement, even after both the panel and the board had rejected Dixon\u2019s attempt on the basis that it would \u201cnot impose an adequate penalty for [her] intentional dishonesty.\u201d We agree that the bar association raises a legitimate concern that, coupled with our recognition of Dixon\u2019s inability to perceive the extent and nature of her misconduct, supports our finding that Dixon has failed to acknowledge the wrongful nature of her conduct in regard to the misappropriation and in attempting to charge an excessive fee. See Section 10(B)(1)(g) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline. This aggravating factor offsets Dixon\u2019s incomplete expression of remorse.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AM-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Gold, Schwartz &amp; Company, L.P.A., and Niki Z. Schwartz; Charles W. Kettlewell, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">{\u00b6 27} Against the foregoing mitigating factors of varying persuasiveness, we weigh Dixon\u2019s admitted misconduct comprising fifteen distinct violations of the Disciplinary Rules and a violation of her duty to cooperate in the investigation. We find that the mitigating factors present in this case fail to warrant a lesser sanction than disbarment. We have held that in most instances, \u201c[t]he continuing public confidence in the judicial system and the bar requires that the strictest discipline be imposed in misappropriation cases.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Belock </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 98, 100, 694 N.E.2d 897. Misappropriation was but <em>one form </em>of Dixon\u2019s misconduct. As the board correctly explained, Dixon \u201chas committed disciplinary rule violations involving incompetence, neglect, dishonesty and misrepresentation involving commingling and misappropriation of a client\u2019s funds, an attempt to charge an excessive fee, and failure to cooperate initially in the disciplinary process until she was advised to do so by retained counsel.\u201d Dixon\u2019s mitigating circumstances inadequately offset the more compelling interest of protecting the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">{\u00b6 28} This court hereby disbars Dixon from the practice of law. Costs are taxed to Dixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b659-8\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b659-9\">Douglas, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b659-10\">Resnick and F.E.

The board report describes DR 9 \u2014 102(B)(2) as prohibiting Dixon\u2019s failure to render an appropriate account to Heim in a timely fashion, while describing DR 9 \u2014 102(B)(3) as prohibiting Dixon\u2019s failure to label all assets properly. The board has switched the Disciplinary Rules. Our independent evaluation of the case corrects this clerical error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b655-9\">. {\u00b6 a} As noted, the parties stipulated to the recommended sanction of an indefinite suspension, which both the panel and the board found appropriate. At first blush, our departure from the board\u2019s recommended sanction would therefore appear to necessitate a remand in this case pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(8)(D):</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">{\u00b6 b} \u201cAfter a hearing on objections, * * * the Supreme Court shall enter an order as it finds proper. If the Court rejects the sanction contained in a certified report submitted pursuant to Section 11 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline, <em>the Court shall remand the matter to the board for a hearing.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">{\u00b6 c} No remand is required. This court has previously explained that \u201cstipulations to [an indefinite suspension or disbarment] are not within the scope of Section 11 [of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline].\u201d <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v.
