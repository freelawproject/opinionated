Hadbavny, has an allowed workers\u2019 compensation claim. In 1998, he sought temporary total disability compensation (\u201cTTC\u201d). A district hearing officer for appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio granted that request. Claimant\u2019s employer, appellee House of LaRose Cleveland, Inc., appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">{\u00b6 2} A staff hearing officer on October 23, 1998, issued the following order:</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">{\u00b6 3} \u201c[T]he Appeal filed 9-28-98 is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThe Staff Hearing Officer denies the request for payment of temporary total compensation for the period of 7-15-98 through 9-15-98. The basis of this finding is that the claimant voluntarily abandoned his former position of employment. The claimant had returned to his former position of employment without restrictions on 3-31-98. The claimant worked at full duty until 6-26-98 when he was terminated for violation of a company work rule. There is no evidence that this termination was secondary to restrictions stemming from the allowed conditions. The Staff Hearing Officer finds, therefore, that the conduct leading to the termination constitutes a voluntary abandonment of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cAll proof on file was reviewed and considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">{\u00b6 6} Claimant filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the commission abused its discretion in denying TTC. The court of appeals held that the order did not satisfy <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245, and issued a limited writ returning the cause to the commission for further consideration and amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-16\">{\u00b6 7} This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aci\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Paul M. Friedman, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AA_j\">Betty D. Montgomery, Attorney General, and William J. McDonald, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee Industrial Commission.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ap8\">Duvin, Cahn <em>&amp; </em>Hutton and Christine C. Covey, for appellee House of LaRose Cleveland, Inc.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">{\u00b6 8} <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>requires the commission to \u201cspecifically state what evidence has been relied upon, and briefly explain the reasoning for its decision.\u201d Id. at syllabus. Because that did not occur here, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">{\u00b6 9} The commission\u2019s bare reference to \u201c[a]ll proof on file\u201d does not comport with the evidentiary specificity that <em>Noll </em>demands. Its \u201cexplanation\u201d defies <em>Noll </em>for two other reasons. First, the denial of TTC conflicts with its earlier declaration that the employer\u2019s appeal was denied. Second, it does not explain how claimant\u2019s employment discharge satisfied the criteria established in <em>State ex rel. Louisiana-Pacific Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 401, 650 N.E.2d 469, which set forth circumstances under which employment discharge could be deemed a TTC-preclusive abandonment of the former position of employment. Accordingly, a return to the commission for further consideration, clarification, and an amended order is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">{\u00b6 10} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b502-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
