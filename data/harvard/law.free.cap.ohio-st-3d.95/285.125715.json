Hanna, has raised fifteen propositions of law. We have reviewed each and have determined that none justifies reversal of appellant\u2019s convictions. Pursuant to R.C. 2929.05(A), we have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors and reviewed the death penalty for appropriateness and proportionality. For the reasons that follow, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant and Peter Copas were cellmates for four days at the Lebanon Correctional Institution (\u201cLCI\u201d). In the early morning on August 22, 1997, appellant thrust a sharpened paintbrush into Copas\u2019s right eye socket. Appellant also hit Copas in the head with a padlock placed in a sock. The paintbrush penetrated the cranial cavity and entered the brain stem. Surgeons removed the paintbrush lodged in Copas\u2019s brain; however, Copas died on September 10, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant was convicted by a jury of the aggravated murder of Copas and sentenced to death. Appellant directly appeals as a matter of right to this court, challenging his convictions and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">I. Facts and Case History</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">{\u00b6 4} On or about August 18, 1997, Copas was moved into appellant\u2019s cell. From the outset, Copas and appellant did not get along. Appellant was upset because prison authorities had moved Copas into his cell without appellant\u2019s prior knowledge, because Copas had altered the condition of the cell, and because Copas had used appellant\u2019s property without his permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">{\u00b6 5} Around August 20, 1997, Ricardo Lee, another inmate, asked appellant to allow Copas to remain in appellant\u2019s cell until Lee and Copas could become cellmates. According to Lee, appellant \u201cacted as if he was just tolerating him as long as he could until they could move him.\u201d The next day, appellant told Lee that \u201cMr. Copas had bothered his TV set and broken it and that * * * he couldn\u2019t really tolerate him anymore, that [he] should do whatever [he] had to do to help him move out of the cell.\u201d During a third conversation, on the day before the murder, appellant told Lee that he had \u201cbetter do something because his wick was getting short.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">{\u00b6 6} On August 21, when appellant returned to his cell, he found the cell door open, and some of his belongings were \u201claying about\u201d or \u201cstolen.\u201d Appellant was upset, since \u201cyou don\u2019t leave your cell door open so that someone can come in and take your cellmate\u2019s belongings.\u201d Around 9:15 p.m., Copas returned to the cell, appeared intoxicated, crawled into his top bunk, and then vomited.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant decided \u201cthat he had had enough.\u201d Around 4:00 a.m. or 5:00 a.m. on August 22, 1997, appellant \u201ctook a paintbrush, sharpened * * * the tip of it down, took matches and lit the end that he had sharpened as to stiffen it up so that it would be brittle.\u201d Appellant created another weapon by taking \u201ca lock off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>of Mr. Copas\u2019 lock box\u201d and then placing it inside a sock. While Copas was asleep, appellant \u201cstood up and plunged the paintbrush handle into Mr. Copas\u2019 eye,\u201d and the handle broke off. Appellant \u201cdidn\u2019t mean for it to break; * * * he wanted it to go further in than what it did, but it broke off.\u201d Appellant said that he did not stick Copas in the ear \u201c[bjecause the ear is too hard. You would use an ice pick in the ear. The eye is much softer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">{\u00b6 8} After being attacked, Copas \u201crose up out of bed\u201d and asked, \u201cWhy the hell did you do that?\u201d Then, appellant struck Copas in the head with the lock and also \u201ctook his fist and struck\u201d Copas. Copas passed out and fell over the television set at the foot of the bed. At that point, appellant \u201cflushed the paintbrush handle remains and the sock down the toilet, placed the padlock back on the locker box, and then sat back in his bed\u201d and smoked a cigarette.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">{\u00b6 9} Around 6:00 a.m., Copas arose out of his unconscious condition and \u201cjumped up, ran to the cell door and started screaming that, \u2018My celly\u2019s trying to kill me.\u2019 \u201d Doug Stewart, a corrections officer at LCI, heard yelling, went to Copas\u2019s cell, and saw Copas \u201cstanding at the door, bleeding.\u201d Copas was taken to the prison infirmary. In the meantime, appellant was backed out of his cell and handcuffed. When a guard asked him what happened, appellant replied, \u201cI told them not to put him in here with me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">{\u00b6 10} Upon arriving at the prison infirmary, Copas told Linda Young, a registered nurse, that \u201che was shanked in the head and hit with a battery in a sock.\u201d Copas was transferred to the Middletown Regional Hospital about thirty minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">{\u00b6 11} Dr. Ralph Talkers, an emergency physician at Middletown, treated Copas for head lacerations; \u201chis right eye was extremely swollen,\u201d consistent with an assault. However, Copas was not treated for stab wounds, since neither his medical records nor Copas himself had indicated that he had been stabbed. Dr. Talkers examined Copas\u2019s eye, but there was \u201cno indication whatsoever\u201d that there was a foreign object lodged in or behind his eye. Moreover, results of X-rays of the face and skull proved negative. Thus, Dr. Talkers concluded that Copas\u2019s \u201ceye was traumatized * * * because of the blunt injury\u201d during the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">{\u00b6 12} According to Dr. Talkers, a CAT (computerized axial tomography) scan of Copas\u2019s head was not conducted, since \u201cthe patient was awake and talking and did not have * * * focal neurological findings.\u201d Moreover, Copas was \u201cobserved in the emergency room for approximately five hours\u201d and never lost consciousness. Copas was sent back to the prison infirmary and arrived at around 1:45 p.m. on August 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">{\u00b6 13} Dr. James McWeeney, the medical director at LCI, found that Copas was \u201cvery lucid,\u201d and \u201chis speech was clear and deliberate\u201d when he examined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Copas on August 23. According to Dr. McWeeney, Copas \u201cdid not exhibit any signs of an intracranial injury or severe head trauma.\u201d However, Dr. McWeeney ordered an ophthalmology consult and a CAT scan.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">{\u00b6 14} On August 26, 1997, Dr. Steven Katz, a neuro-ophthalmologist, examined Copas at the Corrections Medical Center. Copas\u2019s eye was swollen, and there appeared to be \u201cswelling or congestion in the socket behind the eye.\u201d A CAT scan completed later that evening showed \u201ca large foreign object * * * like a pen or pencil * * * lodged in the socket just behind the eye, inside the eye muscle cone.\u201d According to Dr. Katz, \u201cit appeared to penetrate the pons, which is part of the brain stem, and go back far enough to enter the cerebellum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">{\u00b6 15} On August 27,1997, neurosurgeons conducted a \u201cpterional craniotomy\u201d and removed the remnant of the paintbrush, which was approximately five inches long, from inside Copas\u2019s head. Copas recovered \u201cvery quickly from surgery\u201d and was treated with \u201cbroad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics\u201d to fight possible infection. However, on September 5, 1997, his medical condition deteriorated. Copas died on September 10,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">{\u00b6 16} Dr. Keith Norton, a Franklin County forensic pathologist and deputy coroner, concluded that Copas had suffered extensive brain injuries extending into the cerebellum. These injuries included bleeding surrounding the underside of the brain, swelling of the brain, insufficient blood flow to the brain\u2019s nerve cells, and \u201cbacterial colonies in the basilar meninges.\u201d Dr. Norton stated that \u201cthe penetrating injury to the head\u201d caused by the paintbrush was the cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">{\u00b6 17} At trial, the prosecution introduced appellant\u2019s letter to Dennis Borowski, an inmate at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility (\u201cSOCF\u201d). In the letter, dated January 10, 1998, appellant stated, \u201cWell, it\u2019s like this Dennis, I caught a murder #1 case on my cellie at Lebanon. He was a maggot baby-raper-killer I found out, and those idiots of the administration there wouldn\u2019t move him the hell out of my cell, so I took him out of his misery. I made him suffer pretty good too, because first of all, I stabbed one of his eyeballs up out of its socket, and then I beat all on his stupid-ass-head off-and-on for two (2) hours (4:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.) in the morning until count time when they came and got us both up out of the cell. \u2014He lived for twenty-and-a-half <em>(20%) </em>hours after that before he croaked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">{\u00b6 18} Bryan Freeze, an inmate at LCI in August 1997, was appellant\u2019s cellmate before Copas. Three or four days after the August 22 incident, Freeze and appellant were in the segregation unit at the prison. Freeze asked appellant about the attack. In response, appellant admitted stabbing Copas in the eye and said, \u201cI tried to bash the mother fucker\u2019s brains in.\u201d Freeze asked appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>\u201cwhy he had done it,\u201d and appellant said, that Copas \u201chad turned his TV off on him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">{\u00b6 19} Barnard Williams, a state investigator, talked to Copas at the Middle-town Regional Hospital on August 22, 1997. Copas said that prior to the attack, he had put on head phones and had put a white T-shirt over his eyes so that he could sleep better. He then \u201claid there for a couple of hours and was sleeping.\u201d Then, Copas said, \u201cI felt something hit my head, by my mouth area. I looked up, but I don\u2019t know what [happened]. I saw [appellant\u2019s] hand covered with a gauze, with a pencil like shank in it. He hit me with it and I sat up trying to protect myself.\u201d Thereafter, appellant hit him with the lock in the sock. After he had been hit four or five times, Copas said, \u201cI tried to plead with him but he kept hitting me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">{\u00b6 20} Dr. Bruce Janiak, an emergency physician, testified by videotaped deposition that Copas should have received a CAT scan of his head during medical treatment on August 22, 1997. Dr. Janiak reached that opinion \u201cbecause it\u2019s well-known in the literature that in instances which I described, i.e., the head injury with questionable loss of consciousness and in addition the vomiting, that that would be an indication for a head CAT scan, and that\u2019s the standard, * * * so I think it should have been.\u201d Furthermore, Dr. Janiak stated, \u201cI can say with 100 percent certainty that had a CAT scan been done, you would have seen the piece of wood and known that there was a foreign body.\u201d Finally, Dr. Janiak testified that earlier removal of the wooden shaft from inside Copas\u2019s head would have reduced the possibility of infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">{\u00b6 21} Dr. Paul Schwetschenau, a neurosurgeon, agreed with the coroner\u2019s findings that Copas had died of a brain infarction from a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage. He surmised that the hemorrhage was caused by \u201ctrauma to the blood vessels or bacterial weakening of the wall of the blood vessels.\u201d In Dr. Schwetschenau\u2019s opinion, a CAT scan would have \u201crevealed the presence of a wooden object in Mr. Copas\u2019s brain,\u201d and its \u201cearlier detection and removal would have significantly improved the chances of reducing the bacterial contamination and the bacterial growth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">{\u00b6 22} Dr. Schwetschenau also reviewed Copas\u2019s frontal X-ray of August 22 and identified \u201ctwo very distinct parallel lines that are not natural and do not belong in anybody\u2019s skull.\u201d Dr. Schwetschenau testified, \u201cI believe that this is the outline or the size of a straight or cylindrical object.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">{\u00b6 23} The grand jury indicted appellant for aggravated murder with prior calculation and design with two death penalty specifications. The specifications were for murder committed in a detention facility pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(4), and for conviction of a prior purposeful killing pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>{\u00b6 24} Appellant was also indicted with a third specification for being a repeat violent offender as defined in R.C. 2929.01. In a second count, he was indicted for possession of a deadly weapon under detention and charged with an accompanying specification for being a repeat violent offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">{\u00b6 25} The jury found appellant guilty of Count One and the R.C. 2929.04(A)(4) specification. Upon appellant\u2019s election, the trial judge separately found appellant guilty of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) specification and the repeat violent offender specification. Count Two and the accompanying specification were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">{\u00b6 26} The jury recommended death for Copas\u2019s murder. The trial court sentenced appellant to death for Copas\u2019s murder and eight years for the repeat violent offender specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">II. Trial Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AAn\">A. Warden\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">{\u00b6 27} In his first proposition of law, appellant claims that the trial court erred by refusing to allow LCI Warden Harry Russell\u2019s testimony about shanks or weapons confiscated at the prison and the charges filed against inmates for possessing such weapons. Appellant asserts that this information would show that prisoners\u2019 possession of weapons is common and does not indicate intent to kill. In support, at trial, appellant proffered an exhibit \u201cconcerning the number of shanks and other weapons at LCI that have been confiscated\u201d and \u201ccharges that were filed in relation to possession and use of those items.\u201d The trial court rejected the warden\u2019s testimony, finding that it was not relevant and that its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">{\u00b6 28} The admission of Warden Russell\u2019s testimony rested upon a question of relevancy. Evid.R. 401 provides, \u201c \u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d The admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. See <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 180, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">{\u00b6 29} Evid.R. 403(A) provides: \u201cAlthough relevant, evidence is not admissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d When considering evidence under Evid.R. 403, the trial court is vested with broad discretion, and an appellate court should not interfere absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Allen </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 626, 633, 653 N.E.2d 675, citing <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 257-258, 513 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>{\u00b6 30} The trial court could legitimately conclude that the warden\u2019s testimony focused on side issues (e.g., prison administration, inmate discipline, and inmate violence) substantially unrelated and prejudicial to a fair resolution of the issues in this case. Thus, we find no abuse of discretion in excluding Warden Russell\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">{\u00b6 31} Finally, appellant argues that the jury should have been allowed to consider the warden\u2019s testimony as part of the nature and circumstances of the offense during sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">{\u00b6 32} The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution addresses criminal sentencing. It \u201callows a capital defendant to introduce \u2018any aspect of [his] character or record and <em>any of the circumstances of the offense </em>that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 266, 750 N.E.2d 90, quoting <em>Lockett v. Ohio </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973. R.C. 2929.04(B) also requires the sentencer to consider \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d The warden\u2019s testimony regarding the number of shanks present, the number confiscated, and the general use of shanks within LCI was not related to the circumstances of appellant\u2019s offense. Such evidence did not provide relevant mitigation. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s first proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">B. Jury View</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">{\u00b6 33} In his third proposition of law, appellant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his request for a jury view. Appellant claims a jury view was necessary to show the jurors \u201cthe size and shape of the cell, the lighting conditions in the cell, and the positioning of Peter Copas at the time of the assault\u201d so that the jury could see \u201chow difficult it would be for James Hanna to intentionally stab Peter Copas in the eye.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">{\u00b6 34} R.C. 2945.16 provides, \u201cWhen it is proper for the jurors to have a view of the place at which a material fact occurred, the trial court may order them to be conducted * * * to such place * * Moreover, \u201cthe trial court is vested with a broad discretion in such matters, and its judgment will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Zuern </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 56, 58, 512 N.E.2d 585 (denying jury view of confinement cell). See, also, <em>Sanders, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 265, 750 N.E.2d 90 (denying jury view of prison).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">{\u00b6 35} The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion for a jury view because of \u201cthe inherent problems of security and possible prejudice to the case via other inmates.\u201d Moreover, the trial court held that \u201cthe dimensions and all aspects of the cell can be fully presented to the jury with the aid of diagrams and photographs and without them being physically present.\u201d Thus, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>{\u00b636} Although he claims that the state\u2019s photographs were insufficient, appellant failed to present any diagrams of his cell during the trial. Appellant also fails to demonstrate that diagrams and photographs of the cell were inadequate to provide the jury with a full understanding of conditions in his cell. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s third proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">C. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">{\u00b6 37} In his sixth proposition of law, appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence showing appellant\u2019s prior calculation and design. He claims that his use of weapons (e.g., a shank and a lock in a sock), the location of stab wounds in a nonvital organ, and Copas\u2019s medical care showed that he intended only to injure Copas and not to kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">{\u00b6 38} In reviewing a record for sufficiency, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560. \u201c[T]he weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts.\u201d <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">{\u00b6 39} As to prior calculation and design, no \u201cbright-line test\u201d exists that \u201cemphatically distinguishes between the presence or absence of \u2018prior calculation and design.\u2019 Instead, each case turns on the particular facts and evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 15, 20, 676 N.E.2d 82. In <em>State v. Cotton </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 8, 10 O.O.3d 4, 381 N.E.2d 190, paragraph three of the syllabus, this court held that \u201c[w]here evidence adduced at trial reveals the presence of sufficient time and opportunity for the planning of an act of homicide to constitute prior calculation, and the circumstances surrounding the homicide show a scheme designed to implement the calculated decision to kill, a finding by the trier of fact of prior calculation and design is justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">{\u00b6 40} Appellant\u2019s intent to kill Copas was clearly proved. Not only did appellant express hostility towards Copas over a four-day period prior to the attack, but he also fashioned a paintbrush into a murder weapon an hour or so before the attack. Appellant then thrust the shank into Copas\u2019s eye when he was most vulnerable, while asleep. Moreover, appellant told investigators that he wanted the shank to \u201cgo further in than what it did, but it broke off.\u201d In his letter to another inmate, appellant boasted that he \u201cstabbed one of [the victim\u2019s] eyeballs,\u201d and beat \u201con his stupid-ass-head\u201d for two hours. Thus, there was compelling evidence that appellant purposely murdered Copas with prior calculation and design.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>{\u00b6 41} Appellant also claims that the prevalence of shanks in prison and their use in nonlethal altercations showed that he had never intended to kill Copas. However, appellant\u2019s action in planning and carrying out the attack and not his choice of weapon (i.e., a shank) showed that he intended to murder Copas and did so with prior calculation and design. In <em>Zuern </em>32 Ohio St.3d at 62, 512 N.E.2d 585, a prison inmate stabbed a corrections officer with a shank. The prisoner fashioned the shank into the \u201cdesired shape\u201d and \u201csharpened it to a very fine edge\u201d prior to the murder. Under these facts, <em>Zuem </em>held that the defendant\u2019s actions showed that he had acted with prior calculation and design. Similarly, appellant\u2019s actions leading up to the murder demonstrated his prior calculation and design.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">{\u00b6 42} Further, appellant argues that he stabbed Copas in a nonvital organ (i.e., the eye), and this showed that he never intended to kill him. In reality, appellant stabbed Copas in one of the most vital areas of the body by thrusting the shank through the soft tissue area of Copas\u2019s eye and into his cerebellum. Cf. <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 81-82, 656 N.E.2d 643 (intent to kill shown by defendant\u2019s blows to the victim\u2019s \u201chead, certainly a vital area\u201d). Moreover, appellant admitted that he \u201cwanted [the shank] to go further in than what it did, but it broke off.\u201d Thus, we also reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">{\u00b6 43} Finally, appellant claims that he could not have known that he had inflicted a fatal wound on Copas, since two doctors failed to recognize the seriousness of Copas\u2019s injuries when he was taken to the emergency room. This argument ignores a significant fact. Appellant knew that a long segment of the shank was lodged deep inside Copas\u2019s head, whereas the physicians did not know that fact. Thus, appellant\u2019s intent had nothing to do with the doctors\u2019 awareness of Copas\u2019s injuries. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s sixth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">D. Guilt Phase Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">{\u00b6 44} In his second proposition of law, appellant argues that the trial court erred in rejecting his proposed instruction on medical malpractice as an independent cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">{\u00b6 45} Generally, \u201cone who inflicts injury upon another is criminally responsible for that person\u2019s death, regardless of whether different or more skillful medical treatment may have saved his life.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 35, 40, 10 O.O.3d 78, 381 N.E.2d 637. Moreover, \u201cmedical treatment for homicide victims is not an intervening cause.\u201d <em>State v. Carter </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 218, 226, 594 N.E.2d 595. \u201cOnly gross negligence or willful maltreatment will relieve the defendant from liability. Simple negligence is not enough.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State v. Beaver </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 385, 394, 695 N.E.2d 332. See, also, Annotation, Homicide: Liability Where Death Immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Results from Treatment or Mistreatment of Injury Inflicted by Defendant (1997), 50 A.L.R.5th 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">{\u00b6 46} Appellant proposed the following jury instruction on intervening cause, relying on <em>Johnson, </em>56 Ohio St.2d at 40, 10 O.O.3d 78, 381 N.E.2d 637: \u201c[O]ne who inflicts injury upon another is criminally responsible for that person\u2019s death, regardless of whether different or more skillful medical treatment may have saved his life. \u2022 This rule has been qualified where there has been a gross or willful maltreatment of the patient by the medical personnel which is shown to have been an independent intervening cause of the patient\u2019s death.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">{\u00b6 47} The trial court refused to give the proffered instruction. The court stated that the issue was \u201csufficiently covered\u201d and found the proposed instruction to be \u201cduplicative at best and confusing at worst.\u201d Rather, the trial court provided jury instructions on intervening cause and independent intervening cause based on 4 Ohio Jury Instructions (\u201cOJI\u201d), Section 409.56, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cIntervening causes. The defendant is responsible for the natural consequences of the defendant\u2019s unlawful act, even though death was also caused by the intervening act of another person or agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cIndependent intervening cause of death. If the defendant inflicted an injury not likely to produce death, and if the sole and only cause of death was something else or someone else, the defendant who inflicted the original injury is not responsible for the death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">{\u00b6 50} Appellant was not entitled to his instruction on independent intervening cause. First, the trial court provided adequate instructions from OJI on intervening cause and independent intervening cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">{\u00b6 51} Second, there was no evidence that Copas was the victim of gross or willful maltreatment. There were no clinical symptoms of neurological damage when Dr. Talkers treated Copas. The patient was wide awake and talking, and Copas was observed in the emergency room and never lost consciousness. Based upon these observations and the history provided to him by Copas, Dr. Talkers concluded that a CAT scan was not warranted. Even though defense experts testified that Dr. Talkers breached the standard of care by not ordering a CAT scan, the evidence at most is conflicting on this point and would\u2019 not support a finding of gross negligence or willful maltreatment. Cf. <em>Cook v. Foltz </em>(C.A.6, 1987), 814 F.2d 1109, 1113 (not entitled to instruction on grossly erroneous medical treatment where the record did not support such a claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">{\u00b6 52} Finally, the coroner\u2019s testimony established that appellant\u2019s attack was the cause of Copas\u2019s death. According to Dr. Norton, the deputy coroner, \u201cthe penetrating injury to the head, the instrument going in is what caused death.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Indeed, Dr. Janiak, the defense expert, concurred in the coroner\u2019s findings. He stated that, \u201cclearly the foreign body was responsible for multiple problems that ensued\u201d with the victim. Therefore, we find that the trial court did not err by rejecting appellant\u2019s proposed jury instruction. We reject appellant\u2019s second proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">{\u00b6 53} In his seventh proposition of law, appellant contends that the instructions defining causation in terms of foreseeability undermined the burden of proof on the mens rea element of the aggravated murder charge. See <em>State v. Burchfield </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 261, 263, 611 N.E.2d 819. Appellant objects to the following jury instruction: \u201cThe defendant\u2019s responsibility is not limited to the immediate or most obvious result of the defendant\u2019s act. The defendant is also responsible for the natural and foreseeable results that follow, in the ordinary course of events, from the act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b6 54} We have recognized that the use of the foreseeability instruction in aggravated murder cases is questionable. See <em>Burchfield, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 263, 611 N.E.2d 819; <em>State v. Goodwin </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 331, 346, 703 N.E.2d 1251. However, \u201c[t]he use of that instruction * * * does not require reversal where the instructions as a whole make clear that the jury must find purpose to kill in order to convict.\u201d <em>State v. Phillips, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 100, 656 N.E.2d 643. Accord <em>State v. Frazier </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 323, 331, 652 N.E.2d 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">{\u00b6 55} In the case sub judice, the trial court provided the jury with extensive instructions' on the state\u2019s burden of proof and the requirement to prove purpose to kill both before and after the foreseeability instruction was given to the jury. Thus, the instructions as a whole made clear that the jury was required to find purpose to kill in order to convict. See <em>Phillips, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 100, 656 N.E.2d 643. We find no prejudicial error and reject appellant\u2019s seventh proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">{\u00b6 56} In his fourteenth proposition of law, appellant challenges the instructions on reasonable doubt during both the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial. However, appellant failed to object to these instructions at trial and waived all but plain error. Crim.R. 30(A); <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. Moreover, appellant\u2019s complaints about the statutory definition of \u201creasonable doubt\u201d lack merit. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 347, 744 N.E.2d 1163; <em>State v. Hessler </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 108, 115, 734 N.E.2d 1237; <em>State v. Van Gundy </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 230, 594 N.E.2d 604. See, also, <em>State v. Goff (1998), </em>82 Ohio St.3d 123, 132, 694 N.E.2d 916; <em>State v. Taylor, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 29, 676 N.E.2d 82. We reject appellant\u2019s fourteenth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">E. Sealing the Prosecutor\u2019s File</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">{\u00b6 57} In his eighth proposition of law, appellant argues that the trial court erred by failing to order the prosecution to seal its file upon discovering that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>prosecution had failed to disclose exculpatory information. Appellant filed a pretrial motion requesting that a complete copy of the prosecutor\u2019s file be made, reviewed by the trial court, and sealed for appellate review. The trial court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">{\u00b6 58} As Trooper James Ertel reviewed his investigative report to refresh his recollection, it appeared that the report disclosed possible exculpatory information. The trial court ordered the prosecution to provide this information to the defense, which it did. The defense made no further motions to seal the prosecutor\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">{\u00b6 59} According to appellant, the trial court was alerted to the possibility that the prosecutor\u2019s file might contain other <em>Brady </em>material after Ertel\u2019s report was disclosed. See <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. Thus, appellant argues that the trial court had a sua sponte obligation to review and seal the prosecutor\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">{\u00b6 60} The trial court was not required to examine the prosecutor\u2019s file to determine the prosecutor\u2019s truthfulness or seal the prosecutor\u2019s file for purposes of appellate review. Cf. <em>State v. Chinn </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 548, 569, 709 N.E.2d 1166; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 153, 172, 652 N.E.2d 721. The prosecutor was fully aware of his continuing obligation to divulge exculpatory evidence. Appellant\u2019s claim that the prosecution may have withheld other exculpatory evidence from the defense is purely speculative. The record discloses no such evidence, and we reject appellant\u2019s eighth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">F. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">{\u00b6 61} In his ninth proposition of law, appellant contends that he was denied a fair trial due to prosecutorial misconduct during the guilt phase. \u201cThe test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the accused.\u201d <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 420, 739 N.E.2d 300, citing <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. However, the touchstone of analysis \u201cis the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">1. Denigrating Reasonable Doubt</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">{\u00b6 62} Appellant complains that the prosecutor denigrated the reasonable doubt standard during voir dire when he compared crossing a bridge to making decisions about the most important daily affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">{\u00b6 63} A prospective juror, an engineer, stated that as \u201can engineer, you want facts, everything to be backed up with facts.\u201d While discussing the concept of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>reasonable doubt, the prosecutor asked this prospective juror the following series of questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cQ: Have you ever driven down 75 over the river to Kentucky, over * * * the Brent Spence bridge?</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cA: Uh-huh.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cQ: Okay. And you had your family with you?</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cA: Uh-huh.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cQ: I\u2019ll ask you this because you\u2019re the engineer. Did you ever stop before you got to the bridge and get out and check the bridge to make sure it was safe before you crossed?</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cA: (Juror moves head from side to side.)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\"><em>((% </em>* * {\u00b6 70}</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">mi} \u201cQ: But you crossed the bridge, didn\u2019t you?</p>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cA: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"AEl\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cQ: That was an important affair, was it not?</p>\n<p id=\"AfK\">{\u00b6 74} <em>\u201cA: </em>Uh-huh.</p>\n<p id=\"Aej\">{\u00b675} \u201cQ: So you understand we talk about important affairs, we do important things every day. And I\u2019m asking you not to do any more than you do every day in your important affairs in deciding this case; can you do that?</p>\n<p id=\"b459-19\">'{\u00b6 76} \u201cA: Uh-huh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-20\">{\u00b6 77} The defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s questions and thus waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Wade </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 182, 7 O.O.3d 362, 373 N.E.2d 1244, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-21\">{\u00b6 78} Moreover, the defense counsel used the prosecutor\u2019s bridge analogy to appellant\u2019s advantage during subsequent voir dire and opening statement. In his opening statement, defense counsel stated, \u201cIn jury questioning, the prosecutor Mr. Beaton talked to you a little bit about a bridge in Cincinnati and how you don\u2019t stop and look under the bridge before you drive over it and you assume it\u2019s okay. * * * I know some of you are old enough to remember the Silver Bridge collapse over the Ohio River and, in fact, that happened. * * * What I\u2019m asking you to do in this case is listen to all the evidence. You make the prosecutor take you under the bridge and show you the underpinnings and show you it\u2019s clear. And if he cannot do that, he hasn\u2019t proven his case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-22\">{\u00b6 79} While the prosecutor\u2019s comments were perhaps inappropriate, we do not find that the comments denigrated the reasonable doubt standard. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s \u201creasonable-doubt instructions negated any misconception by the jury.\u201d <em>State v. Lundgren </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 484, 653 N.E.2d 304. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>In any event, appellant shows no prejudice. Appellant turned the tables on the state by effectively using the bridge analogy in presenting his own defense. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">2. Peremptory Challenge of \u201cDeath Hesitant\u201d Jurors</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">{\u00b6 80} Appellant also argues that the prosecutor improperly exercised his peremptory challenges to exclude three jurors who had expressed reluctance to impose the death penalty. However, \u201c \u2018apart from excluding jurors based on race or gender, \u201cprosecutors can exercise a peremptory challenge for any reason, without inquiry, and without a court\u2019s control.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Biros </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 426, 443, 678 N.E.2d 891, quoting <em>State v. Ballew </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 244, 253, 667 N.E.2d 369. Thus, we reject this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">3. Failure to Comply with Discovery Requests</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">{\u00b6 81} Appellant argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by failing to- provide the defense with exculpatory information from Ertel\u2019s investigative report until ordered to do so at trial, in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. Information provided to the defense from Ertel\u2019s report included Officer Hagar\u2019s statement that Copas was unconscious after the attack, statements that Copas was intoxicated at the time of the attack, and interviews of inmates from appellant\u2019s cellblock reporting what they heard on the night of the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">{\u00b6 82} Despite appellant\u2019s claims, the state did not violate <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>by withholding exculpatory evidence. Ertel\u2019s report was presented <em>during </em>the trial (and not after the trial as in <em>Brady), </em>and no <em>Brady </em>violation exists. See <em>State v. Green </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 352, 372, 738 N.E.2d 1208; <em>State v. Wickline </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 114, 116, 552 N.E.2d 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">4. Improper Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">{\u00b6 83} Appellant claims that the prosecutor committed misconduct during his closing argument by suggesting that murder one was the same as prior calculation and design. Appellant attacks the following segment of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument: \u201c* * * [T]elling Trooper Ertel and Scott Male what happened wasn\u2019t good enough. He had to tell somebody else what he had done. And he wrote a letter * * * to another inmate, * * * Dennis Borowski. That letter was written in January, 1998, about two weeks before the defendant was indicted for this charge, for this crime. And in that letter he used the term murder one case. I caught a murder one case on my celly in Lebanon. Murder one. Ladies and gentlemen, <em>I suggest, submit to you that\u2019s a term that most people recognize as synonymous with premeditated murder. </em>And he was telling somebody this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>before he\u2019d even been charged, before he even knew that he would be facing this.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">{\u00b6 84} However, appellant failed to object to this argument and thus waived all but plain error. See <em>State v. Wade, </em>53 Ohio St.2d 182, 7 O.O.3d 362, 373 N.E.2d 1244, paragraph one of the syllabus. No such error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">{\u00b6 85} \u201cProsecutors are entitled to some latitude in arguing what the evidence has shown and what the jury may infer from the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Tibbetts </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 169, 749 N.E.2d 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">{\u00b6 86} Moreover, contrary to appellant\u2019s claim, the prosecutor was not equating \u201cmurder one\u201d with \u201cprior calculation and design.\u201d Rather, the prosecutor used appellant\u2019s own words (i.e., from his letter to Borowski) to prove that he intended to murder Copas. Appellant\u2019s own words, as the prosecutor pointed out, contradicted appellant\u2019s defense that he intended only to injure Copas, not kill him. The prosecutor\u2019s argument represented fair comment on the evidence. <em>Tibbetts, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 168, 749 N.E.2d 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">{\u00b6 87} In summary, we find no prosecutorial misconduct during the guilt phase justifying reversal, and we reject appellant\u2019s ninth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">III. Penalty Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AR-\">A. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">{\u00b6 88} In his tenth proposition of law, appellant argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct during the penalty phase\u2019s closing arguments. The test for prosecutorial misconduct in closing arguments is \u201c \u2018whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Hessler, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 125, 734 N.E.2d 1237, quoting <em>State v. Smith, </em>14 Ohio St.3d at 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">{\u00b6 89} However, appellant failed to object to the portions of the prosecutor\u2019s argument that he complains about now. Thus, he waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Wade, </em>53 Ohio St.2d 182, 7 O.O.3d 362, 373 N.E.2d 1244, paragraph one of the syllabus. No plain error occurred. Moreover, as discussed below, none of the allegations of prosecutorial misconduct has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">1. Misleading the Jury About Life Imprisonment Without Parole</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">{\u00b6 90} Appellant claims that the prosecutor improperly argued that he would not be punished for his crime if he did not receive a death sentence. Appellant objects to the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument: \u201cNow, ladies and gentlemen, if you don\u2019t decide on the death penalty in this case, nothing really is going to change for the Defendant. He\u2019s still going to \u2014 things are going to go on as usual. He\u2019s got three meals a day, he\u2019s got a roof over his head. Granted, he\u2019s locked up in prison. But, so, he\u2019s been locked up in prison for a while. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>doesn\u2019t have any worries. Doesn\u2019t have to go to work. As I said, life\u2019s pretty much the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">{\u00b6 91} The prosecutor\u2019s argument was not improper, since it rebutted defense assertions that the severity of life in prison without parole was a mitigating factor. According to defense arguments, appellant would be sent to a maximum security prison, he would be kept away from other inmates, he could not leave his cell \u201cunless he\u2019s in the company of guards under high security,\u201d and \u201c[l]ike the death penalty, this life sentence is unchangeable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">{\u00b6 92} The \u201cstate may' * * * comment upon \u2018evidence rebutting the existence of any statutorily defined or other mitigating factors first asserted by the defendant,\u2019 \u201d and thus the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal was proper. <em>State v. Stojetz </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 452, 464, 705 N.E.2d 329, quoting <em>State v. Gumm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 421, 653 N.E.2d 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">2. Belittling Mitigation</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">{\u00b6 93} Appellant complains that the prosecutor improperly minimized the severity of his abuse as a child by labeling it acceptable parenting. Appellant points to the prosecutor\u2019s comments that \u201cit wasn\u2019t unusual back then [the 1950s] if you were bad that you\u2019d get swatted with a paddle on your rear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">{\u00b6 94} The prosecutor\u2019s comments simply responded to defense claims that a mitigating factor in appellant\u2019s case was the \u201chistory of a dysfunctional family, an aggressive mother, [and] inconsistent and hostile treatment.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s remarks did not belittle the abuse that appellant suffered. Rather, the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal placed the mother\u2019s actions in the context of her personal situation (i.e., the hardships of a single mother with six children at home) and suggested the acceptability of harsher forms of corporal punishment during the 1950s. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument represented fair comment. See <em>State v. Murphy </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 572, 605 N.E.2d 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">{\u00b6 95} Appellant also claims that the prosecutor belittled the long-term effects of appellant\u2019s impoverished background. Specifically, appellant complains about the following remarks: \u201cThey talk about this house \u2014 to play on your emotions, they talk about this house with no plumbing. Now, you might want to laugh, but Abe Lincoln didn\u2019t have any plumbing. If any of you have traveled in other parts of the world, other people live in conditions without electricity or without plumbing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">{\u00b6 96} The prosecutor\u2019s comparison to Lincoln was a way to point out that many people rise from impoverished backgrounds similar to appellant\u2019s. By so doing, the prosecutor was simply arguing that the jury should give appellant\u2019s background little weight in mitigation. See <em>State v. Richey </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 353, 370, 595 N.E.2d 915. \u201cProsecutors can urge the merits of their cause and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>legitimately argue that defense mitigation evidence is worthy of little or no weight.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 381, 399, 659 N.E.2d 292. Moreover, prosecutors are \u201cafforded wide latitude during closing argument\u201d and can be \u201ccolorful or creative.\u201d <em>State v. Brown </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 305, 317, 528 N.E.2d 523. The prosecutor\u2019s argument was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 97} Finally, appellant claims that the prosecutor erred by comparing him with his brothers and sisters. The prosecutor argued that while his brothers and sisters came from the same family environment, only appellant ended up in adult prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 98} The prosecutor could legitimately argue that appellant\u2019s brothers and sisters came from the same deprived background but did not kill anybody or end up in adult prison. See <em>Wilson, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 399, 659 N.E.2d 292; <em>Richey, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 370, 595 N.E.2d 915. Moreover, the record supported the prosecutor\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">{\u00b6 99} In summary, we find no prosecutorial misconduct during the penalty phase, and we reject appellant\u2019s tenth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">B. Sentencing Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">{\u00b6 100} In his twelfth proposition of law, appellant argues that his death sentence should be reversed because of flaws in the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">{\u00b6 101} First, appellant claims that the trial court improperly compared him with his siblings by stating that \u201c[n]one of his siblings [has] been involved in any felony crime,\u201d while he has been in prison for \u201cnearly twenty years.\u201d However, such comparison was not improper. See <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 343, 738 N.E.2d 1178; <em>State v. White </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 433, 450, 709 N.E.2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">{\u00b6 102} Second, appellant argues that the trial court improperly evaluated evidence of his various psychological and mental disorders. Appellant complains that the trial court incorrectly evaluated such evidence when finding that \u201c[t]he court fails to see any relationship * * * between the contended character and/or psychological defects advocated by the defendant and the actions in this case which would warrant a finding in mitigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">{\u00b6 103} This court has stated that \u201cthe assessment and weight to be given mitigating evidence are matters for the trial court\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>State v. Hill </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 433, 441, 653 N.E.2d 271, citing <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 171, 555 N.E.2d 293. Moreover, \u201c[t]he fact mitigation evidence is admissible \u2018does not automatically mean it must be given any weight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hill </em>at 441, 653 N.E.2d 271, quoting <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph two of the syllabus. The sentencing opinion fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>reviewed Dr. Kathleen Burch\u2019s testimony about appellant\u2019s character and psychological defects. The trial court could reasonably assign any or no weight to such evidence. Thus, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">{\u00b6 104} Third, appellant incorrectly asserts that the trial court failed to consider his offer to plead guilty. The trial court specifically mentioned that appellant \u201chad asked for the prosecution to allow him to plead guilty as charged and accept a sentence of life in prison without parole.\u201d However, the trial court gave \u201cno weight\u201d to appellant\u2019s offer to plead, since he was already serving a life sentence for aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder, and thus \u201chis offer to plea was conceding little regardless of the outcome of the trial.\u201d The trial court exercised permissible discretion in giving no weight to appellant\u2019s offer to plead. Cf. <em>State v. </em>Stumpf (1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 106, 512 N.E.2d 598 (guilty plea in face of a hopeless trial entitled to little weight as mitigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">{\u00b6 105} Appellant also contends that the trial court failed to consider evidence that he was sexually abused as a child. The trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion did not specifically mention appellant\u2019s child abuse. However, it is clear that the trial judge carefully considered Dr. Burch\u2019s testimony, since he discussed Dr. Burch\u2019s opinions about appellant\u2019s various psychological disorders. Thus, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 106} We find that the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion fully complied with the requirements of R.C. 2929.03 and R.C. 2929.04. For these reasons, we reject appellant\u2019s twelfth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">C. Proportionality</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">{\u00b6 107} In his fourth proposition of law, appellant argues that the death penalty is disproportionate when his case is compared to similar cases in which the death penalty has been imposed. We will consider appellant\u2019s argument in our independent review of his death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">D. Weighing and Determination of the Death Penalty</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">{\u00b6 108} In his fifth proposition of law, appellant argues that the death penalty must be vacated because the aggravating circumstances do not outweigh the mitigating factors. We will also consider this argument in our independent review of appellant\u2019s death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">IV. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">{\u00b6 109} In his eleventh proposition of law, appellant alleges multiple instances of ineffective assistance of counsel. Reversal of convictions for ineffective assistance of counsel requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cTo show that a defendant has been prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the defendant must prove that there exists a reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d Id., paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">A. Failure to Conduct Voir Dire about Pretrial Publicity</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 110} Appellant complains that his counsel failed to inquire adequately about pretrial publicity during voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 111} We have recognized that \u201c \u2018[t]he conduct of voir dire by defense counsel does not have to take a particular form, nor do specific questions have to be asked.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Cornwell </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 560, 568, 715 N.E.2d 1144, quoting <em>State v. Evans </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 247, 586 N.E.2d 1042. Moreover, \u201ccounsel is in the best position to determine whether any potential juror should be questioned and to what extent.\u201d <em>State v. Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 539, 747 N.E.2d 765; see, also, <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 143-144, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">{\u00b6 112} The trial counsel filed a pretrial motion to conduct sequestered voir dire on pretrial publicity, and this motion was granted. During voir dire, the trial court asked the first panel of jurors about pretrial publicity, and one prospective juror indicated that she had read a newspaper account about the event. However, the trial counsel did not ask any questions about pretrial publicity during voir dire examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">{\u00b6 113} The trial counsel retained flexibility to forgo voir dire on pretrial publicity once the trial had started, and the defense counsel were not locked into this line of questioning solely because of their pretrial motion. We find that counsel were not ineffective, since their action falls \u201cwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Moreover, there is no evidence that pretrial publicity affected appellant\u2019s case, and any prejudicial impact is purely speculative. Therefore, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">B. Failure to Object to the Prosecutor\u2019s Denigration of Reasonable Doubt</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">{\u00b6 114} Appellant argues that his counsel were ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s use of a bridge analogy to explain reasonable doubt to the jury and further erred by using the analogy during the defense opening statement. We previously found that the prosecutor committed no misconduct in using the bridge analogy at trial. Moreover, appellant\u2019s counsel effectively used the prosecutor\u2019s bridge analogy to defense advantage during their opening statement. Under these circumstances, we find that appellant\u2019s attorneys made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>legitimate tactical decision and were not ineffective. See <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 144, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">C. Failure to Again Move to Seal the Prosecutor\u2019s File</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">{\u00b6 115} Appellant also asserts that his counsel were ineffective by failing to again move to seal the prosecutor\u2019s file. We held in regard to appellant\u2019s eighth proposition of law that the trial court committed no error by refusing to seal the prosecutor\u2019s file. Moreover, appellant\u2019s claim that the prosecution withheld other exculpatory evidence is purely speculative. Thus, this claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">D. Failure to Recall Witnesses or Request a Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">{\u00b6 116} Appellant argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to recall witnesses or request a mistrial after learning that the prosecution withheld evidence about Copas\u2019s unconsciousness. During Ertel\u2019s testimony, the defense learned that Officer Hagar\u2019s statement.showed that Copas was unconscious after the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">{\u00b6 117} Appellant claims that his counsel should have recalled Copas\u2019s physicians and confronted them with Hagar\u2019s statement. Appellant asserts that his counsel could have used evidence of Copas\u2019s unconsciousness to show that the doctors\u2019 failure to order an immediate CAT scan was gross medical malpractice. Appellant also asserts that trial counsel could have used Hagar\u2019s statement to \u201ccreate the inference that the physicians were lying about their lack of knowledge of Copas\u2019s unconsciousness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">{\u00b6 118} However, \u201ccounsel\u2019s decision whether to call a witness falls within the rubric of trial strategy and will not be second-guessed by a reviewing court.\u201d <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 490, 739 N.E.2d 749; see, also, <em>State v. Jackson </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 436, 447, 751 N.E.2d 946. No evidence exists that Hagar informed Dr. Talkers or other treating physicians of Copas\u2019s unconsciousness, and thus this information played no role in Copas\u2019s medical treatment. Counsel could legitimately decide not to recall physicians to reiterate that they were unaware of Copas\u2019s unconsciousness. Furthermore, it was also unlikely that trial counsel could have used Hagar\u2019s statement to show that Copas\u2019s physicians were untruthful. Thus, we also reject this ineffectiveness claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">E. Failure to Develop Inconsistencies During Cross-examination</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">{\u00b6 119} Appellant argues that his counsel were ineffective in their cross-examination of Dr. Katz and Dr. McWeeney, the state\u2019s medical experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">{\u00b6 120} This court has recognized that \u201c \u2018[t]rial counsel need not cross-examine every witness * * *. The strategic decision not to cross-examine witnesses is firmly committed to trial counsel\u2019s judgment * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>Campbell, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 339, 738 N.E.2d 1178, quoting <em>State v. Otte </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 555, 565, 660 N.E.2d 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 121} First, appellant argues that his counsel were ineffective for failing to bring out inconsistencies in Dr. Katz\u2019s testimony about Copas\u2019s numbness. On direct examination, Dr. Katz testified that \u201ctingling and numbness in his * * * face\u201d were two of several medical findings that led him to request a CAT scan. Subsequently, however, Dr. Katz mentioned that the absence of any \u201cweakness or tingling or numbness in [Copas\u2019s] body\u201d was a reason why the \u201caverage ophthalmologist\u201d or \u201caverage emergency room physician\u201d might not have ordered a CAT scan.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">{\u00b6 122} Appellant does not explain how his attorneys\u2019 failure to highlight Dr. Katz\u2019s inconsistencies made a difference in the outcome of his case. According to Dr. Katz, the absence of numbness was only one of several factors that might explain why an average emergency room doctor did not order a CAT scan. If challenged, Dr. Katz likely would have corrected his misstatement about numbness and clarified his testimony. However, it is unclear whether Dr. Katz\u2019s clarification would have worked in appellant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">{\u00b6 123} Thus, counsel could decide to forgo further cross-examination to avoid the danger of reinforcing the state\u2019s evidence (i.e., numbness as only one factor) and clarifying expert testimony that might not come out in appellant\u2019s favor (i.e., numbness as a subtlety that might be overlooked). Moreover, the jurors heard Dr. Katz\u2019s testimony, and they could evaluate his inconsistencies during their deliberations. We find that appellant\u2019s attorneys made a legitimate \u201ctactical decision\u201d and were not ineffective. <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 144, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">{\u00b6 124} Second, appellant contends that his counsel were ineffective by failing to cross-examine Dr. McWeeney on the implications of Copas\u2019s numbness. Dr. McWeeney testified that Copas told him on August 23 that \u201che felt his face was numb at times.\u201d Thus, appellant argues that his counsel should have challenged Dr. McWeeney\u2019s failure to order a CAT scan in view of Dr. Katz\u2019s testimony about numbness of the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">{\u00b6 125} Appellant has not demonstrated how further cross-examination of Dr. McWeeney would have made a difference in his case. In fact, Dr. McWeeney testified that he ordered a CAT scan of Copas\u2019s head because of his \u201ctraumatic facial injuries.\u201d Counsel made a legitimate \u201ctactical decision\u201d on the scope of cross-examination, and we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">F. Failure to Call Witness on Conditions of Confinement</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">{\u00b6 126} Appellant complains about his attorneys\u2019 failure to present adequate evidence about confinement for life without the possibility of parole or conditions of confinement at the Ohio State penitentiary in Youngstown.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>{\u00b6 127} During mitigation, Trooper Ertel testified about conditions at the maximum security prison at Youngstown based on his one visit to the prison. Ertel said that inmates were housed individually and confined to their cells for up to twenty-three hours a day. During appellant\u2019s unsworn statement, he told jurors, \u201cIf I get a life sentence, I will go to a super maximum prison where I will stay isolated from others except contact with guards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">{\u00b6 128} Appellant claims that counsel were ineffective for failing to subpoena \u201csomeone from Youngstown or the Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections\u201d to testify about conditions of confinement. According to appellant, the jurors were interested in confinement conditions, since during sentence deliberations, they had asked the trial court, \u201cIf given a life sentence, how is it assured it will be served in a maximum security prison?\u201d and \u201cHow will we be assured he will be in his cell 23 hours a day?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 129} However, \u201c[t]he decision to forgo the presentation of additional mitigating evidence does not itself constitute proof of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Keith </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 514, 536, 684 N.E.2d 47. The defense attorneys were not ineffective in relying on Ertel\u2019s testimony about the realities of prison life were appellant sentenced to life without parole. Moreover, \u201c \u2018[attorneys need not pursue every conceivable avenue; they are entitled to be \u2018selective.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 542, 747 N.E.2d 765, quoting <em>United States v. Davenport </em>(C.A.7, 1993), 986 F.2d 1047, 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">{\u00b6 130} Testimony about prison conditions was of questionable relevance, since evidence about future conditions of confinement involves speculation as to what future officials in the penal system will or will not do. Such evidence did not relate to appellant, his background or the nature and circumstances of the crime and therefore is not mitigating. See <em>State v. White, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 448, 709 N.E.2d 140; see, also, <em>People v. Thompson </em>(1988), 45 Cal.3d 86, 139, 246 Cal.Rptr. 245, 753 P.2d 37; <em>People v. Coddington </em>(2000), 23 Cal.4th 529, 636, 97 Cal.Rptr.2d 528, 2 P.3d 1081 (conditions of confinement irrelevant to a capital sentencing scheme); <em>Schmitt v. Commonwealth </em>(2001), 262 Va. 127, 146, 547 S.E.2d 186 (evidence of prison life and security features of a maximum security prison not admissible); but, c.f., <em>State v. Rhines </em>(1996), 1996 S.D. 55, 175, 548 N.W.2d 415 (prison life relevant when weighing alternatives of life imprisonment and the death penalty). Thus, this claim of ineffectiveness has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">G. Failure to Present Adequate Evidence of Child Abuse</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">{\u00b6 131} Appellant also complains about his attorneys\u2019 failure to present evidence about his child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>{\u00b6 132} Patricia Cutcher, appellant\u2019s sister, testified that their mother was a harsh disciplinarian and mentioned that appellant was sexually abused as a child, although she did not elaborate.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">{\u00b6 133} Similarly, Dr. Burch testified that appellant\u2019s mother was a very abusive parent. Dr. Burch also testified that appellant\u2019s relationship with his mother was ambivalent, and it seemed that he was \u201cpampered, but also abused later on.\u201d Further, Dr. Burch mentioned \u201can allegation by one of the sisters that in one of the foster placements she believed that there may have been some sexual abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">{\u00b6 134} Considerable evidence was introduced about parental abuse and neglect for the jury\u2019s consideration. The record does not support appellant\u2019s speculation that his counsel failed to present other available evidence to the jury about the conditions of his upbringing. Indeed, appellant did not mention any abuse during his unsworn statement. Thus, \u201c \u2018[i]t may be * * * that counsel conducted a diligent investigation, but [were] unable to find [more] substantial mitigation evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Otte, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 566, 660 N.E.2d 711, quoting <em>State v. Hutton </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 36, 42, 559 N.E.2d 432. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">H. Failure to Explain the Significance of Appellant\u2019s Records</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">{\u00b6 135} Appellant argues that his counsel failed to adequately explain the significance of Lucas County Children Services records regarding one of his sister\u2019s problems with appellant\u2019s mother in 1972 and appellant\u2019s juvenile records from the early 1960s.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">{\u00b6 136} Appellant contends that his counsel \u201cmerely handed over these records to the jury\u201d and asked them to read through them without providing the jury with any guidance concerning their significance as mitigation. This is incorrect. Dr. Burch\u2019s extensive testimony about appellant\u2019s childhood in a poor and abusive household referenced information contained in appellant\u2019s juvenile and family records. Moreover, these records were not voluminous, and the jurors could readily review this information during their deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">{\u00b6 137} We find that counsel made a legitimate \u201ctactical\u201d choice in introducing appellant\u2019s juvenile and family records without highlighting specific items of information for the jury\u2019s consideration. See <em>State v. Jones, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 356, 744 N.E.2d 1163. Appellant\u2019s attorneys were not deficient, and we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">I. Failure to Object to Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"AzU\">{\u00b6 138} Appellant recasts his objections to prosecutorial misconduct into claims of ineffective assistance of counsel without showing deficient performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>or how reasonably probable that, but for his attorneys\u2019 errors, the result of the trial would be different. <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus. However, <em>\u201c </em>\u2018[t]he failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Fears </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 347, 715 N.E.2d 136, quoting <em>State v. Holloway </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831; see, also, <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 300, 754 N.E.2d 1150. Since appellant does not show that any particular failure to object substantially violated any essential duty or was otherwise prejudicial, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">J. Failure to Object to Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">{\u00b6 139} Appellant also complains that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object to two of the trial court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">{\u00b6 140} First, appellant argues that his counsel should have objected to the trial court\u2019s instructions on reasonable doubt. Earlier in this opinion, we found no error in the court\u2019s instructions on reasonable doubt. Thus, appellant\u2019s attorneys were not ineffective, and this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">{\u00b6 141} Second, appellant claims that counsel erred by failing to object to the following instructions about his unsworn statement:' \u201cNow, Mr. Hanna will take the stand in the mitigation presentation, but will not testify under oath and, therefore, cross examination is not permitted. It is his right under Ohio law to do so and the exercising of that right may not be considered by you to impair in any way the value of what he tells you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">{\u00b6 142}, The trial court\u2019s instructions on unsworn statements did not prejudice appellant. See <em>State v. Grant </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 465, 478, 620 N.E.2d 50; see, also, <em>State v. Davis </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 107, 120, 666 N.E.2d 1099; <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 528 N.E.2d 542, paragraph two of the syllabus. Thus, appellant\u2019s attorneys were not deficient by failing to object, and we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">{\u00b6 143} In summary, since none of appellant\u2019s claims establishes ineffective assistance of counsel, we find that his eleventh proposition lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">V. Constitutional Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">{\u00b6 144} In his fifteenth proposition of law, appellant disputes the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death penalty statute. We reject these claims and so reject appellant\u2019s fifteenth proposition. See <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 607, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v. Clemons </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 454, 696 N.E.2d 1009; <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 179, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"AvM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>VI. Cumulative Error</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">{\u00b6 145} In his thirteenth proposition of law, appellant argues that the cumulative effect of errors in this case necessitates reversal of his conviction and death sentence. However, we find that appellant received a fair trial and a fair sentencing determination, and no significant cumulative error occurred. Therefore, we reject appellant\u2019s thirteenth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">VII. Independent Sentence Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"AOrA\">A. Aggravating Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">{\u00b6 146} The evidence established that appellant was properly convicted of aggravated murder with prior calculation and design with death penalty specifications for murder while a prisoner in a detention facility under R.C. 2929.04(A)(4) and for a prior purposeful killing under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">B. Mitigation Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">{\u00b6 147} Appellant called three mitigation witnesses, provided his own unsworn statement to the jury, and submitted documentary evidence for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">{\u00b6 148} Patricia Cutcher, appellant\u2019s sister, testified about appellant\u2019s upbringing. According to Cutcher, her appearance at the trial provided her with the first opportunity to see appellant in twenty-one years. Cutcher was the youngest of nine children (seven sisters and two brothers) in the Hanna family. The family lived in a \u201clittle house\u201d in Toledo, Ohio, that had no indoor plumbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">{\u00b6 149} Appellant\u2019s mother raised the family after their father died. Their mother did not work and supported the family on Social Security benefits received after their father died in 1956. Only two of the nine children graduated from high school. Appellant\u2019s mother was a harsh disciplinarian. She would use a shoe, the hard part of a vacuum hose, and willow switches to discipline her children. Appellant was described as her mother\u2019s favorite child. Appellant\u2019s mother was \u201cslack with him\u201d in enforcing rules. However, appellant got into trouble with \u201ctheft and stuff like that\u201d because of a lack of supervision at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">{\u00b6 150} According to Cutcher, appellant was sexually abused as a child, although she provided no details. Finally, Cutcher mentioned that appellant was placed in foster homes \u201cmore than twice\u201d when he was growing up.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">{\u00b6 151} Dr. Kathleen Burch, a clinical psychologist, conducted psychological testing of appellant, reviewed appellant\u2019s records, and talked to his mother and three of his sisters. According to Dr. Burch, appellant\u2019s clinical history showed that he was raised in a very dysfunctional family. Appellant\u2019s family was \u201cextremely poor, to the point of living in an Army surplus tent for several years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>{\u00b6 152} Appellant\u2019s father died when appellant was six years old. Thereafter, appellant\u2019s mother raised the family on her own. She was \u201crather aggressive and abusive toward the children.\u201d Appellant was his mother\u2019s favorite child, and \u201che was allowed to pull the girls\u2019 hair and be mean to them and not get punished for it.\u201d Meanwhile, his sisters were frequently punished, and on one occasion, \u201cthe mother broke the sister\u2019s nose because she made [appellant] get angry. So it was very, very inconsistent and also humiliating, * * * for both the daughters and James.\u201d In sum, his mother \u201coverprotected him in the sense of not allowing him to accept responsibility or to be made * * * responsible for any of his behaviors, but also treated him in a humiliating and overly controlling fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">{\u00b6 153} Appellant told Dr. Burch that he had killed Copas because he \u201chad been very careless and left the cell open when James was at work. And when this guy left, he would leave the cell open and that a number of James\u2019 personal belongings were stolen.\u201d According to appellant, Copas also \u201cenlisted the support of some of his friends and that threats were made against James.\u201d On the night of the stabbing, Copas \u201ccame back to the cell late and he was drunk and he was loud and noisy and James was trying to sleep and could not sleep because of this guy\u2019s disruption.\u201d Appellant then stabbed Copas in the eye and beat him when he stirred around.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">{\u00b6 154} Family members told Dr. Burch that a neighbor had sexually abused appellant. One of appellant\u2019s sisters stated \u201cthat in one of the foster placements she believed that there may have been some sexual abuse.\u201d However, Dr. Burch was not able to substantiate this abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">{\u00b6 155} According to Dr. Burch, \u201c[t]here were a lot of efforts to' treat [appellant],\u201d beginning at about age 12 when he was admitted to the Child Study Institute. \u201cAnd then there were a couple of foster placements in between those admissions. And then he was involved in Ohio Youth Services and several placements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">{\u00b6 156} Neuropsychological testing showed that appellant has attention defi-' cit disorder, which was never diagnosed or treated, frontal lobe impairment in the brain, and dysfunction in the right posterior aspect of his brain. Appellant was also diagnosed with a \u201cpersonality disorder, predominantly antisocial, and he has a passive/aggressive style and also hostile/dependent style of relating.\u201d According to Dr. Burch, appellant is \u201cnot a person who functions very well. He had a lifelong history of poor performance in most areas. He\u2019s not ever really showed the ability to look ahead, to behave in his best interests, to delay gratification toward a future goal, to regulate his feelings and his behavior in a way that allows healthy, productive, effective relationships with other people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">{\u00b6 157} Dr. Burch stated that appellant\u2019s imprisonment in a maximum security prison, where there was virtually no contact with other inmates, would likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>cause his mental health to go more \u201coff the beam.\u201d However, \u201c[i]t would be safer for him and, from that aspect, for other people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 158} During cross-examination, Dr. Burch stated that appellant\u2019s intelligence quotient (IQ) was in the normal range, between 91 and 111. There was also no information that any of appellant\u2019s brothers or sisters went to adult prison for violent crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">{\u00b6 159} Trooper Ertel described the conditions of imprisonment at the maximum security prison at Youngstown based upon his one visit to that facility. Ertel stated that prisoners were housed individually in cells for up to twenty-three hours a day. During cross-examination, Ertel stated that prisoners at Lucasville were housed in single cells and that prison guards escorted prisoners everywhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">{\u00b6 160} In his unsworn statement, appellant expressed \u201cdeepfelt regret and remorse and, yes, also sorrow that I have in turn inflicted upon Peter Copas and others innocent of any type of wrongdoing.\u201d Appellant also said, \u201cConsidering the type of isolation and incarceration that I exist under these days, weeks, months, and years, I foresee no human contact other than corrections officers and officials, with most of that being strictly limited to visual contact alone. My confinement consists of a steel cement bed, mattress with bedding, light fixture, toilet and sink combination, but without a window for fresh air, just the vent circulated variety inside my cell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">{\u00b6 161} Appellant added, \u201cI wanted an offer to plead guilty to aggravated murder and receive a sentence of life in prison without parole. This would have saved a trial. * * * [T]he prosecutor told my lawyers they would not agree.\u201d If he received a life sentence, appellant said, \u201cI will go to a super maximum prison where I will stay isolated from others except contact with guards.\u201d In concluding remarks, appellant said, \u201cI again express my remorse and thanks (sic) you for listening to my statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">{\u00b6 162} Lucas County Juvenile Court records from 1962 through 1966 showed that appellant was a runaway, charged with being ungovernable, unsuccessfully placed in foster care, and later placed in various juvenile institutions. A probation counselor\u2019s report dated September 21, 1962, described appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s hardship as a single parent raising a large family with few financial resources, appellant\u2019s inability to get along with his mother, and the family\u2019s inadequate living conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">{\u00b6 163} Records from 1963 showed that appellant was unable to adjust to foster care. A psychologist\u2019s report dated November 15, 1963, stated that appellant was \u201cdisturbed emotionally and that institutional placement where he will receive psychiatric counseling and training in accepting rules, regulations and limits\u201d was considered the preferred treatment approach. Appellant was com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>mitted to the Youth Commission and transferred to the Boys\u2019 Industrial School on December 27, 1963. Records from 1964 through 1966 showed truancy infractions, parole violations for disorderly conduct and theft, and parole violations for burglary and larceny. In 1966, appellant escaped from the Fairfield School for Boys four times, but he was apprehended and returned to the school on each occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">{\u00b6 164} Lucas County children\u2019s records from 1972 pertaining to appellant\u2019s sister Patricia discussed the family\u2019s living situation and illustrated Mrs. Hanna\u2019s lack of concern for her children\u2019s home placement. Mrs. Hanna was described as a \u201cdramatic woman with a loud, almost piercing voice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">C. Sentence Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">{\u00b6 165} We find that the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was guilty of the charged aggravating circumstances, i.e., murder while a prisoner in a detention facility, R.C. 2929.04(A)(4), and a prior purposeful killing under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">{\u00b6 166} We find nothing in the nature and circumstances of this offense to be mitigating. Appellant fashioned the sharpened end of a paintbrush into a deadly weapon, thrust it into Copas\u2019s right eye socket while he was sleeping, and then broke off the paintbrush handle, leaving five inches of it lodged inside Copas\u2019s brain. Appellant then continued the attack by hitting Copas about the head with a padlock in a sock. Later, appellant bragged about killing this \u201cmaggot baby-raper-killer,\u201d making him suffer by stabbing \u201cone of his eyeballs up out of its socket,\u201d and then beating on \u201chis stupid-ass-head off-and-on for two (2) hours.\u201d Thus, the facts show a senseless, horrific murder that lacks any mitigating features.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">{\u00b6 167} Appellant\u2019s history and background provide some mitigating features. Appellant grew up as one of nine children in a dysfunctional family. Appellant\u2019s father died when he was young, and he was raised by an abusive, overly controlling mother. His teenage years were turbulent as he was removed from his home, placed in foster care, and later spent time in various juvenile institutions. Appellant\u2019s character offers no redeeming features.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">{\u00b6 168} We conclude that, pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(B)(7), these facts are applicable but entitled to little weight. Dr. Burch testified that appellant has attention deficit disorder, antisocial personality disorder, and suffers from some organic injury to his brain. However, psychological and mental disorders do not mitigate the aggravating circumstances of this crime. See <em>State v. Stojetz, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 472, 705 N.E.2d 329 (paranoid schizoid personality and post-traumatic stress disorder entitled to only modest weight under [B][7]).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A1c\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Timothy A. Oliver, Warren County Prosecuting Attorney, Kenneth A. Ewing and James D. Beaton, Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A32\">David H. Bodiker, Ohio Public Defender, Stephen A Ferrell, Kelly L. Culshaw and Diane M. Menashe, Assistant Public Defenders, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">{\u00b6 169} Other factors in mitigation include appellant\u2019s unsworn statement. Appellant expressed remorse for killing Copas. Appellant\u2019s remorse represented a sharp contrast to his sentiments about the murder in his letter to Borowski in January 1998. Then, he boasted about killing Copas. Thus, we attach little weight to appellant\u2019s expression of remorse during his unsworn statement. See <em>State v. Keene </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 646, 671, 693 N.E.2d 246 (retrospective remorse entitled to little weight in mitigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">{\u00b6 170} Appellant\u2019s unsworn statement also mentioned that he offered to plead guilty as charged if allowed to accept a sentence of life without parole. However, appellant had been in prison since 1978 for aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder. Thus, given his status at the time of the offense, we agree with the trial court that appellant\u2019s \u201coffer to plea was conceding little regardless of the outcome of the offense.\u201d We find that appellant\u2019s offer to plea is entitled to little weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">{\u00b6 171} In summary, appellant\u2019s collective mitigation is weak. His family background, psychological disorders, and his unsworn statement are entitled to modest weight in mitigation. Overall, the mitigating factors are of minimal significance, and the aggravating circumstances substantially outweigh them.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">{\u00b6 172} We find that appellant\u2019s death sentence is proportionate to death sentences approved for murders by inmates in detention facilities, see <em>State v. Stojetz, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 472, 705 N.E.2d 329; <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 149, 538 N.E.2d 373; <em>State v. Zuern, </em>32 Ohio St.3d 56, 512 N.E.2d 585, and for offenders with prior murder convictions, see <em>State v. Taylor, 78 </em>Ohio St.3d at 34, 676 N.E.2d 82; <em>State v. Carter, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 228, 594 N.E.2d 595; <em>State v. Mapes </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 108, 118, 19 OBR 318, 484 N.E.2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">{\u00b6 173} For the foregoing reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b475-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, F.E.
