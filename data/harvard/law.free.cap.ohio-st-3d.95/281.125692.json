The common pleas court found Howard to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>psychopathic offender, suspended the execution of his sentence, and committed him to the former Department of Mental Health and Retardation for an indefinite period, \u201cuntil released from said institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">{\u00b6 2} In November 1978, after Howard apparently attempted to escape, the common pleas court revoked its previous order, terminated the suspension of Howard\u2019s prison sentence, and ordered the execution of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">{\u00b6 3} In April 2001, Howard filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Ross County for a writ of habeas corpus to compel 'his immediate release from prison. Howard claimed that he was entitled to discharge from confinement because of an unconstitutional amendment of his indictment, a defective indictment, sentencing errors, including a violation of the prohibition against ex post facto laws, breach of a plea agreement, fraud, double jeopardy, and his own incompetence. Appellee, Chillicothe Correctional Institution Warden Michael Randle, filed a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">{\u00b6 4} In October 2001, the court of appeals granted the warden\u2019s motion and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">{\u00b6 5} In his appeal as of right, Howard asserts that the court of appeals erred by dismissing his habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">{\u00b6 6} Howard\u2019s assertion lacks merit because his claims are not cognizable in state habeas corpus. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Bragg v. Seidner </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 87, 88, 748 N.E.2d 532 (validity or sufficiency of an indictment or an amended indictment); <em>Brown v. Leonard </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 593, 716 N.E.2d 183 (sentencing errors); <em>Majaros v. Collins </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 442, 596 N.E.2d 1038 (ex post facto provisions); cf. <em>State ex rel. Seikbert v. Wilkinson </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 489, 633 N.E.2d 1128 (adequate legal remedy to raise claim of breach of plea agreement precluded extraordinary relief in mandamus); <em>Douglas v. Money </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 348, 708 N.E.2d 697 (conspiracy and bias); <em>State ex rel. Tran v. McMackin </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 165, 580 N.E.2d 782 (fraud and trickery); <em>Thomas v. Huffman </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 266, 703 N.E.2d 315 (double jeopardy); <em>Krauter v. Maxwell </em>(1965), 3 Ohio St.2d 142, 32 O.O.2d 141, 209 N.E.2d 571 (mental incompetence of an accused in a criminal proceeding). Howard had adequate remedies in the ordinary course of law to raise these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">{\u00b6 7} Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b444-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
