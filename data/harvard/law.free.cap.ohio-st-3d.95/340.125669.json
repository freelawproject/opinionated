Jankowski, hurt her right arm while working as a nurse for appellant, Parma Community General Hospital (\u201cthe hospital\u201d). A workers\u2019 compensation claim was allowed, and temporary total disability compensation (\u201cTTC\u201d) commenced in January 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>The hospital subsequently received an anonymous letter stating that claimant was working for her brother at Child' Support Advocates (\u201cCSA\u201d). Because she was receiving TTC, the hospital conducted its own investigation and also forwarded the allegation to the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, which, in turn, instituted its own inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">{\u00b6 3} Both investigations established that claimant had, at various times, answered the phones and advised clients at CSA. Claimant did not deny these allegations. Only the frequency of her activity was in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">{\u00b6 4} The investigations unearthed no evidence that claimant had received wages or any other remuneration for her activities. To the contrary, attorney Michael Dadisman, who cosigned all CSA checks, stated that he never paid her and was unaware of her ever being paid. Claimant testified that she occasionally went into CSA\u2019s office to assist her brother, who was having personal problems at the time. She also hoped that the experience would complement her recently completed paralegal training, since her doctor had told her she would never return to nursing.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">{\u00b6 5} Responding to the hospital\u2019s motion to terminate TTC, the commission denied the request after finding that claimant had not performed any \u201cwork\u201d that would preclude TTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">{\u00b6 6} After unsuccessfully seeking a writ of mandamus from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, the hospital now appeals to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">{\u00b6 7} Three key facts are undisputed: (1) claimant, to some degree, answered phones and advised clients at CSA; (2) these activities were not inconsistent with her allegation that she was medically unable to resume her former duties as a nurse; and (3) there was no evidence of wages or other remuneration for these activities. The last two facts raise a question to which the parties, surprisingly, devote little attention: Do a claimant\u2019s activities in a workplace environment preclude TTC if (1) the claimant is not being remunerated and (2) the duties are not medically inconsistent with her claim that she could not perform her former position of employment? We find that they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>{\u00b6 8} TTC is meant to compensate a claimant for the loss of earnings sustained while the injury heals. <em>State ex rel. Ashcraft v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 42, 44, 517 N.E.2d 533. For this reason, TTC ceases when a claimant \u201chas returned to work.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Ramirez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 630, 632, 23 O.O.3d 518, 433 N.E.2d 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 9} <em>Ramirez </em>did not define \u201cwork.\u201d Later cases, however, suggest that remuneration is a key element. <em>State ex rel. Nye v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 75, 78, 22 OBR 91, 488 N.E.2d 867, implied that \u201cwork\u201d entailed remuneration, and we affirmed that definition in <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. Rawac Plating Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 599, 600-601, 575 N.E.2d 837:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cIn <em>State ex rel. Nye v. Indus.. Comm. </em>[supra], we held that \u2018work\u2019 as used in <em>Ramirez </em>referred to <em>any </em>\u2018substantially gainful employment,\u2019 not merely the former position of employment. To hold otherwise:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c * * * would permit the payment of temporary total disability benefits to a claimant who has chosen to return to full-time work at a job other than his former employment. In such a case, the claimant is no longer suffering the loss of earnings for which temporary total disability benefits are intended to compensate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">{\u00b6 12} <em>State ex rel. Blabac v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 113, 717 N.E.2d 336, instructs that the receipt of wages need not be for full-time work in order to bar TTC. There, claimant received TTC while teaching scuba diving for pay on a part-time basis. In disqualifying claimant from TTC, we rejected a proposed distinction between paid part-time and paid full-time employment:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">{\u00b6 13} <em>\u201cNye </em>merely confirmed that substantially gainful employment barred TTC. It did not, as claimant represents, create two categories of employment whereby only substantially gainful employment terminated TTC and more sporadic employment did not. Again, <em>Ramirez </em>states that a \u2018return to work\u2019 bars TTC. In this case, claimant does not dispute that his paid scuba diving instruction constitutes \u2018work.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 116, 717 N.E.2d 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">{\u00b6 14} These cases establish that remuneration is encompassed within the definition of TTC-prohibitive \u201cwork activity.\u201d Remuneration, however, was not disputed in those cases, so we were not directly confronted with an issue such as this one. Nevertheless, the guiding principles of those decisions are applicable. All focused on TTC\u2019s purpose \u2014 compensation for lost earnings. Where remuneration is paid for other work, the claimant does not experience a lack of wages and TTC is, therefore, inappropriate. Conversely, it follows that where there are no outside wages to reduce or eliminate the loss, the purpose of TTC has not been compromised and payment is proper.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A7N-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Seaman &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A., and Angelique M. Hartzell, for appellee Jankowski.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ady\">Betty D. Montgomery, Attorney General, and William J. McDonald, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee Industrial Commission.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">{\u00b6 15} Such a result makes practical sense for two reasons. First, engaging in any potentially remunerative activity would automatically preclude a claimant from receiving TTC. Such a rule could prohibit a TTC claimant from babysitting her grandchildren. It could prohibit a TTC claimant from mowing his lawn. These daily activities are not the type that should disqualify a claimant from receiving TTC <em>unless </em>engaging in those activities is physically inconsistent with a claimed inability to return to the former job. If a claimant gets TTC for a back injury and is seen single-handedly pulling out a neighbor\u2019s engine block, it matters not whether claimant is doing it for free \u2014 TTC is almost certainly inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6 16} Second, to hold as the hospital suggests discourages claimants from participating in unpaid internships, apprentice programs, and other opportunities to learn and gain new skills and workplace experience. The instant claimant, for example, testified that she was attempting to gain experience to supplement her paralegal training, since a return to nursing was unlikely. Claimants who show this motivation should be encouraged, not dissuaded, from gaining experience that may ultimately lead to a new career and eliminate the need for TTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">{\u00b6 17} In its second, third, and fourth propositions of law, the hospital challenges certain alleged deficiencies in the commission\u2019s order. None of these alleged deficiencies affects the hospital\u2019s fatal failure to prove remuneration. Again, these matters are irrelevant given the undisputed lack of evidence. Accordingly, they are dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">{\u00b6 18} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b505-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
