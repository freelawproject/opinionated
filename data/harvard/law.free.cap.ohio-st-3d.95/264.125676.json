Because we hold that the statutory subsection violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 2, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, we reverse defendant-appellant Eric Thompson\u2019s conviction for importuning.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b426-17\">{\u00b62} In July 1999, Thompson was charged with violating R.C. 2907.07(B) after he had solicited a male jogger by offering to perform a sexual act. Prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>trial, Thompson moved to dismiss the charge against him. Thompson argued that because the importuning statute discriminated against those of homosexual orientation, the statute violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 2, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, and the case proceeded to a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 3} The trial court found Thompson guilty. Thompson appealed to the Eleventh District Court of Appeals. That court found Thompson\u2019s argument that the importuning statute violated equal protection compelling, but \u201c[w]ith considerable reluctance\u201d followed a prior decision from this court that held that R.C. 2907.07(B) did not violate equal protection. Thompson then appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 4} The cause is now before this court pursuant to our allowance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">{\u00b6 5} R.C. 2907.07(B) provides that \u201c[n]o person shall solicit a person of the same sex to engage in sexual activity with the offender, when the offender knows such solicitation is offensive to the other person, or is reckless in that regard.\u201d The 1973 Legislative Service Commission comment to 1972 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 511, which enacted the current version of R.C. 2907.07(B), describes the operation and stated rationale behind the statute:</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe solicitation of homosexual or lesbian activity is also prohibited, when the solicitor knows or has reasonable cause to believe the solicitation is offensive to the person solicited.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe section represents an exception to the general rule that \u2018just asking\u2019 is not a criminal offense. * * * The rationale for prohibiting indiscreet solicitation of deviate conduct is that the solicitation in itself can be highly repugnant to the person solicited, and there is a risk that it may provoke a violent response.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>State v. Phipps </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 271, 12 O.O.3d 273, 389 N.E.2d 1128, the court relied on this stated purpose in construing R.C. 2907.07(B) \u201cto proscribe only the \u2018fighting\u2019 words category of unprotected speech. \u2018Fighting\u2019 words are those \u2018which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 278, 12 O.O.3d 273, 389 N.E.2d 1128, quoting <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire </em>(1942), 315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031. Thus, the <em>Phipps </em>court reached the following holding:</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>{\u00b6 9} \u201cUnder R.C. 2907.07(B), persons may not be punished for \u2018soliciting] a person of the same sex to engage in sexual activity with the offender, when the offender knows such solicitation is offensive to the other person, or is reckless in that regard,\u2019 unless the solicitation, by its very utterance, inflicts injury or is likely to provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace.\u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">{\u00b6 10} Thompson asks this court to hold that R.C. 2907.07(B) violates the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. The state in turn notes its agreement with the court of appeals, which found our prior decisions regarding R.C. 2907.07(B) problematic and asks that we \u201cmore fully explain why R.C. 2907.07(B) does not violate the Equal Protection clauses under the United States and Ohio Constitutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">{\u00b6 11} The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o State shall * * * deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d Ohio\u2019s Equal Protection Clause in turn provides that \u201c[a]ll political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for their equal protection and benefit * * Section 2, Article I, Ohio Constitution. We have construed these provisions as being \u201cfunctionally equivalent,\u201d necessitating the same analysis. <em>Am. Assn. of Univ. Professors, Cent. State Univ. Chapter v. Cent. State Univ. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 55, 59, 717 N.E.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">{\u00b6 12} Without revisiting the <em>Phipps </em>issue of whether homosexual solicitations targeted by R.C. 2907.07(B) constitute fighting words, we find that the statute is facially invalid as a content-based restriction on speech, which by extension violates the equal protection guarantees of both the United States and Ohio Constitutions. In reaching this result, we note that while the parties contend that this court should apply rational-basis review to determine the constitutionality of R.C. 2907.07(B), we must as a matter of law employ a more exacting level of scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cIn considering whether state legislation violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment * * * [courts] apply different levels of scrutiny to different types of classifications.\u201d <em>Clark v. Jeter </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 456, 461, 108 S.Ct. 1910, 100 L.Ed.2d 465. We use the same analytic approach in determining whether a statutory classification violates Section 2, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. <em>State v. Williams </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 513, 530, 728 N.E.2d 342. Thus, all statutes are subject to at least rational-basis review, which requires that a statutory classification be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. <em>Clark, </em>486 U.S. at 461, 108 S.Ct. 1910, 100 L.Ed.2d 465; <em>Williams, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 530, 728 N.E.2d 342. When a discriminatory classification based on sex or illegitimacy is at issue, we employ heightened or intermediate scrutiny and require that the classification be substantially related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>to an important governmental objective. <em>Clark, </em>486 U.S. at 461, 108 S.Ct. 1910, 100 L.Ed.2d 465. And when classifications affect a fundamental constitutional right, or when they are based on race or national origin, we will conduct a strict-scrutiny inquiry. Id.; <em>Williams, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 530, 728 N.E.2d 342. This latter level of scrutiny demands that a discriminatory classification be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. <em>United States v. Playboy Ent. Group, Inc. </em>(2000), 529 U.S. 803, 813, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865; <em>Painesville Bldg. Dept. v. Dworken &amp; Bernstein Co., L.P.A. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 564, 567, 733 N.E.2d 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 14} Although the parties contend that R.C. 2907.07(B)\u2019s classification is based on <em>sexual orientation, </em>we find that characterization of R.C. 2907.07(B) erroneous. The plain language of the statute dictates that any person \u2014 a heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual male or female \u2014 who solicits a person of the same sex to engage in sexual activity would be guilty of importuning, if the offender knowingly offended the solicitee or was reckless in that regard. Further, our decision in <em>Phipps </em>characterized the statutory classification as based on the nature of the <em>offensive sexual content </em>of the communication. Therefore, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>R.A.V. v. St. Paul </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 377, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305, guides our analysis. Decided over a dozen years after our decision in <em>Phipps, R.A.V. </em>concerned a city ordinance that prohibited placing \u201con public or private property a symbol * * * which one knows or has reasonable grounds to know arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.\u201d Id. at 380, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305. R.A.V., the defendant, had allegedly burned a cross on a black family\u2019s property, thereby violating the ordinance. Prior to trial, he moved to dismiss the charges in part on the theory that because the ordinance was an impermissible content-based limitation on speech, it was facially invalid under the First Amendment. After initially obtaining a dismissal, R.A.V. lost on appeal in state court and then brought the issue to the United States Supreme Court. The court was bound by the construction of the ordinance given to it by the state supreme court: that \u201cthe ordinance reache[d] only those expressions that constitute \u2018fighting words.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 381, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305. Accepting this characterization, the court held that even if \u201call of the expression reached by the ordinance is proscribable under the \u2018fighting words\u2019 doctrine, we nonetheless conclude that the ordinance is facially unconstitutional in that it prohibits otherwise permitted speech solely on the basis of the subjects the speech addresses.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 15} The rationale behind this decision is instructive. The court explained that the general proposition that fighting words \u201care \u2018not within the area of constitutionally protected speech,\u2019 or that the \u2018protection of the First Amendment does not extend\u2019 to them\u201d is misleading if not taken in the proper context. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>(Citation omitted.) Id. at 383, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305, quoting <em>Roth v. United States </em>(1957), 354 U.S. 476, 483, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498, and <em>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc. </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 485, 504, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502. \u201c[T]he exclusion of \u2018fighting words\u2019 from the scope of the First Amendment simply means that, for purposes of that Amendment, the unprotected features of the words are, despite their verbal character, essentially a \u2018nonspeech\u2019 element of communication.\u201d Id. at 386, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305. Even such \u201cnonspeech,\u201d the court noted, nonetheless \u201ccan be used to convey an idea.\u201d Id. Thus, the court held that \u201c[t]he government may not regulate use based on hostility \u2014 or favoritism \u2014 towards the underlying message expressed.\u201d Id. This is because \u201cthe First Amendment imposes * * * a \u2018content discrimination\u2019 limitation upon a State\u2019s prohibition of proscribable speech.\u201d Id. at 387,112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 16} We find this reasoning directly applicable to the case at bar. Here, R.C. 2907.07(B) seeks to handicap the expression of particular content \u2014 offensive same-sex solicitations \u2014 while permitting offensive solicitations between opposite sexes. But as the United States Supreme Court has explained, \u201cthe reason why fighting words are categorically excluded from the protection of the First Amendment is not that their content communicates any particular idea, but that their content embodies a particularly intolerable (and socially unnecessary) <em>mode </em>of expressing <em>whatever </em>idea the speaker wishes to convey.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 393, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305. As in <em>R.A.V., </em>the state prohibition here does not single out \u201can especially offensive mode of expression \u2014 it has not, for example, selected for prohibition only those fighting words that communicate ideas in a threatening (as opposed to a merely obnoxious) manner.\u201d Id. Rather, as <em>Phipps </em>held, the distinction drawn in R.C. 2907.07(B) impermissibly proscribes <em>only </em>fighting words of a <em>specific </em>sexual character. This constitutes a content-based limitation.-</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 17} The stated legislative purpose of the statutory classification at issue is the desire to prevent a violent response to same-sex sexual solicitation. But the means employed here to accomplish this end, in the words of the <em>R.A.V. </em>court, present a \u201crealistic possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot.\u201d <em>R.A.V., </em>505 U.S. at 390, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305. We are convinced that R.C. 2907.07(B) makes such a possibility an actuality. This is not an instance in which the selectivity of the government restriction is simply underinclusive. Mere underinclusiveness does not offend freedom of speech \u2014 and therefore equal protection \u2014 because it does not discriminate on the basis of content. See id. at 387, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305. This is also not a case in which \u201cthe basis for the content discrimination consists entirely of the very reason the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable.\u201d Id. at 388, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305. Nor is this a case in which a statute\u2019s content discrimination targets only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>\u201csecondary effects\u201d of the prohibited speech. Cf. <em>R.A.V., </em>505 U.S. at 394, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (\u201c \u2018Listeners\u2019 reactions to speech are not the type of \u201csecondary effects\u201d we referred to in <em>[Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc. </em>(1986), 475 U.S. 41, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d 29].\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018The emotive impact of speech on its audience is not a \u201csecondary effect,\u201d \u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Boos v. Barry </em>[1988], 485 U.S. 312, 321, 108 S.Ct. 1157, 99 L.Ed.2d 333).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 18} Here, R.C. 2907.07(B)\u2019s content-based classification implicates a fundamental right. Cf. <em>Williams, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 530, 728 N.E.2d 342 (\u201cRecognized fundamental rights include the right to vote, the right of interstate travel, rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the right to procreate, and other rights of a uniquely personal nature\u201d). Therefore, the court of appeals erred in applying less than strict-scrutiny analysis. See <em>Williams v. Rhodes </em>(1968), 393 U.S. 23, 31, 89 S.Ct. 5, 21 L.Ed.2d 24, quoting <em>NAACP v. Button </em>(1963), 371 U.S. 415, 438, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (\u201c \u2018only a compelling state interest in the regulation of a subject within the State\u2019s constitutional power to regulate can justify limiting First Amendment freedoms\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 19} The state has not narrowly tailored R.C. 2907.07(B) to serve a compelling state interest. Curtailing the risk of violent responses to offensive sexual solicitations \u2014 as opposed to prohibiting offensive sexual solicitations of a particular content \u2014 could have been achieved by prohibiting <em>all </em>offensive solicitations of sexual activity. The existence of such an adequate <em>content-neutral </em>alternative undercuts any notions that the discriminatory classification of R.C. 2907.07(B) is <em>necessary </em>or that the statute\u2019s \u201c \u2018asserted justification is in fact an accurate description of the purpose and effect of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>R.A.V., </em>505 U.S. at 395, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305, quoting <em>Burson v. Freeman </em>(1992), 504 U.S. 191, 213, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (Kennedy, J., concurring). See, also, <em>Madsen v. Women\u2019s Health Ctr., Inc. </em>(1994), 512 U.S. 753, 763, 114 S.Ct. 2516, 129 L.Ed.2d 593 (finding that injunction that prohibited picketing was content neutral, because \u201cnone of the restrictions imposed by the court were directed at the contents of petitioner\u2019s message\u201d). Although the Legislative Service Commission comments regarding R.C. 2907.07(B) describe the purpose of the statute as preventing violence related to offensive same-sex solicitations, \u201cthe mere assertion of a content-neutral purpose [is not] enough to save a law which, on its face, discriminates based on content.\u201d <em>Turner Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v. Fed. Communications Comm. </em>(1994), 512 U.S. 622, 642-643, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 129 L.Ed.2d 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">{\u00b6 20} R.C. 2907.07(B) prohibits speech <em>because of the content expressed in that communication. </em>Such selectivity \u2014 targeting specifically the <em>message </em>and not merely the <em>mode </em>used to communicate that message \u2014 handicaps the expres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>sion of particular ideas. See <em>R.A.V., </em>505 U.S. at 394, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305. The state not only has failed to demonstrate how this discriminatory classification is narrowly tailored to satisfy a compelling state interest, but, in fact, agrees with the proposition that R.C. 2907.07(B) could not even pass a rational-basis review, a much less stringent standard than strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">{\u00b6 21} In his separate concurrence, Justice Pfeifer also argues that rational-basis review applies and that the statute would fail under such scrutiny. He errs in several ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">{\u00b6 22} The concurrence accuses us of \u201cnot addressing] the central issue of the case, the only issue that was argued by the parties: whether R.C. 2907.07(B) unconstitutionally distinguishes between people who seek to engage in homosexual activity and people who seek to engage in heterosexual activity.\u201d In framing the issue of this case in such a way, the concurrence fails to appreciate that the broad issue before this court is whether R.C. 2907.07(B) violates the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. In making this determination, we are bound neither by a party\u2019s characterization of a statutory classification nor by any party\u2019s suggestion of what level of scrutiny we must employ. Rather, a court must independently determine what level of scrutiny it must apply based on the operation of the statute involved. Cf. <em>Atty. Gen. of New York v. Soto-Lopez </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 898, 906, 106 S.Ct. 2317, 90 L.Ed.2d 899, fn. 6 (plurality opinion) (explaining that \u201c[t]he logical first question to ask when presented with an equal protection claim * * * is what level of review is appropriate\u201d and that \u201cin order to ascertain the appropriate level of scrutiny, [a court] must, as an initial matter, determine\u201d what right is implicated).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">{\u00b6 23} Nonetheless, the concurrence concludes that this court should employ a rational-basis review, because the \u201cobvious intent of R.C. 2907.07(B) is to restrict homosexual activity, not speech.\u201d This reading of the statute ignores what the statute actually proscribes. Nothing in the statutory language criminalizes homosexual <em>activity; </em>rather, the statute criminalizes only same-sex <em>solicitation. </em>As noted, under an accurate reading of the statutory language, even a <em>heterosexual </em>could be guilty of violating R.C. 2907.07(B), if he or she spoke words constituting a same-sex solicitation. It remains legal to engage in same-sex sexual activity, but (according to <em>Phipps) </em>not to solicit such activity in a manner that could lead to violence. While it is conceivable that this prohibition would inhibit the permitted conduct, such a result is secondary to the purpose of the statute on its face. In other words, the concurring Justice would strike a statute based not on what the statute <em>actually </em>proscribes explicitly, but on what it might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number><em>also </em>inhibit implicitly \u2014 ignoring the content-based nature of the statutory prohibition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">{\u00b6 24} Finally, even if R.C. 2907.07(B) did not implicate a fundamental right, requiring strict scrutiny, if this court were to employ rational-basis review, it would require this court to <em>uphold </em>the statute. The concurrence thus not only applies the wrong level of review, but applies it incorrectly.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 25} This court has previously explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cUnder federal [and state] rational-basis analysis, a classification \u2018must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\u2019 <em>Fed. Communications Comm. v. Beach Communications, Inc. </em>(1993), 508 U.S. 307, 313, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 2101, 124 L.Ed.2d 211, 221. A rational relationship will exist under rational-basis review if \u2018the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational, see <em>Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc. </em>[1985], 473 U.S. [432], 446 [105 S.Ct. 3249, 3257, 87 L.Ed.2d 313, 324].\u2019 <em>Nordlinger v.

Furthermore, \u2018courts are compelled under rational-basis review to accept a legislature\u2019s generalizations even when there is an imperfect fit between means and ends.

Williams </em>[1970], 397 U.S. [471] 485 [90 S.Ct. 1153, 1161, 25 L.Ed.2d 491, 501-502], quoting <em>Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., </em>220 U.S. 61, 78 [31 S.Ct. 337, 340, 55 L.Ed. 369, 377] (1911). * * *\u2019 <em>Heller, </em>509 U.S. at 321, 113 S.Ct. at 2643, 125 L.Ed.2d at 271.\u201d <em>Am. Assn. of Univ. Professors, Cent. State Univ. Chapter, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 58, 717 N.E.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Here, the 1973 Legislative Service Commission comment to 1972 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 511 stated that \u201c[t]he rationale for prohibiting indiscreet solicitation of deviate conduct is that the solicitation in itself can be highly repugnant to the person solicited, and there is a risk that it may provoke a violent response.\u201d Thus, by confining its prohibition to the solicitation of what the General Assembly described as \u201cdeviate conduct,\u201d the legislature found that same-sex solicitation is <em>more </em>likely to induce violence than solicitations between members of opposite genders. Legislatures are permitted to so generalize in their collective decision-making. Because courts may not indulge any personal intuition to the contrary, almost any classification survives \u201cmere rationality\u201d review. The classification must be upheld so long as it is conceivable that the classification bears a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 29} Therefore, in the words of <em>Fed. Communications Comm. v. Beach Communications, Inc., </em>508 U.S. at 313, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 124 L.Ed.2d 211, there is a \u201creasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for th[is] classification\u201d: preventing violence by prohibiting that which is likely to induce it. While the generalization underlying the classification may not be one that any member of this court would endorse, our role is to accept the legislature\u2019s proposition unless Thompson negates \u201cevery conceivable basis which might support it.\u201d Id. at 315, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 124 L.Ed.2d 211. Thompson has failed to do this. Thus, we could not say that the relationship of the classification to its goal is \u201cso attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational.\u201d <em>Cleburne, </em>473 U.S. at 446, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313. Only by <em>ignoring </em>the stated rationale behind R.C. 2907.07(B) is the concurrence able to make the conclusory determination that \u201cthe classification drawn in R.C. 2907.07(B) is not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 30} Nevertheless, R.C. 2907.07(B) implicates a fundamental right, necessitating the strict-scrutiny review we employ.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 31} It is well settled that \u201c[t]he First and Fourteenth Amendments forbid discrimination in the regulation of expression on the basis of the content of that expression.\u201d <em>Carey v. Brown </em>(1980), 447 U.S. 455, 463, 100 S.Ct. 2286, 65 L.Ed.2d 263, fn. 7. See, also, <em>Burson, </em>504 U.S. at 197, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5, fn. 3 (plurality opinion). Accordingly, we find that R.C. 2907.07(B) is facially invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Section 2, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. We therefore reverse Thompson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b435-5\">F.E.

The concurrence misleads with its reference to R.C. 2907.24 to bolster its construction of R.C. 2907.07(B). R.C. 2907.24 is simply not analogous. That statute does not present a similar prohibition on speech that distinguishes between <em>heterosexual </em>and <em>homosexual </em>solicitations to engage in sexual activity for hire.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b435-8\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A3P\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">{\u00b6 32} The lead opinion rightly determines that R.C. 2907.07(B) violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 2, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. Therefore, I concur in the judgment and the syllabus. I write separately because the lead opinion has not addressed the central issue of the case, the only issue that was argued by the parties: whether 'R.C. 2907.07(B) unconstitutionally distinguishes between people who seek to engage in homosexual activity and people who seek to engage in heterosexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">{\u00b6 33} Instead, the lead opinion finds R.C. 2907.07(B) to be a \u201ccontent-based restriction on speech, which by extension violates the equal protection guarantees of both the United States and Ohio Constitutions.\u201d The obvious intent of R.C. 2907.07(B) is to restrict homosexual activity, not speech, as the lead opinion would have us believe. In the same way, the obvious intent of R.C. 2907.24, which prohibits the solicitation of another person to engage in sexual activity for hire, is to restrict prostitution, not speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">{\u00b6 34} I would directly address the issue that the parties raised. I would find that the classification drawn in R.C. 2907.07(B) does not survive rational-basis scrutiny. <em>Clark v. Jeter </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 456, 461, 108 S.Ct. 1910, 100 L.Ed.2d 465. There is no rational reason for the state to treat people who seek to engage in homosexual activity as criminals when it does not treat people who seek to engage in heterosexual activity as criminals. Even the state, in its brief to this court, expressed reservations about such a distinction. Because the classification drawn in R.C. 2907.07(B) is not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose, I conclude that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. For the same reason, I conclude that R.C. 2907.07(B) violates Section 2, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Accordingly, I would also reverse <em>State v.
