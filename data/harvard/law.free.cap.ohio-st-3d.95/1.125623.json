Zaino </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 1.]</p>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b163-7\">(No. 00-2127</docketnumber>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"At\">Submitted November 13, 2001</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AE\">Decided April 3, 2002.)</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b163-9\">Cook, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV\">This appeal presents the question whether a company that uses technicians supplied by a temporary employment service to satisfy maintenance and repair contracts for products sold to its customers meets the R.C. 5739.01(E)(1) resale exception to the state use tax. Because we conclude that the company does not resell the benefit obtained from the temporary employment service in the same form in which it was received, we hold the resale exception inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">Sarcom, Inc. is a computer hardware provider that, among other products, offers its customers a \u201cfull insurance plan\u201d service agreement. Under this agreement, Sarcom contracts with its customers to provide all maintenance and repair service for specified computer hardware. Because Sarcom\u2019s need for technicians under this plan exceeded its own technical personnel, Sarcom supplemented its workforce during a portion of 1994 and the entirety of 1995 with computer technicians provided by Corporate Staffing Resources, Inc. (\u201cCSR\u201d), a temporary employment service.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">Under the arrangement between Sarcom and CSR, CSR would pay the technicians an hourly rate and Sarcom would in turn pay CSR a fee consisting of a percentage above that rate. The technicians would report each day to Sarcom, unless Sarcom had previously dispatched them to a worksite, where a Sarcom employee managed them. When computer hardware covered under the Sarcom plan needed on-site repair, Sarcom would then dispatch from its offices an appropriate technician.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>In 1996, CSR filed on Sarcom\u2019s behalf an application for a refund of use tax collected and remitted by CSR for its sale of employment services to Sarcom from October 1, 1994 to December 31, 1995. Among other grounds since abandoned on appeal to this court, CSR asserted a right to a refund because the services that Sarcom sold were in the same form as the services that CSR provided, thus falling within the resale exception set forth in R.C. 5739.01(E)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The Tax Commissioner denied the refund application, finding in part that Sarcom did not resell in the same form the benefit of the temporary employment services provided by CSR. CSR then appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d). Relying upon our decision in <em>Bellemar Parts Industries, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 351, 725 N.E.2d 1132, the BTA affirmed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s denial of the refund. The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">R.C. 5741.02(A) levies \u201can excise tax * * * on the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property or the benefit realized in this state of any service provided.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specific exceptions exist to this general rule of taxation, such as that found in R.C. 5741.02(C)(2). That statute exempts from the use tax the acquisition of services that, \u201cif made in Ohio, would be a sale not subject to the tax imposed by sections 5739.01 to 5739.31 of the Revised Code.\u201d R.C. 5739.01(E)(1) provides an exception to both R.C. 5739.02 sales taxation and R.C. 5741.02 use taxation by excluding from the definition of retail sales (and therefore from taxation) \u201call sales * * * in which the purpose of the consumer is * * * [t]o resell the thing transferred or benefit of the service provided, by a person engaging in business, in the form in which the same is, or is to be, received by the person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">CSR contends that Sarcom qualifies for the exception because Sarcom\u2019s use of CSR technicians to satisfy its service plans constitutes the resale of the benefit, in the same form, that Sarcom receives from CSR. We disagree with this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>In <em>Bellemar, </em>we explained that \u201c[t]he benefit of the services of a temporary work force must include and focus upon its most obvious benefit \u2014 that provided by the labor itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353, 725 N.E.2d at 1135. Thus, the actual benefit to a company using temporary employees is \u201ctheir contribution of temporary, flexible, and less costly labor to its work force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Other such benefits also exist, including screening candidates for future employment and controlling the costs of benefits. <em>Id. </em>Applying this \u201cactual benefit\u201d inquiry to the facts before us, we conclude that Sarcom did not resell the benefit of its transactions with CSR in the same form to its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The BTA found that during 1994 and 1995, Sarcom could not satisfy its service agreements without supplementing its technical personnel. By using CSR-provided technicians, Sarcom was able to achieve control over a sufficient number of technicians to meet its contractual obligations. Therefore, the <em>actual </em>benefit to Sarcom was not the product of the workers\u2019 labor \u2014 consistently operating computer hardware \u2014 but a temporary and flexible work force of sufficient size and expertise. Further, although the hourly cost of CSR technicians exceeded the hourly wage of Sarcom technicians, Sarcom did not provide benefits for the temporary workers. And the Sarcom employee who managed the CSR technicians testified before the BTA that, after a certain period of time, he had hired CSR technicians on as Sarcom technicians \u2014 thus realizing the screening benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">These benefits contrast with the benefit that Sarcom provided to its customers. The Sarcom employee responsible for negotiating the sale of service plans with Sarcom customers testified before the BTA that \u201c[w]e were selling a service to our customers that basically were [sic] telling them we would keep their computers up and running.\u201d This offered benefit \u2014 functioning hardware\u2014 matched what the Sarcom employee described as the customers\u2019 desired benefit: \u201cWhat the customers were negotiating for in the proposal period were the services to keep their computer up and running.\u201d The benefit to Sarcom\u2019s customers, then, was not the <em>labor </em>of CSR technicians, but the end <em>product </em>of that labor: consistently operating computers. Sarcom\u2019s customers purchased a service to ensure a result, not the addition of service personnel to their own work forces. To say that the actual benefit to Sareom\u2019s customers was the CSR <em>technicians </em>would be to ignore that no customer would purchase a service plan simply to employ technicians. Rather, the customers purchased the service plans to realize the benefit of <em>having functioning hardware, </em>with the technicians being a means to an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">CSR argues that our decision in <em>Bellemar </em>is distinguishable. In <em>Bellemar, </em>a company obtained workers from a temporary employment service to work at the company\u2019s place of operations. The company then sold the tangible results of that work \u2014 wheel assemblies \u2014 to its customers. <em>Bellemar, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 351, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>725 N.E.2d at 1133. CSR argues that here, however, \u201cthe CSR technicians performed their duties at Sarcom\u2019s customers\u2019 locations upon equipment owned by the customers.\u201d Therefore, CSR reasons, \u201c[i]t logically follows that Sarcom\u2019s benefit \u2014 deployed technicians to perform repair services under the customers\u2019 supervision \u2014 was the same benefit received by its customers, the ultimate consumers.\u201d CSR thus urges us to conclude that \u201cSarcom and its customers were joint beneficiaries of the deployment of CSR technicians to customer sites. The same benefit was received at the same location and at the same time by both Sarcom and its customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">CSR\u2019s reasoning is flawed. While the proper focus of our inquiry should encompass all material factors, which could include the site at which the various actors realize their benefit, the geographic location of the realization of the benefit is not dispositive. Such a narrow focus fails to account for the fact that Sarcom and its customers have different interests and ultimately realize <em>different, </em>although related, benefits \u2014 regardless of where the laborers perform their work.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Our prior cases involving the resale exception provide examples of the proper analytical framework. We described these cases in <em>Bellemar:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u201cIn <em>Hyatt [Corp. v. Limbach </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 537, 634 N.E.2d 995], the taxpayer purchased laundry services, received laundered linens as the benefit of those services, and resold them in that form to the customers. Likewise in <em>CCH [Computax, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 86, 623 N.E.2d 1178], the taxpayer purchased tax return preparation, received completed tax returns as the benefit, and resold the returns unchanged to its customers.\u201d <em>Bellemar, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 354, 725 N.E.2d at 1135-1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">In both cases, the benefit received at each step in the transactional chain was the same. The resale exception therefore applied. These cases contrast with the facts of <em>Bellemar, </em>in which the benefit to the taxpaying company \u2014 or the manufacturer\u2019s receipt of a supplemented work force \u2014 did not match the benefit to its customer \u2014 or wheel assemblies, the product of the supplemented work force\u2019s labor. There, because the character of the actual benefit realized by each party did not remain consistent throughout the transactional chain, the resale exception did not apply. In each of the three cases, the proper inquiry is a focus on the actual benefit received and not on the service purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">CSR\u2019s dual-benefit/site-focused approach thus fails to comport with our analysis in <em>Bellemar </em>and related cases, which follows the plain language of R.C. 5739.01(E)(1). We therefore reaffirm our prior holding that \u201c[w]here a consumer contracts for temporary employees to add to its workforce, the benefit of that service is the labor of the employees, not the product of their work. Because it is the consumer of the services, not its customer, that receives the benefit of the service, the benefit is not resold in the same form and the resale exception from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>the sales tax does not apply.\u201d <em>Bellemar, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 351, 725 N.E.2d 1132, paragraph one of the syllabus. Accordingly, we hold that Sarcom did not resell in the same form the actual benefit it realized from its transactions with CSR to those customers who had purchased the service agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that CSR failed to prove that Sarcom satisfied the requirements of the resale exception. We therefore affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b167-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick and F.E.

The majority holds that Sarcom\u2019s use of technicians supplied by Corporate Staffing Resources Inc. (\u201cCSR\u201d) to satisfy maintenance and repair contracts was not subject to the resale exception in R.C. 5739.01(E)(1) and thus was subject to use tax. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">As the majority recognizes, Ohio law imposes a use tax on a \u201cbenefit realized in this state of any service provided,\u201d R.C. 5741.02(A), but exempts services that would not qualify as a sale in Ohio as defined in R.C. 5739.01 to 5739.31 of the Revised Code. R.C. 5741.02(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">A \u201csale\u201d includes \u201c[a]ll transactions by which * * * [ejmployment service is or is to be provided.\u201d R.C. 5739.01(B)(3)(k). \u201c \u2018Employment service\u2019 means providing or supplying personnel, on a temporary or long-term basis, to perform work or labor under the supervision or control of another, when the personnel so supplied receive their wages, salary, or other compensation from the provider of the service.\u201d R.C. 5739.01(JJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">R.C. 5739.01(E) defines the resale exception. It excludes from the definition of a sale sales in which the purpose of the purchaser is to resell the benefit of a service in the same form in which it was received. R.C. 5739.01(E)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">The majority dismisses CSR\u2019s contention that Sarcom resold the benefit of the CSR technicians in the same form that it received the benefit from CSR, based primarily on two conclusions. First, the majority finds that the actual benefit of CSR technicians that Sarcom received was \u201ca temporary and flexible work force of sufficient size and expertise.\u201d Second, the majority finds that the benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the CSR technicians to Sarcom\u2019s customers \u201cwas not the <em>labor </em>of CSR technicians, but the end <em>product </em>of that labor: consistently operating computers.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">A. No Actual Benefit to Sarcom</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The resale exception, R.C. 5739.01(E)(1), reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u201c(E) \u2018Retail sale\u2019 and \u2018sales at retail\u2019 include all sales except those in which the purpose of the consumer is:</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">\u201c(1) To <em>resell </em>the * * * <em>benefit </em>of the <em>service </em>provided * * * <em>in the form in which the same is* </em>* * <em>received </em>by the person.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\"><em>\u201cPurpose\u201d </em>means \u201csomething that one sets before himself as an object to be attained: an end or aim to be kept in view in any plan, measure, exertion, or operation.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 1847. I believe that evidence before the BTA indicated that the <em>purpose </em>of Sarcom\u2019s purchase of the temporary use of the CSR technicians was to resell the benefit of the technicians\u2019 labor to Sarcom\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">The decision to acquire technicians from CSR was made out of necessity. Because of its success in selling computer hardware, the demand for Sarcom\u2019s repair services also increased. Because of this increased demand for service and a tight labor market, Sarcom had to resort to filling its staffing needs through CSR, a temporary employment service. Despite this, Sarcom\u2019s service account manager testified that Sarcom preferred to use its in-house technicians for repair service. This position was reiterated by Sarcom\u2019s field service supervisor, who testified, \u201cThe advantage of using the Sarcom employee, they knew the Sarcom way.\u201d In fact, at least three of Sarcom\u2019s customers prohibited Sarcom from contracting out their repair services. Further, Sarcom paid a higher hourly rate for CSR technicians than for its own technicians. To quote from Justice Pfeifer\u2019s dissent in <em>Bellemar Parts Industries, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 351, 357, 725 N.E.2d 1132, I would find that any benefit received by Sarcom from hiring the CSR technicians was \u201cephemeral at best.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">B. The Benefit to Sarcom\u2019s Customers Was the Labor of the CSR Technicians</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s characterization of the benefit of the CSR technicians received by Sarcom\u2019s customers as \u201cthe end <em>product </em>of [the technicians\u2019] labor: consistently operating computers.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>Sarcom purchased the service of temporary employees from CSR. The benefit of that service was the labor of the CSR technicians. Sarcom did not use the technicians\u2019 labor, but rather resold it to its customers to repair the customers\u2019 computers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Therefore, I believe that Sarcom resold the benefit of the CSR technicians in the same form in which Sarcom received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Even accepting the majority\u2019s characterization of the benefit of the labor of CSR technicians to Sarcom\u2019s customers as \u201cthe end product of that labor: consistently operating computers,\u201d such a benefit is consistent with an example set out in <em>Bellemar </em>that defined a situation where the resale exception applied. In <em>Bellemar </em>the court recognized that its holding did not eliminate the resale exception where the benefit of a purchased service is sold. In characterizing the nature of the benefit that fit within the resale exception, the court in <em>Bellemar </em>gave the following example: \u201c[I]f a service such as landscaping is purchased, the taxpayer need not resell landscaping services to meet the exception, but need only resell the benefit of those services, <em>ie., </em>cared-for grounds.\u201d <em>Id., </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 354, 725 N.E.2d 1132.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In this case, the majority holds that the benefit of the CSR technicians to Sarcom\u2019s customers \u201cwas not the <em>labor </em>of the CSR technicians, but the end <em>product </em>of that labor: consistently operating computers.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>I fail to see how that benefit differs from the cared-for grounds, which would also appear to be the end <em>product </em>of the landscaping services. Therefore, pursuant to the example in <em>Bellemar, </em>the benefit of the CSR technicians, even if characterized as the end <em>product </em>of their labor, should be subject to the resale exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">C. The Majority\u2019s Holding Leads to an Unreasonable Result</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">This court has a duty to construe legislation to avoid unreasonable results. <em>State ex rel. Commt. for the Referendum of Ordinance No. 3543-00 v. White </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 212, 218, 736 N.E.2d 873. As the dissenting member of the Board of Tax Appeals stated, \u201cIf Sarcom had sufficient personnel to provide the same service, no tax would have been levied.\u201d Sarcom hired the CSR technicians to do work that Sarcom employees would have done had Sarcom been able to foresee the demand for computer repair. Sarcom did not receive anything more from the CSR technicians than it would have from its own employees. Sarcom should not be penalized from a tax standpoint for being unable to foresee staffing needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Further, I believe that the majority\u2019s holding results in double taxation. Not only was a use tax imposed on the labor of the CSR technicians, but Sarcom also collects a sales tax from customers for the repair services. Thus, the labor of the CSR technicians was taxed twice. Accordingly, I believe that the majority\u2019s holding leads to an unreasonable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">D. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">Because I believe that (1) Sarcom did not receive a benefit from its hiring of the CSR technicians and (2) Sarcom resold the benefit of the CSR technicians, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>i.e., </em>the technicians\u2019 labor, to its customers in the same form in which it was received, I believe that the resale exception set out in R.C. 5739.01(E)(1) applied. As a result, I do not believe that Sarcom should be taxed on its purchase of the labor of the CSR technicians. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b170-6\"><em>Vorys, Sater, Seymour &amp; Pease, L.L.P., Anthony L. Ehler </em>and <em>Renee C.
