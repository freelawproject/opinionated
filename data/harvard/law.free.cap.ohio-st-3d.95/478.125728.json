After the birth, it was discovered that Matthew had several birth defects.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 13, 1997, St. Vincent and Kahn signed an affiliation agreement memorializing Kahn\u2019s new status as a St. Vincent employee. The agreement also addressed St. Vincent\u2019s obligations to Kahn regarding medical malpractice insurance coverage. On August 4, 1997, Matthew\u2019s parents and Matthew Gerig, by and through his mother, filed a complaint against Kahn,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging that Matthew\u2019s birth defects resulted from medical malpractice committed by Kahn during Matthew\u2019s delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">{\u00b6 2} At the time that the lawsuit was filed, St. Vincent had insured Kahn against medical malpractice claims through P.I.E. Mutual Insurance Company with liability limits up to $4 million. St. Vincent also funded a self-insurance plan to pay malpractice and general liability claims. While the Gerigs\u2019 medical malpractice action was pending, P.I.E. was found to be insolvent, and on March 23, 1998, it was ordered into liquidation pursuant to R.C. 3903.16. The liquidation order prompted appellant Ohio Insurance Guaranty Association (\u201cOIGA\u201d) to get involved in the Gerigs\u2019 malpractice lawsuit. OIGA was created by the Ohio Insurance Guaranty Association Act (\u201cAct\u201d) and pays \u201ccovered claims,\u201d as defined by the Act, brought against insolvent insurance companies. R.C. Chapter 3955.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">{\u00b6 3} Although Kahn had been insured by P.I.E. for malpractice liability up to $4 million, recovery from OIGA is statutorily limited to $300,000. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>pursuant to R.C. 3955.13(A),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> OIGA is obligated to pay claims only after claimants have exhausted their rights under all other insurance policies where recovery is possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">{\u00b6 4} After learning of P.I.E.\u2019s insolvency, the Gerigs reviewed the affiliation agreement and determined that, because of P.I.E.\u2019s insolvency, the agreement required St. Vincent to insure Kahn through its self-insurance plan up to $4 million against medical malpractice claims<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> such as the Gerigs\u2019 that were made after its date.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On September 9, 1999, the Gerigs filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, pursuant to R.C. 2721.03,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> asking the court to declare that the affiliation agreement in fact so required. The Gerigs named St. Vincent, OIGA, and Kahn as defendants in the declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">{\u00b6 5} OIGA also filed a cross-claim' for declaratory judgment against St. Vincent, asking the court to declare that the affiliation agreement between St. Vincent and Kahn required St. Vincent to indemnify Kahn. OIGA further asked the court to declare that, pursuant to R.C. 3955.13(A), OIGA is not obligated to pay any damages that may be awarded to the Gerigs unless and until the Gerigs have exhausted St. Vincent\u2019s self-insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">{\u00b6 6} Kahn filed a counterclaim for declaratory judgment also asking the court to declare that St. Vincent had a contractual duty to allocate $4 million in self-insurance for his indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">{\u00b6 7} St. Vincent, relying on an arbitration clause contained in the affiliation agreement, moved the court to stay the proceedings in the medical malpractice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>action and the declaratory judgment action and also sought an order compelling arbitration of the dispute regarding whether St. Vincent is legally required, pursuant to the agreement, to insure Kahn through its self-insurance plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">{\u00b6 8} The Gerigs and OIGA opposed St. Vincent\u2019s motion, arguing that they could not be compelled to arbitrate the dispute because they were not parties to the affiliation agreement and therefore were not bound by the arbitration clause therein. The trial court denied St. Vincent\u2019s motion to compel arbitration, concluding that, if granted, appellants would be deprived of their right to be heard with regard to the interpretation of the affiliation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">{\u00b6 9} St. Vincent appealed the trial court\u2019s ruling to the Court of Appeals for Lucas County.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court of appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s decision and held that the doctrine of equitable estoppel prevented the Gerigs and OIGA from asserting that the arbitration provision in the agreement should be disregarded while simultaneously asserting that other provisions of the agreement were valid and enforceable. The Gerigs and OIGA appealed the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">{\u00b6 10} The cause is before this court upon our allowance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">{\u00b6 11} The issue in this case is whether signatories to a contract may enforce an arbitration provision against a nonsignatory who seeks a declaration of the signatories\u2019 rights and obligations under the contract. For the reasons that follow, we hold that they may, and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">{\u00b6 12} In their declaratory judgment action, the Gerigs seek a declaration that the affiliation agreement between St. Vincent and Kahn requires St. Vincent to insure Kahn through its self-insurance plan against the Gerigs\u2019 medical malpractice claim. OIGA seeks the same declaration in its cross-claim against St. Vincent. The Gerigs concede that if Kahn were to seek this same declaration, he would be forced to arbitrate the issue pursuant to the agreement\u2019s arbitration provision. The arbitration clause in the affiliation agreement covers this issue and is undeniably broad. Specifically, it provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cAny controversy or claim arising out of, or relating in any way to, this Agreement or the breach thereof shall be resolved by arbitration in the City of Toledo, Ohio, in accordance with the rules then obtaining of the American Arbitration Association.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>{\u00b6 14} The Gerigs and OIGA, however, contend that, as nonsignatories, they are not bound by the arbitration provision. In support of their position, the Gerigs and OIGA rely on the principle that \u201c \u2018arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Council of Smaller Enterprises v. Gates, McDonald &amp; Co. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 661, 665, 687 N.E.2d 1352, quoting <em>United Steelworkers of Am. v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co. </em>(1960), 363 U.S. 574, 582, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">{\u00b6 15} St. Vincent, on the other hand, urges this court to affirm the decision of the court of appeals, wherein the court held that the Gerigs and OIGA are bound by the arbitration provision. The court determined that it would be inequitable to allow the Gerigs and OIGA to avoid a burden of the agreement, i.e., arbitration, while simultaneously seeking a benefit of the agreement, i.e., medical malpractice insurance coverage for Kahn.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">{\u00b6 16} In support of its decision, the court of appeals cited <em>Fawn v. Heritage Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(June 30, 1997), Franklin App. No. 96APE12-1678, 1997 WL 359322. Kim Fawn was injured in an automobile accident while she was operating a vehicle owned by Robert Beach. After settling with the tortfeasor, Fawn sought underinsured motorist coverage from Beach\u2019s insurer, Heritage Mutual Insurance Company. Fawn subsequently sued Heritage, and Heritage moved for a stay pending arbitration pursuant to its contract of insurance with Beach. The trial court denied the motion, and Heritage appealed. The court of appeals reversed, holding that, although she had not signed the contract, Fawn was bound by the arbitration provision because, by accepting the benefit of the contract \u2014 underinsured motorist coverage \u2014 she also accepted its burden \u2014 arbitration. The court held that third-party beneficiaries acquire no greater rights than that provided in the contract. <em>Union S. &amp; L. Co. v. Cook </em>(1933), 127 Ohio St. 26, 186 N.E. 728, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">{\u00b6 17} The Gerigs and OIGA argue that the holding in <em>Fawn </em>is not applicable to this case because, unlike Fawn, they are neither insureds nor third-party beneficiaries of the agreement. They claim instead to be \u201cincidental\u201d beneficiaries with sufficient interest in the affiliation agreement to satisfy the requirement for bringing a declaratory judgment action under R.C. 2721.03 but at the same time too disinterested to be bound by the arbitration provision. We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">{\u00b6 18} We acknowledge that the relationship between Fawn and Heritage was different from the relationship between the parties in this case. We find, however, that the differences make application of the equitable estoppel doctrine even more appropriate here. Unlike Fawn, the Gerigs and OIGA do not have a direct dispute with a signatory regarding their rights under the agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Rather, the Gerigs and OIGA have an interest in Kahn\u2019s dispute with St. Vincent regarding Kahn\u2019s rights under the agreement. Because appellants derive their interest in the agreement through Kahn, they can have no greater right than Kahn to a judicial interpretation of the agreement. <em>Luntz v. Stern </em>(1939), 135 Ohio St. 225, 230, 14 O.O. 62, 20 N.E.2d 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">{\u00b6 19} Moreover, we find that it would be inequitable to allow an interested nonsignatory to determine the forum in which an agreement is to be interpreted when the signatories previously agreed in writing to arbitrate any controversy relating to the agreement. Accordingly, we hold that a signatory to a contract may enforce an arbitration provision against a nonsignatory seeking a declaration of the signatories\u2019 rights and obligations under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">{\u00b6 20} Our holding is in keeping with this court\u2019s long history of favoring and encouraging arbitration. <em>Brennan v. Brennan </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 29, 57 O.O. 71, 128 N.E.2d 89, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Schaefer v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 708, 711, 590 N.E.2d 1242. Moreover, it is consistent with Ohio\u2019s Arbitration Act, codified in R.C. Chapter 2711, which embodies the public policy of supporting arbitration. Specifically, R.C. 2711.01 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cA provision in any written contract * * * to settle by arbitration a controversy that subsequently arises out of the contract * * * shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable * *</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">{\u00b6 22} And R.C. 2711.02(B) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cIf any action is brought upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for arbitration, the court in which the action is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in the action is referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for arbitration, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until the arbitration of the issue has been had in accordance with the agreement * *</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">{\u00b6 24} Furthermore, while the specific issue in this case appears to be one of first impression, we note that many federal and state courts have recognized exceptions to the rule that a person cannot be compelled to arbitrate a dispute which he did not agree to submit to arbitration. See, e.g., <em>Hilti, Inc. v. Oldach </em>(C.A.1, 1968), 392 F.2d 368, 369, fn. 2; <em>Thomsom-CSF, S.A. v. Am. Arbitration Assn. </em>(C.A.2, 1995), 64 F.3d 773, 778; <em>Inernatl. Paper Co. v.

See, also, 2 Macneil, Speidel, and Stipanowich, Federal Arbitration Law (1994), Section 18.7.2.3 (when seeking rights under a contract, a nonsignatory is bound by the contract\u2019s arbitration clause).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AtqO\">Williams, Jilek, Lafferty, Gallagher &amp; Scott Co., L.P.A., and Martin W. Williams, for appellants Matthew Gerig, Dawn Gerig, and LaMar Gerig.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AxXg\">Vorys, Sater, Seymour &amp; Pease, L.L.P., F. James Foley and Rosemary D. Welsh, for appellant Ohio Insurance Guaranty Association.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">{\u00b6 25} We now turn to the second issue raised in OIGA\u2019s cross-claim against St. Vincent. In addition to asking the court to interpret the affiliation agreement and declare that it requires St. Vincent to insure Kahn through its self-insurance plan, OIGA also requests that the court declare St. Vincent\u2019s self-insurance to be \u201cother insurance\u201d within the purview of R.C. 3955.13, such that it must be exhausted before OIGA is obligated to provide coverage. St. Vincent concedes that the exhaustion issue raised by OIGA requires interpretation of statutory language and is not a matter for the arbitrator to decide. Nevertheless, St. Vincent contends that the exhaustion issue is secondary to the coverage issue, and therefore it should also be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">{\u00b6 26} Although the exhaustion issue could be resolved before coverage is determined, the arbitrator\u2019s determination regarding coverage may render the exhaustion issue moot. That is, if the arbitrator determines that the affiliation agreement does not require St. Vincent to insure Kahn through its self-insurance plan, then the determination of whether the exhaustion provision in R.C. 3955.13 applies to St. Vincent\u2019s self-insurance would be irrelevant. Therefore, in the interest of judicial economy, we conclude that the exhaustion issue should be stayed pending the arbitrator\u2019s determination of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">{\u00b6 27} For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b645-10\">Moyer, C.J., Deshler, F.E.
