On November 20, 2000, relator, Lorain County Bar Association, filed a complaint charging that by preparing the quitclaim deeds, respondent, who is not and has never been a lawyer, was engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. Respondent admitted that she had filled out the quitclaim deed forms but denied that she had practiced law. Respondent also admitted that she had notarized the quitclaim deeds before they were submitted to the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">The matter was submitted to the Board of Commissioners on the Unauthorized Practice of Law (\u201cboard\u201d). Based on the stipulations of the parties and a deposition of the proposed grantor, the board found the facts as stated and concluded that respondent\u2019s conduct did constitute the practice of law and recommended that she be enjoined from such further activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">On review, we accept the facts as stipulated. Based upon our holding in <em>Land Title Abstract &amp; Trust Co. v. Dworken </em>(1934), 129 Ohio St. 23, 1 O.O. 313, 193 N.E. 650, we said in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Doan </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 236, 237, 673 N.E.2d 1272, that \u201cthe practice of law embraces the preparation of legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>documents on another\u2019s behalf, including deeds which convey real property.\u201d In preparing quitclaim deeds, respondent was engaged in the practice of law.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Alo\"><em>Marillyn Fagan Damelio, </em>for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AZs\"><em>Mary Ann Rabin, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Of importance to us, although not related to respondent\u2019s practice of law, is her neglect of her duty as a notary. A notary, under R.C. 147.07, has the power to administer oaths and take and certify acknowledgements of deeds. This is an important responsibility. As we said in <em>Lorain Cty. Bar Assn. v. Papcke </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 91, 93, 689 N.E.2d 549, \u201cDocuments acknowledged by [a notary] are self-authenticating. Evid.R. 902(8); Fed.R.Evid. 902(8). A notary who certifies to the affidavit of a person without administering the oath or affirmation to that person as required by R.C. 147.14 is subject to a fine of up to $100 or imprisonment of up to thirty days, or both. R.C. 147.99(B).\u201d For that reason, we recognized that notaries \u201cmust not take a cavalier attitude toward their notary responsibilities and acknowledge the signature of persons who have not appeared before them.\u201d <em>Papcke </em>at 93, 689 N.E.2d 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Respondent is hereby enjoined from further acts that constitute the practice of law. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b279-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
