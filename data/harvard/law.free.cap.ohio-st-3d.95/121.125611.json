Muj\u00e1is, Jr., was moving steel bars with a straddle truck at the Gambrinus Steel Mill of his employer, the Timken Company, appellant. A straddle truck is designed to carry loads of pipe, lumber, and other long materials. With its wide wheelbase and high clearance, it moves materials \u2014 as the name indicates \u2014 by straddling the material and hauling it in the large undercarriage located beneath the elevated cab.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">{\u00b6 2} On this particular vehicle \u2014 the number 40 Hyster \u2014 the cab was on the right side. There was a mirror on the cab\u2019s left side, but not the right. Claimant\u2019s right-side view was further obstructed by Timken\u2019s addition of parts to the vehicle\u2019s right side.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">{\u00b6 3} Shortly after 6:00 a.m., Muj\u00e1is was moving steel from the plant to an outdoor location. He was moving approximately three to four miles an hour as he neared the door. As he approached, he noticed two men to his right. As he made the right turn through the door, his view on that side was blocked by the parts added and he lost sight of the men. He completed the turn only to be flagged down by a frantic coworker who told him that he had just run over someone.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">{\u00b6 4} Fellow employee Carl W. Hammer died of injuries received in that accident. After a workers\u2019 compensation claim was allowed, his widow, Mabel, appellee-claimant herein, sought an additional award, alleging that Timken had committed several violations of specific safety requirements (\u201cVSSR\u201d). On January 5, 1998, appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio, through a staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d), granted the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Timken successfully moved for rehearing based on newly obtained evidence. The second hearing occurred on January 25, 1999, and in a nine-page, single-spaced order, a second SHO found a violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-5-13(F)(1)(d), which reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c(F) Powered industrial trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(1) General requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(d) Trucks shall not be altered so that the relative positions of the various parts are different from what they were when originally received from the manufacturer, nor shall they be altered either by the addition of extra parts not provided by the manufacturer or by the elimination of any parts, except as provided in paragraph (F)(1)(e) of this rule. Additional counterweighting of fork trucks shall not be done unless authorized by the truck manufacturer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">{\u00b6 10} In great detail, the SHO addressed the two primary issues presented \u2014 the applicability of the specific safety requirement and the causal relation between the undisputed alterations and the fatal accident. The applicability of the rule was in dispute because of the absence of a definition within the Ohio Adm.Code for \u201cpowered industrial truck.\u201d As a result, Timken argued that (1) Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-13(F) applied exclusively to forklifts; (2) absent an Ohio Adm.Code definition, the commission was required to use the definition supplied by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (\u201cASME\u201d), which, according to Timken, excluded a straddle truck from its definition of \u201cpowered industrial truck\u201d; and (3) the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) did not consider the straddle truck to be a powered industrial truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">{\u00b6 11} The commission rejected each contention. Addressing Timken\u2019s initial argument, the commission wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cIf the Industrial Commission had intended to limit 4121:l-5-13(F) only to \u2018forklifts\u2019 then the section would be entitled \u2018forklifts\u2019 and not \u2018powered industrial trucks.\u2019 One should note that sections preceding subsection (F) and those subsequent to it list different types of vehicles. For instance, subsection (C) is entitled \u2018general requirements for motor vehicles and mobile mechanized equipment^]\u2019 Subsection (D) refers to haulage vehicles and high lift rider trucks. Subsection (E) is entitled to \u2018Motor vehicles used to transport employees.\u2019 While the employer is correct in pointing out that 4121:l-5-13(F)(l)(d) contains a specific reference to \u2018fork trucks,\u2019 the Staff Hearing Officer rejects the employer\u2019s contention that the reference to \u2018fork trucks\u2019 means that this particular subsection applies exclusively to \u2018fork trucks.\u2019 The Staff Hearing Officer finds that the reference to \u2018fork trucks\u2019 is meant to be included in the general category of \u2018Powered Industrial Trucks,\u2019 given the fact the section is not entitled \u2018fork trucks\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>or \u2018forklifts.\u2019 It is reasonable to assume that due to this detailed list of coverage had the drafters of this rule intended 4121:1 \u2014 5\u201413(F)(1)(d) to apply only to forklifts it would have so stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">{\u00b6 13} As to Timken\u2019s second argument, the commission rejected the assertion that it was required to use the ASME definition. Even if it were to use the definition, the commission rejected as conclusory and without foundation testimony from a Timken witness that indicated that a straddle truck was excluded from the ASME definition. To the contrary, it concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cIt should be noted that Section B56-1-1993 entitled \u2018Safety Standard for Low Lift and High Lift Trucks Appendix,\u2019 on page 49 contains definitions of \u2018forklift\u2019 and \u2018powered industrial truck.\u2019 The definitions are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c \u2018Truck-forklift \u2014 a self loading truck, equipped with load carriage and forks for transporting and tiering loads.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c \u2018Truck-powered industrial \u2014 a mobile power propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack or tier material.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe Staff Hearing Officer finds the fact that ASME provided two different definitions for \u2018forklift\u2019 and \u2018powered industrial truck\u2019 defeats the employer\u2019s earlier argument that \u2018powered industrial truck\u2019 is limited to \u2018forklift truck.\u2019 It appears that powered industrial trucks were meant to cover a much broader spectrum of vehicles than forklifts. On file is page 26 of an industry instruction manual (chapter six-powered industrial trucks) which devotes an inclusionary section to \u2018straddle trucks.\u2019 P. 229 of that same manual indicates that a straddle truck is an industrial truck used to lift and carry large loads. The Staff Hearing Officer finds that \u2018straddle truck\u2019 fits within the definition of a \u2018powered industrial truck\u2019 since it is a \u2018mobile powered propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack or tier material.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c * * * [T]he Staff Hearing Officer further notes that the ASME B56.1 Standard cited by the employer\u2019s counsel would not apply to the Hyster straddle truck because the straddle truck has a 60,000 pound capacity (per the 11/14/1997 affidavit of Robert D. Newman) and the ASME B.56.1 \u2018scope\u2019 section states that the scope of ASME 56.1 only applies to powered industrial trucks with a capacity up to 22,000 capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">{\u00b6 20} A second ASME description was also discarded:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe employer further relies on ASME interpretation 1-28 for its proposition that the straddle truck in question is not a \u2018powered industrial truck.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"ACL\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThis interpretation provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c \u2018Question: What ASME or ANSI standards would apply to a machine that fits the following description?</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>{\u00b6 24} \u201c \u2018The machine is used for moving <em>containers </em>between railroad flatbeds},] trailer trucks, and flatbed trailer trucks where these <em>large containers </em>are moved by rail and then by truck. The function of this piece of equipment is to lift and move <em>containers approximately 35 to JpO feet in length </em>between flatbed railroad cars and flatbed trailer trucks. These containers are quite heavy, weighing between 60,000 and 70,000 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c \u2018This piece of equipment is powered by a diesel engine. It has hydraulic cylinders to operate the arms that <em>lift and lower the containers. </em>The containers are either <em>lifted by attachments to the top of the container or lifted by hanging hooks that connect to the underside of the containers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c \u2018The containers, once attached to the machine, are lifted only about 5 ft. normally. This piece of equipment can travel at a speed of approximately 15 mph and is not normally used on highways but is used on railroad transfer cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c \u2018Reply: It appears that the piece of equipment described above is a type of straddle carrier or van container handler. Neither of these types of vehicles is covered by the B56 Standards and we are not aware of any other standards that would apply.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cThe Staff Hearing Officer finds the employer\u2019s reliance on this interpretation to be misplaced. The straddle truck that the employer uses carries large sections of steel, not containers. It carries its load on internal lifting shoes and guides rather than cables. See the Specification Sheet, dated October 1994, for the straddle truck. The Staff Hearing Officer also finds that Interpretation 1-28 only applies to a container carrier capable of moving containers that are 35-40 feet long. The straddle truck in question is only 20 feet long.\u201d (Emphasis added by SHO.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">{\u00b6 29} Turning finally to Timken\u2019s OSHA assertion, the commission found:</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cLastly, the employer asserts, as one of its defenses, that the Industrial Commission should rely upon the outcome of the OSHA investigation with regard to the classification of the Hyster straddle at issue herein. It should be noted that OSHA initially issued two citations and levied a fine of $10,000. It appears that the OSHA citations were based upon a finding that the straddle truck in question was a \u2018powered industrial truck.\u2019 The employer asserted, on several occasions, the OSHA citation was vacated <em>because </em>OSHA conceded that the Hyster straddle truck was not a powered industrial truck. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">{\u00b631} \u2022\u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c * * * The Staff Hearing Officer finds this assertion to be disturbing for the simple reason that it is, at best, false, and, at worst, intentionally misleading. The Staff Hearing Officer finds that OSHA has <em>never </em>vacated the aforementioned citations based upon a finding that the straddle truck was not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>powered industrial truck. * * * [T]he citations were vacated for an entirely different reason.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">{\u00b6 33} Having found that the rule applied to the straddle lift and that it was violated by the undisputed modification of the straddle truck, the commission turned to proximate cause. Based on the testimony of driver Jimmy Muj\u00e1is, the commission indeed found the requisite connection between the violation and the death, and ordered the maximum award. Reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">{\u00b6 34} Timken petitioned the Court of Appeals for Franklin County to issue a writ of mandamus ordering the commission to vacate its order. The court of appeals rejected each of Timken\u2019s arguments and denied the writ, prompting this appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">{\u00b6 35} All agree that the straddle truck had been altered. Timken challenges the specific safety requirement\u2019s applicability to the straddle truck and, alternatively, the finding of proximate causation. Both objections lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">{\u00b6 36} As to the former, Timken makes two arguments. Absent an Ohio Adm.Code definition for \u201cpowered industrial truck,\u201d the commission, according to Timken, was compelled to accept ASME\u2019s definition. This is false. Where a relevant term is left undefined by the safety code, its interpretation rests solely with the commission. While the commission may rely on an outside definition, it is not required to do so. <em>State ex rel. Go-Jo Industries v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 529, 534, 700 N.E.2d 1264. In the commission\u2019s excellent order, as quoted earlier, the commission set forth the reasoning it used to determine that the straddle truck was a \u201cpowered industrial truck.\u201d It also went a step further in painstakingly explaining why it considered Timken\u2019s interpretation and counterarguments unpersuasive. No more is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">{\u00b6 37} Timken also argues that the points it raised created a reasonable doubt as to the regulation\u2019s applicability and, in so doing, required the commission to interpret the rule in favor of the employer. Timken states a correct proposition of law that does not apply here. Because an award for a VSSR is a penalty, all reasonable doubts as to applicability must indeed be resolved in the employer\u2019s favor. <em>State ex rel. Burton v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 170, 172, 545 N.E.2d 1216. Timken, however, incorrectly presupposes that the introduction of <em>any </em>counterargument or contrary interpretation automatically raises a reasonable doubt as to interpretation. This obviously is not so. In this case, the commission found that Timken\u2019s arguments lacked merit and did not, therefore, raise any doubt as to the applicability of the code section. Accordingly, this contention, too, is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">{\u00b6 38} Timken\u2019s remaining propositions assume that the specific safety requirement is applicable. It initially argues that (F)(l)(d)\u2019s prohibitions are so vague as to offend due process. Specifically, Timken argues that nothing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>specific safety requirement addresses line-of-sight hazards and that the rule therefore \u201cfails to plainly apprise relator of its legal obligation, to wit, that it must protect its employees against whatever dangers may be posed by a partially obstructed line of sight.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Alc\">Day, Ketterer, Raley, Wright &amp; Rybolt, Ltd., Darrell N. Markijohn and Stephen E. Matasich, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AYL\">William F. Mikesell, for appellee Mabel Hammer.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AT7\">Betty D. Montgomery, Attorney General, and Cheryl J. Nester, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">{\u00b6 39} This assertion is meritless. Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-13(F)(l)(d) clearly prohibits the addition of any extra parts except as provided in section (F)(1)(e). Timken\u2019s additions did not fall under (F)(1)(e), so Timken was on clear notice that its alteration violated the specific safety requirement. It does not matter that the hazard posed was not enumerated. What matters is that the proscribed conduct was clearly set forth \u2014 i.e., acceptable alterations were enumerated and Timken\u2019s was not among them.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">{\u00b6 40} Finally, Timken contests the finding of a causal relation between the alterations and the accident. Its argument is based on the fact that no one could actually explain how the decedent happened into the path of a straddle truck. That is immaterial. As stated by the commission, the straddle truck\u2019s driver testified that the added equipment caused him to lose sight of the decedent. Certainly, the commission was entitled to infer that had the driver been able to see the decedent, he would have made an effort to avoid him. It was not, therefore, an abuse of discretion to conclude that the driver\u2019s inability to see the decedent \u2014 which was caused by Timken\u2019s add-on equipment \u2014 resulted in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">{\u00b6 41} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b288-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
