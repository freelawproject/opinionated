Smith, challenges the denial of his application to reopen his direct appeal under App.R. 26(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">{\u00b6 2} Smith was convicted of the aggravated murder of Ronald Lally and sentenced to death. Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the conviction and death sentence. <em>State v. Smith </em>(Mar. 25, 1998), Lorain App. No. 96CA006331, 1998 WL 158966. We also affirmed his conviction and sentence on January 5, 2000. <em>State v. Smith </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 424, 721 N.E.2d 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">{\u00b6 3} Soon afterwards, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to deny Smith\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. <em>State v. Smith </em>(Mar. 15, 2000), Lorain App. No. 98CA007169, 2000 WL 277912. We refused to. accept Smith\u2019s appeal of that decision. <em>State v. Smith </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 1453, 731 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">{\u00b6 4} On July 17, 2001, appellant filed a <em>pro se </em>application for reopening with the court of appeals pursuant to App.R. 26(B) and <em>State v. Murnahan </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204, alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">{\u00b6 5} In denying appellant\u2019s application for reopening, the court of appeals essentially found that Smith had failed to show good cause for filing his application more than ninety days after that court\u2019s judgment was journalized, as required by App.R. 26(B)(2)(b). <em>State v. Smith </em>(Aug. 2, 2001), Lorain App. No. 96CA006331. We then denied Smith\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel to represent him in his application for reopening pursuant to App.R. 26(B) on September 26, 2001. <em>State v. Smith </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 1432, 755 N.E.2d 355. The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Axo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Gregory A. White, Lorain County Prosecuting Attorney, and Jonathan E. Rosenbaum, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">{\u00b6 6} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, albeit for different reasons. The two-pronged analysis found in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, is the appropriate standard to assess whether Smith has raised a \u201cgenuine issue\u201d as to the ineffectiveness of appellate counsel in his request to reopen under App.R. 26(B)(5). See <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 24, 25, 701 N.E.2d 696. To show ineffective assistance, Smith must prove that his counsel were deficient for failing to raise the issues he now presents and that there was a reasonable probability of success had they presented those claims on appeal. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">{\u00b6 7} Moreover, to justify reopening his appeal, Smith \u201cbears the burden of establishing that there was a \u2018genuine issue\u2019 as to whether he has a \u2018colorable claim\u2019 of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Spivey, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 25, 701 N.E.2d 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">{\u00b6 8} <em>Strickland </em>charges us to \u201cappl[y] a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments,\u201d 466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, and to \u201cindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Moreover, we must bear in mind that appellate counsel need not raise every possible issue in order to render constitutionally effective assistance. See <em>Jones v. Barnes </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 745, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987; <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 150, 761 N.E.2d 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">{\u00b6 9} We have reviewed appellant\u2019s four propositions of law alleging, inter alia, deficient performance by appellate counsel. We rejected several of these same arguments on Smith\u2019s appeal before this court. See <em>State v. Smith, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 424, 721 N.E.2d 93. In any case, however, in none of the four propositions of law has Smith raised \u201ca <em>genuine issue </em>as to whether [he] was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal\u201d before the court of appeals, as required under App.R. 26(B)(5). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">{\u00b6 10} Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b290-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
