Specifically, the announcement provided, \u201cThe payroll report for Jan. 1 [1999], to June 30, 1999, payroll period you received with this newsletter reflects a one-time-only 75-percent premium dividend credit. This means you will pay only 25 percent of the premium due.\u201d The administrator\u2019s decision to grant the premium credit was based in part on his determination that the fund contained a surplus of earned premium over all losses that was larger than necessary to adequately safeguard the solvency of the state insurance fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">{\u00b6 2} On April 9, 1999, appellee, United Auto Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of America (\u201cU.A.W.\u201d), filed a complaint in mandamus and/or prohibition with the Tenth District Court of Appeals claiming that appellants exceeded their statutory authority by granting the premium credit without first promulgating rules as mandated by R.C. 4123.32. Appellee sought a peremptory writ of mandamus and/or prohibition ordering appellants to maintain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the funds that have accumulated in the state insurance fund and not to grant the announced one-time-only premium credit for the payroll reporting period of January 1,1999 to June 30, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 3} Pursuant to Civ.R. 53 and Loc.R. 12(M) of the Tenth District Court of Appeals, the matter was referred to a magistrate. The magistrate found that appellants improperly initiated the premium credit without first promulgating a rule. However, the magistrate denied the writ of mandamus, concluding that there was no affirmative relief to which the appellee was entitled. Additionally, the magistrate denied appellee\u2019s writ of prohibition, finding that appellants\u2019 actions were not judicial or quasi-judicial. Appellees filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 4} The court of appeals did not follow the magistrate\u2019s recommendation but instead granted a writ of mandamus on the basis that the premium credit was not a refund of \u201cfuture premiums\u201d as required by R.C. 4123.32(A), and therefore the administrator\u2019s action in granting the premium credit contravened the authority set forth in R.C. 4123.32(A). Appellants appealed to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 5} Seldom do we have such a role reversal as we have in this case. Usually, we have a claimant seeking a ruling that allows or affirms an award for industrial injury. Often, these arguments are based on equity. On the other hand, we usually have employers (and the BWC) insisting that we follow and strictly construe and apply the workers\u2019 compensation statutes no matter how unfair that they might be in an individual claimant\u2019s case and notwithstanding how compelling the equitable arguments of a claimant may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 6} Today, however, we have the BWC and various employers asking us not to apply what appears to be a clear and, by their own admission, unambiguous statute. They argue policy and say that approving the action of the BWC is the \u201cright\u201d thing to do. Where is a court to turn?</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">{\u00b6 7} It appears that the case is neither difficult nor cloudy. The statute is clear, and the law is unambiguous. R.C. 4123.32 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe administrator of workers\u2019 compensation, with the advice and consent of the workers\u2019 compensation oversight commission, <em>shall adopt rules </em>with respect to the collection, maintenance, and disbursements of the state insurance fund including all of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(A) <em>a rule </em>providing that in the event there is developed as of any given rate revision date a surplus of earned premium over all losses which, in the judgment of the administrator, is larger than is necessary adequately to safeguard the solvency of the fund, the administrator may return such excess surplus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>to the subscriber to the fund in either the form of cash refunds or a reduction of <em>future premiums.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 10} The record reflects that the administrator issued the notice on March 11, 1999, granting a premium credit for the payroll period of January 1, 1999 through June 30, 1999. However, at the time that the notice was issued, the premiums from the January 1, 1999 to June 30, 1999 payroll period were already due and owing. Clearly, a premium that has already accrued is not a \u201cfuture premium.\u201d Thus, under any interpretation, strained or otherwise, the reduction announced by the administrator in March 1999 was clearly unlawful, since it was not, as required by R.C. 4123.32(A), the reduction of a \u201cfuture premium.\u201d Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 11} While our decision above is dispositive of this case, we nevertheless review additional grounds for granting the writ of mandamus. As noted, the magistrate for the court of appeals found that in reducing the premiums without first promulgating a rule allowing him to do so, the administrator exceeded his authority. R.C. 4123.32 provides that the administrator of the BWC \u201cshall adopt rules\u201d providing for the refund or reduction of premiums from the state insurance fund. It is undisputed that prior to March 11, 1999, the administrator had not adopted such rules. The authority to refund and/or reduce premiums granted by R.C. 4123.32(A) is not excepted from compliance with the administrative rule-making procedures of R.C. Chapter 119. R.C. 119.01(A). The purpose of the administrative rule-making process provided for by R.C. Chapter 119 is \u201cto permit a full and fair analysis of the impact and validity of a proposed rule.\u201d <em>Condee v. Lindley </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 90, 93, 12 OBR 79, 81, 465 N.E.2d 450, 452. The administrator failed to promulgate rules pursuant to R.C. Chapter 119 in accordance with the mandates of R.C. 4123.32(A) and thereby prevented a full and fair analysis of the impact of the proposed premium reduction credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 12} Appellants contend that the rationale set forth in <em>Dressier Coal CoTp. v. Call </em>(1981), 4 Ohio App.3d 81, 85, 4 OBR 161, 166, 446 N.E.2d 785, 789 (agency permissibly enforced standards with internally developed criteria where previously adopted rules had been enjoined and new rules had not yet been promulgated), and <em>State ex rel. Hoover Co. v. Mihm </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 619, 624, 669 N.E.2d 1130, 1134 (prior to the adoption of new administrative rules, agency permissibly enforced new statutory requirements regardless of whether the new statute invalidated existing agency rules), exempted the administrator from having to follow a mandated rule-making process. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">{\u00b6 13} In both <em>Dressier </em>and <em>Hoover, </em>the agencies had promulgated rules as required by statutory mandates. In the case at bar, the administrator disregarded the mandates of R.C. 4123.32(A) and did not promulgate rules providing for the premium credit. In <em>Hoover, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 624, 669 N.E.2d at 1134, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>court noted that the invalidation of an administrative rule does not leave an agency \u201crudderless\u201d to carry out statutory duties. However, in the case at bar, BWC was not left \u201crudderless\u201d due to the invalidation of an administrative rule, but rather, the administrator simply neglected to promulgate rules mandated by R.C. 4123.32(A). Thus, we find that the rationale of <em>Dressier </em>and <em>Hoover </em>does not support appellants\u2019 contention that an administrator of a state agency may disregard statutory mandates to promulgate agency rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, we hold that, in the absence of a rule promulgated pursuant to the procedures set forth in R.C. Chapter 119, the Administrator of Workers\u2019 Compensation is without authority to refund or reduce premiums pursuant to R.C. 4123.32(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">{\u00b6 15} Some might ask what the U.A.W. had hoped to gain by bringing this cause of action, given that, as noted by appellants in their brief, \u201c[rjelators\u2019 concerns have now become moot, as the BWC has enacted Ohio Admin. Code 4123-17-10 <em>in compliance with the </em>statute.\u201d (Emphasis added.) So what was to be gained? As stated at oral argument by the lawyer for appellee in response to a question posed from Justice Lundberg Stratton, \u201cWe hope to gain, to compel a public figure to obey the law.\u201d The rule of law must not be compromised, and in no instance is the rule of law more vital than when it regulates governmental activity. \u201cThe law is the standard and guardian of our liberty; it circumscribes and defends it; but to imagine liberty without the law, is to imagine every man with his sword in his hand to destroy him, who is weaker than himself; and that would be no pleasant prospect to those who cry out most for liberty.\u201d Edward Hyde (Earl of Clarendon), quoted in Bradley, Daniels, &amp; Jones, Eds., The International Dictionary of Thoughts (1969) 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">{\u00b6 16} Based upon the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Judgment affirmed and writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b573-8\">F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b573-9\">Resnick, J., concurs in syllabus and judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b573-10\">Moyer, C.J., Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b573-11\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ateq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">{\u00b6 17} Once again, a majority of this court has created a special remedy for certain parties who deem themselves relators in an original action seeking an extraordinary writ. Following publication of the majority opinion in this case, we should not wonder that the bench and the bar no longer know the rules that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>should apply to all persons or entities when they seek an order commanding a public official or quasi-public official to perform an act pursuant to his or her duty under the law. Principles of standing and the fundamental elements of a mandamus action that have been a part of our Ohio jurisprudence since its earliest days are no longer applied consistently.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">I. Mandamus is not appropriate if the party has any other adequate specific remedy. <em>Chinn v. Fayette Twp. Trustees </em>(1877), 32 Ohio St. 236, 237, 1877 WL 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">{\u00b6 18} An action in mandamus is proper only when the party requesting the writ pleads and proves (1) that the relator has a clear legal right to the relief requested; (2) that the respondents have a clear legal duty to perform the acts requested; and (3) that the relator suffers an injury for which there is no plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Berger v. McMonagle </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 28, 29, 6 OBR 50, 451 N.E.2d 225. If the court determines that the substance of the writ is actually an injunction, the original action must be dismissed, since this court does not have original jurisdiction in injunction. <em>State ex rel. Pressley v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St.2d 141, 150, 40 O.O.2d 141, 228 N.E.2d 631, citing <em>State ex rel. Stine v. McCaw </em>(1939), 136 Ohio St. 41, 44, 15 O.O. 538, 23 N.E.2d 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 19} In determining the substance of the writ, a court must scrutinize pleadings in order to determine whether the pleadings in an action filed by a party requesting mandamus as a remedy are consistent with the form and the substance of the relief sought. <em>State ex rel. Zupancic v. Limbach </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 130, 132, 568 N.E.2d 1206. A writ of mandamus compels action or commands performance of a duty; a decree of injunction restrains or forbids a performance of a specific act. <em>State ex rel. Smith v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1942), 139 Ohio St. 303, 22 O.O. 349, 39 N.E.2d 838, paragraph two of the syllabus. If a petition is labeled an action in mandamus but actually seeks an injunctive remedy to restrain and enjoin the respondents rather than to compel respondents to perform a .clear legal duty, the petition does not state a cause of action in mandamus, but states a cause of action in injunction. <em>Pressley, </em>11 Ohio St.2d 141, 150, 40 O.O.2d 141, 228 N.E.2d 631, citing <em>McCaw, </em>136 Ohio St. 41, 44, 15 O.O. 538, 23 N.E.2d 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">{\u00b6 20} Until the majority opinion in <em>State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v. Sheward </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 451, 475, 715 N.E.2d 1062, when a party raised the issue of the appropriate application of the test for a mandamus action, courts responded with a consistency that created necessary predictability in determining how a party invokes the original jurisdiction of a court. The cases in which the courts of this state, including this court, have consistently applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>the test for determining whether an original action is a mandamus action would fill volumes of court reports.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">{\u00b6 21} The above test for mandamus is still valid and has been applied after <em>Sheward, </em>albeit with less consistency and predictability than before. See <em>State ex rel. Cunningham v. Amer Cunningham Co., L.P.A. </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 323, 324, 762 N.E.2d 1012; <em>State ex rel. Phillips v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 535, 537, 757 N.E.2d 319. In <em>Cunningham, </em>we held that in determining the true objects of a claimed action in mandamus, we must examine the complaint \u201c \u2018to see whether it actually seeks to prevent, rather than to compel, official action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cunningham, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 324, 762 N.E.2d 1012, quoting <em>State ex rel. Stamps v. Montgomery Cty. Automatic Data Processing Bd. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 164, 166, 538 N.E.2d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">{\u00b6 22} Applying this test as recently as February 27, 2002, we unanimously held that although the relator attempted to couch the allegations of his complaint in terms of compelling affirmative duties on the part of respondent law firm, i.e., to <em>remove </em>relator\u2019s surname from the firm name, \u201cit is evident that the true objects of [relator\u2019s] complaint for a writ of mandamus are a declaratory judgment that [respondent law firm\u2019s] retention of his name violates Gov.Bar R. 111(2) and DR 2-102 and a prohibitory injunction preventing [respondent law firm] from using his name in its firm name.\u201d <em>Cunningham, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 324, 762 N.E.2d 1012. We held that the court of appeals properly dismissed the mandamus complaint. Id. Language from the merit briefs and/or the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>itself may reveal that relator really wants <em>to prevent conduct </em>rather than to <em>compel an act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">{\u00b6 23} Finally, if the mandamus action does not provide effective relief unless accompanied by an ancillary preventive injunction, injunction rather than mandamus is the appropriate remedy. <em>State ex rel. Walker v. Bowling Green </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 391, 392, 632 N.E.2d 904. In <em>Walker, </em>the relators requested a writ of mandamus to compel a city and its officials to reapportion ward boundaries and to declare the current ward system unconstitutional. The court held that \u201cwere this court to find the city\u2019s apportionment plan unconstitutional, mandamus would not provide effective relief unless accompanied by an ancillary preventive or prohibitory injunction\u201d and that \u201c[ajlthough [relators\u2019 request for relief is] stated in positive language, the essence of such a request is to enjoin the city from conducting any future elections under the present apportionment system.\u201d Id. at 393, 632 N.E.2d 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 24} At issue is relator\u2019s request, as characterized by the majority opinion, for the court to order appellants \u201cnot to grant\u201d the announced one-time-only premium credit. Specifically, relator asks the court to order appellants \u201cnot to grant the announced one-time-only premium dividend for private employers who pay premiums to the state insurance fund for the payroll-reporting period dating from January 1, 1999 to June 30, 1999.\u201d <em>Smith </em>held that a request for the Industrial Commission to cease disbursing funds was a request for an injunction, not a writ of mandamus, and was not within the original jurisdiction of the court. <em>Smith, </em>139 Ohio St. at 303, 22 O.O. 349, 39 N.E.2d 838, paragraph three of the syllabus. I would find that relator\u2019s purpose is identical to that of <em>Smith </em>in that both sought to prevent an alleged disbursement from the state insurance fund. As what the relator seeks is an injunction, I would dismiss the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">II. Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">{\u00b625} The instant action also fails under a simple standing test. Relator must first establish standing to sue. Even in <em>Sheward, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 451, 469, 715 N.E.2d 1062, the majority held that the relator first must establish standing to seek a remedy. Standing is satisfied when a party has a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy. <em>State ex rel. Dallman v. Franklin Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1973), 35 Ohio St.2d 176, 178-79, 64 O.O.2d 103, 298 N.E.2d 515. In <em>Sheward, </em>the majority held, \u201cWhere the object of an action in mandamus and/or prohibition is to procure the enforcement or protection of a public right, the relator need not show any legal or special individual interest in the result, it being sufficient that the relator is an Ohio citizen and, as such, interested in the execution of the laws of this state.\u201d <em>Sheward, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 451, 715 N.E.2d 1062, paragraph one of the syllabus. Relator argues that the \u201cpublic right\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>involved in the instant case is in the execution of Ohio laws by public officials and agencies. I disagree.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AKQ\">Stephen E. Mindzak, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">{\u00b6 26} Relator\u2019s reliance on <em>Sheward </em>to short-circuit the requirement of legal or special individual interest is simply incorrect. <em>Sheward </em>carved out a very narrow exception for \u201c \u2018the <em>rare and extraordinary case\u2019 </em>where the challenged statute operates <em>\u2018directly and broadly to divest the courts of judicial power.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis sic.) <em>State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v. Sheward, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 504, 715 N.E.2d 1062. This \u201cpublic right doctrine\u201d involves a usurpation of judicial power. Id. at 474, 715 N.E.2d 1062. \u201cThe private litigant must generally show that he or she has suffered or is threatened with direct or concrete injury in a manner or degree different from that suffered by the public in general, that the law in question has caused the injury, and that the relief requested will redress the injury.\u201d Id. at 469-70, 715 N.E.2d 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 27} The Franklin County Court of Appeals in <em>Bowers v. Ohio State Dental Bd. </em>(2001), 142 Ohio App.3d 376, 381, 755 N.E.2d 948, discretionary appeal not allowed (2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 1417, 754 N.E.2d 262, emphasized that \u201c[a]pplication of the public action rule of standing * * * is limited, and not all alleged illegalities or irregularities rise to that level. Therefore, courts entertain such actions only where the alleged wrong affects the citizenry as a whole, involves issues of great importance and interest to the public at large, and the public injury by its refusal would be serious.\u201d The court noted that \u201c[t]he vast majority of such cases involve voting rights and ballot disputes.\u201d In <em>Boioers, </em>the mandamus action was brought by dentists to compel the dental board to adopt an administrative rule specifying which exams the board would accept for licensure in Ohio. The court found that although the issues may tangentially affect the citizens of Ohio as a whole, they were not of sufficient importance to the general public to fall within the <em>Sheward </em>exception to the general standing requirement of specific personal injury to the litigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 28} In the instant case, there is no usurpation of judicial power. The disbursement of funds through the dividend is merely a reduction in employer premium payments and does not involve any divestment of judicial power of the courts. Because the majority has created a remedy in this case, for this relator, that is supported by no principle of law, and because consistent application of fundamental tests to determine standing and mandamus will be jeopardized by the majority\u2019s opinion, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b577-8\">Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AIr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Betty D.
