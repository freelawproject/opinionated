The trial court sentenced LaMar to death for four of these murders. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">{\u00b6 2} On the afternoon of April 11, 1993, a group of Muslim inmates seized control of cellblock \u201cL\u201d (\u201cL-Block\u201d) at SOCF. The rioting inmates took several guards hostage and locked inmates considered \u201csnitches\u201d into various cells in the L-6 section of L-Block. The Muslim inmates maintained control of unit L-6 while two other dominant groups \u2014 the Aryan Brotherhood (a racist group of white inmates) and the Black Gangster Disciples (a prison gang) \u2014 controlled other units within L-Block.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">{\u00b6 3} On the day of the riot, LaMar was an SOCF inmate serving a sentence of eighteen years to life for a 1989 murder conviction. LaMar, who was not a Muslim, did not plan or participate in the prison takeover and was in the prison recreation yard when the riot began. But after the commotion began, LaMar and two other inmates, Louis Jones and Derek Cannon, went back inside L-Block to check the personal belongings in their respective cells. When the three were unable to get back outside because the Muslims had closed access to and from L-Block, LaMar said to Jones and Cannon, \u201cAin\u2019t no need in us staying in here getting caught up in something we\u2019re not a part of. Let\u2019s kill all the snitches and get out to the yard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">{\u00b6 4} LaMar approached Cecil Allen, a leader of the Muslim group of inmates, and asked, \u201cif we kill the snitches, could we be let out to the yard so we don\u2019t be a part of this?\u201d Allen consulted with the Muslim leadership and returned a few minutes later to tell LaMar that the \u201corders has [sic] been granted to kill the snitches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>{\u00b6 5} After Allen granted permission to \u201ckill the snitches,\u201d LaMar, Jones, and Cannon walked around the L-Block corridor to enlist other inmates to help them. Eventually, the group recruited Hiawatha Frezzell (a.k.a. \u201cPittsburgh\u201d), Eric Scales (a.k.a. \u201cTiger\u201d), Derrick Mathews, Rasheem Matthews, Albert Young (a.k.a. \u201cDa-Da\u201d), and Gregory Curry to join the newly formed death squad. LaMar\u2019s group proceeded to unit L-2, where they retrieved bats, shovels, and weight bars to use as weapons. The men also wore masks fashioned from T-shirts, towels, and bandannas.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">{\u00b6 6} After arming and disguising themselves, LaMar and his group returned to L-6. Inmate Timothy Grinnell was operating the console that controlled the cell doors within L-6. LaMar led his group to the upper tier of the cellblock and instructed Grinnell to open a cell occupied by Andre Stockton. After Grinnell complied with the demand, LaMar and Curry entered the cell and beat Stockton with a shovel and a baseball bat. Other members of the group dragged Stockton from the cell and participated in the beating.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">{\u00b6 7} After beating Stockton, the group went downstairs to the lower tier of L-6. LaMar yelled at Grinnell to open the cells occupied by inmates Ellis Walker and Darrell Depina. After Walker refused to comply with LaMar\u2019s command to come out of the cell, LaMar and Curry dragged him to the main floor of the cellblock and beat him repeatedly. Other members of the death squad also participated in Walker\u2019s beating. LaMar then ordered Depina out of his cell. When Depina refused, LaMar entered the cell and hit him several times before dragging him to the main floor, as he had done with Walker. LaMar continued to beat Depina with a baseball bat, striking him several times. Other members of LaMar\u2019s group joined in beating Depina, who died from his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">{\u00b6 8} When LaMar finished beating Depina, he ordered Grinnell to open a cell occupied by Bruce Vitale. When Vitale refused to come out of the cell, LaMar hit him on the head with a shovel. LaMar continued beating Vitale on the head and at one point knocked a tooth out of Vitale\u2019s mouth. Vitale tried to defend himself by crawling under the bed, but LaMar and Curry dragged him out of the cell and continued the beating, joined by other members of the death squad. At one point, LaMar told Jones, \u201cI didn\u2019t bring you all in here to stand around,\u201d when he noticed that Jones was not participating in the assault. Vitale was still alive when the group left him but died after Frezzell and another member of LaMar\u2019s group stabbed and beat him again.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">{\u00b6 9} LaMar continued on to a nearby cell occupied by Thomas Taylor, another suspected snitch. Before LaMar could order Taylor\u2019s cell opened, a Muslim inmate named Harris intervened and told LaMar that Taylor was under Muslim protection. LaMar angrily pushed Harris out of the way, saying, \u201cIf he [Taylor] is in there, he\u2019s a snitch. Fuck it. Kill him.\u201d After Taylor told LaMar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>that he was not a snitch, LaMar agreed to spare Taylor\u2019s life, but only if Taylor would kill Albert Staiano, who was locked in an adjacent cell, To save his own life, Taylor agreed. LaMar ordered Taylor\u2019s and Staiano\u2019s cells opened and commanded one of the other inmates to give a baseball bat to Taylor. Staiano tried to run from his cell, but fell to the ground when Frezzell tripped him. Taylor hit Staiano over the head several times with the baseball bat and then, after the bat broke, with a fire extinguisher. Other death-squad members, not including LaMar, joined in the assault and stabbed Staiano repeatedly. When the beating ended, LaMar ordered Taylor to return to his cell. Taylor eventually pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter for his role in Staiano\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">{\u00b6 10} The death squad\u2019s next stop was a cell occupied by Michael Trocadero and four to five other inmates. LaMar ordered Grinnell to open the cell, but Grinnell refused, saying that the Muslim leadership did not want those inmates killed. As LaMar and his group began to leave L-6, it passed the cell of William Svette, an elderly inmate who used a walker to move himself around. Svette, who appeared to have been beaten earlier, cursed the death squad with obscenities and racial epithets. On LaMar\u2019s order, Grinnell opened Svette\u2019s cell, where LaMar and Curry beat Svette over the head with a baseball bat and a shovel. LaMar started to leave the cell but returned to beat Svette again after noticing that Svette\u2019s legs were moving.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">{\u00b6 11} Svette remained alive after the death squad left his cell. A short time later, on Grinnell\u2019s instructions to make sure all of the victims in L-6 were dead, inmate Eric Girdy struck Svette across the head twice more with a baseball bat. Svette continued to live after Girdy\u2019s beating and was still alive after inmate Robert Bass, on orders from one of the Muslim inmates, dragged Svette\u2019s body to a ramp near a prison recreation area. Svette eventually died after yet another inmate, Freddie Frakes, beat him yet again with a baseball bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">{\u00b6 12} After finishing their rampage, LaMar and the others left L-Block and joined the large contingent of inmates gathered in the recreation yard. Many of the participants in the L-6 killings remained together and discussed what had transpired. During this time, LaMar saw inmate Dennis Weaver in the recreation yard and told Curry, \u201cI wish Weaver was in there. I\u2019d have killed him, too.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">{\u00b6 13} Early the following morning, law enforcement officers surrounded the approximately three hundred inmates gathered in the recreation yard and herded them to a gymnasium on the SOCF grounds, where the inmates were handcuffed and taken to various cells around the prison. LaMar occupied a cell in K-Block with nine other inmates: Scales, Frezzell, Weaver, William \u201cGeno\u201d Washington, Jeffrey Mack, Michael Childers, Ricky Rutheford, William Bowling, and John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Malveaux. These ten inmates remained in the cell without incident for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">{\u00b6 14} The next day, however, tensions began rising in the cell. LaMar and Scales began harassing Weaver, accusing him of being a snitch and telling him that \u201call snitches should be killed.\u201d Weaver denied being a snitch and urged his fellow cellmates to protest what he perceived as mistreatment of the inmates who were not involved in the riot. LaMar became incensed by Weaver\u2019s comments, yelled \u201cshut up, snitch,\u201d punched Weaver in the face, and relegated him to a corner of the cell. Scales and Mack also joined in the attack on Weaver. LaMar later ordered that Weaver, Malveaux, Bowling, and Childers be tied up.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">{\u00b6 15} Later that day, LaMar announced to the cellmates that \u201cI want Mr. Weaver dead. I want that snitch dead right now.\u201d LaMar then accused Bowling of being a snitch and threatened to kill Bowling if Bowling did not kill Weaver. LaMar untied Bowling, handed him some string, and watched Bowling choke Weaver. LaMar also threatened Rutheford, who then aided Bowling in the assault by holding Weaver\u2019s feet. LaMar became impatient with Bowling\u2019s progress and told Childers, \u201c[I]f you want to live, if you ain\u2019t no snitch, then you help kill him.\u201d LaMar then untied Childers, who complied with LaMar\u2019s order by choking Weaver, using the ropes with which LaMar had tied Childers\u2019s wrists. When Childers began hitting and kicking Weaver, LaMar told him to \u201cjust strangle him\u201d because LaMar wanted \u201cto make it look like he hung hisself.\u201d LaMar aided Childers by stuffing toilet paper and pieces of plastic down Weaver\u2019s throat in an effort to silence him. Weaver eventually died while Childers was choking him.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">{\u00b6 16} After Weaver died, LaMar instructed Bowling and Malveaux to move the body to a corner of the cell. He also ordered them to tie a string from a cell mattress around Weaver\u2019s neck \u201cand hook it to the coat hook to make it look like a suicide.\u201d And before corrections officers removed Weaver\u2019s body, LaMar instructed everyone in the cell to tell them that Weaver had killed himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">{\u00b6 17} The grand jury indicted LaMar on nine counts of aggravated murder for his role in the deaths of Depina, Vitale, Staiano, Svette, and Weaver. Five of the aggravated-murder counts alleged that LaMar killed each of the victims with prior calculation and design. R.C. 2903.01(A). The remaining counts charged LaMar with murdering Depina, Vitale, Staiano, and Svette while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping. R.C. 2903.01(B). In addition, the grand jury charged LaMar with four death-penalty specifications attached to the first eight counts of the indictment: R.C. 2929.04(A)(4) (murder committed in a detention facility); (A)(5) (prior murder conviction); (A)(5) (murdering two or more victims); (A)(7) (murder committed while committing or attempting to commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>kidnapping). The ninth count, charging Weaver\u2019s murder, alleged only three of these specifications; it did not charge LaMar with the kidnapping specification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">{\u00b6 18} At trial, LaMar testified on his own behalf and denied committing any of the five murders. LaMar testified that he was in the recreation yard when the riot began and went back inside L-6 briefly to get his personal belongings. LaMar explained that while inside, he spoke briefly with Allen after Grinnell had accused LaMar of trying to \u201cget guys out the cells.\u201d According to LaMar, Allen did not believe Grinnell and allowed LaMar to leave the cellblock. LaMar testified that he returned to the recreation yard and never went back into L-6 that day. He told the jury that he stayed in the recreation yard until the early morning hours of April 12, when corrections officers and state troopers surrounded the yard and ordered the inmates into the gymnasium. LaMar\u2019s alibi testimony was corroborated by four inmate witnesses who each testified to having seen and talked to LaMar in the yard during the early stages of the riot.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">{\u00b6 19} LaMar also testified to the events surrounding Weaver\u2019s murder, which took place after officers placed the two men, along with eight others, in a holding cell in K-Block. LaMar stated that he and Scales argued with Bowling about the distribution of food and admitted to punching Bowling in the face. He denied, however, tying up other inmates or assaulting Weaver. According to LaMar, Bowling tied up Childers and started punching Weaver after Weaver came to Childers\u2019s defense. LaMar testified that Bowling then grabbed Weaver around the neck in a \u201chalf Nelson\u201d until Weaver lost consciousness. Bowling then untied Childers, who also choked Weaver until Weaver died. LaMar admitted lying to investigators about the events leading to Weaver\u2019s death, but said that he lied because he didn\u2019t \u201cwant nothing to do with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">{\u00b6 20} Two defense witnesses corroborated LaMar\u2019s account of Weaver\u2019s murder. Inmate Cory Perkins, who was in an adjacent cell, testified that he heard Bowling call Weaver a \u201csnitch.\u201d Perkins also testified that he heard someone else in the cellblock suggest that Weaver be killed. William Washington, who was in the K-Block cell with LaMar and Weaver, also corroborated LaMar\u2019s story by identifying Bowling and Childers as the inmates who killed Weaver. According to Washington, LaMar did not touch Weaver, did not order anyone to hurt Weaver, and did not say anything about Weaver. On cross-examination, however, the prosecution impeached Washington with a prior statement in which he identified LaMar as one of Weaver\u2019s assailants.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">{\u00b6 21} The jury returned guilty verdicts on all the charges and specifications alleged in the indictment. Following the penalty-phase proceedings, the jury recommended the death penalty for the murders of Depina, Vitale, Svette, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Weaver. For Staiano\u2019s murder, the jury found that LaMar should be sentenced to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after thirty years. The trial court issued a sentencing opinion in which it agreed with the jury\u2019s recommendation and sentenced LaMar to death for the murders of Depina, Vitale, Svette, and Weaver. LaMar appealed to the Fourth District Court of Appeals, asserting nineteen assignments of error. The court of appeals overruled each of the assignments and affirmed the convictions and death sentence. The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">II. Settled Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">{\u00b6 22} LaMar presents twenty propositions of law for our review. Although R.C. 2929.05 grants a capital defendant an appeal of right to this court, we are not required to discuss in opinion form each proposition raised in the appeal. <em>State v. Davis </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 107, 110, 666 N.E.2d 1099. We may therefore summarily overrule those propositions of law that this court has previously resolved and address only those issues that warrant discussion. Id. See, also, <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 520 N.E.2d 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">{\u00b6 23} Accordingly, we summarily overrule LaMar\u2019s eighteenth proposition of law challenging the constitutionality of death-penalty proportionality review under R.C. 2929.05. See, e.g., <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 118, 684 N.E.2d 668; <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph one of the syllabus. We also overrule LaMar\u2019s twentieth proposition of law, which challenges the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s deathrpenalty statutory scheme on various grounds. We have considered all of these arguments and summarily reject them. See, e.g., <em>State v. Stallings </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 280, 297, 731 N.E.2d 159; <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 371-372, 582 N.E.2d 972; <em>State v. Seiber </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 4, 15-16, 564 N.E.2d 408. In neither proposition does LaMar offer any arguments that this court has not already rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">III. Pretrial Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">A. Failure to Disclose Exculpatory Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">{\u00b6 24} In his first proposition of law, LaMar asserts that the state failed to disclose material evidence tending to exculpate him in the murders, thereby denying him his constitutional right to a fair trial. See <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. Prior to trial, LaMar\u2019s counsel asked the state to produce all evidence of an exculpatory nature, as required by Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f). The state\u2019s response did not provide a complete list of inmate statements, purportedly because of concerns about the safety of inmates who had given statements to law enforcement about the events of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>SOCF riot. Instead, the state submitted to the trial court an eleven-page document containing summaries of inmate interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">{\u00b6 25} At a pretrial hearing, the trial court read summaries of inmate statements from the bench and, with a few exceptions, did not identify who made them. The contents of the summaries varied widely, ranging from useless information (e.g., \u201cHe was in a cell adjoining K-2-36 but gave no useful information\u201d) to pure speculation (e.g., \u201cHe was in an adjoining cell to K-2-36 and heard a commotion and thought Weaver hung himself\u2019) to statements with exculpatory value (e.g., \u201che observed Eskridge kill Svette in L-corridor\u201d; \u201c[h]e was in an adjoining cell * '* * and identified Greg Curry telling Keith LaMar to kill Weaver because he was a snitch\u201d). Many of the statements, however, corroborated LaMar\u2019s participation in the killings, while other statements named other assailants without eliminating LaMar as a participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">{\u00b6 26} After reading all of the summaries, the trial court granted a continuance to the defense and authorized funds for a second defense investigator to conduct additional interviews of inmate witnesses. The trial court did not, however, require the prosecution to provide the full statements (i.e., contents of the statement with the name of the inmate who gave it) to the defense. Instead, the court ordered the prosecution to provide the defense with the names of forty-three inmates who gave statements to law enforcement. Although the prosecution complied with the trial court\u2019s directive and provided a list of forty-three names, it did not match the statements with the names supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">{\u00b6 27} Suppression by the prosecution of evidence that is favorable to the accused and \u201cmaterial either to guilt or to punishment\u201d is a violation of due process. <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. Evidence suppressed by the prosecution is \u201cmaterial\u201d within the meaning of <em>Brady </em>only if there exists a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the result of the trial would have been different had the evidence been disclosed to the defense. <em>Kyles v. Whitley </em>(1995), 514 U.S. 419, 433-434, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490; see, also, <em>United States v. Bagley </em>(1985), 473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481. As the United States Supreme Court has stressed, \u201cthe adjective [\u2018reasonable\u2019] is important. The question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490; see, also, <em>Strickler v. Greene </em>(1999), 527 U.S. 263, 289-290, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">{\u00b6 28} Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the prosecution \u201csuppressed\u201d the evidence LaMar complains of within the meaning of <em>Brady</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we find no due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>violation. On the record before us, we find no reasonable probability of a different trial outcome had the defense received the full statements. Many of the statements identified LaMar as a participant in the murders. And statements identifying other inmates as participants did not exculpate LaMar because each victim had been attacked by multiple assailants. Cf. <em>State v. Waddy </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 433, 588 N.E.2d 819 (holding evidence not to be material within the meaning of <em>Brady </em>when the evidence did not eliminate the defendant as the perpetrator). Finally, with respect to murders in cellblock L-6, none of the statements assisted LaMar\u2019s alibi defense (i.e., that LaMar was in the recreation yard at the time of the killings). In short, nothing in the contents of the statements \u201ccould reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 435, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">{\u00b6 29} As a separate <em>Brady </em>claim, LaMar argues that the trial court should have found a <em>Brady </em>violation and granted his motion for a new trial after defense counsel discovered that the prosecution had provided complete inmate statements \u2014 the same material the defense had requested at the pretrial hearing in LaMar\u2019s case \u2014 in the criminal trials of two other SOCF inmates (Derek Cannon and Rasheem Matthews). LaMar argues that the disclosure in these two noncapital cases undercuts the prosecution\u2019s proffered reason (i.e., inmate safety) for failing to disclose the information in his case. As we stated above, however, the statements were not material to LaMar\u2019s case within the meaning of <em>Brady. </em>We therefore reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">{\u00b6 30} In his final <em>Brady </em>claim, LaMar claims that he should have received a new trial in light of evidence the defense discovered after trial. The evidence consisted of (1) Ohio State Highway Patrol summaries of two statements given by inmate Willie Kastner to investigators and (2) transcripts of interviews conducted by law enforcement officers with inmates David Hackett, Tyronne Golphin, Gerald Kelly, William Turner, and Daniel Davidson. These witnesses identified several persons other than LaMar as being involved in the murders of Vitale, Staiano, Depina, and Svette. LaMar further notes that the interviews with Hackett and Davidson suggest that Vitale and Staiano may not have been dead at the time their assailants left L-6. Because the state failed to disclose these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>potentially exculpatory statements, LaMar argues that there has been a <em>Brady </em>violation warranting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">{\u00b6 31} We reject this <em>Brady </em>claim for reasons similar to the ones we stated above. While these statements identified other inmates, none of them exonerated LaMar. At best, these witnesses established that there were several persons who joined in beating the L-6 victims to death. The state\u2019s theory all along was that LaMar was one of many assailants who participated in murdering the victims in L-6. Therefore, the existence of this evidence does not undermine our confidence in the trial outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">{\u00b6 32} Finding no <em>Brady </em>violation that would warrant reversal, we reject LaMar\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">B. Allegations of a Biased Judge</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">{\u00b6 33} The trial court\u2019s treatment of the exculpatory evidence complained of in the first proposition of law also forms the basis of LaMar\u2019s second proposition of law. Because of the trial judge\u2019s actions, LaMar contends that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">{\u00b6 34} It is well settled that a criminal trial before a biased judge is fundamentally unfair and denies a defendant due process of law. See <em>Rose v. Clark </em>(1986), 478 U.S. 570, 577, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460; <em>Tumey v. Ohio </em>(1927), 273 U.S. 510, 534, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749. We have described judicial bias as \u201ca hostile feeling or spirit of ill will or undue friendship or favoritism toward one of the litigants or his attorney, with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will' be governed by the law and the facts.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt </em>(1956), 164 Ohio St. 463, 58 O.O. 315, 132 N.E.2d 191, paragraph four of the syllabus; see, also, <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Cleary </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 191, 201, 754 N.E.2d 235. LaMar argues that the trial judge exhibited bias by \u201cactually aid[ing] the prosecution in intermingling names, adding irrelevant inmate names and generally obfuscating the information that appellant was clearly entitled to.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">{\u00b6 35} We first note that LaMar did not raise the issue of judicial bias in his appeal to the court of appeals. He has therefore forfeited this claim. <em>State v. Jalowiec </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 220, 224, 744 N.E.2d 163. Moreover, LaMar failed to avail himself of the procedures described in R.C. 2701.03, which allows a party to file an affidavit of bias and prejudice with this court seeking disqualification of a biased judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">{\u00b6 36} Even if LaMar had raised this issue before the court of appeals, we would find no merit to his contention. LaMar relies on a general characterization of unfairness\u2018and bias by the trial court during the March 6,1995 pretrial hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>to support his claim, without referring to any specific evidence of bias. But viewing the transcript as a whole, and taking all of the judge\u2019s comments in them proper context, we see nothing to suggest that the trial court harbored a hostile feeling of ill will toward either LaMar or his attorneys during the course of the trial. We accordingly reject the second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">C. Pretrial Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">{\u00b6 37} As a branch of his fourth proposition of law (alleging prosecutorial misconduct in various respects), LaMar argues that the prosecution improperly withheld discovery before trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, LaMar alleges that the prosecutor (1) ignored the trial court\u2019s order to provide transcripts of statements given by inmate witnesses, (2) repeatedly refused the trial court\u2019s orders to fully answer defense interrogatories in support of the defense\u2019s motion to dismiss on selective-prosecution grounds, and (3) failed to disclose summaries of inmate statements on grounds of \u201cconfidentiality\u201d and inmate safety, only to turn them over in other cases. We construe LaMar\u2019s argument, which asserts many of the same claims raised in the first proposition of law, as asserting violations of the discovery provisions contained in Crim.R. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">{\u00b6 38} Violations of Crim.R. 16 by the prosecution may result in reversible error only upon a showing that (1) the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose was a willful violation of the rule, (2) foreknowledge of the information would have benefited the accused in preparing a defense, and (3) the accused has suffered prejudice. <em>State v. Joseph </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 450, 458, 653 N.E.2d 285. For the reasons we stated in overruling the first proposition of law, LaMar cannot establish prejudice because there was no reasonable probability of a different trial result even if the prosecution had disclosed the inmate statements LaMar complains of. And as for the prosecutor\u2019s alleged failure to answer defense interrogatories relevant to LaMar\u2019s selective-prosecution claim, LaMar\u2019s claim likewise fails. As we shall explain infra in disposing of the seventh proposition of law, LaMar did not make a prima facie showing of selective prosecution. Because he did not produce credible evidence of selective prosecution, he was not entitled to discovery on the issue. <em>United States v. Armstrong </em>(1996), 517 U.S. 456, 468-469, 116 S.Ct. 1480, 134 L.Ed.2d 687. We accordingly reject LaMar\u2019s pretrial-discovery argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">D. Limitations on Jury Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">{\u00b6 39} LaMar\u2019s third proposition of law attacks the trial court\u2019s actions during jury selection. He argues that the trial court unreasonably and arbitrarily prevented him from \u201cinquiring into' proper subjects of <em>voir dire </em>including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>factors affecting credibility, the meaning of the presumption of innocence, defendant\u2019s right to remain silent, the burden of proof, and the juror\u2019s ability to follow instructions.\u201d LaMar cites numerous instances from voir dire when the trial court sustained prosecution objections to defense counsel\u2019s questions relating to areas such as (1) a potential juror\u2019s methods of evaluating a witness\u2019s credibility, (2) whether the juror could convict just because LaMar presented no evidence, and (3) how a juror would feel if LaMar did not testify at trial. At one point, the trial court fined one of LaMar\u2019s attorneys $50 after the attorney, in apparent frustration, complained (in the presence of the jury venire) that he was \u201cnot getting a fair trial in this case\u201d if he was not allowed to delve into certain- areas with the potential jurors during voir dire.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">{\u00b6 40} Crim.R. 24 and R.C. 2945.27 afford both prosecution and defense counsel the opportunity to conduct reasonable voir dire of prospective jurors. Nevertheless, the length and scope of voir dire fall within a trial court\u2019s sound discretion and vary depending on the circumstances of a given case. <em>State v. Lundgren </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 481, 653 N.E.2d 304. Accordingly, we will not find prejudicial error in how the trial court qualified venirepersons \u201cas fair and impartial jurors\u201d unless the appellant can show \u201ca clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Cornwell </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 560, 565, 715 N.E.2d 1144; see, also, <em>State v. Beuke </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 29, 39, 526 N.E.2d 274. A trial court does not abuse its discretion unless it acts arbitrarily, unreasonably, or unconscionably. <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">{\u00b6 41} We find no abuse of discretion warranting reversal in this case. The voir dire limitations cited by LaMar paint an incomplete picture of how the trial court conducted the jury-selection process. At one point, when defense counsel expressed concerns that the trial court was limiting his ability to ask jurors \u201cwhat their opinion will be if [LaMar] does not take the stand,\u201d the court agreed to allow him to inquire into this area with appropriate questions phrased in terms of the jurors\u2019 ability to follow instructions. The trial court also reconsidered its position on objections previously sustained and allowed the defense to \u201cget back into that area [of credibility].\u201d As a result, the defense was allowed to ask numerous questions of prospective jurors about their methods of assessing credibility, how they would feel if LaMar exercised his right to refuse to testify, and their views on the concept of reasonable doubt. Thus, notwithstanding LaMar\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the record shows that defense counsel was allowed some latitude to explore these areas. Viewed in its entirety, we find no undue restriction in the manner the trial court conducted voir dire and therefore reject LaMar\u2019s third proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>E. Selective Prosecution</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">{\u00b6 42} In the seventh proposition of law, LaMar contends that he is the victim of selective prosecution. LaMar, who is African-American, argues that the trial court should have dismissed the indictment against him on grounds that the state chose to prosecute him for capital offenses because of his race. Although the state prosecuted numerous inmates for murders committed during the SOCF riot, LaMar states that he was the only inmate charged with capital murder for killing other inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">{\u00b6 43} The decision whether to prosecute a criminal offense is generally left to the discretion of the prosecutor. <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>517 U.S. at 464, 116 S.Ct. 1480, 134 L.Ed.2d 687. That discretion is, however, subject to constitutional equal-protection principles, which prohibit prosecutors from selectively prosecuting individuals based on \u201c \u2018an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Oyler v. Boles </em>(1962), 368 U.S. 448, 456, 82 S.Ct. 501, 7 L.Ed.2d 446. Although a selective-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself, a defendant may raise it as an \u201cindependent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by the Constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Getsy (1998), 84 </em>Ohio St.3d 180, 203, 702 N.E.2d 866; see, also, <em>Armstrong, </em>517 U.S. at 463, 116 S.Ct. 1480, 134 L.Ed.2d 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">{\u00b6 44} To support a claim of selective prosecution, \u201c \u2018a defendant bears the heavy burden of establishing, at least <em>prima facie, </em>(1) that, while others similarly situated have not generally been proceeded against because of conduct of the type forming the basis of the charge against him, he has been singled out for prosecution, and (2) that the government\u2019s discriminatory selection of him for prosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations as race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Flynt </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 132, 134, 17 O.O.3d 81, 407 N.E.2d 15, quoting <em>United States v. Berrios </em>(C.A.2, 1974), 501 F.2d 1207, 1211. In this case, LaMar has failed to satisfy either prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">{\u00b6 45} LaMar asserts that out of the more than twenty-five inmates who were indicted for homicide offenses relating to the SOCF riot, he was the only one charged with capital murder for \u201ckilling only inmates.\u201d LaMar also states that four other inmates, at least one of whom was white, were charged with noncapital offenses for participating in the same murders for which LaMar was convicted. Even accepting these assertions as true, LaMar fails to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Flynt </em>analysis because he has not shown that the state has treated him differently from other similarly situated individuals. The state built its case against LaMar on the theory that he organized and led a small group of inmates on a murderous rampage. The state presented considerable evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>LaMar acted in a leadership role and participated in all five murders by either beating his victims or forcing other inmates to kill. Because of LaMar\u2019s extensive involvement, we cannot conclude that he was \u201csimilarly situated\u201d with other inmates charged with noncapital offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">{\u00b6 46} LaMar also fails to satisfy the second <em>Flynt </em>prong. There is no evidence to suggest that the prosecution singled him out for death-penalty prosecution because of his race. Just two years ago, in fact, this court affirmed the convictions of a white inmate who received the death penalty for aggravated murders committed during the SOCF riot. See <em>State v. Robb </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 59, 723 N.E.2d 1019. Although LaMar emphasizes that <em>Robb </em>involved a white inmate convicted of killing both an inmate <em>and </em>a corrections officer, we fail to see how this distinction matters for purposes of a selective-prosecution analysis. And even if it did, LaMar has done nothing more than make a bald assertion of differing treatment motivated by race. Absent some demonstration of an invidious motive, this court will not presume intentional or purposeful discrimination from a mere showing of different treatment. <em>State v. Freeman </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St.3d 55, 58, 20 OBR 355, 485 N.E.2d 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">{\u00b6 47} Under this proposition of law, LaMar also argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss the indictment on selective-prosecution grounds without stating its essential factual findings, as required by former Crim.R. 12(E) (now Crim.R. 12[F]). There was no such error in this case, however, because LaMar failed to request the findings he now claims were necessary. See <em>State v. Eley </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 174, 179, 672 N.E.2d 640. By failing to invoke the rule, LaMar has forfeited any error. Id. We reject LaMar\u2019s seventh proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">F. Prejudicial Joinder</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">{\u00b6 48} In his eighth proposition of law, LaMar argues that the trial court should have granted his pretrial motion to sever count nine of the indictment, alleging aggravated-murder and death-penalty specifications for Weaver\u2019s murder, from the remaining eight counts. LaMar claims that the Weaver count should have been tried separately from the other counts because the allegations relating to Weaver\u2019s murder \u201cwere quite different\u201d from the allegations relating to the deaths of the other four victims. LaMar further contends that he was unduly prejudiced by the joinder of all nine counts because \u201ctrying these cases together gave the benefit to the state of permitting the jury to infer from the evidence presented in the deaths of the first four victims that Mr. LaMar was quite capable of directing the death of Dennis Weaver two days later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cThe law favors joining multiple offenses in a single trial under Crim.R. 8(A) if the offenses charged \u2018are of jthe same or similar character.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293. Crim.R. 8(A) also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>allows joinder of two or more offenses that \u201care based on the same act or transaction, or are based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme 'or plan, or are part of a course of criminal conduct.\u201d Notwithstanding the policy in favor of joinder, an accused may move to sever counts of an indictment on the grounds that he or she is prejudiced by the joinder of multiple offenses. See Crim.R. 14. An appellate court will reverse a trial court\u2019s decision to deny severance only if the trial court has abused its discretion. <em>Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d at 163, 555 N.E.2d 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">{\u00b6 50} The state may rebut a defendant\u2019s claim of prejudicial joinder in two ways. The first way is by satisfying the \u201cother acts\u201d test. Id. If in separate trials the state could introduce evidence of the joined offenses as \u201cother acts\u201d under Evid.R. 404(B), a defendant cannot claim prejudice from the joinder. Id. See, also, <em>State v. Coley </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 253, 259-260, 754 N.E.2d 1129. The state may also negate a claim of prejudice by satisfying the less stringent \u201cjoinder test,\u201d which requires a showing \u201cthat evidence of each crime joined at trial is simple and direct.\u201d <em>Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d at 163, 555 N.E.2d 293; see, also, <em>State v. Torres </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 344, 20 O.O.3d 313, 421 N.E.2d 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">{\u00b6 51} The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying severance in this case because the state satisfied both tests. Even if the state had tried the Weaver count separately from the others, the evidence <em>of </em>LaMar\u2019s participation in the L-6 murders would have been admissible under Evid.R. 404(B). The rule allows the admission of other-acts evidence for purposes other than proving that the accused acted in conformity with a particular character. In this case, count nine of the indictment contained an R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) specification alleging that LaMar had murdered Weaver as part of a \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d that involved the \u201cpurposeful killing of or attempt to kill\u201d two or more persons. Even if this count had been tried separately, the state would have had to present some evidence of the L-6 murders in order to prove this specification. Thus, there would have been a valid noncharacter purpose for admitting evidence of the other murders. Cf. <em>State v. Wilkinson </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 308, 317, 18 O.O.3d 482, 415 N.E.2d 261 (noting the admissibility of other-crimes evidence when \u201c \u2018 \u201cthey are so blended or connected with the one on trial as that proof of one * * * tends logically to prove any element of the crime charged,\u201d \u2019 \u201d quoting <em>United States v. Turner </em>[C.A.7, 1970], 423 F.2d 481, 483-484, and <em>United States v. Wall </em>[C.A.7, 1955], 225 F.2d 905, 907).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">{\u00b6 52} Even if we were to hold that.evidence of the L-6 murders would not have been admissible \u201cother acts\u201d in a separate trial for Weaver\u2019s murder, we are. satisfied that the evidence for Weaver\u2019s murder was sufficiently \u201csimple and direct\u201d to negate LaMar\u2019s claims of prejudicial joinder. As LaMar\u2019s brief acknowledges, the Weaver murder occurred two days after the L-6 murders in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>different cellblock and was accomplished by strangulation rather than bludgeoning. Accordingly, it is highly unlikely that the jury was confused as to which evidence tended to show that LaMar killed Weaver and which tended to show that he killed the L-6 victims. See, e.g., <em>Coley, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 260, 754 N.E.2d 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">{\u00b6 53} The eighth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">IV. Trial Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"ANM\">A. Gruesome Photographs</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">{\u00b654} In the fifth proposition of law, LaMar contends.that the trial court prejudiced his defense by allowing the prosecution to admit \u201cgruesome and misleading photos\u201d into evidence. In particular, LaMar challenges the admission of Svette\u2019s postmortem photographs. LaMar contends that Svette\u2019s photographs were particularly prejudicial in light of evidence that (1) Svette had multiple assailants apart from LaMar\u2019s group and (2) the photos did not depict how Svette looked after the death squad left his cell. LaMar further argues that the prejudicial effect of all the admitted photographs was exacerbated by the prosecution\u2019s use of them during closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cProperly authenticated photographs, even if gruesome, are admissible in a capital prosecution if relevant and of probative value in assisting the trier of fact * * * as long as the danger of material prejudice to a defendant is outweighed by their probative value and the photographs are not repetitive or cumulative in number.\u201d <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768, paragraph seven of the syllabus. We review a trial court\u2019s decision to admit photographs under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 258, 513 N.E.2d 267. We will not disturb a trial court\u2019s balancing of the probative value against the prejudicial effect unless the trial court has \u201c \u2018clearly abused its discretion and the defendant has been materially prejudiced thereby.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 602, 605 N.E.2d 916, quoting <em>State v. Hymore </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St.2d 122, 128, 38 O.O.2d 298, 224 N.E.2d 126; see, also, <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 78, 656 N.E.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">{\u00b6 56} We agree with LaMar that the two Svette photographs he challenges here \u2014 Exhibits 20H and 20K \u2014 were decidedly gruesome. Each depicted Svette\u2019s head split open at the crown, with Exhibit 20K showing a portion of Svette\u2019s bloodied brain. In addition, Exhibit 20H offered a frontal view of Svette\u2019s head, allowing jurors to see that Svette\u2019s face was also beaten badly. Notwithstanding the nature of the photographs, however, we cannot say that the trial court erred in admitting them. Both photographs supported the forensic pathologist\u2019s testimony that Svette had sustained four major blows to the head and that any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>four was sufficient to cause death. Even though there was testimony from an inmate witness that Svette\u2019s head \u201cwasn\u2019t that far open\u201d when LaMar had finished beating him, the court was well within its discretion to admit the photos and afford the jury an opportunity to see the effects of <em>all </em>of the blows to Svette\u2019s head, including any inflicted by LaMar. Inasmuch as LaMar inflicted at least one of the major blows that could have been sufficient to cause Svette\u2019s death, the photographs helped establish LaMar\u2019s intent to Mil by graphically portraying the force with which Svette was beaten. See <em>State v. Tibbetts </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 156, 749 N.E.2d 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">{\u00b6 57} LaMar also complains about the trial court\u2019s admission of mugshot-style photographs showing Svette, Staiano, Depina, Vitale, and Weaver while all were still alive. We reject LaMar\u2019s arguments as to these photos. Pre-death photographs are relevant and admissible for purposes of identifying the victims. See <em>State v. Davie </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 311, 325, 686 N.E.2d 245; <em>State v. Roe </em>(1989), 41 Ohio St.3d 18, 22-23, 535 N.E.2d 1351. LaMar\u2019s fifth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">B. Hearsay Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">{\u00b6 58} LaMar\u2019s sixth proposition of law attacks the trial court\u2019s admission of \u201chighly prejudicial hearsay evidence.\u201d Inmate Robert Bass, who witnessed the actions of LaMar\u2019s death squad at L-6 on the day of the SOCF riot, testified that he heard Allen tell LaMar, \u201cGet your boys together and come on. Come with me.\u201d The trial court overruled defense objections to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">{\u00b6 59} Out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted within them are generally inadmissible as hearsay. Evid.R. 801 and 802. If a statement is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, however, it is not prohibited by the hearsay rule and will be admissible, subject to the standards governing relevancy and undue prejudice. <em>State v. Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 262-263, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768. Accordingly, \u201ctestimony which explains the actions of a witness to whom a statement was directed, such as to explain the witness\u2019 activities, is not hearsay.\u201d Id. at 262, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">{\u00b6 60} In this case, the trial court properly overruled LaMar\u2019s objection because Allen\u2019s statement was not offered for its truth. Rather, the prosecution offered it to show that LaMar was the target of Allen\u2019s command. Allen\u2019s comment was therefore admissible as a nonhearsay statement showing that LaMar heard Allen\u2019s instruction and acted upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">{\u00b6 61} LaMar\u2019s counsel also objected to testimony by Bass about a statement made by Cannon. Bass testified that Cannon asked Bass whether he had. seen LaMar before the group had embarked on its plan to Mil snitches in L-6. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>trial court properly overruled the hearsay objection because Cannon\u2019s question was not a \u201cstatement\u201d within the meaning of the hearsay rule. Evid.R. 801(A) defines a \u201cstatement,\u201d for hearsay purposes, as \u201c(1) an oral or written <em>assertion </em>or (2) nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by him as an <em>assertion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) \u201cAn \u2018assertion\u2019 for hearsay purposes \u2018simply means <em>to say that something is so, e.g., </em>that an event happened or that a condition existed.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State v. Carter </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 549, 651 N.E.2d 965, quoting 2 McCormick on Evidence (4th Ed.1992) 98, Section 246. Inasmuch as Cannon\u2019s question asserted nothing \u201cbecause a true question or inquiry is by its nature incapable of being proved either true or false,\u201d it cannot be hearsay within the meaning of Evid.R. 801.

Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">{\u00b6 63} In his ninth, tenth, and eleventh propositions of law, LaMar argues that the evidence was insufficient to support several of his convictions. He therefore argues that the trial court should have granted his Crim.R. 29 motions for acquittal with respect to Svette\u2019s murder, the course-of-conduct specification attached to Weaver\u2019s murder, and the kidnapping specification attached to the murders of Depina, Vitale, Staiano, and Svette.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">{\u00b6 64} When reviewing the sufficiency of evidence to support a criminal conviction, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus; see, also, <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560. When conducting this review, we do not weigh the evidence; our inquiry is limited to whether reasonable minds could reach the conclusion reached by the trier of fact. See <em>Tibbetts, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 162, 749 N.E.2d 226. Issues concerning the weight given to the evidence and the credibility of witnesses are primarily for the trier of fact. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">\n<em>1. Aggravated Murder of Svette</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">{\u00b6 65} In connection with Svette\u2019s death, LaMar was convicted of aggravated murder under R.C. 2903.01(B), which at the time of the SOCF riot provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cNo person shall purposely cause the death of another while committing or attempting to commit, or while fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit kidnapping * * *.\u201d 139 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1, 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>{\u00b6 67} LaMar insists that the state did not present sufficient evidence showing that he caused Svette\u2019s death. He points to testimony showing that others beat Svette and that Svette remained alive after LaMar and his group allegedly left L-6 after their rampage. LaMar also emphasizes testimony attesting to the fact that Svette\u2019s postmortem photographs did not accurately depict how Svette looked after LaMar and his group beat him. Because of all these factors, LaMar contends that there is insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that he \u201ccaused the death of William Svette.\u201d At best, he contends, there was sufficient evidence only of attempted murder. We reject LaMar\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">{\u00b6 68} At least two witnesses testified that LaMar struck Svette\u2019s head multiple times with either a shovel or baseball bat. One of the witnesses added that LaMar even went back to Svette\u2019s cell to beat him a second time after noticing that Svette was still alive. Furthermore, the forensic pathologist who testified for the state opined that Svette sustained four major blows to his head with a heavy object and that any <em>one </em>of those would have independently killed Svette. The jury was well within its province to infer that LaMar had struck one \u25a0 of those blows.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">{\u00b6 69} The fact that others assaulted Svette and perhaps hastened his death does'not undermine the sufficiency of the evidence to convict LaMar. Despite the actions of inmates Girdy and Frakes, who, according to witness testimony, finished Svette off, the evidence at trial supports an inference that LaMar\u2019s actions bore a causal connection to Svette\u2019s death. An offender who has inflicted injuries capable of causing death cannot escape culpability for homicide simply because intervening assailants have inflicted injuries that also contributed to the victim\u2019s death. See <em>State v. Keene </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 646, 655, 693 N.E.2d 246; see, also, <em>People v. Bailey </em>(1996), 451 Mich. 657, 676-678, 549 N.W.2d 325; <em>Holsemback v. State </em>(Ala.Crim.App.1983), 443 So.2d 1371, 1381-1382. Because sufficient evidence supports the conclusion that LaMar caused Svette\u2019s death, we overrule the ninth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\n<em>2. Course-of-Conduet Specification for Weaver\u2019s Murder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">{\u00b6 70} With respect to Weaver\u2019s murder, LaMar argues that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction for one of the capital specifications. Specifically, LaMar argues that the state failed to present sufficient evidence that Weaver\u2019s murder \u201cwas part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill two or more persons.\u201d R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). Even assuming that he participated in the four murders committed in L-6, LaMar urges that \u201cthere is no evidence that the Weaver killing was related\u201d to them because Weaver\u2019s murder involved \u201ca different scheme and a different mode of operation\u201d and took place at a different time. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>{\u00b6 71} The \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d specification applies to multiple murders that an offender commits as part of a continuing course of criminal conduct, even if the offender does not necessarily commit them as part of the same transaction. See <em>State v. Benner </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 301, 304-305, 533 N.E.2d 701. In this case, a reasonable jury could have found that the circumstances surrounding the Weaver murder were intertwined with the four murders in L-6 that took place two days earlier. The state presented testimony that LaMar and his group murdered the L-6 victims <em>and </em>Weaver as part of a concerted effort to kill \u201csnitches\u201d at SOCF, indicating a common motive for all of the killings. And even though the Weaver murder happened at a different time than the other four murders, that fact does not preclude a finding of sufficient evidence to support a conviction for the course-of-conduct specification. Conduct taking place over several days may satisfy the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) specification so long as the offender\u2019s actions were part of a continuing course of criminal conduct. See, e.g., <em>State v. Dunlap </em>(199), 73 Ohio St.3d 308, 316, 652 N.E.2d 988 (two murders, ten days apart, committed in two states); <em>State v. Fautenberry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 435, 444, 650 N.E.2d 878 (five murders committed in four states during a five-month period). The tenth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\n<em>3. Kidnapping Specifications</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">{\u00b6 72} With respect to four of the victims \u2014 Depina, Vitale, Staiano, and Svette \u2014 the jury found LaMar guilty of the death-penalty specification alleging that he committed the murders while \u201ccommitting, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit kidnapping.\u201d R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). LaMar contends that there was insufficient evidence of kidnapping to support a conviction for this specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">{\u00b6 73} The trial court instructed the jury on the definition of kidnapping set forth in R.C. 2905.01(A)(3), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cNo person, by force, threat, or deception * * * shall remove another from the place where the other person is found or restrain the liberty of the other person, for any of the following purposes:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">{\u00b6 75} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">{\u00b6 76} \u201c(3) To terrorize, or to inflict serious physical harm on the victim or another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">{\u00b6 77} In <em>State v. </em>Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 242-243, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768, this court considered a constitutional challenge to the validity of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) specification. The defendant argued that \u201cin virtually every aggravated murder the victim will be restrained from liberty for the purpose of terrorizing or the infliction of serious physical harm\u201d and that the specification therefore violated the constitutional requirement that aggravating circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>adequately distinguish between offenses that are death-eligible and those that are not. See, generally, <em>Godfrey v. Georgia </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 420, 100 S.Ct. 1759, 64 L.Ed.2d 398. This court rejected the argument by interpreting the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) specification to require proof of something more than a restraint or movement incidental to the commission of a murder. That is, the court held that R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) requires \u201cprolonged restraint, secretive confinement, or significant movement apart from that involved in the underlying crime in order to justify the application of the aggravating circumstance of kidnapping.\u201d <em>Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 243, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768; see, also, <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 197-198, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264; <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 135, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">{\u00b6 78} LaMar argues that there was not enough evidence of either prolonged restraint, secretive confinement, or significant movement to sustain a conviction on the kidnapping specification. For example, he argues, the evidence showed that Depina and Vitale were beaten inside their respective cells and in the range immediately in front of the cells. As to the Staiano murder, LaMar points to evidence that Staiano tripped and fell as he tried to escape his cell, after which Taylor attacked him. And with respect to the Svette murder, LaMar argues that there was no evidence suggesting that LaMar restrained Svette or removed him from his cell. Accordingly, LaMar contends that any restraint or movement was merely incidental to the beatings, distinguishing this case from others in which we have upheld convictions for the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">{\u00b6 79} If our focus were confined solely to the circumstances immediately preceding the murder of each victim, LaMar would have a substantial argument that any movement or restraint associated with any of them was incidental, at best, to the vicious assaults that caused their deaths. But beyond the evidence of movement incidental to the killings themselves, there was evidence that rioting inmates confined their victims in various cells and would not allow them to escape to the recreation yard with the nonrioting inmates. There was evidence that Allen, while each victim was locked in a cell, told LaMar and his group to \u201ckill the snitches.\u201d Thus, a reasonable jury could find that the inmates in control of L-6 confined suspected snitches for the purpose of terrorizing or inflicting serious physical harm. Cf. <em>State v. Simko </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 483, 488-489, 644 N.E.2d 345 (finding sufficient evidence to support kidnapping specification when defendant restrained and terrorized victim for approximately a half-hour before murdering her as she tried to escape); <em>State v. Seiber, </em>56 Ohio St.3d at 14-15, 564 N.E.2d 408 (kidnapping specification supported by evidence that, prior to shooting the victim, the defendant restrained bar patrons by ordering them on the floor and blocking exits). In turn, a reasonable jury could conclude that LaMar assumed control over the victims\u2019 confinement after Allen relayed the order for LaMar to \u201ckill the snitches.\u201d Indeed, there was evidence that LaMar ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Grinnell to open each victim\u2019s cell, supporting the inference that LaMar had some measure of control over the physical location and movement of the victims. Construing the evidence most strongly in the prosecution\u2019s favor, as we are required to do in a sufficiency-of-the-evidence inquiry, there was sufficient evidence that LaMar was at least an aider and abettor in the victims\u2019 confinement and thus capable of being \u201cprosecuted and punished as if he were a principal offender\u201d in the kidnappings. R.C. 2923.03(F); see, also, <em>State v. Bies </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 320, 325, 658 N.E.2d 754. We therefore conclude that the trial court properly overruled LaMar\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal on the kidnapping specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">{\u00b6 80} The eleventh proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">D. Surprise Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">{\u00b6 81} LaMar\u2019s thirteenth proposition of law asserts that the defense was unfairly prejudiced by \u201csurprise\u201d testimony on cross-examination by William \u201cGeno\u201d Washington, a defense witness. Washington was one of the ten inmates, including LaMar and Weaver, placed in the K-Block cell after corrections officers cleared the recreation yard on the morning after the riot began. On direct examination by defense counsel, Washington testified that Bowling and Childers had killed Weaver. He also testified that LaMar did not say anything about Weaver, did not order anyone to kill Weaver, and did not touch Weaver. On cross-examination, however, the state impeached Washington with the contents of an interview during which he told an investigator, among other things, that LaMar was one of the persons responsible for Weaver\u2019s murder. Washington repeatedly denied any memory of making the statement. LaMar argues that the defense was \u201ccompletely surprised\u201d by Washington\u2019s prior statement and that a new trial was therefore warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">{\u00b6 82} LaMar\u2019s counsel, citing Washington\u2019s testimony, filed a post-trial motion for new trial under Crim.R. 33(A)(3). This rule allows for a new trial on the grounds of \u201csurprise which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against.\u201d To warrant a new trial, the surprise of which the defendant complains must have materially affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. A reviewing court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial absent an abuse of discretion. See <em>State v. Schiebel </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 76, 564 N.E.2d 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">{\u00b6 83} LaMar has not met his burden of establishing an entitlement to a new trial under Crim.R. 33(A)(3). Although LaMar\u2019s counsel claimed surprise in his motion for new trial, he did not raise this issue during Washington\u2019s testimony. A trial court acts well within its discretion to deny a post-trial Crim.R. 33(A)(3) motion when defense counsel fails to raise the issue of surprise during trial. We accordingly reject the thirteenth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>E. Newly Discovered Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"AdX\">{\u00b6 84} In the twelfth proposition of law, LaMar claims that he was entitled to a new trial on the grounds of newly discovered evidence. Following trial, LaMar\u2019s attorneys moved for a new trial under Crim.R. 33(A)(6) after two inmates, James Were and Derek Cannon, had contacted them with information about LaMar\u2019s case. Were signed an affidavit stating that he was present in L-6 at the time of the murders and that LaMar did not participate in them. Were also stated that other inmates had been \u201cdispleased\u201d with LaMar for refusing to participate in the riot and \u201cconsidered him a traitor and coward.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cannon provided LaMar\u2019s attorneys with two letters that inmate Anthony Walker had written to Rasheem Matthews, an alleged member of the group that attacked the L-6 victims. In one letter, Walker wrote that \u201cLaMar\u2019s trail [sic] starts on Monday so try and stay up on it althrough [sic] you no [sic] he\u2019s hit anyway.\u201d In the second letter, Walker told Cannon, \u201cI came from court and Sweat is hit.\u201d (\u201cSweat\u201d was LaMar\u2019s nickname.) LaMar argues that the new evidence from Were and Cannon contradicted several of the state\u2019s witnesses, including Walker himself, and therefore raised a genuine issue concerning his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">{\u00b6 85} The decision whether to grant a new trial on grounds of newly discovered evidence falls within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Hawkins </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 339, 350, 612 N.E.2d 1227. To warrant the granting of a new trial, the new evidence must, at the very least, disclose \u201c \u2018a strong probability that it will change the result if a new trial is granted,\u2019 \u201d and must not be \u201c \u2018merely cumulative to former evidence.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State v. Petro </em>(1947), 148 Ohio St. 505, 36 O.O. 165, 76 N.E.2d 370, syllabus. We find no abuse of discretion in this case because the newly discovered evidence forming the basis of LaMar\u2019s motion failed to satisfy these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">{\u00b6 86} Were\u2019s information was largely cumulative of other defense witnesses who likewise testified that LaMar was not present in L-6 at the time of the murders. And his affidavit testimony about other inmates thinking LaMar was a \u201ctraitor or coward\u201d was speculative. As such, Were\u2019s testimony on this point was of questionable inadmissibility and therefore could not have provided a \u201cstrong probability\u201d of an acquittal. Similarly, we see nothing in the Walker letters that would have disclosed a strong probability of a different trial result. Contrary to LaMar\u2019s arguments, the Walker comment about LaMar being \u201chit\u201d did not suggest that there was perjured testimony at LaMar\u2019s trial. Walker\u2019s comment is reasonably \u2014 and perhaps better \u2014 construed as a statement of Walker\u2019s belief that the state had a strong case against LaMar. The trial court therefore did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>abuse its discretion in finding the proffered newly discovered evidence insufficient to warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">{\u00b6 87} We also find unpersuasive LaMar\u2019s argument that the new evidence would have created \u201cresidual doubt\u201d about his guilt, thus providing a mitigating factor that would have led the jury to choose a life sentence. Residual doubt is not an acceptable mitigating factor in determining the appropriate sentence in a capital case. <em>State v. McGuire </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 403, 686 N.E.2d 1112. The twelfth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">V. Penalty-Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">A. Admission of Trial Phase Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">{\u00b6 88} In the fourteenth proposition of law, LaMar claims prejudicial error in the trial court\u2019s admission in the penalty phase of \u201call evidence submitted by the state in the guilt-innocence phase.\u201d In LaMar\u2019s view, some of the evidence was entirely irrelevant to the issue of whether the aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. The defense specifically objected to the readmission of the trial exhibits, including all photographs of the victims, demonstrative evidence of the weapons used, and a walker that belonged to Svette.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">{\u00b6 89} In <em>State v. Gumm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 653 N.E.2d 253, syllabus, this court recited the broad categories of evidence that the state may introduce during the penalty phase of a capital prosecution under R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) and (2). We held that, subject to applicable Evidence Rules, the state may introduce (1) any evidence raised at trial that is relevant to the aggravating circumstances specified in the indictment of which the defendant was found guilty, (2) any other testimony or evidence relevant to the nature and circumstances of those aggravating circumstances, (3) evidence rebutting the existence of any statutorily defined or other mitigating factors first asserted by the defendant, (4) the presentence investigation report, and (5) the mental examination report. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">{\u00b6 90} Under this standard, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s admission of the photographs and demonstrative exhibits depicting the weapons used. These items bore some relevance to the nature and circumstances surrounding the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) course-of-conduct specification of which the jury found LaMar guilty. As for the admission of Svette\u2019s walker, we find merit in LaMar\u2019s contention that this item of evidence has only a tenuous connection, if that, to any of the aggravating circumstances for which LaMar was convicted. We do not, however, find that the admission of this item warrants reversal. The record of the sentencing hearing reveals no emphasis whatsoever on the walker or the fact that Svette used one. Thus, based on the record before us, we deem any error in admitting this item of evidence to be harmless. And in any event, this court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>independent reassessment can eliminate any possible error in the court\u2019s admission of this evidence. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 569, 578, 660 N.E.2d 724. We accordingly overrule LaMar\u2019s fourteenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">B. Improper Penalty-Phase Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">{\u00b6 91} LaMar\u2019s fifteenth proposition of law alleges that the prosecutor engaged in improper argument during the sentencing proceeding. LaMar argues that the prosecutor improperly argued that the jury should evaluate the mitigating factors in light of LaMar\u2019s culpability for the murders. For example, LaMar cites a portion of the closing argument in which the prosecutor rhetorically asked the jury, \u201c[A]ll of the testimony that you have heard over the last two days, number one, is it mitigating? Does that lessen what he did? Does that explain what he did or justify what he did?\u201d And even though the trial court sustained a defense objection to these remarks, LaMar notes that the prosecutor later continued along that same line of argument, telling the jury that \u201c[n]othing was presented that mitigated what he did, and any mitigation is greatly outweighed and absolutely eclipsed by the aggravating circumstances.\u201d The trial court overruled LaMar\u2019s motion for mistrial following this comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">{\u00b6 92} As LaMar correctly notes, \u201cmitigating factors under R.C. 2929.04(B) are not related to a defendant\u2019s culpability but, rather, are those factors that are relevant to the issue of whether an offender convicted under R.C. 2903.01 should be sentenced to death.\u201d <em>State v. Holloway </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 242, 527 N.E.2d 831. Thus, we have held that it is improper for prosecutors to make any comment to the jury during the penalty phase that the nature and circumstances of the murder are \u201caggravating circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Wogenstahl </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 662 N.E.2d 311, paragraph two of the syllabus. Nevertheless, LaMar overstates the significance of the prosecutor\u2019s comments in this case. For one thing, the trial court sustained a defense objection to the prosecutor\u2019s first foray into questionable argument by instructing the jury to disregard the remark about whether the mitigating factors \u201cjustify\u201d what LaMar did. We will ordinarily presume that the jury followed such an instruction by the court. See <em>State v. Loza </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 75, 641 N.E.2d 1082. For another thing, the second remark by the prosecutor complained of by LaMar did not warrant a mistrial. The trial court ultimately gave correct penalty-phase instructions to the jury, including an instruction that the mitigating factors are \u201crelevant to the issue of whether the Defendant should be sentenced to death.\u201d Thus, despite whatever complaints LaMar raises about the prosecutor\u2019s argument, the trial court cured any defect by essentially instructing that the mitigating factors are relevant to the question of whether LaMar should be sentenced to death and not simply to the question of whether LaMar\u2019s culpability is somehow reduced. We can therefore find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s decision to deny LaMar\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>motion for mistrial. See <em>State v. Garner </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 49, 59, 656 N.E.2d 623 (noting that the decision whether to grant a mistrial lies within trial court\u2019s sound discretion). And in any event, this court\u2019s independent sentence reassessment eliminates the effect of any error in the prosecutor\u2019s argument in this particular case. See <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 381, 398, 659 N.E.2d 292. The fifteenth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">C. Penalty-Phase Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">{\u00b6 93} In his sixteenth proposition, LaMar takes issue with the jury instructions used by the trial court at the sentencing phase. He asserts that the trial court\u2019s instructions prejudiced him by (1) failing to inform the jury that a \u201csolitary juror could prevent the death sentence\u201d and (2) placing undue emphasis on jury unanimity in returning a penalty verdict. LaMar\u2019s claims of error are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">{\u00b6 94} In <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 148, 661 N.E.2d 1030, this court held that it is error for a trial court to require a jury to unanimously reject a death verdict before considering a sentence of life imprisonment. Id. at 160, 661 N.E.2d 1030. This court reasoned that \u201cR.C. 2929.03(D)(2) contains no limiting language as to when a jury may contemplate a life sentence.\u201d Id. Thus, when the jury cannot unanimously agree on death as the appropriate punishment, it can properly consider alternative sentences. Accordingly, <em>Brooks </em>counseled courts in capital cases to instruct the jury that \u201ca solitary juror may prevent a death penalty recommendation by finding that the aggravating circumstances in the case do not outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d Id. at 162, 661 N.E.2d 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">{\u00b6 95} In this case, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">{\u00b6 96} \u201cYou shall make a finding for the sentence of death if you unanimously, all 12, find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors as to each given death.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">{\u00b6 97} \u201cIf you do not so find, you shall unanimously, and that\u2019s all 12, make a finding for either a life sentence with parole eligibility after serving 20 full years of imprisonment or a life sentence with parole eligibility after serving 30 full years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">{\u00b6 98} \u201cVerdict forms with these three options will be furnished to you for each decedent. You will consider each death and the aggravating circumstances as to that death separately. The fact that you * * * unanimously agree on a sentence as to one death does not require you to impose the same sentence for any other death. You must unanimously decide the sentence for the death of each decedent applying the instructions I have just given you and uninfluenced by your verdict as to any other death.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">{\u00b6 99}</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>{\u00b6 100} \u201cWith regard to the verdict that you render, all 12 of you, each and every one of you must sign in ink on the lines provided for your signature, the foreperson signing on the 12th line under which is printed the phrase foreperson.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">{\u00b6 101} \u2018Tour verdict must be unanimous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">{\u00b6 102} We reject LaMar\u2019s contention that <em>Brooks </em>requires reversal in this case, The above instruction was virtually identical to the proposed penalty-phase instructions that LaMar\u2019s counsel submitted to the trial court. LaMar thus cannot complain of any alleged error in the instructions. Under the invited-error doctrine, a party cannot take advantage of an error that the party invited or induced the court to commit. <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 492-493, 709 N.E.2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">{\u00b6 103} Even if the invited-error doctrine were not applicable, we would still reject LaMar\u2019s argument. LaMar\u2019s counsel did not object to the penalty-phase instructions and thereby forfeited all but plain error. See <em>State v. Lundgren, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 493, 653 N.E.2d 304. Although this court had not yet decided <em>Brooks </em>at the time of LaMar\u2019s trial, that fact did not obviate defense counsel\u2019s responsibility to object to instructions that were potentially erroneous. See <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 394, 721 N.E.2d 52 (collecting cases in which this court applied a plain-error analysis to alleged <em>Brooks </em>errors in cases tried before <em>Brooks </em>was decided). There was no plain error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">{\u00b6 104} The instruction given by the trial court is vastly different from the one this court rejected in <em>Brooks. </em>The trial court never instructed the jury that it had to unanimously reject the death penalty before it could consider sentencing LaMar to life imprisonment. Accordingly, nothing in the instruction prevented the jury from considering a life sentence even if it had not unanimously rejected the death penalty. <em>Bey, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 498, 709 N.E.2d 484; see, also, <em>State v. Stallings, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 294, 731 N.E.2d 159 (upholding similar instruction against <em>Brooks </em>challenge); <em>State v. Smith </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 424, 438, 721 N.E.2d 93 (same). We reject the sixteenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">D. Instructing Jury that Verdict was a Recommendation</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">{\u00b6 105} In the nineteenth proposition of law, LaMar argues that the trial court committed constitutional error by repeatedly informing the jury that its sentencing decision would be only a <em>recommendation. </em>Specifically, LaMar takes issue with how the trial court explained the penalty phase to prospective jurors before voir dire:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">{\u00b6 106} \u201c[Depending on your decision in the guilt or innocent [sic] proceeding, you might then be involved in a second proceeding. If this second proceeding takes place, the jury will have to make a recommendation of sentence for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>aggravated murder charges. One of the recommendations could be the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">{\u00b6 107} \u201cIf you are selected and if you\u2019re required to make a recommendation of sentence and if that recommendation is death, then before that sentence may be ordered the Court must independently determine if the recommendation is supported with proof of evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">{\u00b6 108} The trial court used similar language with other panels of prospective jurors. LaMar claims further prejudice from the fact that the jury verdict forms also used the term \u201crecommend,\u201d thereby solidifying the concept that the jury was not ultimately responsible for a death verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">{\u00b6 109} The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201cit is constitutionally impermissible to rest a death sentence on a determination made by a sentencer who has been led to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the defendant\u2019s death rests elsewhere.\u201d <em>Caldwell v. Mississippi </em>(1985), 472 U.S. 320, 328-329, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 86 L.Ed.2d 231. Accordingly, the <em>Caldwell </em>court reversed a defendant\u2019s death sentence because the prosecutor\u2019s argument had left jurors with a mistaken impression that Mississippi\u2019s appellate courts \u2014 and not the jury itself \u2014 would be the ones actually responsible for imposing a death sentence. See id. at 331-333, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 86 L.Ed.2d 231. To establish a <em>Caldwell </em>violation, however, a defendant \u201c \u2018necessarily must show that the remarks to the jury improperly described the role assigned to the jury by local law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buell v. Mitchell </em>(C.A.6, 2001), 274 F.3d 337, 353, quoting <em>Dugger v. Adams </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 401, 407, 109 S.Ct. 1211, 103 L.Ed.2d 435. LaMar cannot show that in this case. There is no <em>Caldwell </em>error in a case where, as here, a trial court\u2019s statements accurately reflect Ohio law and do not induce reliance on the appellate review process. <em>State v. Durr </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 86, 93, 568 N.E.2d 674; see, also, <em>State v. Davie, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 326-327, 686 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">{\u00b6 110} Moreover, the penalty-phase instructions belie any claim that the jury misapprehended its role in the sentencing process. The trial court specifically instructed the jury during the sentencing phase that it \u201cshould not * * * impose a greater sentence than is deserved with the thought that the Judge will lessen the sentence, nor impose a lesser sentence than is deserved with the thought that the Judge will increase the penalty since the Court cannot increase the sentence.\u201d This instruction sufficiently informed the jury of its \u201cawesome responsibility\u201d to evaluate the \u201cappropriateness of death\u201d without regard to what the court may or may not do when the jury has completed its evaluation. <em>Caldwell, </em>472 U.S. at 330, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 86 L.Ed.2d 231. Because the trial court correctly explained the capital sentencing process in this case, we reject LaMar\u2019s nineteenth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>E. Trial Court\u2019s Sentencing Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"AkiJ\">{\u00b6 111} In his seventeenth proposition of law, LaMar claims that the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion failed to comport with R.C. 2929.03(F), which requires a trial court imposing a sentence of death to \u201cstate in a separate opinion its specific findings as to the existence of any of the mitigating factors set forth in [R.C. 2929.04(B) ], the existence of any other mitigating factors, the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing, and the reasons why the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing were sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d In particular, LaMar contends that the trial court weighed several \u201cnonstatutory aggravating circumstances\u201d in reaching its decision to accept the jury\u2019s recommendation and impose the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">{\u00b6 112} The trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion accurately recited the aggravating specifications that LaMar was found guilty of committing in connection with each of the murders for which he was sentenced to death. LaMar takes umbrage, however, with the trial court\u2019s subsequent discussion of the circumstances of the murders under a heading entitled, \u201cAggravating Circumstances.\u201d In this section, the trial court mentioned the non-lethal assaults on inmates Andre Stockton and Ellis Walker, noting that \u201c[t]he State elected to not charge the Defendant for these assaults, although the evidence was that he was a participant.\u201d The trial court continued with the facts of each murder and referred to the fact that both Depina and Vitale had begged and cried for mercy. And with regard to Svette\u2019s murder, the court wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">{\u00b6 113} \u201cOnce the death squad decided to leave L-6, they were confronted by an alleged Cleveland Mafia hit man, William Svette, serving his second life sentence for murder. * * * This time it was really and truly a life sentence, since Mr. Svette, age 69, and who walked with a walker, was killed. * * * Mr. Svette\u2019s head was so grossly injured that some pictures were kept from the jury\u2019s view. Suffice it to say that one could put his hand directly through the crack in Svette [sic] skull to his brain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">{\u00b6 114} The trial court later added that the rampage of LaMar and his group \u201cis indicative of the Defendant\u2019s mental process, his power, control, cruel, violent and unremorseful attitude.\u201d According to LaMar, the trial court effectively treated all of these factors as \u201caggravating circumstances,\u201d meaning that the court impermissibly sentenced him to death based on aggravating circumstances not listed in R.C. 2929.04(A). LaMar further notes that there was no evidence presented at trial to support the trial court\u2019s recitation of facts about Svette\u2019s criminal record. Accordingly, LaMar contends that the trial court \u201cimproperly weighed findings on the aggravating side which were not permissible.\u201d We reject LaMar\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>{\u00b6 115} It is permissible for the trial court to rely upon and cite the nature and circumstances of the offense as reasons to support its finding that the aggravating circumstances of which the jury found the defendant guilty outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Fautenberry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 440\u2014441, 650 N.E.2d 878; <em>State v. Stumpf </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 512 N.E.2d 598, paragraph one of the syllabus. It is sufficiently clear from the structure and organization of the sentencing opinion that this was the purpose of the trial court\u2019s recitation of the facts surrounding the murders. The trial court discussed the facts of each murder only <em>after </em>it had listed the statutory aggravating factors that the jury had found to exist. We are therefore convinced that the trial court knew the difference between statutory aggravating circumstances and the nature and circumstances of the offense. See <em>Fautenberry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 441, 650 N.E.2d at 878. And to the extent the trial court relied upon nonrecord evidence about Svette\u2019s criminal record and the fact that Svette required a walker, we find nothing that would taint its findings that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">{\u00b6 116} Under this proposition of law, LaMar also argues that the trial court \u201cimproperly\u201d analyzed the mitigating factors offered during the sentencing phase. In support of his argument, LaMar cites the following passage from the sentencing opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">{\u00b6 117} \u201cIt is true that the defendant was raised in a [sic] environment which suggested that he was destined to get into trouble. However, the same community allowed others to live and work -within a community and society in a peaceful fashion when they chose to, compelling this court to conclude that the defendant functioned as a rational being during the period of time surrounding the criminal activity of which he has been convicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">{\u00b6 118} Because the trial court openly refuted the notion that LaMar\u2019s background carried significant mitigating weight, LaMar contends that the trial court did not properly weigh the mitigating evidence, thereby depriving him of an individualized determination of whether the death penalty was appropriate in this case. We reject this argument. Contrary to LaMar\u2019s contention, the passage suggests that the trial court analyzed whether LaMar\u2019s background affected his mental status in any appreciable manner at the time of the offenses committed, as the defense\u2019s mitigating evidence suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">{\u00b6 119} LaMar also argues that the trial court failed to consider testimony from Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon, indicating that LaMar suffered from a borderline personality disorder. LaMar contends that the trial court \u201cwholly discounted\u201d Dr. Smalldon\u2019s testimony as mitigating evidence. We disagree with LaMar\u2019s reading of the sentencing opinion on this point. The trial court specifically mentioned that LaMar \u201chas been diagnosed over many years as having a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>borderline personality disorder which manifests itself in antisocial behavior.\u201d Thus, LaMar\u2019s argument is aimed more at the weight the trial court gave to the evidence. Matters involving the weight to be given to mitigating evidence are within the trial court\u2019s domain. <em>State v. Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d at 171, 555 N.E.2d 293. \u201cThe fact that mitigation evidence is admissible \u2018does not automatically mean that it must be given any weight.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Mitts </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 223, 235, 690 N.E.2d 522, quoting <em>State v. Steffen, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph two of the syllabus. Moreover, this court\u2019s independent sentence reassessment can correct any error in the trial court\u2019s treatment of the mitigating evidence. <em>Mitts. </em>See, also, <em>State v. Robb, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 83, 723 N.E.2d 1019; <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 191, 631 N.E.2d 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">{\u00b6 120} Finally, LaMar claims that the trial court \u201cwholly failed\u201d to specify why the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. This contention is simply incorrect. The trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion devoted almost three full pages to weighing the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors. The seventeenth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">VI. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">{\u00b6 121} In the fourth proposition of law, LaMar claims that the prosecutor committed misconduct throughout his trial. To address these arguments, we must determine (1) whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was improper and (2) if so, whether it prejudicially affected LaMar\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13,14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. The touchstone of this analysis \u201cis the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78. We will not deem a trial unfair if, in the context of the entire trial, it appears clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found the defendant guilty even without the improper comments. <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 464, 739 N.E.2d 749; see, also, <em>Smith, </em>14 Ohio St.3d at 15, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">A. Improper Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">{\u00b6 122} LaMar claims that the prosecutor committed misconduct during jury voir dire. He first complains that the prosecutor ignored the trial court\u2019s request that the attorneys not \u201cget into the facts\u201d and \u201cbasically attempted to give an opening statement.\u201d LaMar cites one passage in which the prosecutor told potential jurors that \u201cin this particular case Keith LaMar did hands-on killing of some of these people.\u201d The record shows, however, that the trial court sustained a defense objection to this statement and admonished the potential jurors not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>treat such comments as evidence. Accordingly, LaMar has not shown any prejudice flowing from the prosecutor\u2019s remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">{\u00b6 123} LaMar next claims that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of witnesses whom the state would call during trial. For example, the prosecutor discussed the credibility of inmate witnesses by telling the potential jurors that \u201cmost of the people involved at Lucasville, a lot of them are very, very decent people that have made mistakes in the past.\u201d Despite the trial court sustaining an objection to this remark, the prosecutor continued this line of discussion by adding that \u201ca majority of people in that particular situation did not want to be involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">{\u00b6 124} \u201cIt is improper for an attorney to express his or her personal belief or opinion as to the credibility of a witness.\u201d <em>State v. Williams </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 1, 12, 679 N.E.2d 646. We do not, however, view the prosecutor\u2019s comments as improper vouching for the credibility of the inmate witnesses he would call at trial. Rather, the prosecutor was validly exploring the possibility that potential jurors would be predisposed to discredit certain witnesses simply because they were inmates. A prosecutor may properly try to \u201censure that jurors would not be biased against his witnesses.\u201d <em>State v. Lundgren, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 484, 653 N.E.2d 304. And even if we believed that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper, they were harmless error at worst, particularly in view of the fact that the defense also relied upon inmate witness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">B. Conduct During Opening Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">{\u00b6 125} During his opening statement, the prosecutor read the indictment and recited the results from the autopsies performed on the murder victims. LaMar argues that this constituted an improper \u201cattempt to focus the jurors on the horror of the crime rather than the evidence.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">{\u00b6 126} As to the prosecutor reciting the autopsy results to the jury, LaMar\u2019s counsel did not object, thereby forfeiting all but plain error. See <em>State v. Clemons </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 451, 696 N.E.2d 1009. Even if defense counsel had objected, however, the objection would have been overruled because there was no error'. In view of the fact that the state admitted the autopsy results into evidence, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks about them were nothing more than a fair commentary on the facts to be presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">{\u00b6 127} As for the prosecutor\u2019s reading of the indictment during opening statement, the trial court properly overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection. LaMar cites no authority for the proposition that a prosecutor may not read from the indictment during opening statement. Indeed, our precedent suggests that it is not improper to do so. In <em>State v. Graven </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 112, 6 O.O.3d 334, 369 N.E.2d 1205, for example, this court held that a trial court has discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>in a criminal case to let the jury take a copy of the indictment into the jury room. Id. at syllabus. If it is proper for the jury to read an indictment in the jury room, a defendant cannot claim prejudice from a prosecutor\u2019s reading the indictment during opening statement. Further, the trial court instructed the jury that neither the opening statement nor the indictment is considered to be evidence of an accused\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">C. Inappropriate Comments, Questions, and Arguing with the Court</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">{\u00b6 128} LaMar also claims that the prosecutor acted improperly by questioning trial court rulings on defense objections, asking improper questions, arguing with witnesses, and making inappropriate comments. LaMar first cites the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of two prosecution witnesses. At one point, while the defense was attempting to impeach Robert Bass\u2019s testimony with the fact that Bass had reviewed the transcript of his prior statement before testifying, the prosecutor interrupted the questioning in an apparent attempt to explain the circumstances of Bass\u2019s receiving the transcript. Similarly, during the defense\u2019s cross-examination of Thomas Taylor, the prosecutor interjected, \u201cI\u2019ll stipulate that I prepared my case and talked to every witness\u201d when the defense was inquiring about Taylor\u2019s previous interviews with investigators and/or prosecutors. The trial court admonished the prosecutor not to make comments during the cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">{\u00b6 129} Second, LaMar points to an instance of improper questioning during the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Cory Perkins, a defense witness. LaMar complains of the following exchange, which occurred while the prosecutor was questioning Perkins about a statement Perkins had made to investigators about the Weaver murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">{\u00b6 130} \u201cQ. [by the prosecutor] What depth or details didn\u2019t you go in that you went into with the jury now?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">{\u00b6 131} \u201cA. Well, I mean, to be frank, I told them the same thing I told them. Just different things left out that ain\u2019t really no big thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">{\u00b6 132} \u201cQ. What did you leave out? We\u2019ll decide if it\u2019s a big thing or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">{\u00b6 133} \u201cMR. CARSON [defense counsel]: Objection, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">{\u00b6 134} \u201cTHE COURT: Sustained. It\u2019s argumentative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">{\u00b6 135} LaMar also complains of improper cross-examination when LaMar was on the witness stand. When the trial court instructed the prosecutor to limit his cross-examination about LaMar\u2019s boxing career to the fact of whether LaMar was in fact a boxer, the prosecutor ignored the admonition:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">{\u00b6 136} \u201cQ. [by the prosecutor] You are a heavyweight boxing champion in the institution, are you not?</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>{\u00b6 137} \u201cMR.

[by LaMar] I\u2019m a heavyweight boxer. I tried but I failed, and right before the riot took place \u2014 well, the riot stopped me from trying again. To answer your question, no, I\u2019m not nor have I ever been a heavyweight champion within the institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">{\u00b6 140} \u201cQ.

CARSON: Objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">{\u00b6 147} \u201cTHE COURT: Sustained. Go to a different line of questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-16\">{\u00b6 148} LaMar also notes that the trial court \u201csustained a total of forty-five objections in the space of fifty-nine pages of transcript \u2014 several more than once\u201d during his testimony. LaMar also complains that the prosecutor continually ignored the court\u2019s rulings by continuing improper lines of questioning with LaMar and other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-17\">{\u00b6 149} Upon review of the record, we agree that the prosecutor engaged in some improper and unprofessional behavior. We find no reason for the prosecutor to have ignored admonitions by the trial court about improper questions. Similarly, we find it improper for the prosecutor to have interjected comments in open court, particularly when he interrupted testimony to make statements of fact and essentially testify in place of the witness. See <em>State v. Fears </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 332, 715 N.E.2d 136 (reminding prosecutors to \u201cbe diligent in their efforts\u201d to \u201crefrain from the desire to make outlandish remarks, misstate evidence, or confuse legal concepts\u201d). That being said, however, we disagree with LaMar about the prejudicial nature of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct; the misconduct cited by LaMar did not pervade the trial to such a degree that there was a denial of due process. See <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 402, 410, 613 N.E.2d 203. The trial court sustained numerous objections by defense counsel and, on the state of the record before us, we have no reason to believe that the outcome of the trial was affected by the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments. See <em>Fears, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 336, 715 N.E.2d 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>D. Improper Impeachment of the Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">{\u00b6 150} LaMar also claims misconduct in the manner in which the prosecutor asked questions about his prior conviction for murder. During trial and prior to LaMar\u2019s testimony, the defense had stipulated that LaMar had been convicted of murder in Cuyahoga County in 1989 and that, as a result, LaMar was incarcerated at SOCF at the time of the murders for which he was on trial. Nevertheless, during cross-examination of LaMar, the prosecutor delved into the details of LaMar\u2019s prior murder conviction. The trial court sustained a defense objection after the prosecutor asked LaMar if he had shot his victim \u201cwith a gun\u201d and \u201cin the heart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">{\u00b6 151} When an accused testifies at trial, Evid.R. 609(A)(2) allows the state to impeach the accused\u2019s credibility with evidence that the accused has been convicted of an offense punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year. Under Evid.R. 609, the trial court has broad discretion to prohibit questioning about more than the \u201cname, date and place of the conviction, and the punishment imposed, when the conviction is admissible solely to impeach credibility.\u201d <em>State v. Amburgey </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 115, 116, 515 N.E.2d 925. Acting within its discretion, the trial court sustained an objection to the prosecutor\u2019s line of questioning, which in any event consisted of only two questions about the circumstances surrounding LaMar\u2019s prior conviction. We find nothing unduly prejudicial about the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">E. Improper Trial-Phase Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">{\u00b6 152} In his next claim of misconduct, LaMar alleges improper argument during the trial phase. Specifically, LaMar contends that the prosecutor denigrated defense counsel, used gruesome photographs in an unfair manner, and implored the jury to return a guilty verdict on a capital specification simply so they could proceed to the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">{\u00b6 153} As to the denigration of the defense, LaMar calls our attention to the following passage of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument:</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">{\u00b6 154} \u201cMr. Toy [defense counsel] told all of you on voir dire that this is the first case like this he\u2019s ever handled. He\u2019s never done this before. He got very excited, and he put on a show.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">{\u00b6 155} \u201cLet\u2019s look at the case carefully. First, let\u2019s look at some of the things that have been stressed to you by the Defense. Have you noticed that they always call the Defendant Keith? Has anybody noticed that?</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">{\u00b6 156} \u201c[Defense objection overruled.]</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">{\u00b6 157} \u201cOut of the hundreds or thousands of times that Keith LaMar has been referred to by the Defense, almost every time they refer to him as Keith, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>his first name. They have an angle to present to you in this case, and it\u2019s to call him \u2014 to humanize him, to call him by his first name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">{\u00b6 158} This is not the lone instance in which LaMar claims that the prosecution denigrated the defense. LaMar also calls our attention to another portion of the closing argument, in which the prosecutor compared his case to that of the defense. Even after the trial court sustained an objection to a comment in which the prosecutor accused the defense of having a strategy aimed at criticizing the prosecution and its witnesses, the prosecutor continued along this same theme:</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">{\u00b6 159} \u201cFirst of all, let\u2019s talk about me. The Defendant told you on the witness stand that I put together a case against him, intimating to you that somehow I orchestrated all these witnesses like a puppet master or something and got them to come in here and testify against him. I agree I did prepare my case. I did put together a case; <em>but I put together a truthful case, an honest case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">{\u00b6 160} \u201cThe Defendant and the defense attorney implied that I orchestrated perjury. This is totally inaccurate. It was implied that I know that these inmate witnesses came up here and lied and presented it in court anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">{\u00b6 161} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">{\u00b6 162} \u201cIt was told to you that this was a fiasco and that Sergeant Hudson and Sergeant Brink, supervisors in the patrol, were sloppy and unprofessional with regard to this entire investigation. It was criticized by Mr. Toy the way the yard removal was handled. * * * It\u2019s very easy in hindsight to criticize the efforts of somebody else, a professional in that field.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">{\u00b6 163} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">{\u00b6 164} \u201cBut, again, Mr. Toy gets up here with his charts and his pencils and his pens and his pointer and tells you that Corrections Officer Clarkson, he just really dropped the ball.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">{\u00b6 165} \u201cThese are good, honest men and women that are trying to do the right thing and because of him they have to get up here and get dragged through the mud in front of you, a court reporter, a judge, television cameras, and everything else. <em>I guess it\u2019s all part of the job.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">{\u00b6 166} \u201cWhy is this done? It\u2019s done to deflect attention away from Keith LaMar in the courtroom. * * * It\u2019s an attack on everything. <em>What does that tell you about their defense?\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">{\u00b6 167} It is true, of course, that the prosecution is entitled to some latitude and freedom of expression in closing argument. <em>Keenan, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 409, 613 N.E.2d 203. \u201cRealism compels us to recognize that criminal trials cannot be squeezed dry of all feeling.\u201d Id. That being said, however, some of the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>tor\u2019s comments exceeded the scope of proper argument. In the first passage cited above, the prosecutor denigrated defense counsel by pointedly ridiculing the defense\u2019s apparent effort to remind the jury that LaMar was a human being. This tactic was just as improper as disparaging defense counsel for raising objections, which this court has condemned. See, e.g., id. at 406, 613 N.E.2d 203. As for the second passage complained of by LaMar, the prosecutor\u2019s juxtaposition of his \u201chonest\u201d case with the defense\u2019s case, particularly when viewed in light of the pointed criticism of one of LaMar\u2019s defense attorneys, unfairly suggested that the defense\u2019s case was untruthful and not honestly presented. In the context in which they were stated, the prosecution\u2019s comments imputed insincerity to defense counsel and were therefore improper. Id. at 405-406, 613 N.E.2d 203; <em>State v. Clemons, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 452, 696 N.E.2d 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">{\u00b6 168} The fact that the prosecutor engaged in some improper argument, however, does not warrant reversal unless the remarks prejudicially affected substantial rights of the accused. <em>State v. Hessler </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 108, 125, 734 N.E.2d 1237. In making this determination, we must consider the effect of any misconduct in the context of the entire trial. <em>Keenan, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 410, 613 N.E.2d 203. We must also view the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument in its entirety when determining prejudice. <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 204, 661 N.E.2d 1068. Using these standards, we see no basis for reversing LaMar\u2019s conviction based on the prosecutor\u2019s comments. Even though some of the prosecutor\u2019s argument was improper, such comments did not pervade the entire trial, let alone the closing argument. We are unconvinced that the result of LaMar\u2019s trial would have been different without the few instances of improper commentary by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">{\u00b6 169} LaMar also complains of the prosecutor\u2019s displaying and commenting on photographs of the victims during the closing argument. LaMar\u2019s counsel failed to object to this action by the prosecutor, thereby forfeiting all but plain error. See <em>Getsy, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 195, 702 N.E.2d at 866. There was no plain error here. Although a prosecutor may not use gruesome photographs during closing argument in an effort to appeal to the jurors\u2019 emotions, see <em>Keenan, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 407, 613 N.E.2d 203, we see no such effort here.' The prosecutor focused his comments on what the photographs proved and did not make any emotional appeals to the jury to find LaMar guilty simply on the basis of what the photographs showed. We therefore disagree with LaMar\u2019s contention that the prosecutor committed misconduct in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">{\u00b6 170} LaMar also contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct in the trial-phase closing argument when he remarked to the jury, \u201cThe Defendant is guilty of aggravated murder and specification. That\u2019s the way, the only way to get to the penalty phase.\u201d The trial court sustained a defense objection and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>instructed the jury to disregard this comment, which LaMar argues was an improper ploy by the prosecution to implore the jurors \u201cto find the specification so they could get to the sentencing phase.\u201d Even if we agreed with LaMar\u2019s characterization of the prosecutor\u2019s comment and motive for saying it, we would be unable to find reversible error. The trial court\u2019s curative instruction was sufficient to relieve any prejudice. <em>Loza, </em>71 Ohio St.3d at 75, 641 N.E.2d 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">F. Improper Penalty-Phase Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">{\u00b6 171} In addition to claiming misconduct in the prosecutor\u2019s trial-phase closing argument, LaMar also alleges that the prosecutor committed misconduct during the sentencing proceedings. He cites the following passages as instances of improper argument:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">{\u00b6 172} \u2022 \u201cBut there are plenty of people who have lived successful lives, have made something of themselves when they were raised in poverty, when they were raised by a single parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">{\u00b6 173} \u2022 \u201cKeith LaMar made the conscious choices to kill a friend of his by shooting him twice in the heart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">{\u00b6 174} \u2022 \u201cThe prior purposeful killing, he has killed before; and [defense counsel] called that random violence. I think he used those words to you. There was no randomness in that. He took a gun and put it to the man\u2019s heart and he fired twice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">{\u00b6 175} \u2022 \u201cAs far as the mitigation, again, I might have heard things differently, but I heard that he was a very happy, well-adjusted child from the ages of birth to four or five years old.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">{\u00b6 176} \u2022 \u201cHe was already given a chance at a life sentence and look what happened. There may be some mitigation in this case, but it certainly does not rise to nearly the level of the aggravating circumstances. Nothing was presented that mitigated what he did, and any mitigation is greatly outweighed and absolutely eclipsed by the aggravating circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">{\u00b6 177} Because defense counsel did not object to any of these comments, our analysis is limited to ascertaining whether there was plain error. We find that none of the comments, either individually or in the aggregate, constitutes plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">{\u00b6 178} In the first comment complained of above, the prosecutor merely noted that not everyone with a troubled background similar to LaMar\u2019s has committed crimes of this magnitude. There is nothing wrong with this type of argument. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 399, 659 N.E.2d 292. Such comment is fair rebuttal to the defense\u2019s argument that the jury should consider LaMar\u2019s background to be a significant mitigating factor in determining whether he should be sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>{\u00b6 179} As for the second and third statements quoted above, we also see nothing improper. One of the aggravating circumstances in this case was the fact that LaMar had been previously convicted of murder. In its penalty-phase closing argument, the defense had told the jury to view the prior murder as an act of \u201crandom violence\u201d that was typical of the environment in which LaMar was brought up. In light of the defense\u2019s comments, the prosecutor\u2019s comment about LaMar\u2019s prior offense constituted proper rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">{\u00b6 180} We also see nothing improper about the last two comments complained of by LaMar. The prosecutor\u2019s argument about LaMar\u2019s childhood rebutted defense contentions about LaMar\u2019s upbringing. Indeed, \u201cthe contention that the jury is to be carefully fed only that information which reflects positively upon the capital defendant [is] \u2018ludicrous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gumm, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 420, 653 N.E.2d 253, quoting <em>State v. Greer </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 236, 253, 530 N.E.2d 382. Similarly, we see nothing wrong with the last comment by the prosecutor. In it, the prosecutor merely argues his view on what the outcome of the case should be \u2014 that the jury should find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. For these reasons, we find LaMar\u2019s complaints about the prosecutor\u2019s penalty-phase argument to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">G. Pattern of Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">{\u00b6 181} Apart from all of the specific instances misconduct, LaMar complains that the prosecutor engaged in a pattern of misconduct that \u201cpermeated\u201d the proceedings and deprived him of a fair trial. LaMar urges that we cumulate the above-identified instances of misconduct and conclude that the entire trial was so tainted as to warrant reversal and remand for a new trial. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">{\u00b6 182} Admittedly, we have recognized that there were some instances of questionable conduct by the prosecutor. But none of the instances of misconduct cited by LaMar, either individually or collectively, deprived him of a fair trial. The prosecutorial actions pinpointed by LaMar were relatively few and far between in the context of a trial that took over two weeks to complete. In numerous instances in this case, the trial court sustained defense objections and gave curative instructions when necessary. Cf. <em>Keenan, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 410, 613 N.E.2d 203 (noting that prosecutor\u2019s conduct can be exacerbated by lack of curative instructions and by trial court consistently overruling defense objections to misconduct). Although LaMar may not have received a perfect trial, we conclude that nothing in the prosecutors\u2019 conduct deprived him of a fair one. See <em>State v. Wilson, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 399, 659 N.E.2d 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">{\u00b6 183} The fourth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>VII. Independent Sentence Review</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">{\u00b6 184} Having rejected each of LaMar\u2019s propositions of law, we now turn to our statutory duty to independently weigh the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors and, in addition, determine whether LaMar\u2019s sentence is disproportionate to sentences in similar cases. See R.C. 2929.05(A). Our review at this stage is limited to the four murders for which LaMar was given the death penalty. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">{\u00b6 185} The evidence in this case supports the existence of the aggravating circumstances found by the jury and the trial court. LaMar stipulated to the existence of two aggravating circumstances: (1) that LaMar was a prisoner in a detention facility at the time of the offense and (2) that LaMar had previously been convicted of murder. See R.C. 2929.04(A)(4) and (5). We further find that the evidence in the record proves that LaMar committed each aggravated murder as part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of more than one person. R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). Finally, the evidence supports LaMar\u2019s conviction of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) specification attached to the aggravated murders of Vitale, Depina, and Svette. The state\u2019s evidence proved that LaMar was, at the very least, a complicitor in the Muslim inmates\u2019 kidnapping of the suspected snitches in L-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">{\u00b6 186} In mitigation, several witnesses testified about- LaMar\u2019s troubled background. LaMar, along with his siblings, grew up in a poor neighborhood where illegal drug activity and violence were common. LaMar\u2019s aunt, Carolyn LaMar, testified that LaMar lived with a stepfather who was \u201cmean\u201d to him and who would beat him for minor transgressions, such as failing to take out the garbage or touching his stepfather\u2019s things. And although LaMar\u2019s mother tried to look out for LaMar and his siblings, \u201cshe wasn\u2019t there for them because she was having her own problems.\u201d Carolyn also testified about shortcomings she perceived in LaMar\u2019s living conditions. For example, she testified that LaMar and his siblings were not well fed and lived in a house that was inadequately heated. Eventually, while still a teenager, LaMar quit school and moved out of the house to live with friends in an apartment, which was located in a neighborhood with lots of illegal drug activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">{\u00b6 187} LaMar\u2019s older brother, Nelson LaMar, also testified for the defense and corroborated Carolyn LaMar\u2019s description of their upbringing. He testified that their stepfather was physically and mentally abusive and showed interest in the boys\u2019 lives only because of their athletic talent. According to Nelson, their stepfather wanted them to be athletes and would beat them when they did not perform well athletically. Nelson also testified that he introduced his brother to drug dealing. Nelson told the jury that he \u201ctaught [LaMar] everything of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>criminal element.\u201d At the time of his testimony, Nelson was himself in prison for a robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">{\u00b6 188} Kim Granger, a former girlfriend who had known LaMar since the two were in high school, testified that LaMar did not have a good relationship with either his mother or his stepfather. She described LaMar as a \u201cnice guy\u201d who was heavily involved in sports before he started \u201cgetting into illegal activities like stealing and being in the streets a lot.\u201d LaMar told her that he did these things because he needed money for food and clothing. Granger, who remained friends with LaMar after he went to prison, also testified that LaMar had become \u201creally spiritual\u201d and described him as a \u201ccompassionate person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">{\u00b6 189} Charles R. See, a social service administrator with experience working with inner-city youth, also gave mitigation testimony for the defense. See interviewed LaMar and numerous members of LaMar\u2019s family to familiarize himself with LaMar\u2019s background. See described the area in which LaMar grew up as \u201csocially and economically depressed,\u201d but noted that LaMar\u2019s athletic talent could have been his \u201cticket out of the ghetto\u201d if he had received support and guidance. In See\u2019s view, however, LaMar\u2019s mother failed to provide strong parental support and LaMar\u2019s stepfather was excessively abusive. And when LaMar eventually moved to an apartment of his own, See noted that he began living in one of the \u201cmost dangerous areas in the city of Cleveland.\u201d Based on his background and living conditions, See testified that it was \u201cninety percent predictable\u201d that LaMar would become involved in drugs and other illegal activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">{\u00b6 190} Dr. Jeffrey L. Smalldon, a clinical psychologist, was the defense\u2019s final mitigation witness. He testified that LaMar was \u201cunfailingly polite and respectful\u201d during their meetings and described LaMar as \u201can unusually thoughtful, reflective, introspective\u201d person. Dr. Smalldon noted that LaMar denied involvement in the offenses for which he was convicted; this denial was unusual, Dr. Smalldon testified, in light of LaMar\u2019s usual disinclination to \u201cshift blame onto other people * * * for various illegal things he\u2019s done over the years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">{\u00b6 191} As for LaMar\u2019s personal background, Dr. Smalldon opined that the absence of a stable male role model left a \u201cprofound void\u201d in LaMar\u2019s life. Dr. Smalldon noted that LaMar never knew his biological father and that LaMar\u2019s stepfather, as well as an uncle, subjected him to \u201cvery, very harsh physical treatment.\u201d In turn, the abuse inflicted by LaMar\u2019s stepfather created a feeling of \u201chelplessness\u201d in LaMar, particularly because LaMar could not predict when the abuse would occur. In Dr. Smalldon\u2019s view, LaMar was also affected by his mother\u2019s \u201climited repertoire of parenting skills\u201d and the death of another brother at a young age.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>{\u00b6 192} Dr. Smalldon also testified to the effect that drugs and alcohol had on LaMar\u2019s life. LaMar used and sold marijuana when he was fourteen years old and eventually began abusing alcohol, cocaine, crack, and PCP. According to Dr. Smalldon, LaMar developed a serious crack cocaine habit that persisted until he went to prison in 1989. The drugs provided LaMar with a means of \u201cescape\u201d and served a \u201cnumbing function\u201d that desensitized LaMar from the painful aspects of his day-to-day life. Dr. Smalldon ultimately diagnosed LaMar as drug- and alcohol-dependent. He also diagnosed LaMar as suffering from a \u201cpersonality disorder not otherwise specified but one having antisocial and narcissistic features.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">{\u00b6 193} In his unsworn statement, LaMar told the jurors that he was disappointed in their verdict but that he did not hold it against them. He also explained that his previous murder conviction resulted from a shootout in which he had also been shot. LaMar expressed some regret about that incident because the victim he shot \u201ctwice in the heart\u201d had been a childhood friend. LaMar acknowledged that his background had been difficult and added that he had instructed his mother not to testify for him because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want her to feel that she had to justify, you know, or apologize for doing the best that she could.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">{\u00b6 194} In conducting our independent assessment of the appropriateness of the death sentence, we must weigh the aggravating circumstances against (1) the nature and circumstances of the crime, (2) the history, background, and character of the offender, and (3) any applicable mitigating factors enumerated in R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) through (B)(7). <em>State v. Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 491, 739 N.E.2d 749. Here, the nature and circumstances of the aggravated murders offer little to nothing in terms of mitigation. LaMar was the leader of a death squad that brutally beat the L-6 victims simply because they were suspected \u201csnitches.\u201d And as to Weaver\u2019s murder, LaMar ordered others to strangle the victim and threatened cellmates with physical harm if they did not comply with his orders. Moreover, these circumstances convince us that the statutory mitigating factors enumerated at R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) (victim inducement), (B)(2) (duress, coercion, strong provocation), and (B)(6) (accused not being principal offender) are inapplicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">{\u00b6 195} As for the evidence relating to LaMar\u2019s background, we acknowledge that it is entitled to some weight. See, e.g., <em>Tibbetts, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 174, 749 N.E.2d 226. We accord it only modest weight, however, just as we have done in other capital cases of defendants with similarly troubled backgrounds. See, e.g., <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 405, 424, 692 N.E.2d 151. We also give some weight to Dr. Smalldon\u2019s diagnosis of LaMar\u2019s drug addiction. See <em>Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 493, 739 N.E.2d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>{\u00b6 196} \u25a0 The remaining statutory mitigating factors are generally inapplicable in this case. Although Dr. Smalldon testified that LaMar suffers from a personality disorder, we are unable to conclude that this condition rises to the level of a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d that would trigger the R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) mitigating factor in light of the absence of testimony that the condition prevented LaMar from appreciating the criminality of his conduct. See, e.g., <em>Tibbetts, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 173, 749 N.E.2d 226. LaMar\u2019s criminal record rendered R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) (lack of significant criminal history) inapplicable and we see no reason why LaMar\u2019s age at the time of the offenses should trigger the R.C. 2929.04(B)(4) \u201cyouth of the offender\u201d factor. Finally, the evidence does not suggest the existence of any other mitigating factors. See R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">{\u00b6 197} Against the modest mitigating evidence, we weigh the aggravating circumstances of which LaMar was found guilty. In this case, the aggravating circumstances are grievous: LaMar, already incarcerated as a convicted murderer, was the ringleader in a murder spree that killed five victims. We further note that the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) prior-murder specification is of particular significance. As we just recently observed, \u201cthe (A)(5) prior-murder circumstance \u2018can be even more grave than other aggravating circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 48, 58, 765 N.E.2d 334, quoting <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 15, 34, 676 N.E.2d 82. We therefore agree with the jury and the trial court that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">{\u00b6 198} We also find that the death sentence in this case is appropriate and proportionate when compared with similar capital cases in which the death penalty has been imposed. See <em>State v. Steffen, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph one of the syllabus. We have affirmed the imposition of the death penalty in other cases involving murders committed during the SOCF riot. See <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 750 N.E.2d 90; <em>State v. Robb, 88 </em>Ohio St.3d 59, 723 N.E.2d 1019. LaMar\u2019s sentence also appears appropriate and proportional when compared to other death-penalty cases involving similar aggravating circumstances. See, e.g., <em>State v. Campbell, </em>supra, 95 Ohio St.3d 48, 765 N.E.2d 334 (aggravated murder committed during a kidnapping by an offender with a prior murder conviction); <em>State v. Carter </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 218, 594 N.E.2d 595 (aggravated murder committed in a detention facility by an offender with a prior murder conviction); <em>State v. Zuern </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 56, 512 N.E.2d 585 (aggravated murder in a detention facility); <em>State v. Hessler, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 108, 734 N.E.2d 1237 (course of conduct involving multiple murders); <em>State v.

The trial court erred in failing to sustain appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal for the kidnapping specification on the charges relating to Darrell Depina, Bruce Vitale, Albert Staino [sic, Staiano] and William Svette, pursuant to Crim.R. 29, as the convictions of the appellant were based on insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">{\u00b6 214} Proposition of Law No. 12: The trial court committed prejudicial error in failing to grant Mr. LaMar\u2019s motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence thereby denying Mr. LaMar his constitutional rights to due process, a fair trial, effective assistance of counsel and a reliable sentencing determination as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Sections 2, 9, 10 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">{\u00b6 215} Proposition of Law No. 13: The trial court erred in failing to grant defendant\u2019s motion for new trial pursuant to Crim.R. 33(3) [sic, 33(A)(3) ], thereby denying appellant LaMar his rights to due process, a fair trial, and effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">{\u00b6 216} Proposition of Law No. 14: The trial court committed prejudicial error in admitting all evidence submitted by the state in the guilt-innocence phase into the mitigation phase as much of the evidence was not relevant to any specific aggravating circumstance.

This failure denied the appellant his due process rights as guaranteed by the United States and Ohio Constitution[s].</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">{\u00b6 220} Proposition of Law No. 18: The Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Sections 10 and 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and R.C. 2929.05 guarantee a convicted capital defendant a fair and impartial review of his death sentence. The statutorily mandated proportionality process in Ohio does not comport with this constitutional requirement and thus is fatally flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">{\u00b6 221} A. This court, in performing its proportionality review, should compare Mr. LaMar\u2019s sentence with other inmate defendant\u2019s sentences received for crimes committed during the Lucasville riot. Such comparison would guarantee Mr. LaMar the rights set forth in the U.S. Constitution as well as those sought to be protected by the Ohio Constitution and Ohio capital statutory framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">{\u00b6 222} B. In performing this comparison this court will find that from initiation of the charges through the trial and sentencing of Mr. LaMar, the prosecution selectively sought to impose a heavier penalty on appellant than any other inmate accused or convicted of killing inmates. Such selective prosecution cannot withstand scrutiny and accordingly this court will find that Keith LaMar\u2019s death sentences are in violation of both U.S. and state constitutional principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">{\u00b6 223} Proposition of Law No. 19: Repeatedly instructing that a jury\u2019s verdict is only a recommendation violates the Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Section[s] 2, 9, 10 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution. The prejudice an appellant suffers from this constitutional violation is further exacerbated by using the term \u201crecommendation\u201d on the actual verdict forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">{\u00b6 224} Proposition of Law No. 20: The Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Sections 2, 9, 10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>and 16 of the Ohio Constitution establish the requirements for a valid death penalty scheme.
