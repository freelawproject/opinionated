In December 2000, appellee, Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge Ronald Suster, denied White\u2019s motion to correct the entry of sentence.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A0-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Dewight White, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b628-3\">{\u00b6 2} In July 2001, White filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County for a writ of mandamus to compel Judge Suster to correct his journal entry \u201cto reflect the fact that [his] sentencing was never scheduled for April 11, 1996, at 9:00 A.M. at Relator\u2019s request, nor was Relator sentenced on March 28, 1996.\u201d White did not attach an affidavit required of inmates by R.C. 2969.25(A) describing each civil action or appeal of a civil action filed by the inmate against governmental entities or employees in the previous five years in any state or federal court, an R.C. 2969.25(C) certified statement of his prison cashier, or an affidavit specifying the details of his claim, as required by Loc.App.R. 45(B)(1)(a). After Judge Suster filed an answer and a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, the court of appeals denied the writ. The court of appeals denied the writ for three separate reasons: (1) mandamus is not appropriate to compel a judge to enter a specific judgment, (2) White did not comply with Loc.App.R. 45(B)(1)(a), and (3) White did not comply with the filing requirements of R.C. 2969.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">{\u00b6 3} In his appeal of right, White challenges only the first of the three reasons given by the court of appeals in denying the writ. Therefore, even assuming that White\u2019s contention on appeal is correct, he would still not be entitled to reversal of the judgment. In other words, even if the court\u2019s rationale on one of its grounds was incorrect, its judgment denying the writ based on the two grounds that White does not challenge on appeal was proper. <em>State ex rel.
