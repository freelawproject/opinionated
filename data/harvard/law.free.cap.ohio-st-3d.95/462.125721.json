However, I strongly disagree with the majority\u2019s implicit conclusion that this case amounts to multiple appeals within the statutory time period. When one large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>parcel is divided into many distinct plots, the right to appeal should be determined by plot, not by the parcel as a whole. To do otherwise is grossly unfair to the actual users because of the multiple uses to which the land is put. Accordingly, I concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b625-5\">Rich, Crites <em>&amp; </em>Wesp, Jeffrey A. Rich and Mark H.
