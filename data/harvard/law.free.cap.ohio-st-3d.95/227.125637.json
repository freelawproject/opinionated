The trial court sentenced appellant to death. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">{\u00b6 2} At the time of Wilma Arnett\u2019s murder, Calvin Davis was the central figure of a Shelby County narcotics ring. He had formerly headed a door-to-door \u201cgypsy\u201d painting crew in Georgia; appellant had worked on his painting crew during 1991 or 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-15\">{\u00b6 3} Wilma Arnett was the sister of Calvin Davis\u2019s wife, Jewel. Arnett lived in Sidney, the Shelby County seat. For a number of months, Arnett had been a police informant in local drug cases. From September 1993 to January 1994, Arnett made controlled drug purchases under the supervision of detectives while wearing a hidden recorder and transmitter.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>{\u00b6 4} In February 1994, a grand jury indicted Calvin Davis and fourteen others for aggravated drug trafficking. Calvin Davis\u2019s codefendants included Tyrone McGhee and Jermaine Jelks, two members of Calvin Davis\u2019s drug ring. After Calvin Davis received discovery from the state, he told his wife that Arnett \u201chad to go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant\u2019s girlfriend, Elizabeth Johnson, had a conversation with Calvin Davis in late 1993 or early 1994. An enraged Calvin Davis told her that Arnett had \u201cset him up\u201d and that he would \u201cgo to prison for 15 years\u201d because of Arnett\u2019s betrayal. Arnett had left a message on Calvin Davis\u2019s answering machine threatening to inform the police about his drug dealing unless Calvin Davis paid her off, and Calvin Davis played the message for Johnson. Calvin Davis told Johnson that \u201cbefore he gave [Arnett] any more fuckin\u2019 money, he\u2019d have her killed or kill her himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 6} In May 1994, Calvin Davis summoned appellant to Shelby County. On May 2, Calvin Davis paid for a bus ticket in the name of Elizabeth Johnson to take appellant .from Augusta, Georgia, to Sidney, Ohio. Davis arranged for Johnson to pick it up at the Augusta bus station. Johnson picked up the ticket, gave it to appellant, and put him on the bus. Although the ticket entitled appellant to ride all the way to Sidney, he got off the bus in Cincinnati. Calvin Davis, along with Davis\u2019s wife and a friend, picked him up there and drove him to Sidney. Calvin Davis later introduced appellant to Tyrone McGhee as \u201cmy boy.\u201d While in Sidney, appellant supported himself by dealing drugs in association with Calvin Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 7} State\u2019s Exhibit 26, a photograph of appellant, shows a large cyst below and to the right of appellant\u2019s right eye. (Because of his distinctive appearance, appellant was nicknamed \u201cKnothead.\u201d) Appellant no longer had the cyst by the time that he was tried, but his girlfriend testified that Exhibit 26 accurately depicted appellant\u2019s appearance \u2014 including the cyst \u2014 in May 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 8} In May 1994, Calvin Davis, McGhee, and Jelks were discussing their cases with appellant in Calvin Davis\u2019s van. Calvin Davis suggested that he and McGhee \u201cshould * * * pay Kevin Yarbrough to do a hit on Wilma * * * so our drug cases would get dropped.\u201d Calvin Davis and McGhee were each to pay appellant $10,000. They drove to McGhee\u2019s house. McGhee got out of the van and came back with a duffel bag containing $10,000 in cash. He gave the bag to appellant, who counted the money in the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">{\u00b6 9} Annette Simmons was Calvin Davis\u2019s neighbor; originally from Georgia, she had known Calvin Davis since he was sixteen. One evening in May, while appellant was staying with the Davises, Simmons was visiting Jewel Davis. In Simmons\u2019s presence, appellant asked Calvin Davis, \u201c[D]id you get the picture?\u201d Calvin Davis asked his wife, \u201c[D]o you have the picture!?]\u201d A photograph of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Jewel Davis and Wilma Arnett was removed from an album and torn or cut in half. Calvin Davis showed appellant the half depicting Wilma; then Calvin Davis pocketed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 10} On May 9, 1994, the day before Wilma Arnett\u2019s body was found, Jewel Davis saw her husband hand his .38-caliber handgun to appellant. That same day, Vicki Shawler saw \u201ca tall black male\u201d displaying a handgun during a party. The man was in the company of Calvin Davis, and he had a \u201cmole\u201d or \u201cmark\u201d on his face, located where appellant\u2019s cyst had been.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">{\u00b6 11} At the United gas station in Sidney, Tanya Counts was working the last shift on May 9 as a cashier. During Counts\u2019s shift, which ended at 10 or 11:00 p.m. that night, Wilma Arnett came to the station three times. The first two times, she was by herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 12} Near the end of her shift, Counts saw Arnett for the third time. This time, Arnett was accompanied by a tall black man with a \u201cbump\u201d on his face. Arnett drove in and pumped some gasoline, and her companion came inside and paid for it. He asked Counts if the station sold beer. Counts said no, and the man left.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">{\u00b6 13} Counts could not positively identify appellant as the man with Arnett. However, Counts testified that the \u201cbump\u201d on the man\u2019s face was in the same location as appellant\u2019s cyst shown in State\u2019s Exhibit 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">{\u00b6 14} Just before midnight on May 9, a motorist saw Arnett\u2019s car parked at the edge of a field on Dingman-Slagle Road, outside Sidney. He saw at least one person in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">{\u00b6 15} Around 12:30 or 1:00 a.m. on May 10, appellant came into Walleyes Bar in Sidney to speak to Calvin Davis. McGhee, who was watching a pool game and standing near Calvin Davis, heard the conversation. Appellant approached Calvin Davis and reported, \u201cThe snitch is no more.\u201d He commented that \u201cthe bitch was hard to die.\u201d He then told Calvin Davis that he \u201cbeat her down,\u201d that he \u201c[s]hot her once and * * * had to shoot her again because she wasn\u2019t dead the first time,\u201d and that he \u201cthrew the gun up there in the woods\u201d near the residence of James Bussey, Calvin Davis\u2019s nephew. Appellant also said something about \u201cthe window being broke out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">{\u00b6 16} On the morning of May 10, Arnett\u2019s husband looked for her. He did not find her, but he did find her car parked in town. The windshield had been broken, scattering glass fragments on the seat and floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">{\u00b6 17} That same morning, another motorist reported a body lying in a field on Dingman-Slagle Road, where Arnett\u2019s car had been seen at midnight. The body was later identified as Wilma Arnett. Fragments of tinted automotive window glass were found near the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>{\u00b6 18} Arnett was shot three times in the head and three times in the body. A .38-caliber slug was recovered from Arnett\u2019s body. Semen was found on a vaginal swab taken during the autopsy. DNA analysis showed that appellant was the source of the semen.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 19} On the morning of May 10, Calvin Davis told his wife that he wanted appellant out of his house. Calvin Davis then went to the nearby apartment of Paul Smith, another meinber of his drug ring, and ordered him to \u201cget [appellant] out of there.\u201d Calvin Davis told Smith that appellant had stolen money and crack from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 20} Appellant got into Smith\u2019s car with two bags, one of which was a duffel bag. Smith headed for Sidney, but appellant told him to drive to Lima instead. When they arrived, the bus station was closed, so Smith checked appellant into a motel under Smith\u2019s name. Appellant told Smith: \u201c[T]ell Calvin where I am. Don\u2019t tell nobody else.\u201d This surprised Smith, since Calvin Davis \u201cwas supposed to be mad at\u201d appellant.-</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 21} Three or four days after the murder, Calvin Davis told his wife that he had paid appellant $5,000 to kill Arnett and he \u201cwasn\u2019t gonna pay any more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">{\u00b6 22} As a result of Arnett\u2019s murder, the aggravated drug trafficking cases in which she was to testify were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">{\u00b6 23} In September- 1994, Detective Joanie Henry of the Shelby County Sheriffs Department interviewed appellant in South Carolina. At first, appellant told Henry that \u201che had heard of the murder but did not know Wilma.\u201d After seeing Wilma\u2019s picture, he admitted that he had seen her at Walleyes Bar \u201cbut denied that he\u2019d ever had any contact with her.\u201d Later, appellant admitted to Henry that he and Arnett \u201chad had contact with each other outside Walleyes Bar within a few days [of] when he first arrived\u201d and that he had sexual relations with Arnett. He denied being with her on the night of May 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">{\u00b6 24} In 1995, appellant was being held in the Shelby County Jail on other charges. One day in late October or early November, appellant returned from a court appearance \u201cexcited\u201d and \u201cupset.\u201d He told Vance Short, a fellow inmate, that he was \u201cafraid that he was the last person that [Arnett] was seen with.\u201d He also said, \u201c[W]ell, I made sure that the bitch got what she deserved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">{\u00b6 25} In December 1995, a local resident found a .38-caliber revolver in a wooded area not far from the apartment complex where Calvin Davis\u2019s nephew Bussey lived. Witnesses identified that gun as belonging to Calvin Davis. It was impossible to determine conclusively that the .38-caliber slug removed from Arnett\u2019s body was fired from that gun. However, the gun could not be excluded as the murder weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>{\u00b6 26} Appellant was ultimately indicted for aggravated murder with prior calculation and design in violation of R.C. 2903.01(A) with two death specifications: murder for hire pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(2) and murder of a witness pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(8). The indictment also charged conspiracy to commit aggravated murder, R.C. 2923.01(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 27} Appellant was convicted of all charges and specifications. After a penalty hearing, the trial judge followed the jury\u2019s recommendation and sentenced him to death. The court of appeals affirmed appellant\u2019s aggravated murder conviction and death sentence. On the authority of R.C. 2923.01(G), the court of appeals reversed appellant\u2019s conspiracy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 28} Appellant appeals as a matter of right, pursuant to R.C. 2929.05(A) and former Section 2(B)(2)(a)(ii), Article IV, Ohio Constitution, from the judgment affirming his aggravated murder conviction and death sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He raises eighteen propositions of law. In our judgment, none of these propositions of law justifies reversal of the conviction or sentence. We have also independently reviewed the death sentence imposed in this case for appropriateness and proportionality. For the reasons that follow, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">I. Admission of Calvin Davis\u2019s OuNof-Court Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">{\u00b6 29} Calvin Davis died on June 1, 1996. Thus, he was unavailable to testify at appellant\u2019s trial. However, the state introduced into evidence three out-of-court statements that Calvin Davis had made between November 1993 and May 1994. In his first proposition of law, appellant contends that admission of these three statements violated the hearsay rule of the Ohio Rules of Evidence and the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">A. Statement to Elizabeth Johnson</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">{\u00b6 30} Johnson testified that she and Calvin Davis had had a conversation in November or December 1993 or early in 1994. An \u201c[e]nraged\u201d Calvin Davis was complaining that Arnett had \u201cset him up\u201d and that \u201che\u2019d go to prison for 15 years.\u201d Johnson then testified, \u201cHe [Calvin Davis] said before he gave her any more fuckin\u2019 money, he\u2019d have her killed or kill her himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>{\u00b6 31} Over defense objection, the trial court admitted this testimony, holding that it qualified under both the \u201cstate of mind\u201d and the \u201cstatement against interest\u201d exceptions to the hearsay rule, Evid.R. 803(3) and 804(B)(3), respectively. Appellant contends that Calvin Davis\u2019s statement, \u201cbefore he gave her any more * * * money, he\u2019d have her killed or kill her himself,\u201d should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">{\u00b6 32} Evid.R. 803(3) creates a hearsay rule exception for \u201c[a] statement of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as <em>intent </em>* * *), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 33} Calvin Davis\u2019s statement was a statement of his then-existing intent. \u201c \u2018It has long been settled that the state-of-mind exception may be used as the basis for introducing statements showing the forward-looking intent of the declarant for the purpose of proving that he thereafter acted in accordance with that intent.\u2019 \u201d 4 Louisell &amp; Mueller, Federal Evidence (1980) 540, Section 442, quoted in <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 120, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383. See, generally, <em>Mut. Life Ins. Co. of New York v. Hillmon </em>(1892), 145 U.S. 285, 295, 12 S.Ct. 909, 36 L.Ed. 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 34} Although appellant calls this a hearsay issue, he does not seriously contend that Calvin Davis\u2019s statement fails to qualify for the state-of-mind exception of Evid.R. 803(3). Rather, he argues that the statement is irrelevant to proving Calvin Davis\u2019s state of mind because it was too remote in time from the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 35} However, it is the trial court\u2019s province to determine whether, under the circumstances, testimony is \u201cessentially misleading or too remote\u201d to be deemed relevant. <em>Whiteman v. State </em>(1928), 119 Ohio St. 285, 298, 164 N.E. 51. Trial courts have \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in determining relevance, and we are correspondingly \u201cslow to interfere\u201d with a trial court\u2019s exercise of that discretion. <em>State v. Hymore </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St.2d 122, 128, 38 O.O.2d 298, 224 N.E.2d 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">{\u00b6 36} Six months at most elapsed between Calvin Davis\u2019s statement \u2014 made no earlier than November 1993 \u2014 and his hiring appellant to kill Arnett in May 1994. Indeed, the trial court could have found that Calvin Davis made this statement to Johnson later than November 1993. Jewel Davis recalled that Arnett had left the phone message after Calvin Davis was indicted, which was in February 1994. Since Arnett was still making drug buys in January 1994, Calvin Davis presumably did not know in November 1993 that Arnett was working with police.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">{\u00b6 37} In any case, Calvin Davis\u2019s anger at Arnett was likely still fresh in May 1994, with his trial pending. (According to Paul Smith, Calvin.Davis told Jewel Davis in January or February 1994 that Arnett \u201chad to go.\u201d) Hence, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>trial court could reasonably find that Calvin Davis\u2019s statement to Johnson was not too remote to be relevant, and the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting that statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 38} Appellant further contends that the statement is irrelevant because it is not \u201cprobative of appellant\u2019s involvement.\u201d But the state never claimed that the statement directly proved appellant\u2019s involvement, and that is not the test of its probative value. Evid.R. 401 defines \u201crelevant evidence\u201d as \u201cevidence having <em>any </em>tendency to make the existence of <em>any </em>fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 39} To obtain these convictions and the sentence of death, the state had to prove not only that appellant killed Arnett, but that he killed with prior calculation and design, R.C. 2903.01(A), and that he did so \u201cfor hire,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(A)(2). Calvin Davis\u2019s statement that he intended to <em>\u201chave [Arnett] killed </em>or kill her\u201d makes it \u201cmore probable\u201d that appellant was <em>hired </em>to kill Arnett \u201cthan it would be without the [statement].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 40} Finally, we reject appellant\u2019s argument that the court should have excluded the statement under Evid.R. 403(A). That rule requires a trial court to exclude relevant evidence whose \u201cprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d But the exclusion of <em>relevant </em>evidence under Evid.R. 403(A) is even more of a judgment call than determining whether the evidence has logical relevance in the first place. Thus, \u201cthe trial court is vested with broad discretion and an appellate court should not interfere absent a clear abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Allen </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 626, 633, 653 N.E.2d 675. There was no such \u201cclear abuse\u201d here. The statement at issue created no danger of unfair prejudice or jury confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">B. Statement to Jewel Davis</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 41} On direct examination, Jewel Davis testified, \u201cCalvin stated that he paid $5,000 to Kevin to have Wilma killed. * * * He said he wasn\u2019t gonna pay any more.\u201d This statement, though hearsay, was admitted under the Evid.R. 804(B)(3) exception for statements against interest. Appellant contends first that the statement was not an admission against interest and, second, that it was not corroborated by the circumstances of its making, so that its admission into evidence also violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">{\u00b6 42} Evid.R. 804(B)(3) creates a hearsay rule exception for statements against interest. The rule allows admission of \u201c[a] statement that * * * at the time of its making * * * so far tended to subject the declarant to * * * criminal liability * * * that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>made the statement unless the declarant believed it to be true. A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability, whether offered to exculpate or inculpate the accused, is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 43} Appellant argues that Calvin Davis\u2019s statement was not against his penal interest \u2014 i.e., it did not tend \u201cto subject [Calvin Davis] to * * * criminal liability\u201d \u2014 because it was privileged. Under R.C. 2945.42, with certain exceptions not relevant here, a \u201c[h]usband or wife shall not testify concerning a communication made by one to the other * * * during coverture * * Thus, Jewel Davis could not have repeated Calvin Davis\u2019s admission in a prosecution of Calvin Davis. Although appellant lacks standing to assert Calvin Davis\u2019s marital privilege, see <em>Diehl v. Wilmot Castle Co. </em>(1971), 26 Ohio St.2d 249, 55 O.O.2d 484, 271 N.E.2d 261, appellant contends that, because Calvin Davis could have raised it, his statements to his wife were not against his penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 44} However, a statement may be against a declarant\u2019s penal interest even though it cannot be used in evidence against the declarant. The marital privilege bars only testimony; it \u201cdoes not ensure that the statement will not be repeated to the police or anyone else * * <em>State v. Kiewert </em>(1992), 135 N.H. 338, 344, 605 A.2d 1031. By telling his wife that he had paid for Arnett\u2019s murder, Calvin Davis placed himself at serious risk of arrest and prosecution. His statement was therefore against his penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 45} Appellant also argues that Calvin Davis\u2019s statement was not made under circumstances suggesting that it is trustworthy. Under Evid.R. 804(B)(3), \u201c[a] statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability * * * is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">{\u00b6 46} The existence or nonexistence of corroborating circumstances also invokes Confrontation Clause concerns. The hearsay exception for statements against interest is not a firmly rooted exception, at least when the statement is \u201coffered by the prosecution to establish the guilt of an alleged accomplice of the declarant.\u201d <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 385, 721 N.E.2d 52. See, also, <em>Lilly v. Virginia </em>(1999), 527 U.S. 116, 130-134, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">{\u00b6 47} For this reason, the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment permits such a statement to be admitted only if it exhibits adequate indicia of reliability. <em>Madrigal, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 386, 721 N.E.2d 52. See, generally, <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597. Moreover, \u201cthe fact that other evidence corroborates the statement is irrelevant. * * * The relevant circumstances include <em>\u2018only those that surround </em>the making of the statement and that render the declarant particularly worthy of belief.\u2019 (Empha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>sis added.)\u201d <em>Madrigal, 87 </em>Ohio St.3d at 387, 721 N.E.2d 52, quoting <em>Idaho v. Wright </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 805, 819, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 48} Relying heavily on the plurality opinion in <em>Lilly v. Virginia, </em>supra, appellant contends that Calvin Davis\u2019s statement to Jewel Davis was not surrounded by \u201ccircumstances * * * that render the declarant particularly worthy of belief.\u201d Therefore, appellant contends, the statement\u2019s admission violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 49} We disagree. Calvin Davis\u2019s statement to his wife is distinguishable from the statement at issue in <em>Lilly </em>on every relevant point. This is not a case where \u201cthe government [was] involved in the statements\u2019 production.\u201d <em>Lilly, </em>527 U.S. at 137, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117. Calvin Davis was not in custody when he made the statement, nor was he speaking \u201cunder the supervision of governmental authorities.\u201d Id. at 139, 119 S.Ct. 1887,144 L.Ed.2d 117. Thus, he had no \u201cnatural motive to attempt to exculpate himself as much as possible\u201d by implicating appellant. Id. Nor was he \u201cresponding to * * * leading questions.\u201d Id. See <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 61, 752 N.E.2d 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">{\u00b6 50} Nor can we accept appellant\u2019s contention that Calvin Davis was shifting blame from himself. Like the declarant in <em>Issa, </em>he \u201chad nothing to gain from inculpating appellant in the crime.\u201d <em>Issa, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 61, 752 N.E.2d 904. \u201cAt best, [declarant\u2019s] statement would \u2018shift\u2019 enough blame so that he and [defendant] would share responsibility for the crime. [Declarant] would be exposed to an equally severe penalty on the basis of his confession alone.\u201d <em>People v. Petros </em>(1993), 198 Mich.App. 401, 416, 499 N.W.2d 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">{\u00b6 51} <em>\u201cLilly\u2019s, </em>main concern was with statements in which, as is common in police-station confessions, the declarant admits only what the authorities are already capable of proving against him and seeks to shift the principal blame to another (against whom the prosecutor then offers the statement at trial).\u201d <em>United States v. Shea </em>(C.A.1, 2000), 211 F.3d 658, 669. The statement in <em>Lilly </em>whose admission violated the Confrontation Clause fit that description. Calvin Davis\u2019s spontaneous statement to his wife, in his own home, with no state involvement whatsoever, does not. <em>\u201cLilly </em>does not change the fact that statements to close family members have \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Westmoreland </em>(C.A.7, 2001), 240 F.3d 618, 628, quoting <em>United States v. Tocco </em>(C.A.6, 2000), 200 F.3d 401, 416. See, also, <em>Latine v. Mann </em>(C.A.2, 1994), 25 F.3d 1162, 1166-1167 (distinguishing between custodial statements to police and statements to a perceived ally).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">{\u00b6 52} Appellant goes so far as to contend that Calvin Davis\u2019s statement is unreliable because he was speaking to his wife; he argues that Calvin Davis \u201chad every reason to believe that his conversations with his wife would never be disclosed and would never subject him to criminal liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>{\u00b6 53} Although a few courts have found similar reasoning persuasive in part, see <em>United States v. Hoyos </em>(C.A.9, 1978), 573 F.2d 1111, 1115; <em>United States v. Battiste </em>(N.D.Ill.1993), 834 F.Supp. 995, 1006, and fn. 11; <em>State v. Myers </em>(1981), 229 Kan. 168, 175, 625 P.2d 1111, others have not. See <em>Linton v. State </em>(Alaska App. 1994), 880 P.2d 123, 127-128; <em>State v. Kiewert </em>(1992), 135 N.H. 338, 605 A.2d 1031. We believe the latter courts take the better position. \u201cEven to people we trust completely, we are not likely to admit serious fault of which we are innocent * * 4 Mueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence (2d Ed.1994) 822-823, Section 496. Thus, where a declarant makes a statement to someone with whom he has a close personal relationship, such as a spouse, child, or friend, courts usually hold that the relationship is a corroborating circumstance <em>supporting </em>the statement\u2019s trustworthiness. See, e.g., <em>Green v. Georgia </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 95, 97, 99 S.Ct. 2150, 60 L.Ed.2d 738; <em>United States v. Tocco, </em>supra; <em>United States v. Boone </em>(C.A.9, 2000), 229 F.3d 1231, 1234; <em>Westmoreland, </em>240 F.3d at 627-628.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b6 54} To sum up: Calvin Davis was speaking to his wife, not to police; he was at home, not in custody; his statement was spontaneous, and he had nothing to gain by incriminating appellant. These are corroborating circumstances that render his statement worthy of belief. The admission of that statement did not, therefore, violate either the Confrontation Clause or Evid.R. 804(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">C. Statement to Jermaine Jelks</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">{\u00b6 55} Jermaine Jelks testified to a conversation that took place in Calvin Davis\u2019s van before the murder. Jelks testified that Calvin Davis \u201cwas speakin\u2019 based upon our drug cases and suggested they should * * * pay Kevin Yarbrough to do a hit on Wilma. * * * It was $10,000 apiece.\u201d Over objection, this testimony was admitted under the rule for statements by coconspirators, Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e), and under the hearsay exception for statements against interest when the declarant is unavailable, Evid.R. 804(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">{\u00b6 56} The court of appeals upheld the admission of this statement to Jelks on essentially the same grounds that it upheld the admission of Calvin Davis\u2019s statement to Jewel Davis that Calvin Davis had paid appellant to have Wilma Arnett killed. We agree with the court of appeals that this statement also was admissible under Evid.R. 804(B)(3) as a statement against interest. We also agree that the corroborating circumstances render the statement sufficiently trustworthy that the Confrontation Clause was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">{\u00b6 57} The trial court properly admitted each of the statements in question. Appellant\u2019s first proposition of law is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>II. Exclusion of Hearsay \u2014 Due Process Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">{\u00b6 58} In his second proposition of law, appellant contends that certain out-of-court statements by Calvin Davis should have been <em>admitted </em>as statements against interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">{\u00b6 59} Appellant proffered the testimony of Kenneth Henderson, who had been in jail with Calvin Davis in November or December 1994. According to Henderson, Calvin Davis told him \u201cthat Tyrone McGhee and Jermaine Jelks and Darren Taborn killed Wilma. * * * He said that * * * they came to his house early that morning and cleaned blood off \u2018em or somethin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">{\u00b6 60} The defense argued that Calvin Davis\u2019s statements to Henderson were admissible as statements against Calvin Davis\u2019s penal interest. The trial judge found that no corroborating circumstances supported the truthfulness of these statements. He therefore excluded them.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">{\u00b6 61} Appellant argues that the statements meet every requirement of Evid.R. 804(B)(3) and therefore should have been admitted. He further argues that excluding the statements denied him due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">A. Evid.R. 804(B)(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">{\u00b6 62} Calvin Davis\u2019s statement that McGhee, Jelks, and Taborn killed Arnett was clearly not against Calvin Davis\u2019s penal interest. On the other hand, his statement that McGhee, Jelks, and Taborn washed blood from themselves at Calvin Davis\u2019s house was against his penal interest, at least arguably. The statement could be construed as implying that he permitted the others to wash off the blood, which could be deemed to violate R.C. 2921.32(A), obstructing justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">{\u00b6 63} However, the rule requires that the statement so far subjected him to criminal liability that a reasonable person would not make the statement unless true. <em>Issa, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 58, 752 N.E.2d 904. Appellant concedes that the statement represents an effort to shift blame to Taborn, McGhee, and Jelks. The evidence at trial shows that Calvin Davis was far more deeply involved in Arnett\u2019s murder than his statement to Henderson would suggest. A reasonable person might easily make a false statement that minimized his involvement in the-offense. Compare <em>People v. Petros </em>(1993), 198 Mich.App. 401, 499 N.W.2d 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">{\u00b6 64} Moreover, there is little to indicate that the statement is trustworthy. The sole corroborating circumstance is that Calvin Davis was not speaking to police and therefore was not trying to curry favor. However, while \u201cjailhouse <em>confessions </em>to cellmates\u201d may be \u201ctrustworthy and admissible,\u201d we cannot say the same of a statement that <em>shifts </em>blame from the declarant to others. (Emphasis added.) <em>Westmoreland, </em>240 F.3d at 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>{\u00b6 65} Appellant purports to find further corroboration in the facts that Henderson and Calvin. Davis were discussing their cases, that Henderson knew Calvin Davis was in jail on drug charges, and that \u201cprior indictments, convictions, or dismissals\u201d were therefore a likely topic of conversation between them. Appellant offers no explanation of how these facts show the trustworthiness of Calvin Davis\u2019s statements. On balance, we find that the exclusion of Calvin Davis\u2019s statements comported with Evid.R. 804(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">B. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">{\u00b6 66} Appellant further argues that, irrespective of whether the statements were admissible under Evid.R. 804(B)(3), their exclusion denied him due process of law. Here, appellant relies on <em>Chambers v. Mississippi </em>(1973), 410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297. <em>Chambers </em>holds that due process \u201caffords criminal defendants the right to introduce into evidence third parties\u2019 declarations against penal <em>interest </em>\u2014 their <em>confessions </em>\u2014 when the circumstances surrounding the statements (provid[e] considerable assurance of their reliability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lilly, </em>527 U.S. 116, 130, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (plurality opinion) (emphasis added), quoting <em>Chambers, </em>410 U.S. at 300, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">{\u00b6 67} In this case, the circumstances surrounding Calvin Davis\u2019s statements provide no assurances of reliability remotely comparable to those in <em>Chambers. </em>There, the declarant confessed to the murder, and his confession exonerated the defendant. <em>Chambers, </em>410 U.S. at 297, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297. But Calvin Davis\u2019s statements did not amount to a confession; he may have exposed himself to some liability, but he was accusing <em>other </em>people of killing Arnett. Furthermore, Calvin Davis\u2019s statements did not exonerate appellant; the possible involvement of three other persons in the murder hardly disproves appellant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">{\u00b6 68} In <em>Chambers, </em>the declarant\u2019s statement was corroborated both by the circumstances of its making and by other evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 410 U.S. at 300, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297; see, also, <em>Green v. Georgia, </em>442 U.S. 95, 99 S.Ct. 2150, 60 L.Ed.2d 738. In this case, Calvin Davis\u2019s statements were corroborated to some extent by the circumstances of their making (in that they were not made to police), but not at all by other evidence. Finally, the <em>Chambers </em>declarant was available to be cross-examined. <em>Chambers, </em>410 U.S. at 301, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297. Calvin Davis was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>{\u00b6 69} <em>\u201cChambers </em>was an exercise in highly case-specific error correction.\u201d <em>Montana v. Egelhoff </em>(1996), 518 U.S. 37, 52, 116 S.Ct. 2013, 135 L.Ed.2d 361 (plurality opinion). The case \u201cestablish[ed] no new principles of constitutional law\u201d but \u201ch[e]ld quite simply that <em>under the facts and circumstances of this case </em>the rulings of the trial court deprived Chambers of a fair trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Egelhoff, </em>quoting <em>Chambers, </em>410 U.S. at 302-303, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">{\u00b6 70} The quite different \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d of this case call for a contrary result. Unlike the trial court in <em>Chambers, </em>the court here did not apply the hearsay rule \u201cmechanistically to defeat the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>410 U.S. at 302, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297. Rather, the court applied the rule properly for its historic purpose: to exclude statements of dubious reliability that cannot be tested by cross-examination. Appellant\u2019s second proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">III. Sufficiency and Weight of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">{\u00b6 71} In his fourteenth proposition, appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to convict him.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">{\u00b6 72} The state\u2019s evidence showed' that Calvin Davis wanted Arnett dead and that he had brought appellant to Shelby County no more than a week before her murder. Arnett was last seen alive late in the evening on May 9, and appellant returned to Georgia the very next morning. He traveled under false names, carried no identification during his Ohio sojourn, and went out of his way to avoid the Sidney bus station.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">{\u00b6 73} Jelks was present when Calvin Davis proposed that he and McGhee pay appellant to \u201chit\u201d Arnett \u201cso [their] drug cases would get dropped.\u201d Jelks saw McGhee give appellant $10,000 in a duffel bag, and he watched appellant count it. Calvin Davis told his wife that he had paid appellant $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">{\u00b6 74} Appellant had a large cyst near his eye. On the night of the murder, one witness saw a black man with a \u201cmole\u201d or \u201cknot\u201d near his eye carrying a pistol. Another saw Arnett that night in the company of a black man with a \u201cbump\u201d near his eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">{\u00b6 75} Later that night, McGhee was present when appellant described the murder to Calvin Davis. According to McGhee, appellant also told Calvin Davis that he \u201cthrew the gun up there in the woods\u201d near the home of Calvin Davis\u2019s nephew. A .38-caliber pistol was later found in that vicinity; two witnesses identified that gun as belonging to Calvin Davis. Jewel Davis testified that Calvin Davis gave that gun to appellant. Calvin Davis\u2019s gun was .38-caliber; so was the bullet removed from Arnett\u2019s corpse.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>{\u00b6 76} Appellant also mentioned \u201cthe window being broke out\u201d of Arnett\u2019s car, McGhee testified. Arnett\u2019s car had a broken window when her husband found it on the morning of May 10, and broken glass was found near Arnett\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 77} Appellant was identified as the source of semen found on a vaginal swab taken during Arnett\u2019s autopsy. After initially denying to a detective that he knew Arnett, appellant eventually admitted that he had had sexual relations with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 78} On sufficiency-of-the-evidence review, \u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">{\u00b6 79} Appellant argues that the testimony implicating him was \u201ccontradictory and incredible.\u201d However, this contention calls for an evaluation of the witnesses\u2019 credibility, which \u2014 as we have repeatedly pointed out \u2014 is not proper on review for evidentiary sufficiency. See, e.g., <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 543, 747 N.E.2d 765; <em>State v. Waddy </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 430, 588 N.E.2d 819; <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">{\u00b6 80} Appellant contends that we should not consider Calvin Davis\u2019s statements in this sufficiency review because, as appellant claims in his first proposition, they were inadmissible hearsay. He is mistaken. The statements were properly admitted, and on a claim of insufficient evidence, the reviewing court considers all the evidence admitted against the appellant at trial. See <em>Lockhart v. Nelson </em>(1988), 488 U.S. 33, 40-42, 109 S.Ct. 285, 102 L.Ed.2d 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">{\u00b6 81} Appellant further claims that there was insufficient evidence that the murder was committed for hire. But this ignores Jelks\u2019s testimony. Jelks not only heard the conversation in which Calvin Davis hired appellant to kill Arnett, he actually saw McGhee pay his portion in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">{\u00b6 82} The evidence, if believed, proves that appellant killed Arnett, that he did so to prevent her testimony against Calvin Davis\u2019s drug ring, and that he did so for hire. Appellant\u2019s fourteenth proposition of law is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">{\u00b6 83} In his third proposition, appellant contends that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence. \u201cPursuant to R.C. 2953.02, [this court] can overturn a conviction as being against the manifest weight of the evidence in a capital case, but only where the crime was committed after January 1, 1995.\u201d <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 254, 750 N.E.2d 90. Arnett was murdered in May 1994. Appellant\u2019s third proposition is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"Abz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>IV. Venue</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">{\u00b6 84} In his eleventh proposition, appellant asserts that the trial court should have granted his motion for a change of venue because \u201cextensive news coverage and widespread media exposure\u201d of Arnett\u2019s murder prevented him from obtaining a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">{\u00b6 85} A trial court has discretion to grant or deny a change-of-venue motion; its ruling will not be disturbed on appeal unless that discretion was abused. See, e.g., <em>State v. Lundgren </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 479, 653 N.E.2d 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">{\u00b6 86} Ordinarily, a defendant claiming that pretrial publicity denied him a fair trial must show that one or more jurors were actually biased. See <em>Mayola v. Alabama </em>(C.A.5, 1980), 623 F.2d 992, 996. However, \u201c[prejudice is presumed * * * when pretrial publicity is sufficiently prejudicial and inflammatory and * * * saturated the community where the trials were held.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Kemp </em>(C.A.11,1985), 778 F.2d 1487, 1490, citing <em>Murphy v. Florida </em>(1975), 421 U.S. 794, 798-799, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 44 L.Ed.2d 589; <em>Sheppard v. Maxwell </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 333, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600; <em>Estes v. Texas </em>(1965), 381 U.S. 532, 85 S.Ct. 1628, 14 L.Ed.2d 543; <em>Rideau v. Louisiana </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 723, 726-727, 83 S.Ct. 1417, 10 L.Ed.2d 663; <em>Mayola v. Alabama, </em>623 F.2d at 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">{\u00b6 87} Forty-seven veniremen were individually questioned in the voir dire process. Of these, forty-six were asked about pretrial publicity. Of these, forty-two had read or heard something about the case. But although the voir dire suggests that local media gave attention to the case, the record does not demonstrate that the publicity \u201csaturated the community.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Kemp, </em>778 F.2d at 1490. Moreover, despite appellant\u2019s allegations of \u201cinflammatory\u201d media coverage, there is nothing in the record to show the <em>content </em>of the coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">{\u00b6 88} Thus, appellant has shown neither that the media coverage saturated the community nor that it was inflammatory. Absent such a showing, we have no basis to presume prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">{\u00b6 89} In order to prevail on his change-of-venue claim, appellant must show that one or more of the jurors were actually biased by pretrial publicity. <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 464, 739 N.E.2d 749. We have closely examined the voir dire transcript, mindful that \u201c[t]he examination of jurors on their <em>voir dire </em>affords the best test as to whether prejudice exists in the community against the defendant, and whether it appears that opinions as to the guilt of the defendant of those called for examination for jurors are not fixed but would yield readily to evidence, it is not error to overrule an application for a change of venue, in absence of a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Swiger </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St.2d 151, 34 O.O.2d 270, 214 N.E.2d 417, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>{\u00b6 90} The voir dire record shows that of the forty-two jurors who had read or heard something about the case, thirty-eight said that they had not formed a firm opinion and could base a verdict on the trial evidence. One admitted forming opinions, but she had not formed one as to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, and she stated that he could set her opinions aside. Three stated that they had formed opinions they could not set aside; the trial court promptly dismissed all three.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">{\u00b6 91} The United States Supreme Court has recognized that voir dire denials of bias may not always be reliable: \u201cIn a community where <em>most </em>veniremen will admit to a disqualifying prejudice, the reliability of the others\u2019 protestations may be drawn into question; for it is then more probable that they are part of a community deeply hostile to the accused, and * * * may unwittingly have been influenced by it.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 803, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 44 L.Ed.2d 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 92} Here, however, only three veniremen of - forty-two admitted that they had formed preconceived opinions that they could not set aside. In <em>Murphy, </em>where a far larger proportion of the venire (twenty of seventy-eight) was excused for bias, the court stated: \u201cThis * * * by no means suggests a community with sentiment so poisoned against petitioner as to impeach the indifference of jurors who displayed no animus of their own.\u201d 421 U.S. at 803, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 44 L.Ed.2d 589. Thus, the trial judge here, as in <em>Murphy, </em>was entitled to rely on the truthfulness of the veniremen who stated under oath that they could be impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">{\u00b6 93} Significantly, the defense did not challenge any prospective juror for cause on the ground that the juror had been biased by pretrial publicity. In fact, defense counsel specifically \u201cpassed for cause\u201d (i.e., declined to challenge) thirty-two prospective jurors who had heard something about the case. Compare <em>State v. Davis </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 107, 111, 666 N.E.2d 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">{\u00b6 94} On these facts, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by denying a change of venue. Appellant\u2019s eleventh proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">V. Jury Selection Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">{\u00b6 95} In his twelfth proposition, appellant complains about various aspects of the jury selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">A. Motion for Individual Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">{\u00b6 96} The trial court allowed individual, sequestered voir dire only for pretrial publicity and death qualification issues. This was within the trial court\u2019s discretion: \u201cThere is no requirement that voir dire in a capital case must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>conducted in sequestration.\u201d <em>State v. Fears </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 338, 715 N.E.2d 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">{\u00b6 97} Nevertheless, appellant claims that the entire venire was \u201ctainted\u201d by hearing the answers that two prospective jurors gave during general voir dire. When asked if he \u201cwould give a police officer more credibility simply because he\u2019s a police officer,\u201d Juror No. 48 said \u2018Yes.\u201d Juror No. 34 was asked by defense counsel whether \u201csometimes the courts * * * are too soft on criminals.\u201d He said, \u2018Yes\u201d and explained, when asked, why he thought so.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">{\u00b6 98} Nothing in the record indicates that the statements at issue biased the other veniremen. Absent some such indication, we decline to speculate that hearing these opinions must somehow have irretrievably tainted the other prospective jurors. See <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 248, 750 N.E.2d 90, citing <em>State v. Doerr </em>(1998), 193 Ariz. 56, 62, 969 P.2d 1168, and <em>Lucero v. Kerby </em>(C.A.10, 1998), 133 F.3d 1299, 1308-1309. Compare <em>Mach v. Stewart </em>(C.A.9, 1997), 137 F.3d 630 (prejudice presumed where a venirewoman made repeated, definite assertions about a factual matter about which the venirewoman happened to be an expert that was germane to the trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">{\u00b6 99} Finally, appellant complains that the trial court \u201ccut off\u2019 his questioning of a juror. The record does not support this claim. When defense counsel began to question Juror No. 73, counsel began with the comment, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from you yet today.\u201d The trial court admonished counsel: \u201cJust because some jurors did not answer questions, I\u2019m not going to allow you to go through and pick each one just because they didn\u2019t answer a question or raise a question. If you have a specific question to ask them, fine; but just because they haven\u2019t answered is no reason to ask them specific questions.\u201d Counsel then proceeded to examine Juror No. 73 without further interruption from the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">B. Peremptory Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">{\u00b6 100} Appellant complains that the prosecutor used peremptory challenges to exclude jurors who opposed capital punishment. Appellant did not object at trial and thus has waived this claim. See <em>State v. Allen </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 626, 629, 653 N.E.2d 675, and <em>State v. Lundgren </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 484, 653 N.E.2d 304. See, also, <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 670, 675, 687 N.E.2d 1358, where we rejected the claim that this practice is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">C. Challenge for Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">{\u00b6 101} On voir dire, Juror No. 16 indicated a belief that murderers should get the death penalty to protect society and stated that \u201cprobably fear in me would try [to] persuade going the other, towards death.\u201d She also repeatedly affirmed that she would set aside her feelings and consider mitigating circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>stances. Appellant passed Juror No. 16 for cause, and she was seated on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">{\u00b6 102} Appellant now contends that this juror was predisposed to vote in favor of death irrespective of mitigation and should therefore have been excused for cause. However, by declining to challenge the juror for cause, appellant waived this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">D. Venire Drawn from Electors List</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 103} Finally, appellant complains that the venire was drawn exclusively from registered voters rather than from licensed drivers. This, he alleges, produced a venire with no black members.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">{\u00b6 104} Under R.C. 2313.08(B), each county may compile its jury list either (1) exclusively from the list of electors certified by the county board of elections, or (2) from that list, combined with the list of licensed drivers certified by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles. Shelby County uses the electors list.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">{\u00b6 105} Appellant contends that drawing the venire solely from registered voters deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to a jury drawn from \u201ca fair cross section of the community.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Louisiana </em>(1975), 419 U.S. 522, 527, 95 S.Ct. 692, 42 L.Ed.2d 690. See, generally, <em>State v. Fulton </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 120, 566 N.E.2d 1195, paragraph two of the syllabus, citing <em>Duren v. Missouri </em>(1979), 439 U.S. 357, 364, 99 S.Ct. 664, 58 L.Ed.2d 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">{\u00b6 106} However, we have consistently upheld the calling of venires from voter registration lists. See, e.g., <em>State v. Moore </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 22, 28, 689 N.E.2d 1; <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1972), 31 Ohio St.2d 106, 60 O.O.2d 85, 285 N.E.2d 751, paragraph two of the syllabus. This practice does not systematically exclude blacks from the jury-selection process. <em>Moore, </em>supra Moreover, appellant submitted no evidence that blacks are underrepresented in Shelby County venires, nor that the use of voter lists caused such underrepresentation. Appellant\u2019s twelfth proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">VI. Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">{\u00b6 107} In his fourth proposition, appellant contends that the trial court\u2019s guilt-phase instructions were deficient as to the death specifications. According to appellant, the trial court should have defined the term \u201cfor hire\u201d in the murder-for-hire specification and the terms \u201cwitness\u201d and \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d in the witness-murder specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">\u25a0{\u00b6 108} Appellant did not request an instruction defining these terms. Thus, he can prevail only if the court\u2019s failure to define the terms was plain error. \u201cPlain error is an obvious error * * * that affects a substantial right.\u201d <em>State v. Keith </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 514, 518, 684 N.E.2d 47. An alleged error is plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>error only if the- error is \u201cobvious,\u201d <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 257, 750 N.E.2d 90, and \u201cbut for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.\u201d <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph two of the syllabus. See, generally, <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27-28, 759 N.E.2d 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">{\u00b6 109} \u201cFailure of a trial court to separately and specifically instruct the jury on every essential element of each crime with which an accused is charged does not <em>per se </em>constitute plain error under Crim.R. 52(B).\u201d <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">{\u00b6 110} Appellant concedes that \u201cmany of the elements from the statute [delineating aggravating circumstances] are commonly understood terms.\u201d While he contends that \u201chire\u201d and \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d are terms \u201copen to interpretation,\u201d he does not explain how the trial court <em>should </em>have defined them, nor what incorrect meapings the jury might have given them. \u201cNot every term or phrase in our criminal statutes possesses some hidden metaphysical legal meaning requiring lengthy instruction for a juror to understand.\u201d <em>United States v. Hall </em>(C.A.8, 1986), 801 F.2d 356, 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6 111} It is hardly likely that the verdict hinged upon the trial court\u2019s failure to define the terms \u201cfor hire,\u201d \u201cwitness,\u201d and \u201ccriminal proceeding.\u201d Consequently, no plain error exists, and appellant\u2019s failure to request such instructions waived the issue. Appellant\u2019s fourth proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">{\u00b6 112} \u25a0 In his tenth proposition, appellant contends that the trial court failed to give a required penalty-phase instruction. The trial court instructed:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">{\u00b6 113} \u201cYou shall recommend the sentence of death if you unanimously, all twelve of you, find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors. If you do not so find, you shall unanimously, all twelve, recommend either life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving 20 years of imprisonment or a life sentence with parole eligibility after serving 30 years of imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">{\u00b6 114} In <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 148, 661 N.E.2d 1030, this court held that a jury need not unanimously reject the death penalty in order to recommend a life sentence. However, \u201cthe jury, when it cannot unanimously agree on a death sentence, [is required] to move on * * * to a consideration of which life sentence is appropriate, with that determination to be unanimous.\u201d 75 Ohio St.3d at 162, 661 N.E.2d 1030. Nothing in the above instruction is inconsistent with the holding of <em>Brooks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">{\u00b6 115} <em>Brooks </em>also contains dictum urging trial courts to specifically instruct that \u201ca solitary juror may prevent a death penalty recommendation * * *.\u201d Id.; but, see, <em>Jones v. United States </em>(1999), 527 U.S. 373, 379-383, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 144 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>L.Ed.2d 370; <em>Buell v. Mitchell </em>(C.A.6, 2001), 274 F.3d 337, 354-355. Appellant claims that the trial court erred by not giving such an instruction. However, he did not request it, and he therefore waived any claim he may have had to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">{\u00b6 116} In light of what the trial court did instruct, we cannot find plain error. The court instructed: \u2018You shall recommend the sentence of death if you <em>unanimously, all twelve of you, </em>find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cWhen read as a whole, the trial court\u2019s instruction effectively informed the jury that a death penalty recommendation could be returned only after a unanimous vote * * <em>State v. Davis </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 107, 117, 666 N.E.2d 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">{\u00b6 117} Appellant has waived this claim, and there is no plain error. Consequently, we overrule his tenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">VII. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">{\u00b6 118} In his eighth proposition of law, appellant claims that prosecutorial misconduct tainted both phases of trial. Only one of the comments that he cites was objected to at trial, however. The others are waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">{\u00b6 119} In the guilt phase, the prosecutor argues that appellant was \u201cseen by Tanya Counts\u201d with Arnett. Appellant\u2019s objection was overruled. Appellant claims the argument was improper because Counts did not identify him as the man she saw with Arnett.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">{\u00b6 120} However, the prosecutor neither said nor implied that Counts actually identified appellant. Counts testified that the man had a \u201cbump\u201d on his face in the same place as appellant\u2019s. And, she added, appellant\u2019s photograph looked like the same man. From this evidence, it was reasonable to infer that appellant was the man whom Counts saw with Arnett. A prosecutor is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence. See, e.g., <em>State v. Waddy </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 436, 588 N.E.2d 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">{\u00b6 121} For these reasons appellant\u2019s eighth proposition of law lacks merit and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">VIII. Crime-Scene Photos &amp; Video</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">{\u00b6 122} Appellant did not object to the admission of the crime-scene photographs and videotape. Hence, he has waived this issue. No plain error exists; therefore, his thirteenth proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">IX. Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b408-15\">{\u00b6 123} In his fifth proposition, appellant claims that the two death specifications arose from \u201cone indivisible act\u201d and therefore should have been merged. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>However, he did not request merger at trial. Thus, he can prevail only if he can demonstrate that not merging the specifications amounted to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">{\u00b6 124} In the penalty phase of a capital case \u201cwhere two or more aggravating circumstances arise from the same act or indivisible course of conduct, and are thus duplicative,\u201d they will be merged for sentencing purposes. <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph five of the syllabus. The analysis used to determine whether two aggravating circumstances merge is the same as that used to determine whether two offenses are allied offenses of similar import. Id. at 197-198, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, citing <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">{\u00b6 125} <em>Logan </em>sets forth the following test: \u201c[I]n order for two crimes to constitute allied offenses of similar import, * * * [t]he offenses and their elements must correspond to such a degree that commission of the one offense will result in the commission of the other.\u201d 60 Ohio St.2d at 128, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345. Thus, the R.C. 2929.02(A)(2) specification merges with the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) specification only if the elements of the two specifications \u201ccorrespond to such a degree that commission of one [specification] will result in the commission of the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">{\u00b6 126} Between the two specifications at issue here, no such correspondence exists. The R.C. 2929.04(A)(2) specification requires only that \u201c[t]he offense was committed for hire.\u201d The elements of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) specification are that (1) the victim was a witness to an offense; and (2) that the purpose of the killing was to prevent the victim from testifying in a criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">{\u00b6 127} These two specifications are by no means \u201cindivisible\u201d even though they happen to apply to the same murder. Indeed, their elements do not overlap. Hired killers do not solely kill witnesses, nor are witnesses killed only by hired killers. Thus, it is not the case that \u201ccommission of the one [specification] will result in the commission of the other.\u201d <em>Logan, </em>60 Ohio St.2d at 128, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">{\u00b6 128} Appellant has not demonstrated that plain error occurred. We overrule his fifth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">X. Sentencing Opinions</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">{\u00b6 129} In his sixth proposition, appellant attacks the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion, arguing that it failed to consider mitigating factors and improperly considered nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">{\u00b6 130} Appellant contends that the trial court failed to consider the mitigating factor set forth in R.C. 2929.04(B)(5): \u201clack of a significant history of prior criminal convictions * * The parties stipulated at trial that appellant\u2019s crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>nal record \u201cconsists of a conviction for aggravated trafficking in drugs here in this county in 1995.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">{\u00b6 131} It is clear that the trial court did consider the (B)(5) factor: a paragraph of the sentencing opinion is devoted exclusively to appellant\u2019s record. The court concluded that it could <em>\u201cgive no weight </em>to [appellant\u2019s] lack of a significant criminal record as a mitigating factor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cThe fact that an item of evidence is admissible * * * does not automatically mean that it must be given any weight.\u201d <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">{\u00b6 132} Appellant also contends that the trial court weighed nonstatutory aggravating circumstances against him. After noting that appellant \u201cwas raised in a very loving, supportive and religious family,\u201d the sentencing opinion states: \u201cThe Court finds no mitigating factors in any of the evidence produced regarding the Defendant\u2019s history or family background. If anything, <em>such evidence only exacerbates the Defendant\u2019s involvement in this crime.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">{\u00b6 133} To \u201cexacerbate\u201d is \u201c * * * to intensify the bad qualities of.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1961) 790. Thus, the trial judge\u2019s use of this word may suggest that he treated appellant\u2019s family background as an aggravating circumstance. But that overlooks his use of the words \u201cIf anything\u201d to preface the remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">{\u00b6 134} In any case, we need not parse the sentencing opinion. The opinion of the court of appeals contains nothing to indicate that it treated appellant\u2019s background as aggravating. Hence, that court\u2019s independent review cured any error by the trial court, and so will our own independent review. See <em>State v. Bies </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 320, 325, 658 N.E.2d 754; <em>State v. Lorraine </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 414, 422, 613 N.E.2d 212; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 148, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">{\u00b6 135} Finally, appellant contends that the trial court should not have discussed his lack of remorse, since he did not claim remorse as a mitigating factor. See <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 289, 528 N.E.2d 542. But the opinion contains no language suggesting that the court used this as an aggravating circumstance. Rather, the court was simply noting the absence of a possible mitigating factor. Appellant\u2019s sixth proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">{\u00b6 136} In his seventeenth proposition, appellant claims that the court of appeals \u201crefused to consider\u201d the R.C. 2929.04(B)(6) mitigating factor. R.C. 2929.04(B)(6) requires that \u201c[i]f the offender was a participant in the offense but not the principal offender, [the court shall consider] the degree of the offender\u2019s participation in the offense and * * * in the acts that led to the death of the victim.\u201d The court of appeals found the (B)(6) factor \u201centitled to no weight\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>because \u201ca jury convicted appellant of aggravated murder as well as two death penalty specifications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">{\u00b6 137} Even though the guilty verdict did not entail a specific finding that appellant was the principal offender, the (B)(6) factor does not apply, since the evidence clearly indicates that appellant was the principal offender. For that reason, the court of appeals\u2019 assignment of no weight to the (B)(6) factor was not error. Appellant\u2019s seventeenth proposition is without merit and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">XI. Ineffective Assistance</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">{\u00b6 138} In his sixteenth proposition of law, appellant contends that his trial counsel failed to render effective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">{\u00b6 139} Ineffective assistance claims are governed by a two-part test. To prevail, the defendant must show (1) deficient performance by counsel, i.e., performance falling below an objective standard of reasonable representation, and (2) resulting prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the proceeding\u2019s result would have been different. See <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>Williams v. Taylor </em>(2000), 529 U.S. 362, 390-391, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">{\u00b6 140} First, appellant contends that, since this case involved a white victim and black defendant, his counsel should have questioned veniremen on their racial attitudes <em>during individual, sequestered voir dire. </em>Counsel did question the panel about racial attitudes during general voir dire. However, appellant argues that this topic is so sensitive that jurors will not answer questions about it honestly in the presence of other veniremen.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">{\u00b6 141} However, appellant ignores the fact that his counsel requested individual, sequestered voir dire, and the trial court denied the motion. Consequently, appellant\u2019s counsel did not have the opportunity to query jurors in sequestration with regal'd to subjects other than pretrial publicity and death-qualification. Counsel can hardly be blamed for following a procedure ordered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">{\u00b6 142} Second, appellant contends that his counsel should have tried to impeach Jermaine Jelks with prior inconsistent statements. However, those statements are not in the record before us. Hence, appellant cannot show either deficient performance or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">{\u00b6 143} Finally, appellant contends that his counsel failed to object to eight alleged errors. Five of his proposed objections, however, would have been contrary to existing law. See <em>State v.

Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345 (merger); <em>State v. Van Gundy </em>(1992), 64 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Ohio St.3d 230, 594 N.E.2d 604 (reasonable doubt instruction); <em>State v.

Since these are commonly understood terms, there is no reasonable probability that, had they been defined, the trial\u2019s outcome would have been otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">{\u00b6 145} Regarding counsel\u2019s failure to request an instruction that a single juror may block a death sentence, see <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 148, 661 N.E.2d 1030, appellant fails to suggest how he was prejudiced by the lack of such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">{\u00b6 146} Regarding counsel\u2019s failure to object to the gruesome crime scene photos and videotape, there was no prejudice. Since the photos and video had legitimate probative value, there is no question that some of them would have been admitted. An objection would have done little more than eliminate some duplicative photos. The evidence against appellant was strong. The prosecutor did not use the gruesome images to inflame the jury. There is no reasonable likelihood that the result of the trial would have been otherwise had counsel objected to the photos and tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">{\u00b6 147} Appellant\u2019s sixteenth proposition is without merit and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">XII. Settled Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">{\u00b6 148} Appellant\u2019s ninth proposition, in which he claims that the trial court erred by calling the jury\u2019s recommendation a \u201crecommendation,\u201d is summarily overruled. See, e.g., <em>State v. Mitts </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 223, 232-233, 690 N.E.2d 522. Additionally, his eighteenth proposition, which questions the death penalty\u2019s constitutionality, is without merit and is also overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">XIII. Independent Sentence Review</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">{\u00b6 149} In his seventh and fifteenth propositions, appellant contends that the death sentence in this case is inappropriate, excessive, and disproportionate.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">{\u00b6 150} Under R.C. 2929.05, we must independently reweigh the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors submitted by appellant. The aggravating circumstances are murder for hire and murder of a witness to prevent her testimony. The evidence is sufficient to prove these circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>{\u00b6 151} During appellant\u2019s case in mitigation, three members of his family testified: his older brother, Sam Yarbrough, Jr., his sister, Virginia Martin-Brown, and his aunt, Evelyn Stringer.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">{\u00b6 152} Appellant, born in 1958, was 36 when he murdered Arnett. Although he was raised in public housing, his relatives testified that the area was not a high-crime area. Appellant\u2019s sister, Virginia, recalled the neighborhood as \u201ca big extended family.\u201d She remembered \u201ceverybody being [her] mother and brothers and everybody being [her] father. * * * And when we got out of school, if our parents worked, somebody else\u2019s parents would say * * * don\u2019t do this, don\u2019t do that; and they watched after us as a unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">{\u00b6 153} Appellant\u2019s father was an alcoholic whose spending on liquor created friction. His parents broke up in 1965. Four years later, when appellant was about 11, his mother died. His grandmother then cared for him and his siblings. Appellant\u2019s grandmother attended church regularly, worked hard, was a good person who knew right from wrong, and raised the children with sound values.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">{\u00b6 154} Appellant\u2019s relatives described him as a \u201chappy-go-lucky\u201d child, \u201cmischievous\u201d but respectful, \u201cnever * * * mean\u201d or quarrelsome. In school, he was learning-disabled but displayed no behavior problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">{\u00b6 155} As an adult, appellant was a hard worker, capable of exercising responsibility. His brother Sam, a carpenter who frames houses, let him supervise other workers because he could be trusted to make sure a job was done right.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">{\u00b6 156} Appellant had two sons by different mothers. Although he lived full-time with neither, he was a caring father who took time to involve himself in his sons\u2019 lives, attending parent-teacher conferences and making sure that they had clothes for school.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">{\u00b6 157} Appellant\u2019s relatives unanimously declared that murder and involvement with drugs were out of character for him. He was never in trouble except for a traffic ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">{\u00b6 158} The defense also presented Dr. Douglas Johnson, a psychologist. Johnson interviewed appellant four times, gave him tests, reviewed school and court records, and talked with his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">{\u00b6 159} Appellant\u2019s school records indicated his placement in a program for the learning-disabled; Johnson \u2022 speculated that he may have been classified as \u201ceducationally mentally retarded,\u201d although Johnson\u2019s testing did not \u201cput him quite into that category.\u201d Appellant\u2019s performance IQ was 93 on the Wechsler scale, 7 points below normal; his verbal IQ was 82. He reads below a third grade level. His IQ and reading level were consistent with a learning disability. However, his ability to \u201cfigure things out\u201d was \u201cfairly good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>{\u00b6 160} Johnson found appellant to be moderately depressed, seeing himself as a chronic failure. According to Johnson, depressed people often pursue \u201cillicit activity\u201d because they think, \u201cWell, what\u2019s the difference what I do, everything I do ends in failure * * * anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">{\u00b6 161} Appellant also displayed elevated \u201cpsychopathic deviate\u201d and paranoid scales and an elevated \u201chysterical conversion\u201d scale, indicating a tendency to \u201coverreact * * * to threats and issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">{\u00b6 162} Johnson described appellant as \u201crather passive,\u201d \u201cnonviolent,\u201d lacking initiative, and inclined to <em>\u201cgo </em>along * * * and try to please people.\u201d But he was also \u201cvery distrusting\u201d and had a \u201cvery high autonomy scale,\u201d indicating a high degree of independence. His personality profile indicates a tendency to feel \u201ctrapped, bitter, resentful,\u201d and \u201cvulnerable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">{\u00b6 163} Johnson felt that the crimes that appellant committed were somewhat out of character for him and that appellant\u2019s passivity would probably make him \u201ca model prisoner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">{\u00b6 164} Appellant\u2019s history or background is entitled to no mitigating weight. Nothing in his environment predisposed him to crime. Although he lost his parents, he lived in a close-knit neighborhood that functioned like an \u201cextended family,\u201d and his grandmother instilled sound values.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">{\u00b6 165} Certain elements of appellant\u2019s character deserve some weight as mitigating factors. The evidence indicates that the crimes that he committed in this case are out of character. With his passive, nonviolent nature and capacity for work, he may adjust well to prison, as Dr. Johnson suggested. On the other hand, it is questionable whether a \u201ctrapped, bitter, resentful\u201d and \u201cdistrusting\u201d prisoner with a high autonomy scale and a tendency to overreact will really be, in Dr. Johnson\u2019s words, a \u201cmodel prisoner.\u201d In the end, Dr. Johnson\u2019s prediction, and appellant\u2019s character, carry little weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">{\u00b6 166} Appellant does not claim, nor does the record suggest, the applicability of any factors set forth in R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) through (B)(4). He does contend that he \u201clack[s] * * * a significant history of prior criminal convictions and delinquency adjudications,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B)(5). However, inasmuch as appellant was convicted in 1995 of aggravated drug trafficking, we find that R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">{\u00b6 167} Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(6), \u201c[i]f the offender was a participant in the offense but not the principal offender,\u201d the sentencer must consider \u201cthe degree of the offender\u2019s participation in the offense and * * * in the acts that led to the death of the victim\u201d as a mitigating factor. Appellant argues that this mitigating factor applies to him, as he claims that he was \u201conly a participant\u201d in the murder and that Calvin Davis and McGhee were \u201cmore culpable\u201d than he.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>{\u00b6 168} However, by its terms, the (B)(6) factor applies only to a defendant who was \u201cnot the principal offender,\u201d i.e., the actual killer. In the penalty phase, the defendant has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of mitigating factors. See <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 171-172, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264. Thus, the (B)(6) factor does not apply unless a preponderance of the evidence shows that he was \u201ca participant in the offense but not the principal offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">{\u00b6 169} No evidence suggests that appellant was not the actual killer; in fact, the evidence overwhelmingly proves that he was. Two witnesses testified that appellant admitted shooting Arnett. Appellant was given a photo of Arnett before the murder, he was the last person seen with Arnett, and he was seen with Calvin Davis\u2019s gun, which was later found near the murder scene. Appellant admitted to having sexual relations with Arnett, and his semen was found in her body at the autopsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">{\u00b6 170} Nor is there any evidence that appellant was, as he claims, \u201cmanipulated by powerful local drug dealers.\u201d The record does not support the statement in appellant\u2019s brief that he was lured to Ohio by \u201cthe promise of a painting job.\u201d Calvin Davis and McGhee did not, so far as the evidence shows, \u201cmanipulate\u201d, appellant. Compare <em>State v. Lawson </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 336, 352, 595 N.E.2d 902. They simply offered him money in exchange for murder. He accepted. That is not a mitigating factor but the essence of the murder-for-hire aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">{\u00b6 171} Moreover, appellant\u2019s role in the crime belies any suggestion that his participation was merely a matter of \u201cgoing along.\u201d His role was too active for that. To begin with, the evidence suggests that he personally killed Arnett. In addition, he apparently got to know her and worked his way into her confidence before he killed her: she was seen in his company on the last night of her life, and at some point he had sexual intercourse with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">{\u00b6 172} Finally, the record affords no glimpse of appellant\u2019s taking orders from anyone; he appears to have been more analogous to an independent contractor than an employee of the Davis gang. Indeed, the record shows him <em>giving </em>orders to Paul Smith on the day after the murder. We find that the (B)(6) mitigating factor is absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">{\u00b6 173} The aggravating circumstances of murder for hire and witness-murder carry great weight, and appellant\u2019s mitigation is distinctly unimpressive. Accordingly, we find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">{\u00b6 174} The death sentence is proportionate to those approved in other murder-for-hire cases, see <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 752 N.E.2d 904; <em>State v. Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 702 N.E.2d 866; <em>State v.

Williams </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 346, 528 N.E.2d 910, and in other witness-murder cases, see <em>State v. Jalowiec </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 220, 744 N.E.2d 163; <em>State v. Smith </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 424, 721 N.E.2d 93; <em>State v. Coleman </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 129, 707 N.E.2d 476.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AaQ\">James F.

In 1994, Ohio voters approved Issue I, providing for direct appeal from common pleas court to the Supreme Court of Ohio \u201cas a matter of right in cases in which the death penalty has been imposed.\u201d See Section 2(B)(2)(c), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution. The amendment applies only to offenses committed on or after January 1, 1995. Sub.H. Joint Resolution No. 15, Schedule, 145 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 7811, 7814. See <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 95, 684 N.E.2d 668. Since the death penalty in this case was imposed for events that occurred prior to January 1, 1995, the 1994 amendment to Section 2(B)(2) of the Ohio Constitution does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-9\">.
