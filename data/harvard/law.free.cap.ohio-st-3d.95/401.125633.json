No. 3 (\u201cS.B. 3\u201d) in 1999, the General Assembly enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme to implement competition in Ohio\u2019s retail electricity market. Most of the provisions of S.B. 3 are contained in newly enacted R.C. Chapter 4928, and most provisions became effective on October 5, 1999. R.C. 4928.31, part of S.B. 3, requires that each eleptric utility file a transition plan with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio regarding the utility\u2019s provision of competitive electric service in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 2} In December 1999, FirstEnergy Corp. (\u201cFirstEnergy\u201d)-, on behalf of its Ohio operating companies (Ohio Edison Company, the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, and the Toledo Edison Company), filed with the commission its proposed transition plan together with applications for tariff approval. Stipulated settlement agreements were entered into among the parties and evidentiary hearings and local public hearings were held. These proceedings resulted in an opinion and order, dated July 19, 2000, in which the commission approved the settlement agreements and FirstEnergy\u2019s transition plan as modified by the settlement agreements and the commission order, subject to final approval of FirstEnergy\u2019s compliance tariffs to be filed pursuant to the order, and approved FirstEnergy\u2019s proposed tariff amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 3} After informal review of FirstEnergy\u2019s proposed compliance tariffs by interested parties and after informal comments by the parties, FirstEnergy modified its proposed compliance tariffs and made a final submission to the commission on August 28, 2000. One of the compliance tariff provisions is the subject of this appeal: the Net-Energy Metering Rider (the so-called August Rider) that FirstEnergy proposed for inclusion in the tariff of each of its Ohio operating companies. By its entry, dated November 21, 2000, the commission found that FirstEnergy\u2019s proposed August Rider should be modified as recommended by the commission\u2019s staff, and ordered FirstEnergy to make those modifications. The question in this appeal as of right is whether, as claimed by FirstEnergy, the commission acted unlawfully and unreasonably in issuing its November 21, 2000 entry, which failed to approve FirstEnergy\u2019s proposed August Rider and, instead, ordered modifications to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Net-Metering Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">{\u00b6 4} S.B. 3 included a provision requiring retail electric service providers to develop a standard contract or tariff providing for net metering, a service introduced in S.B. 3. R.C. 4928.67. The term \u201cnet metering\u201d is defined as \u201cmeasuring the difference in an applicable billing period between the electricity supplied by an electric service provider and the electricity generated by a customer-generator which is fed back to the electric service provider.\u201d R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>4928.01(A)(31). A customer-generator is a user of a net-metering system. R.C. 4928.01(A)(30). A net-metering system is a facility for the production of electrical energy that (a) uses as its power source either solar power, wind, biomass, landfill gas, or hydropower, or uses a microturbine or fuel cell; (b) is located on a customer-generator\u2019s premises; (c) operates in parallel with the electric utility\u2019s transmission and distribution facilities; and (d) is intended primarily to offset part or all of the customer-generator\u2019s requirements for electricity. R.C. 4928.01(A)(32). As FirstEnergy points out, a customer-generator may consume electricity from an electric service provider during one period of time but feed back the electricity that is generated in excess of consumption in another period.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 5} Under R.C. 4928.67, the charges associated with net metering are determined by reference to the charges in the underlying tariff rate schedules under which a customer takes electric service. As a result, for ease of administration, FirstEnergy chose to provide for net metering through a tariff rider, rather than create a separate tariff or a separate set of tariff schedules applicable solely to net metering. FirstEnergy filed its proposed rider as a part of its transition plan filing in December 1999, and supplemented its December filing by submitting a revised net-metering rider in April 2000 (the so-called April Rider). On April 6, 2000, pursuant to R.C. 4928.11, the commission adopted a set of rules entitled \u201cElectric Service and Safety Standards\u201d to be included as Ohio Adm. Code Chapter 4901:1-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 6} Ohio Adm.Code 4901:1-10-28, the net-metering rule, includes requirements for meters: \u201cNet metering shall be accomplished using a single meter capable of registering the flow of electricity in each direction. A customer\u2019s existing single-register meter that is capable of registering the flow of electricity in both directions satisfies this requirement.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4901:1-10-28(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">{\u00b6 7} As FirstEnergy points out, under the net-metering rule, a customer-generator could use a meter with a wheel showing electrical usage by movement both forward (to show consumption) and backward (to show generation being supplied to the electric distribution company). Such a meter shows the net flow of electricity but cannot show separately the amounts of electricity that flowed in each direction as would the type of meter that would have been required under FirstEnergy\u2019s April Rider, and as FirstEnergy claimed is required by R.C. 4928.67(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 8} As a result of the commission\u2019s net-metering rule and in consequence of the commission\u2019s July 29, 2000 order, FirstEnergy revised its April Rider and submitted its August Rider as a part of its proposed compliance tariffs. The August Rider varied from the April Rider in three relevant respects: First, it complies with the commission\u2019s net-metering rule, permitting a customer-generator to use a single meter that measures the net flow of electricity, so long as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>meter\u2019s register runs both forward and backward, eliminating the necessity of installation of a new meter. Second, the August Rider eliminates the April Rider\u2019s requirement that the customer-generator pay distribution, transmission, and ancillary charges to FirstEnergy upon electricity provided to FirstEnergy. Third, the August Rider credits customer-generators for all unbundled charges contained in the underlying service tariff with respect to the electricity they supply, to the extent that it offsets their consumption for a given period.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">August Rider</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Commission-ordered Modifications</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">{\u00b6 9} On November 21, 2000, the commission issued an entry that disapproved the August Rider and, instead, ordered FirstEnergy to modify it as set forth in Attachment B to the entry. While FirstEnergy disagrees with the necessity or desirability of most of the ordered modifications, this appeal deals only with modifications respecting the assessment of charges and the allowance of credits to net generators, i.e., those customer-generators that generate more electricity than they consume.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">{\u00b6 10} FirstEnergy\u2019s proffered August Rider credited net generators only with the applicable generation charge of the underlying service tariff, based on the amount of electricity they supplied in excess of the amount they consumed in a given time period. The commission-ordered modifications would obligate FirstEnergy to credit a net generator not only for the generation charges for electricity it supplied in excess of its consumption, but for additional amounts equivalent to the charges for the following costs: transmission, distribution, ancillary services, transition (the regulatory transition charge and the generation transition charge), the Universal Service Fund, and the Energy Efficiency Fund. In this appeal, FirstEnergy takes issue only with the ordered modifications of its August Rider that would require FirstEnergy to pay or credit to a net generator the foregoing charges in addition to the electric generation charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">Review of the Order</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">{\u00b6 11} This appeal does not turn on factual determinations, either as to the adequacy of, or the weight to be accorded to, the record evidence. Rather, it involves questions of law. This court has complete and independent power of review as to questions of law. See, e.g., <em>Luntz Corp. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 509, 512, 684 N.E.2d 43, 45. The determination for the court in this appeal is whether the commission acted unlawfully or unreasonably in ordering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the net-generator modifications to FirstEnergy\u2019s August Rider. R.C. 4903.13 provides, <em>\u201cA </em>final order made by the public utilities commission shall be reversed, vacated, or modified by the supreme court on appeal, if, upon consideration of the record, such court is of the opinion that such order was unlawful or unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">{\u00b6 12} The commission argues that R.C. 4928.67 controls and compelled its adoption of the net-metering rule, Ohio Adm.Code 4901:1-10-28, and its order of modifications of the net-generator provisions of FirstEnergy\u2019s August Rider. FirstEnergy agrees that R.C. 4928.67 and the net-metering rule control, but disagrees that they compelled the ordered modifications of the August Rider. Nevertheless, while FirstEnergy\u2019s April Rider did not, FirstEnergy\u2019s August Rider did comply with the terms of the net-metering rule, as adopted by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 4928.67 and the commission\u2019s net-metering rule speak in terms of measuring and charging or crediting for \u201celectricity\u201d produced or consumed. The August Rider as submitted provides for FirstEnergy\u2019s crediting or refunding to a net generator of the \u201cenergy charges of the unbundled generation component of the appropriate rate schedule.\u201d In other words, FirstEnergy must credit or pay to a net generator only the tariff charges for generation of the electricity by the net generator and supplied to FirstEnergy. The net-generator provisions of the August Rider speak solely in terms of electricity generated and supplied, as they should. A net-generator customer of FirstEnergy only generates and supplies electricity; it does not provide transmission, distribution, or ancillary services. It has no allowable transition costs for which transition charges are assessed, and is not responsible for paying into the Universal Service Fund or the Energy Efficiency Fund. Yet the commission-ordered modifications to the net-generator provisions of the August Rider would make FirstEnergy liable for payment or crediting of all of those additional charges, in conflict with several provisions of the Revised Code in addition to R.C. 4928.67(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">{\u00b6 14} First, electric utilities have a right to receive transition revenue through the imposition of a transition charge \u201cbilled on each kilowatt hour of electricity delivered to the customer.\u201d R.C. 4928.37(A)(1)(b). This right is contingent only upon the electric <em>utility </em>demonstrating to the commission\u2019s satisfaction in a transition case that the utility incurred just and reasonable transition costs that meet the criteria set forth in R.C. 4928.39. These costs represent regulatory assets and other costs incurred by the <em>utility </em>under regulation that will not be recovered in a competitive environment. R.C. 4928.39(A) through (D). There is no counterpart to these costs that the customer-generator has or will incur, and the legislature makes clear that the <em>utility </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u201cshall receive\u201d the transition revenues to which the commission has deemed it to be entitled. R.C. 4928.37(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 15} However, in its November 21, 2000 entry, the commission ordered FirstEnergy to pay these revenues to net generators on the electricity supplied by them. Instead of conforming to the statutory mandate that the <em>utility </em>\u201cshall receive\u201d its transition revenues, the commission would require the <em>utility </em>to pay transition charges to the customer-generator. This is contrary to law and is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 16} Second, the Energy Efficiency Fund rider charge imposed by R.C. 4928.61 is required to be assessed on all retail electric distribution rates. It is a uniform amount statewide, and it is determined by dividing an aggregate revenue target for a given year by the number of customers of electric distribution <em>utilities </em>in Ohio in the prior year. R.C. 4928.61(B)(1). Electric <em>utilities </em>such as FirstEnergy \u201cshall remit\u201d the revenues derived from this rider to the Ohio Director of Development on a quarterly basis. R.C. 4928.61(C)(1). Not only does the commission\u2019s order prevent FirstEnergy from collecting this revenue from net generators and remitting it to the state, but it also mandates that FirstEnergy pay this revenue to net generators for their own use, thereby decreasing the amount of funds available for economic development in the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">{\u00b6 17} Third, the Universal Service Fund rider required by R.C. 4928.52 \u201cshall\u201d be a rider on all retail electric distribution service rates. R.C. 4928.52(A). The statute requires that the USF rider be set in such a manner \u201cso as not to shift among the customer classes of electric distribution utilities the costs of funding low-income customer assistance programs.\u201d R.C. 4928.52(C). Not only does the commission\u2019s order prevent FirstEnergy from collecting this revenue from net generators, it also mandates that FirstEnergy pay this revenue to net generators for their own use.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 18} Fourth, transmission, distribution, and ancillary services charges in a FirstEnergy rate schedule are designed to compensate it for the cost of facilities and other costs incurred in providing those services. See R.C. 4928.34(A)(1) through (3); R.C. 4928.01(A)(1); Ohio Adm.Code 4901:l-20-03(C)(2). A customer-generator, whether a net consumer or a net generator, incurs none of these costs. The customer-generator provides no facilities or equipment to support the utility distribution or transmission system. Instead, it relies on the utility\u2019s facilities to feed back the electricity produced. Nevertheless, the commission\u2019s order directs FirstEnergy to pay net generators for the costs FirstEnergy incurs in transmitting and distributing the net amount of electricity the generator supplies to FirstEnergy.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AxR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Arthur E.
