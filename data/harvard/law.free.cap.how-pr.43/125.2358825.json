The answer interposes three defenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-12\">1. A general denial, except as to the fact of marriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-13\">2. Recriminatory charges of adultery against the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-14\">3. That in a suit brought by the defendant against the plaintiff in the year \u00cd86C, for a divorce on the ground of adultery in which the plaintiff as a defense interposed recriminatory charges of adultery against her, issues were framed and tried by a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-15\">That upon such trial the jury in a special verdict, found that the defendant herein was innocent of the acts of adultery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>charged against her, that the plaintiff- herein was guilty of certain acts of adultery charged against him, but that the defendant had condoned the same by voluntary cohabitation with him of her knowledge thereof, and it is claimed that the plaintiff\u2019s adultery established by this verdict, though condoned, is available as a defense and is a bar to the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel read various affidavits in opposition to the motion, tending to show, that for some time before the commencement of this suit, the defendant was engaged in keeping a house of prostitution. It also appeared, that a short time before the hearing of the motion, the defendant had been convicted in a criminal court, of keeping a bawdy house, but that in consequence of some error on the trial, the verdict was set aside and a new trial granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-6\">The plaintiff also showed, that in the year 1865, a suit was pending between him and the defendant in which the defendant asked for a temporary divorce, and an allowance from the plaintiff\u2019s property for her support, on the ground of cruel and inhuman treatment. That in March of that year, by advice of counsel on both sides, the suit was settled, and by consent a decree of separation was entered, in which an allowance for the support of the defendant was made from plaintiff\u2019s property, and that the parties have not lived together since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-7\">Affidavits were also read on the part of the defendant, in. reply to those of the plaintiff, by leave of the court, denying the acts of adultery charged against her, and also denying that she ever kept a house of ill-fame. It also appeared, that the cause had been referred to a referee to take the proofs in the case, and report the same to the court, with his opinion thereon.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-8\">D. O\u2019Brien, <em>for motion.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-9\">James F. Starbuck, <em>opposed.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b130-11\">Hardin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar4\">\u2014It appears from the papers used on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>hearing of this motion, that in March, 1865, the parties to this action voluntarily, with the assent of their counsel, entered into an agreement for a separation from bed and board, and for a settlement of all suits between them; and that the husband, in pursuance of that agreement, transferred and delivered to the wife, some two thousand dollars in property, which she agreed to receive and accept in lieu of dower and of all right in his property and \u201c in full for all future charges or liability for her support.\u201d And it further appeared, that the decree entered by the parties, provided that said property received by the wife under such agreement as alimony should be received by her \u201cin ratification cancelment and extinction of all liability of the husband to support or maintain the wife, or to furnish her with necessaries, or any other thing.\u201d And upon these facts the learned counsel for the plaintiff claims, that the motion should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Were this motion made wholly to obtain alimony, the authorities cited would justify a denial of'the motion. The wife having accepted the provision made for her in lieu of all claims for support, should not be allowed to hold and enjoy that property, and then cast herself upon the husband for him to support and maintain <em>(Rose </em>agt. <em>Rose, </em>11 <em>Paige, </em>166; <em>McDonough </em>agt. <em>McDonough, 26 How., </em>193; <em>Bartlett </em>agt. <em>Bartlett, </em>1 <em>Clark Ch. R new ed. </em>466).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The wife in this actiop is not entitled to alimony <em>pendente lite, </em>because she has not made restitution, or offered to, of the property she received from her husband in pursuance of the agreement of March 1, 1865.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\u25a0Formerly it was almost a matter of course to grant counsel fees to enable the wife to present her defense in an action for a divorce. And her denial under oath in some cases was held sufficient to justify the court in making an order requiring payment of counsel fees and expenses for her defense. And it has been repeatedly held, that her guilt or innocence would not be passed-upon on affidavits <em>(Wright </em>agt. <em>Wright, </em>1 <em>Edwards Ch., </em>62-255, 317; <em>Williams </em>agt. <em>Williams, </em>3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number><em>Barb, Ch., </em>628 ; <em>Wood </em>agt. <em>Wood, 2 Paige, </em>108 ; <em>Osgood </em>agt. <em>Osgood, 2 Paige, </em>621; <em>Hallock </em>agt. <em>Hallock, </em>4 <em>How., </em>160 ; <em>Leslie </em>agt. <em>Leslie, </em>6 <em>Abb. N. S., </em>193).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">But it is insisted that the rule has been relaxed, and that this case comes within the modern rule (19 <em>How., </em>539; 42 <em>Barb., </em>515; 23 <em>How., </em>189 ; 26 <em>How., </em>194; 6 <em>Abb. N. S., </em>206).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">If the only issue to be tried in this action related to the guilt or innocence of the.defendant, the decision of the motion would be controlled by the opinion that might be entertained upon the questions involved in the numerous affidavits read on the motion..</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">But the answer of the defendant sets up the guilt of the plaintiff, whicn if established would be a good defense, however guilty she may be of the acts charged upon her. And the answer also sets up the adultery of the plaintiff which is alleged to have been condoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">To try these issues, I think, the defendant is entitled to an allowance. By the papers in this case it seems that a very interesting question of law is to be presented in respect to the condoned adultery of the plaintiff, and one upon which there is considerable conflict in the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">It is proper there should be a more full argument <em>before a </em>decision of it <em>(De Anguillar </em>agt. <em>De Anguillar, </em>1 <em>Huggard, Eccl., </em>789 ; <em>Foster </em>agt. <em>Foster, </em>1 <em>Comist, </em>146; <em>Kirkwall </em>agt. <em>Kirkwall, 2 Comist, </em>297 ; <em>Johnson </em>agt. <em>Johnson, </em>14 <em>Wend., </em>637; <em>Wood </em>agt. <em>Wood, 2 Paige, </em>115, <em>and note; Monell </em>agt. <em>Monell, </em>1 <em>Barb., </em>318, <em>S. C., </em>3 <em>Barb., </em>236 ; <em>Whispell </em>agt. <em>Whispell, </em>4 <em>Barb., </em>217; <em>Johnson </em>agt. <em>Johnson, </em>1 <em>Edw. Ch., </em>439 ; <em>Johnson </em>agt. <em>Johnson, </em>4 <em>Paige, </em>460 ; <em>Burr </em>agt. <em>Burr, </em>10 <em>Paige, </em>20).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">An order may be entered directing the plaintiff, to pay fifty dollars ($50), within thirty days (30) days, and upon the coming in of the referee\u2019s report on the evidence and the hearing of the motion to confirm the same, an application for a further sum may be made.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
