The railroad track was higher than the laud on either side, and higher than the highway.

The evidence offered as to the number of accidents at this crossing was competent and should have been admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-7\"><em>First. </em>It was admissible .as tending to show that place to be a dangerous crossing, and the necessity of great precautions being taken by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-8\"><em>Second. </em>It was competent evidence bearing on the question of negligence as involved in this case. Suppose that the plaintiff had been able to show that one person on an average was killed there by the defendant daily, or that one hundred accidents involving the destruction of life and property, had happened at that point within one week, would not such proof have been competent as tending to show these two propositions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-9\">1st. That this accident was caused by defendant\u2019s negligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-10\"><em>2d. </em>That it was not caused by the negligence of deceased. Of course, the evidence would not be conclusive on either point, but we submit it had a bearing upon both, and the plaintiff should have been allowed to show all he could on this point to go in with the other facts of the case, and to be considered with them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-11\">II. The evidence offered to show that there was a by-law of the village of Gfeddes prohibiting trains running through that place -faster than ten miles an hour, and that notice thereof had been served on the defendant, was competent and should have been allowed. The court excluded the evidence on the ground that it was immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-12\"><em>First </em>Here is a distinct offer to show that the defendant deliberately violated a village ordinance duly passed by a body having authority. The court decided it on the ground that it was immaterial, and not on the ground that it was passed without authority. It is material. We are aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>that the contrary doctrine was held in the case of <em>Brown </em>agt. <em>State Line RR. Co. (22 N. Y., </em>191), but by a divided court, Dsifio, Seldon and Clerke, <em>JJ., </em>dissenting. The doctrine of that case has been severely criticised in this state <em>(Jetter </em>agt. N. <em>Y. &amp; H. R.R. Co., 2 Keyes, </em>154, <em>162 ; Williams </em>agt. <em>O\u2019Keefe, </em>9 <em>Bosw., </em>536 <em>; Schu. &amp; Red. on Neg., \u00a7 </em>484, 10 <em>Cush. </em>562; 2 <em>Cush., </em>539), and is not followed in any other state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-5\"><em>Second. </em>Why was it material ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-6\">1st. Because negligence arid what constitutes negligence is to be judged from, and viewed in the light of, all the surrounding circumstances of each particular case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-7\">2d. The act of the defendant in deliberately violating a village ordinance, passed for the protection of the traveler, of which it had due notice, entered into and constituted a part of the negligence of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-8\">3d. The plaintiff must show wherein and in what that negligence consisted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-9\"><em>Third. </em>The defendant is bound in law to observe the laws and regulations passed by the proper authorities for ttie protection of the traveler, regulating the manner and speed of running his trains..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-10\">1st. Defendant\u2019s disregarding the village ordinance passed to regulate the speed of trains and for the safety of the passenger, was one of the elements constituting defendant\u2019s negligence, and was a part of the evidence by which plaintiff attempted to show the degree of negligence and in what it consisted; and that the railroad company wilfully and negligently disregarded a duty it was bound to perform. But says the court, \u201c I do not think a by-law of a village could make it negligence <em>per se </em>against the railroad company, especially in favor of a person who was not a resident of the village, but only a traveler through there.\u201d Granted. But if it did not make it negligence <em>\u201cper se,\u201d </em>was it not one of the facts of the case bearing upon the question of negligence?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-11\">It is riot necessary, to the admission of evidence, that each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>distinct fact offered to be shown should show negligence <em>u per se.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-5\">It is not in truth necessary, that all the facts put together should show presumptive negligence; all the plaintiff is required to show is a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence on the part of the defendant, and an omission to perform a duty imposed by statute is <em>prima facie </em>negligence <em>(St. </em>Louis, <em>J. &amp; C. R.R. Co. </em>agt. Terhune, 50 <em>Ill., </em>151).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-6\">2d. Nor is a by-law passed by the village anthorities for the protection of persons alone residing within its boundaries, but it is for the protection of the public at large, and applies to all alike. Suppose a person should come into the state from Pennsylvania, and should receive an injury at a railroad crossing under like circumstance attending inat of Hackford, and bringing an action against the company for the injuries received, his counsel should attempt to show failure on the part of the defendant to comply with the statutory regulations as to ringing the bell and blowing the whistle, and defendant\u2019 counsel should /also an objection to this evidence, could it be said, that because the plaintiff was not a resident of this state, the statute did not apply to him <em>\u00cd </em>that as to him he had no rights under the statute which the company was bound to respect ? dnd that the objection must be sustained ? If the former is a good objection, why would not the latter be equally as valid ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-7\">3d. The third exception taken by the plaintiif is to the ruling of the court nonsuiting the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-8\">The motion for a nonsuit was made at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony. The motion for nonsuit was grounded on the assumption of the fact that there was not sufficient evidence to go to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-9\">The first question that arises upon this exception is the sufficiency of the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-10\"><em>First. </em>It is conceded on the trial of this cause that the decedent died from the effects of the injury inflicted by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>We have given: (1.) injury ; (2.) state of facts attending the injury ; (3.) death, and to be deduced from this, is the evidence sufficient to go to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-5\">1st. The court says, \u201cIt seems to me there is not sufficient evidence to go to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-6\"><em>(a.) </em>The court in passing upon the sufficiency of the evidence directly invaded the province of the jury. It is an elementary principle of law that whether there is any evidence is a question for the judge, but whether there is sufficient evidence is a question for the jury <em>(Phillips on Evi., 3d Am. Ed., </em>15 <em>marg. </em>pag.; <em>Phillips on Evi., 4th Am. Ed., by Edwards, p. </em>3; <em>Wells </em>agt. <em>Tucker, </em>3 <em>Binney, </em>370-2-3.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-7\">(&amp;.) Sufficiency cannot in the nature of things be subject to legal definite control <em>(Betts </em>agt. <em>Jackson, </em>6 <em>Wend., </em>204; 1 <em>Stark, Ev., </em>399).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-8\">When the court takes upon itself the right to pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence, it assumes a dangerous prerogative and directly invades the province of the jury. If courts are to decide upon the sufficiency of the evidence, of what use is a jury? how and in what way are a person\u2019s rights to be determined by a trial before his peers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-9\"><em>Second. </em>The evidence in this case is to be viewed most favorably to the decedent, and the defendant must concede every fact which has been proved against him, and upon appeal the plaintiff is entitled to have every doubtful fact found in his favor <em>(Colgrove </em>agt. <em>N. Y. &amp; N. H. &amp; H. R.R. Cos. </em>20 <em>N. Y., </em>494; <em>Church </em>agt. <em>N. Y. Cen. R.R. Co., </em>3 <em>Trans. Cas. </em>; <em>Hart </em>agt. <em>Erie R.R. Co., </em>3 <em>Albany L. J., </em>312).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-10\">1st. In determining the propriety of a nonsuit, we are legally bound to assume the truth of the facts which the testimony of the plaintiff legitimately conduced to prove <em>(Ernst </em>agt. <em>H. R.R. Co., </em>25 <em>N. Y., </em>25; <em>S. C., </em>Hunt, <em>J., </em>42; 20 <em>N. Y. </em>492; 3 <em>Barb., </em>110).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-11\">2d. When the evidence is conflicting or questions of credibility are involved, the case must be very clear indeed, in favor of the defendant to justify the court in taking the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>away from the jury <em>(Hart </em>agt. <em>Erie R.R. Co., </em>3 <em>Alb. L. J., </em>312).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AMR\">3d. Even where there is no conflict of evidence, it does not follow, necessarily, that the court is to decide the issue <em>(Ernst </em>agt. <em>H. R. R. Co. </em>35 <em>N Y., </em>47; <em>Ireland </em>agt. <em>Os. R.R. Co., </em>13 N. <em>Y., </em>533; <em>Oldfield </em>agt. <em>N. Y. &amp; H. R.R. Co., </em>14 <em>N. Y., </em>310).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-6\"><em>(a.) </em>Negligence is generally deduced from different circumstances attending the injury and more or less definitely proved and clearly established, and seldom susceptible of positive proof that decedent was free from contributory negligence. The same principle may be applied to this as in case of a demurrer to evidence, and tEien any inference against the demurrant which the jury might, with the slightest degree of propriety, make from the evidence is to be conceded <em>(Cow. &amp; Hill's notes, part 2, 3d ed., </em>785 ; <em>Colgrove </em>agt. <em>N. H. &amp; H. R.R. Co., 20 N. Y., </em>492 ; <em>Betts </em>agt. <em>Jackson, </em>6 <em>Wend., </em>203).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-8\">IY. The fourth exception is to the refusal of the court to allow the case to go to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-9\"><em>First. </em>The question touching the negligence of the defendant was one clearly of fact for the jury. The defendant, through different and independent agencies, was guilty of negligence; (1.) in not ringing the bell or blowing the whistle as prescribed by the statute; (2.) neglecting the customary sign or signal, <em>11 </em>railroad erasing, look out for the cars (3.) running at a dangerous rate of speed without\" signals of its approach.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-10\">lsi. As to the signals by bell or whistle. The duty of the railroad company as to ringing the bell and blowing the whistle at places where the same shall cross any traveled public road is prescribed by statute (2 <em>R.

As between the traveler using the public highway and the railroad company, the former has the right to rely on tj\u00a3 latter performing the act prescribed by statute; and it is not carelessness in him to assume that the company will'obey the positive mandates of the'law <em>(29 N.

It was claimed by defendant\u2019s counsel, on the trial, that the law did not require the company to erect and maintain a signboard at this crossing ; yet it is shown that the defendant, on the Monday following the accident, replaced the signboard that was down.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-7\">(it.) This'high measure of duty on the part of the railroad company, the statute prescribing notices by signboards at road or street crossings, * * has not relaxed in any degree.

In determining whether the failure of the deceased to discover an approaching train is attributable to his own carelessness, we must take into account all the' circumstances which surrounded the transaction.

In the case at bar the court assumes two things on granting the motion for nonsuit, (i.) That the deceased knew there was a railroad crossing at the place of the accident, and, (2) That deceased could have seen the tram in time to have avoided the accident, if he had looked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-11\">In regal'd to the first.assumption, we say :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-12\">(1.) The law in reference to looking up and down the track can only apply to those cases where the deceased knew there was a track to look up and down. This is too plain a statement to need argument. (2.) The evidence on this point was that deceased lived fifteen miles away; was a foreigner <em>\u25a0, </em>had been in this country but three years, and his nearest way to Syracuse was another route.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-13\">His neighbor, Woodford, came and went the other way. There was no evidence that deceased had ever before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>or from Syracuse that way. Under this state of facts, had the court .the right to assume as matter of law that the deceased knew there was a railroad crossing at that point? Was it not peculiarly within the province of the jury- to pass on that question under the evidence as presented? Bear in mind, also, in this case the court, according to his own statement, assumes it not as a fact established on clear evidence, but on \u201c strong probabilities.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-5\">We know no better reply to this than Judge Foster\u2019s own words in the case of <em>Gonzales, (supra, </em>39 <em>How., </em>418 <em>and </em>419): \u201cIt is the exclusive province of the jury to determine what are the inferences of fact to be deduced from the testimony, to the same extent that it is to decide the facts when the evidence is conflicting.\u201d and see cases there cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-7\">(2.) In regard to the second assumption, in addition to what is said on the other branch of the subject, we say :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-8\"><em>1st. </em>The fact that a person just out of a house, with eyes and ears open and free from snow and ice, could see a train six to eight rods, is no evidence that one who had driven two or three miles in a storm, wind blowing, snow driving, and whose face, eyes and ears must have been filled with snow, sleet and ice, could have seen the train in time to avoid the accident. Gregory, who had also J*en out in the storm, says, \u201c I couldn\u2019t see any further than the horse\u2019s head, not unless I looked pretty sharp, on account of its snowing and blowing so.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-9\"><em>2d. </em>It is also assumed by the court in this case, that decedent did not look, did not use due care and caution. Upon what principle of law can such a proposition be founded ? Upon what legal principle can the court base such an assumption of fact? There is no proof in the case that decedent was guilty of negligence\u2014that he did not use his eyes and ears ; that he did not use that degree of care and caution which a prudent man would do under like circumstances. When the decedent is killed, can you assume as a fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>that he did not look <em>1 </em>The presumption of law is (he having been killed), that he exercised that ordinary care which the law requires, to save himself from harm <em>(Vide </em>Denio\u2019s opinion, 20 <em>N.

Not only does the court, assume all the foregoing propositions without evidence; it goes further and holds it to have been the duty of the decedent, who was a stranger, at any rate to the particular location of the railroad) not only to look .both ways,- but also behind him, to see that there was no train following on a road nearly parallel to the one he was traveling.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-6\">Courts nonsuit whe^n the negligence of deceased is shown by the evidence, but this is the first case in our knowledge in which negligence has been presumed by the court when there was no evidence of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-7\"><em>Fourth. </em>If the railroad company can, with impunity, violate every law passed for the protection of human life, be guilty of the grossest, culpable negligence, disregarding every safeguard made for the protection of the traveler using the public highway crossing the railroad, no matter what may be the circumstances surrounding the case-; if this court, in the case at bar, with all, its surrounding circumstances, before it, the deceased a comparative stranger in the county, residing miles distant, with no evidence that he was ever in the neighborhood of this crossing before, no bell rung or whistle blown, the signboard down, the railroad track covered with three or four inches of freshly fallen snow, completely obscuring the track at the crossing, no flagman there, a dense snowstorm prevailing at the time of the accident, with the wind blowing from the north-west drifting the snow directly into the eyes of the decedent, his team approaching the crossing upon a walk; Gregory, the cartman, 'turning out to the right and passing Hackford eight or ten feet east of the crossing with his team on a walk, and passing over but a few feet ahead of him ; shall hold, as a matter of law, that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>tiff cannot recover, then under what state of facts can any person ever hope to maintain an action against a railroad corporation for an injury received at a public highway. If the court shall hold in this case, that because it is not shown by positive proof that the decedent did look up and down the railroad track before he attempted to cross, with this terrible snow-storm prevailing at the time and when he could not have seen the train in time to have avoided the collision, that the plaintiff cannot recover then I ask: under what state of facts can a person ever hope to recover an action of this kind <em>1 </em>You directly encourage the railroad company and its servants to a reckless disregard of those laws passed for the protection of human life, you say to him, run your ponderous trains through cities and villages and across thickly crowded thoroughfares; and no matter if you are guilty of culpable negligence and the unsuspecting traveler is crushed to death,'his widow or next of kin cannot recover.

The exception at folio 15 of the case is not well taken. The way a man would naturally look on approaching the \u2018crossing, is not a question of skill or science.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApH\">\u2014The plaintiff, as administrator, brought this action to recover damages for the killing of William Hackford at G-eddes, in the county of Onondaga, in December, 1869, by reason of the negligence of the employees of defendant. The deceased was driving his team from the city of Syracuse to his residence, some fifteen miles from the city. It was a very stormy day, snow was falling, and the wind was blowing very hard.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">The street, along which the deceased was driving, runs east and west, at the railroad crossing, where the accident occurred, and it crosses the track at nearly right angles. The deceased was going west; the engine, by which he was struck, was moving north at about twrenty miles per hour. There was no sign up, indicating that there was a railroad crossing at the place of the accident; the sign that had been up having been removed. A carman, with furniture in his cart, crossed the track just before the deceased attempted to cross; there were other teams approaching the track from the east.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">The drivers of the other teams stopped, seeing the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>proa'ching engine and cried \u201cwhoa\u201d to the deceased just before he got on to the track; the deceased did not regard it, but drove on and was instantly struck and killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">On the trial, plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified to the foregoing facts and, also, that as the engine approached the track, the bell was not rung, nor was the whistle .blown. These omissions of duty, together with the rate of speed and absence of a sign indicating the crossing, constituted the negligence on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The defenses set up in answer were: <em>first, </em>a general denial ; and, second, concurring negligence on the part of the intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The evidence of negligence on the part of the intestate was:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">1 <em>st. </em>That the railroad track could be seen, by a person going from Syracuse, towards the crossing, for a distance of some half a mile, except where houses intervened. The track was higher than the land on either side and higher than the street. \u2022 Near the crossing a train could be seen for a distance of fourteen hundred feet in one direction, and an eighth of a mile in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">\u25a0 Henry Gf. Allen testified that he lived at Gfeddes, in a house on the north side of Gfenessee Street, some six or ten rods from the crossing. He was in the street at the time of the accident, and saw the train approaching some six or eight rods from the crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Michael Ready testified that he lived in Gfeddes, on the northwest side of Gfenessee Street, and east of the railroad. At the time of the accident he was standing seven or eight rods from the crossing. Heard a man shouting <em>\u201c </em>whoa\u201d; looked up and saw the train passing, and just about the same time saw smoke stack of the engine, and then the collision occurred almost instantly, not a half a second after he heard the cry of \u201c whoa,\u201d The intestate, with his team, passed along pretty swift. \"When he first saw the intestate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>he was within a rod of the track, and when he saw the engine the intestate was going right on to the track.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Justin M. Woodford testified that the storm was very severe; so severe that you could not see many rods.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Henry D. Gregory was the carman who crossed the track ahead of deceased, and he testified that before he crossed he did not hear or see the cars. He could not see, by reason of the storm, any further than the horses\u2019 heads, not unless he looked pretty sharp.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Upon this evidence the plaintiff\" was nonsuited, on the grounds that the deceased was himself guilty of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the court to submit the question of concurring negligence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">The request was refused on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence to go to the jury; aiid to this ruling plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted, as he did to the granting of the non-suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">The court committed a grave error in refusing to submit the question of concurring negligence of the deceased to the jury. Had the day been a fair one, so that there was nothing to prevent a person from seeing and hearing an approaching train, I should be of opinion that the deceased would have been chargeable with the grossest negligence. The day was a very stormy one; the wind was high and snow falling in large quantities, and of course it was carried by the wind against the faces of those travelling against the wind. From what point of the compass the wind was blowing on the day of the accident does not appear in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">But it does appear that the man who crossed the track just ahead of the deceased could not see further than his horse\u2019s head, unless he looked pretty sharp.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">There is no evidence that a person approaching the track could see an approaching train at a greater distance than six to eight rods from the crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">If the train was moving twenty miles per hour, it would move the distance of six rods in a little over a second. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>then we could assume that the deceased saw the engine six' rods before it reached the crossing, he had no time to save himself, he must have been. on the track and escape im possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">If we assume that he did not look for an approaching train, and it would, under ordinary circumstances, be negligence not to look, yet when it is demonstrated that if he had looked, he could .not have escaped injury or death, surely his right to recover of the party whose negligence caused the injury would not be denied him?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Again it was shown that the man who crossed ahead of \u25a0 him, did not hear the approaching train, and by reason of neither seeing or hearing it, nearly lost his own life, must we not assume that the deceased did not hear it, and therefore, his senses failed to apprise him of his danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Is it probable that two men rushed recklessly into the jaws of death, having knowledge that death was imminent ?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">If we are to indulge in presumptions, is it not the rational one that men use, their senses for their protection when they have reason to suppose that danger is impending.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">If upon the evidence given by the plaintiff, the jury could reasonably feel that, by reason of the storm, the deceased could not, in the absence of ringing of the bell, or the blowing of the whistle ascertain the approach of a train in time to escape a collision with it, would not a verdict for the plaintiff have been sustained. That such a state of facta might have been found from the evidence, I entertain no doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">It was, therefore, the duty of the court to submit the question to the jury, as to the concurring negligence of the deceased, and because the request to submit it was refused, a new trial must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">The learned judge said, in granting the nonsuit, that the plaintiff had the affirmative of showing by the evidence that he was free from any negligence that contributed to the production of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>This remark cannot be the ground for granting a new trial, if it is erroneous, but it may be taken into consideration in determining the weight the court gave to the evidence of the concurring negligence of deceased, when it refuses to submit the question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">If the learned judge intended to hold that the plaintiff is bound to allege in a complaint in an action for damages resulting from an injury caused by the negligence of the defendant, and to prove affirmatively on the trial that he (the plaintiff) was not guilty of negligence that contributed to the injury, he was mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The concurring negligence of the plaintiff is matter of defense, and the. plaintiff'is under no obligation to prove anything to entitle him to recover but the injury, and that it was caused by defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">No precedent of a common law declaration in case for negligence can be found, I think, in which plaintiff asserts that he was free from negligence, nor any decision that he is bound to make such proof. (See precedents in case for negligence in 2 <em>Ckitty's Pleadings.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">But where, on the trial, there is evidence of negligence on the part of plaintiff, whether it comes from plaintiff\u2019s or defendant\u2019s witnesses, the plaintiff must overcome it, in order to entitle himself to recover. In this way, and in this way <em>only, is the </em>plaintiff bound to disprove his <em>own </em>negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">To meet the view of the court, that the plantiff had the burden of proving the absence of negligence, affirmatively, a \u25a0 higher degree of proof was demanded than he was bound to make, and thus wrong was done to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">If, however, the court merely meant to say, the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence shows his negligence, and that it concurred to produce the'injury, he must, therefore, give evidence to rebut the inference of negligence resulting from the evidence he had himself given, he was, doubtless correct. If plaintiff\u2019s witnesses proved defendant\u2019s defense, it was as available as if proved by itself This construction of the charge would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>hardly be consistent with the proposition that the plaintiff held the affirmative of disproving negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">If it had, it mast follow that the law must presume negligence against him, tin the contrary, negligence is never presumed, but must be affirmatively proved. There must be a new trial with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Note.\u2014In seems that this case turned on the ground that it was a very <em>stormy </em>day. when the collision aim death took place. For it is admitted that the deceased would have been chargeable with the grossest negligence, had the day been a fair one.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Now should not the deceased have exercised a corresponding degree of care and caution iu crossing the railroad on a stormy day, to what he would have been required on a fair day. Was it not his duty on approaching near the railroad track to <em>stoj?t </em>and if he could not see as far as usual in fair weather, to listen attentively to hear an approaching train, especially so when the action of some of the other teamsters was such as to assure him that a train was near at hand, instead ot rushing on blindly, iu a snow storm, with such evidence before him of danger from a coming train.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">This case is somewhat aualagous to that of <em>Ernst </em>agt. <em>Hudson, R. R.R. Co., </em>our views of which are given pretty fully in a Note in 36 <em>How. p. </em>84. A case where we think eventually, great injustice was done by mulcting the railroad company in a sum of $5.0U0, damages, when it appeared to be a very clear case for a nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The theory upon which these railroad collisions occur at a highway crossing, we think to he, generally, an impatience of delay, an aversion to stopping until the danger is past. To be sure, considerate, cautious .and timid people are careful and do not give way to this impatience of restraint, but are willing to allow any reasonable length of time to pass, when necessary, to avoid danger. But take the commonalty of people who drive teams upon public highways, it is different. Such persons get accustomed to railroad as well as to highway travel. A man of this description in crossing a railroad track with his lioises and waggon, would very likely cross in front of an engine so near that the hind wheels of his wagon would barely clear the engine, and after he had got across stop his team for five minutes, and turn around and look at the train, saying to himself, that was a pretty close shave,\u201d when nothing would have induced him to stop two minutes on the other side and let the tr*iu and the danger pass on before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">In the case of <em>Ernst </em>(supra,) who stopped with his team, at Beerstyners tavern in the village oi Bath, opposite of Albany, a day or two before New Years, . and probably after refreshing the inner man and feeling pretty comfortable, Went out, unhitched his horses, jumped into his sleigh and sat down on the bottom of it, with a shawl around his tace and ears, steered his horses for the ferry boat, which he knew was waiting for him, and neither looked to the right nor left, although he must have seen, and probably heard the three men, one on his right, one on his left, and one directly in front of him, warning him that an engine and cars were.close at hand, and to stop, before crowing the railroad, yet, we have no doubt this principle of impatience of delay or restraint, seduced him tv urge forward his horses, with the hope and expectation that he Wi-uld be able to cross before the engine reached him. In this, however, he was m\u00edstala n.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">It is not that people incline to rush into danger and death in these cases, but the, desire to avoid both, by a course myolviug great risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>We still adhere to and insist, that the rule promulgated by Judge E. DXitwxs Smith, when the case of <em>J3nisti </em>was first before the court of appeals, is the true, salutary and humane one, to wit, on crossing a raihoad in constant use, the person crossing should look each way upon the tiack To ascertain whether a train of cars is approaching. We are aware that this rule has had -its stubs and thrusts with a zeal worthy of a better cause, but w\u00e9 think that it abideth still unscathed and unharmed. For it does not require the performance of a duty which the person does not owe to a mismanaged, careless and negligent railroad company; nor has it any reference to the culpability or liability of a railroad company whatever. It has for its object a higher and nobler end\u2014the preservation of human life, which is the highest law of our nature.\u2014Rep.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
