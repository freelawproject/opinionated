Ed.</em>1866).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-9\">The distinction between the time of the vesting of the title of an executor and that o\u00ed an administrator has become of no practical importance, for it is now settled beyond; all question that the title of the administrator, after his appointment vests from or relates back to the death of the intestate (3 <em>Redf. on Wills, </em>127)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-10\">Thus the administrator may recover against a wrongdoer, who has seized or converted the goods of the intestate, before letters granted, in an action of trover <em>(Com. Dig. Administration B. </em>10; 18 <em>Vin. Abr., </em>285; <em>Rockwell </em>agt. <em>Saunders, </em>19 <em>Barb., </em>473).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-11\">Or, he may bring trespass, although this is an action founded on the right to possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-12\"><em>\u201c </em>The relation fixes the possession from the beginning\u201d (2 <em>Roll. Abr., </em>554, <em>Tit. Trespass, pl. </em>2 ; <em>Year Book, </em>26 <em>Hen., 6, </em>8; <em>Tharpe </em>agt. <em>Stallwood, </em>5 <em>Man. &amp; Gr., </em>760)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-13\">The ancient reason for this relation was, that <em>u </em>otherwise there would be no remedy\u201d <em>(Per </em>Rolle, <em>Ch. J., Long </em>agt. <em>Hebb, Style, </em>341, A.D., 1652).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-14\">The principle, as deduced from the latter cases, stands upon a broader and more symmetrical basis, viz.: \u201c The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>title of an administrator relates back to the death of the intestate, for the purpose of supporting the rights of the intestate, and of ratifying acts for the benefit of his estate, and giving a remedy where otherwise there would be none; but not to affect the rights of third persons to the estate vested intermediate the death and letters granted, or to take away those of the intestate, according to the maxim, <em>1 in fictione juris semper eonsistit equitas1 </em>\u201d <em>(Leber </em>agt. Kauffelt, 5 <em>Watts &amp; Sar., </em>440, 5).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-5\">In the case last cited, one who has paid a claim against an\u2019 intestate\u2019s estate, and afterwards took out letters of administration, was held entitled to sue, in his representative capacity, on a bond given to the intestate to indemnify him against that claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-6\">. So where a note belonging to the estate of an intestate was paid to his widow, who subsequently united with another in taking out letters of administration, and they then brought an action on the note in their representative capacity, the letters were he d to relate back and. render the payment to the widow, a bar to the action <em>(Priest agt. Watkins, </em>2 Hill, 225).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-7\">While there are certain cases in which the doctrine of relation has not been allowed, yet they will be found to be those in which the fiction is set up to divest some right of a third person to the estate which vested intermediate the death of the intestate and letters granted, as <em>Gilb. </em>Eq., 223 or to prejudice the right of the intestate, as <em>Morgan </em>agt. <em>Thomas, </em>(8 <em>Exch., </em>302) ; <em>Murray agt. East India Co., </em>(5 <em>Barn &amp; Al., </em>204); <em>Pratt </em>agt. <em>Swaine, </em>(8 <em>B. &amp; </em>C.); <em>Steward </em>agt. <em>Edmond\u2019s, </em>(1 <em>Wms. Exrs., 4th ed. </em>834, <em>note </em>u); <em>Parsons </em>agt. Mayesden, (Freeman, 151).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-8\">The New York decisions proceed on the doctrine of the earlier English cases, and of <em>Williams </em>agt. <em>Norwith, (Style, </em>337), and hold that the grant of letters <em>of </em>administration relates back to <em>the </em>death of the intestate, and legalizes all intermediate acts of the administratrix <em>db </em>initio, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>beneficial to the estate or otherwise, in the absence of fraud or collusion <em>(Vroom </em>agt. <em>Van </em>Horne, 10 Paige, 549, 558 ; <em>Rattoon </em>agt. <em>Overacker, </em>8 <em>Johns., </em>226)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-4\"><em>(b.) </em>Even if the payments on account of the defendant\u2019s indebtedness to the intestate had been made by the defendant to a third person holding the note, and been received as such, under the same circumstances as those of January 22, 1869, and August 11, 1869, were made, the act of such third person could have been ratified by the plaintiff after letters granted, and the new promise, raised by the payments, been rendered available to the plaintiff as administratrix.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-5\">The act would have been ratified by making a legal demand for the benefit of the contract thus made, by bringing suit (1 <em>Am. Lead. Cas., Hare &amp; W. notes, </em>593), and where one means to act as agent for another a subsequent ratification by the other is always equivalent to a prior command ; nor is it any objection that the intended principal was unknown at the time <em>(Hull </em>agt. <em>Pickersgill, </em>1 <em>Brod. &amp; Bing., </em>282 ; <em>Foster </em>agt. <em>Bates, 12 M &amp; W., </em>226).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-6\">So where one received sums of money from an intestate^ debtors\u2019 the- subsequently appointed administratrix vyas held entitled to waive the tort, ratify the receipt of the money and recover the same in an action for money had and received to her use as administratrix <em>(Welchman </em>agt. <em>Sturgis, </em>13 <em>Q. B., </em>552).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-7\">The administrator may ratify a contract made by procuration, or in any other form, before his appointment on behalf of the estate, so as to take the benefit of it, the same as if his authority had been of a date anterior (3 <em>Redf, on Wills., </em>127).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acf\">(c.) The provisions of the Revised Salutes (2 <em>R. S., </em>81, \u00a7 60, and <em>Id., </em>449, \u00a7 17), were not intended to work any alteration in the common law in respect to the doctrine of the relation of letters of administration <em>(Priest </em>agt. <em>Watkins, </em>2 <em>Hill, </em>226).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaV\">At common law if one who was neither executor or ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>ministrator intermeddled with the goods of the deceased, or did any act characteristic of the office of executor, he thereby made himself an executor of his own wrong or <em>de son tort (Swinburne, part </em>4, \u00a7 23, <em>pl. </em>1; <em>Godolph, part </em>2, <em>ch. </em>8 <em>\u00a7 </em>1 ; <em>Wentworth, Off. Exrs., 14th ed. ch., </em>14, <em>p. </em>320).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-5\">When one so acted as to become executor <em>de son tort </em>he thereby rendered himself liable not only to an action by the rightful executor or administrator, but also to be used as executor by the creditor of the deceased or by a legatee, for an executor <em>de son tort </em>had all the liabilities though none of the privileges, that belong to the character of executor <em>(Carmichael </em>agt. <em>Carmichael, </em>1 <em>Phil. E. C., </em>103, <em>per </em>Lord Cottenham ; <em>Williams on Exrs., </em>217 ; 2 <em>Blacks. Com. </em>495.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-6\">He could not bring an action himself in the right of the deceased <em>(Bro. Abr. Tit. Administration, </em>8), so that even at common law the plaintiff in this action could not be heard as executrix <em>de son tori.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-7\">He was chargeable with the debts of the dec\u00e9ased, so far' as assets came to his hands <em>(Dyer, </em>166), and as against creditors in general was allowed all payments made to any other creditor (1 <em>Ch. Ca., </em>33), himself excepted (5 <em>Rep. </em>30, <em>Moore, </em>527).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-8\">By statute, (2 <em>R. L., p. </em>313, \u00a7 13, copied from 43 <em>Eliz., Ch 8, </em>1 <em>Chitty St., 3d ed., </em>1416), an executor of his own wrong was declared liable for all assets coming t\u00f3 his hands, with the privilege of retaining for debts due him from the intestate, and of being allowed for all proper payments made by him. 2 <em>R. S., </em>81, \u00a7 60, deprived him of this statutory privilege.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-9\">2 R. S., 449, \u00a7 17, abolished the common law liability, and rendered him responsible as a wrongdoer to the lawful representative of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-10\">. The sole intention was manifestly to alter the theory of the liability of third persons to the rightful executor or administrator for their wrongful acts, and to restrict this liability to such executor or administrator, as trustee not only of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>intestate, but also for creditors. It was not to deprive the rightful representative of his common law right <em>to avail </em>himseli of acts done' or contracts made on behalf of the estate for its benefit. . .</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b286-5\"><em>By the </em>court, Barnard, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A84\">\u2014The payment made by defendant upon the note in question to the plaintiff before she had <em>taken oat </em>letters of administration on the estate of her husband, was a good payment to her as administratrix, she subsequently having taken out letters. She had possession of the note, and the payment was for the benefit of the estate, and all her acts are confirmed, for the benefit of the estate from the time of the death of her husband, by relation.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The evidence fully sustains the referee in his finding, that the note was not given by defendant to deceased' as collateral security for any debt due from-O.
