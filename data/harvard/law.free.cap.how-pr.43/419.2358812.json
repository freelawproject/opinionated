Assuming that the proof offered by the defendants, would establish the facts sought to be proved, it was not sufficient, as the case,stood, to defeat a recovery on the draft:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b423-7\">Meld, by the general term, on appeal, that where the acceptance is not only without consideration in fact, but procured by fraud practiced upon the acceptors, the mere taking of the draft on account of an antecedent debt, without giving up or surrendering something of value on the faith of its acceptance, is not enough to constitute the holder a <em>bona fide </em>holder for value as against the acceptors.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b423-9\"><em>Before </em>Bakbo\u00far, <em>CJi.

He probably assumed that the plaintiff had sufficiently shown himself to be a <em>bona fide </em>holder of commercial paper for value paid on the faith thereof. But such was1 not the fact. The sale of the steamer <em>.Buby, </em>being a transaction between the plaintiff and M. Requelme individually* the plaintiff under the direction of the firnr of M. Requelme &amp; Co., contained in the letter accompanying the draft to collect-the same- and hold the proceeds' subject to the order of M. Requelme, and in the absence of proof showing an appropriation by M. Requelme; of the said proceeds to plaintiff\u2019s use, appeared, so-far as the evidence went, in the character of a mere naked holder possessing authority to-collect for-the benefit of the true owner; especially, as the court had, at an early stage of the trial, excluded as unnecessary the proof offered by plaintiff to establish actual ownership, and had ruled proof of possession to be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Even upon plaintiff\u2019s theory, however, that he took the draft before acceptance- for the debt of M. Requelme* the evidence was admissible. In -such case, and as the evidence then stood, plaintiff took the unaccepted draft on account of an antecedent debt, without parting With any value upon the faith of either the draft or its acceptance, and defendants were not precluded from showing that their subsequent acceptance was procured wholly-by the fraud of the drawers,and was, in point of fact, wholly without consideration.' That was, one of the very' issues raised by the answer, and, if established as we must assume it would have been but for*such erroneous exclusion, would have cast the burden of proof upon the plaintiff, to establish that he was an innocent actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>owner and holder of the draft for value paid on the faith of its acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"A9p\">, As against the holder of a draft the acceptor, as a general rule, stands in the same position as the maker of a promissory-note, and the drawer in the same as the indorser. By his acceptance the acceptor admits that he has funds of the drawer in his hands to pay it. He is, in such case, regarded as ,the principal and the drawer as his surety, and the accepted draft imports a debt due from the acceptor td the drawer, which is. assigned to the payee. The instrument being one of those which on account of their negotiable quality and universal convenience in mercantile affairs, are specially favored by the law. If A. in the course of trade, parts with value-on the faith of B.\u2019s acceptance, the law,, to protect A., as an innocent holder for \u00b0a valuable- consideration, against ,B.\u2019s contradicting, the words \u201cvalue received\u201d written above his promise, presumes a consideration to exist, and B. will not be permitted to overthrow such presumption by actual proof to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u2022 But this rule applies only to a <em>bona fide </em>holder for a valuable consideration, and the doctrine as to what constitutes a person such <em>bona fide </em>holder for value, again varies in cases presenting a wide and marked distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Thus, in <em>Cole </em>agt. <em>Saulpaugh, </em>(48 <em>Barb., </em>104), and <em>Schepp </em>agt. <em>Carpenter, </em>(49 <em>Barb., </em>542), the holder of an accommodation note, which had been given by the maker without restriction as to the -manner in which it should be used by the payee, was held to be a <em>bona-fide </em>holder for value as against the maker, notwitstanding it appeared that he took it for an antecedent debt and with notice of its character as accommodation paper. These decisions are based upon the fact that the payee, not. being limited or restricted as to the-manner of its use, had a right to apply it to the payment or security of an antecedent debt, or to sustain his credit with.\" it in any other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">So, in the absence of fraud, an acceptance has been held: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>to involve a consideration, inasmuch as it delays the holder\u2019s resort to the drawer, which he might have immediately in case of non-acceptance; and for the same reason a subsequent acceptance, before maturity and for the accommodation of the drawer, has .been held to inure to_the benefit of the holder who discounted the draft before acceptance in the expectation, justified by' a previous course of dealing, that it would be-so accepted (Mechanics\u2019 <em>Bank </em>agt. <em>Livingston, </em>33 <em>Barb., </em>458).</p>\n<p id=\"Aln\">But when the acceptance is not only without consideration in fact, but, in addition, has been procured by means of a fraud practiced upon the acceptor, an entirely different rule prevails. Here, the mere taking of the draft.on- account of an antecedent debt, without giving up or surrendering something of value on the faith of its acceptance, is- nqt enough to constitute the holder a <em>bona fide </em>holder for value as against the acceptor. The doctrine of <em>Swift </em>agt. <em>Tyson, </em>(16 <em>Peters U. S.,), </em>has not been followed in this state. On the contrary, our courts held, at quite an early day, that the'receipt of commercial paper fraudulently put in circulation, or diverted from the purpose for which it was originally. issued, merely as payment or security for a precedent debt, no new credit or other- thing of legal value being given on the faith thereof, and no security being relinquished or discharged, nor any new responsibility incurred on the credit thereof, is not parting with value, such as to enable the holder to' enforce such commercial paper against an accommodation party, or to hold it against the true owner or -to hold it free of equities existing upon it against the transferrer at the time of the' transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">This rule has been firmly . maintained, both at law and in equity, by along and uninterrupted series of adjudications, and is, beyond question, the settled law of this state. <em>(Coddington </em>agt. <em>Bay, </em>20 <em>Johns., </em>637; <em>affirming, S.

In such case, the actual discharge of' the personal responsibility of the debtor is equivalent to parting with securities or to paying money. The extinction of a legal demand in its orignal form is, however, to be proved affirmatively; and ths question whether a party is a holder, for value, so as to displace in his tavor any right or equity of prior parties, depends upon the fact being established of an intended and actual extinguishment (N. <em>Y. Exchange Co. </em>agt. <em>De Wolf, </em>3 <em>Bosw., </em>86, and authorities there cited).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Time and space do not permit me to make a more extended reference to the authorities cited than I have done, and I will conclude, therefore, by calling attention yet- to the following decisions of a comparatively recent date, which deserve to be carefully noted :</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">' In <em>McBride </em>agt. <em>The Farmers\u2019 Bank </em>(26 <em>N. Y, </em>450), and <em>Commercial Bank of Clyde </em>agt. <em>Marine Bank </em>(6 <em>Abb. N. S., </em>33; <em>S. C., </em>3 <em>Keyes, </em>337), it was held that a bank does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>become a purchaser for value of demands remitted to it for collection, by reason of its having a balance against the re mitting bank, for which it has refrained from drawing, and of its having discounted notes for the latter upon its indorsement, in reliance upon a course of dealings between the banks to collect notes for each other, each keeping an open account of said collections, treating all the paper sent for collection as the property of the other, and drawing for balances at pleasure.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In <em>Bright </em>agt. <em>Judson </em>(47 <em>Barb., </em>29), it was expressly decided,, that fraudulent representations by which on\u00e9 is induced to accept a bill, are a bar to a recovery thereon by a holder who took the bill in payment of an antecedent debt, without surrendering something of value upon the faith of such acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">And in the <em>Farmers and Mechanics\u2019 Bank </em>agt. <em>The Empire Stone Dressing Co., (5 Bosw., </em>289), tlje decision was that to entitle one to enforce an acceptance, which is otherwise invalid (whether for want of power in the. agent who wrote the acceptance to bind his principal, as in that case, or for fraud practiced by the drawer upon the acceptor, as in. the case at bar, makes n\u00f3 difference), on the ground that he is a <em>Iona fide </em>holder for value, it must appear that he parted with value upon the faith of such acceptance. . He may be a <em>bona fide </em>holder of the bill for value paid therefor, and be entitled to'enforce, it against every other party thereto, and yet, have no right to recover on such acceptance. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">In view of the authorities referred to, it is entirely clear, that'defendants had an unquestionable' right to prove the facts embraced in the two offers made, and that the exclusion of their proposed evidence constituted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">. Defendants\u2019 exceptions to such exclusion of their evidence and to the direction of a verdict against them must, therefore, be sustained, and the verdict must be set aside and a new trial ordered, with costs to defendants, to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Bakbotjk, <em>Ch.
