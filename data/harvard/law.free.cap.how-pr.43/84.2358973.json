Roberts, (8 <em>Abb., </em>343), in which Judge Hilton, evidently takes the view, that the order affects property in the debtor\u2019s hands at the time of the service of the order. On the other-hand, it is contended, that the order only affects property received, earned, or due before the making of the injunction-order <em>Campbell </em>agt. <em>Genet, </em>(2 <em>Hilt., </em>290), and cases there-cited. This being a general term decision of this court, must-control as long as it remains unreversed, and must control my decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Motion denied, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
