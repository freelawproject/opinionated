Sutherland, J., -said\u00a1.\u201cIt cannot be belieVed that after the jury-box is properly sifted, twelve impartial men cannot be found in the county of Kings to try this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">Parties deceive themselves in the estimate of the extent of interest which the public at large take in their controversies.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">In <em>Nesmith </em>agt. <em>The Atlantic Ins. Co. </em>(8 <em>Abb., </em>423), there had been a protracted trial, and a verdict for the plaintiff, but it was set aside. There had also been a second trial and the jury disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">The motion was, nevertheless, denied. Piereepont, J., said that an impartial trial by a struck jury would be \u00a1much less likely than in the ordinary way. That the court in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>latter mode, would allow every juror to be tried on oath, before he took his seat, and if unfit would exclude him.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In <em>Walsh </em>agt. <em>The Sun Mutual Ins. Co., </em>(17 <em>Abb., </em>356), the cases are collected and reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The motion was made upon the alleged importance and intricacy of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Its importance, involving a claim of $15,000, seems to have been conceded, but the intricacy of the issues was not adjudged. The motion was denied. It was held that there was no precedent for granting the motion in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">In the opinion, the manuscript case of <em>Giles </em>agt. <em>Flagg, </em>is referred to, but the decision in that' case is not stated. I have not been able to find it, I think it must have been adverse to the granting of the order for a struck jury, inasmuch as it was referred to and relied on by Mr. Hoyes, who opposed the motion in' <em>Welsh </em>agt. <em>The Sun Mutual Ins. Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">It was declared that <em>Giles </em>agt. <em>Flagg, </em>was important, and of great public interest, and, doubtless, because it involved the question who should be comptroller.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">It is evident, as intimated, if not substantially declared, in <em>Patchin </em>agt. <em>Sands (supra), </em>that a struck jury will not be granted, except in extreme cases. This is not of that character in my' judgment. I entertain no doubt, that an intelligent and unbiased jury may be impanelled in this\" case in the ordinary way, who, wholly uninfluenced by the national-' ity of either party, will act fairly upon the evidence given on the trial and decide accordingly.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">It is by no means evidence of partiality or prejudice, that juries sometimes disagree..</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">This may well result from the conflicting character of the testimony given before them, and warranting different views. There are few elements of judicial life so embarrassing and productive of so much anxiety and delay as conflicting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">\u25a0Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
