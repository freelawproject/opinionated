This case must not be confounded with an action by a tenant to recover damages against his 'landlord, for injuries sustained by the tenant himself, arising from the neglect of the landlord to perform a valid agreement (or any other legal obligation resting upon him arising out of the circumstances) to keep premises in repair or to guarantee their safety. In such cases there is direct privity between landlord and tenant, and the action itself is either <em>ex </em>contractu, or arises directly out of the relationship of landlord and tenant <em>(Eakin </em>agt. Brown, 1 <em>E. D. </em>Smith, 36; <em>Robbins </em>agt. <em>Mount, </em>4 <em>Robts., </em>553; <em>Johnson </em>agt. <em>Dixon, </em>1 <em>Daly, </em>178 ; <em>Francis </em>agt. <em>Cockerel, Law Rep., </em>5 <em>Q.

The plaintiff endeavors \u25a0 to maintain this action on the ground of what the pleader is pleased to call the <em>\u201c </em>negligence\u201d or non-feasance of the defendant in not repairing or making safe a balcony (alleged to have been dangerous and unsafe) attached to the front of certain rooms, (on the fourth story of a house in East 13th street,) owned by defendant and exclusively occupied by the parents of plaintiff, under a hiring from defendant to plaintiff\u2019s father, in using which plaintiff was injured. Assuming the facts to-be as alleged by plaintiff, then, in order to maintain the allegation of- <em>\u201c </em>negligence,\u201d as the basis of an action against the defendant to recover damages sustained by plaintiff in falling from this balcony, there must be shown some obligation, express or implied, either of contract or legal duty of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>towards the plaintiff, which the defendant has failed to perform. The \u201c negligence\u201d alleged is another word for nonfeasance, and is predicable only of some contract voluntarily undertaken by the defendant, or some legal duty cast upon her by operation of law, in some relation between her and plaintiff. If the plaintiff be a stranger to the defendant, and there be no privity by contract between them, (as must be conceded) then is there any private legal duty which the defendant owed to the plaintiff, as a member of the family of the tenant; or any public legal duty owed by defendant to her, as one of the public or otherwise f Clearly'the defendant owed no greater obligation of private legal duty to the plaintiff specifically, as one of the family of the defendant\u2019s tenant, than to his guests, or friends or-visitors. Neither has the plaintiff a claim against the defendant for any neglect on her part to discharge any public legal duty she owed towards the plaintiff as one of the public. The premises in question are purely private property, and the <em>\u201c </em>balcony\u201d could only be reached by any person through the rooms leased to and exclusively occupied by the plaintiff\u2019s father, and not by defendant <em>( Winterbottom </em>agt. <em>Wright, </em>10 <em>Mees. &amp; Welsby, </em>109; <em>The Mayor, &amp;c., of Albany </em>agt. <em>Cunliff 2 N. Y., 172, </em>173; <em>Nicholson </em>agt. <em>Erie R. W. Co., </em>41 <em>N. Y., </em>530 ; <em>Loop </em>agt. <em>Litchfield, </em>42 <em>N. Y., </em>351).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-5\">3. \u201c Negligence\u201d is well defined as consisting <em>\u201c </em>in the commission of some lawful act in a careless manner, or in the omission to perform some legal duty, to the injury of another. It is essential to a recovery, in the latter case, to establish that the defendant owed at the time some specific, clear, legal duty to the plaintiff, or the party injured\u201d <em>(Nicholson </em>agt. <em>Erie R. W. Co., </em>41 <em>N. Y., </em>529).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-6\">4. As was previously well said by Judge Daly, in the case of <em>Cook </em>agt. <em>N. Y. Floating Dry Dock Co., </em>(1 <em>Hill, </em>438), and approved by Judge Ingraham, <em>(p. </em>444;) <em>\u201c </em>The only safe and practical rule is to confine the right of action to those who stand in the relation of contracting parties, or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>cases where the injury is caused by the disregard or neglect of some obligation or duty, which the party causing it owes to the party injured\u201d <em>(Nicholson </em>agt. <em>Erie R.W. Co., </em>41 <em>N. Y., </em>529).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-5\">5. If, as erroneously alleged in the complaint, the defendant had \u201c had the care and control of the premises\u201d where the accident happened, or had been the \u201coccupant\u201d of the same, there might have been some pretext for claiming a recovery against her. But the defendant was the mere owner; and the custodian of the plaintiff was himself the \u201c occupant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-6\">6. The mere circumstance that the plaintiff was \u201c lawfully\u201d upon these premises at the time of the accident, is immaterial. It does not tend to raise any obligation of defendant toward her, or to sustain this cause of action. This has always been maintained in all the cases <em>(Southcote </em>agt. <em>Stanley, </em>1 <em>Hurls. &amp; Nor. Exch., </em>249; <em>Bolch </em>agt. <em>Smith, </em>7 <em>Hurls, &amp; Nor.

The doctrine of \u201c <em>respondeat superior'\u2019 </em>does not apply, to the facts of this case. \u25a0 There was no relationship of master and servant, or principal and agent, between defendant and any other person connected with the transaction; nor was there any misfeasance or other act done by the defendant or her authority; nor was she, as has been already said, in possession of the premises <em>(Bush </em>agt. <em>Steinman, 1 Bos. &amp; Pull., </em>404; <em>The King </em>agt. <em>Pedlie, </em>1 <em>Ad. &amp; Ellis, </em>822; <em>Rich </em>agt. <em>Basterfield, </em>4 <em>Manning, Gr. &amp; </em>Scotts, 800; <em>Hobbit </em>agt. <em>London &amp; N.

Mere ownership of private' property does not impose upon a party any liability to the public, or strangers, to keep the same in repair or free from danger; provided it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>disturb a neighboring owner, or injure the public in the use of the neighboring streets or ways, or other public easements <em>(Chauntlcr </em>agt. <em>Robinson, </em>4 <em>W., H. &amp;.

The defendant insists it does not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-6\">1. The plaintiff and defendant were not contracting parties in any sense whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-7\">2. If the defendant\u2019s alleged nonfeasance is said to grow out of her relation of \u201clandlord\u201d alluded to, then it is founded upon the contract between the \u201clandlord and tenant, and the obliga tion of the defendant, was to perform that contract, and the \u201c negligence\u201d or nonfeasance complained of is only a breach of that contract, and the remedy is by action <em>ex contractu, </em>and only in favor of a party to that contract, or his lawful representatives. The plaintiff, however, is none of these <em>(Blakemore </em>agt. <em>The B. &amp; E. R.W. Co., </em>8 <em>Ellis &amp; Blkb. </em>1053).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-8\">3. Any agreement to repair was a mere matter between the \u201c landlord\u201d and \u201c tenant.\u201d The contract did not affect third persons. It did not make the landlord liable to them, or relieve the tenant in possession from his liability to them (Coleridge, <em>J., Russell </em>agt. <em>Shenton, </em>3 <em>Adol. &amp; </em>Ellis, <em>N. S., </em>455; <em>Cannavan </em>agt. <em>Conklin, </em>1 <em>Daly, </em>511).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-9\">4. The proposition now contended for by the defendant, was thus laid down by this court in <em>Cook </em>agt. <em>N. Y. Floating Dry Dock Co., </em>(1 <em>Hilt., </em>443 :) \u201c That no action lies against the defendants, founded upon the contract in favor of any other person than those to whom the dock was hired, is conceded. This was established by the cases cited, <em>Winterbottom </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>agt. <em>Wright, </em>(10 <em>Mees. &amp; Welsby, </em>109); <em>Priestly agt.

And where a master sought to recover damages for loss of services of his servant, who was injured by the negligence of a railway company, with whom the servant had a contract as a passenger, it was held that \u201c one not a party to a contract cannot sue for a breach of duty, arising out of the contract\u201d <em>(Alton </em>agt. <em>The Midland R.W. Co., </em>19 <em>Com. </em>Bench, <em>N. S., </em>213).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-7\">7. So. also, Baroit Parke, in the case of <em>Langbridge </em>agt. <em>Levy, </em>(2 <em>Mees. &amp; Welsby, </em>530), said ; \u201c That wherever a duty is imposed on a person by contract or otherwise, and that duty is violated, any one who is injured by the violation of it may have a remedy against the wrongdoer, * <em>* </em>\u2022 * is a principle which, would lead to indefinite extent of liability, * * * and we should pause before we made a precedent by our decision, which would_ be an authority for an action against the vendors, even of such instruments and articles \u2022as are dangerous in themselves, at the suit of any person into, whose hands they might happen to pass, and who should be injured threby\u201d <em>(Winterbottom </em>agt. <em>Wright, </em>10 <em>Mees. &amp; Welsby, </em>114; See, <em>also, Colles agt.

Without an express contract, the landlord is not liable, even to the tenant, to make,any repairs upon demised premises. Such an obligation grows out of the contract alone, and not out of the relation of landlord and tenant. Neither is there, in the absence of fraud, any warranty that the premises are even tenantable or fit, for occupation. The rule of <em>caveat emptor </em>applies <em>(Hart </em>agt. <em>Windsor, </em>12 <em>Mees. &amp; Welsby, </em>68; <em>Howard </em>agt. <em>Doolittle, </em>3 <em>Duer, </em>464 <em>&amp; </em>473<em>Sherwood </em>agt. <em>Seaman, </em>2 <em>Bosw., </em>130; <em>Kostor </em>agt. <em>Newhouse, </em>4 <em>E.

It matters not how stringent may have been the compact between landlord and tenant, that, as between themselves, the landlord should make repairs ; the obligation of the tenant to his guests and family, to keep the premises wherein he invited them, safe from danger, was not discharged or impaired or shifted to the shoulders of the landlord. The occupant alone is the sole wrong-doer in privity with such persons, in case of injury from his neglect to procure the repairs to be made, either by the owner or himself. In the language of <em>Ch: J. </em>Kenyon, (4 <em>T.

Outside and across the front of these rooms there ran a piazza, appurtenant to the demised premises, access to which was obtained through a door opening directly from the family sitting room, that was used by the tenant as a' place for washing and drying clothes, and storing eatables.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">It was protected by a railing, consisting of slats or rails running up and down \u201c about three or four feet\u201d from the floor of the piazza to the top rail. This-railing had been for two years getting quite rotten and out of repair, \u201c one end was quite separated and was secured by putting a barrel there.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\u2018\u2022It was pretty much all gone.\u201d Both the father and mother of the plaintiff were aware of its dangerous condition. The mother says, \u2018\u2018she had been speaking about it, and defendant said she would have the repairs done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">On the occasion of the accident, the mother was on the piazza, hanging out clothes, when the plaintiff, whom she had left in the sitting room, without being noticed by her, came out into the piazza, leaned up against the upright railings, one of which gave way, and she fell through the opening, and was precipitated down four stories into an adjoining yard, and sustained the injuries complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Under the facts of the case, the judgment ought not to be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\"><em>First. </em>The piazza was a portion of the premises which some six years previously had been demised to, and for all that time had been occupied by, John Flynn, the father, as tenant. It constituted no part, of the common passages or other appurtenances, or conveniences in a tenement house, over which it could be inferred or presumed the landlord retained an exclusive or general control, or over or upon which strangers or tenants in general were invited to pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The defect in the railing' arose from natural decay, occuring during the tenancy, and perhaps there was sufficient evidence to show that the landlord by agreement was to make such repairs as were needed to keep them in tenantable condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Conceding however,' such obligation rested on the defendant by virtue of the agreement for the letting of these premises, she was not, by reason thereof, responsible to the plaintiff for the inj ury she sustained. Under breach of a contract, the party in default is only liable to the party with whom or to whose benefit he has Contracted, for such damages as naturally and according to the usual course of things arise from the breach, or which may reasonably be supposed to have been within the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made, as the probable result of its breach, but not for accidental, remote or consequential causes <em>(Sedg. on Damages, 5th ed., </em>78 ; <em>Griffin </em>agt. <em>Culver, </em>16 <em>N.

C., </em>9 <em>Exch., </em>341), (the principles of which have been adopted by our courts,) where plaintiff owner of a mill, verbally contracted with the defendant, a common carrier, to carry a broken shaft of the mill to an artificer at a distance, to serve as a model for a new shaft. Defendant violated his agreement to deliver the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>broken shaft within a reasonable time, in consequence of which a delay occurred in supplying the new shaft, and plaintiff having no other, the mill necessarily remained idle,. and claim was made for the damages sustained from loss of profits incurred, from the mill standing idle for the period occasioned by the defendant\u2019s default.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The defendant, when contracting, knew of the mill standing idle, but not that the shaft he undertook to carry was to serve as a model fqr a new one.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The court held, that damages from the latter- cause could not be recovered ; that only such were recoverable as fairly entered into the minds of the parties, as naturally arising from a breach or which might reasonably have been in their contemplation when the contract was made as the probable result of its non-performance ; that in the absence of notice \"of the particular circumstances of the case, or that plaintiff did not have another shaft, or that the mill was in no other respect defective, nor delayed from any other cause, the loss of profits for the period claimed was not the proximate or necessary result of a breach \u00f3f the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">In <em>Hargous </em>agt. Ablon, (5 <em>Hill, </em>474), Judge Co wen, in illustrating this subject, says: \u201c Doctqr Franklin\u2019s case of the defective horse-shoe nail, which -resulted in the loss \u2022of the shoe, and thence in the loss of the horse, is an excellent lesson in private economy, but in an action against the farrier, it would not have done to have looked beyond-the loss of the shoe. To have charged him with accidental consequences, would have worked his ruin.\u201d \u201c Besides, such a rule would have put his fortune in the power of his employer who might- be careless of consequences, or even secretly aid in promoting them.\u201d |</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">So in the present case, the natural and ordinary damages \u25a0for breach of a general agreement to keep the premis\u00e9s in repair are the expenses of repair, are the expenses of. repair and the loss of the use of the premises, while the party contracting was in default or during the making of the' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>repairs <em>and it could not have </em>been contemplated that any special risk or accident resulting from any particular defect, or likely to occur from decay or want of repair in- any particular part of the premises, was con sidered; and least of all was it likely they anticipated or had in thought or design, that the tenant, with full knowledge of the rotten or unsafe condition of any part of the premises, would expose himself, his wife, children or servant to any danger that might be threatened, of which he had full knowledge, and might <em>avoid; </em>or that it was the intention of the agreement that he or any member of his family <em>should </em>be insured or indemnified against all possible contingencies or casualties resulting from want of perfect repair in every portion of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In <em>Darwin </em>agt. Potter, (5 <em>Denio, </em>306), the supreme court held that the landlord who had demised farming lands with barns thereon, was not liable to his tenant on failure to fulfil mch an agreement, for injury resulting to cows or young cattle; for increase of food, they required and decrease of their product, by reason of the state of the barns in question, but only for such sum as was necessary to place the barns in the condition in which they were to be put by the agreement, with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In <em>Walker </em>agt. <em>Swayzee, </em>(3 <em>Abb., </em>136), decided in 1856, it was announced as a doctrine of this court that the measure of damages in an action on such a covenant was <em>\u201c </em>the amount it would cost to make such repairs; and for the reason that the tenant cannot, by exposing himself, his family or his goods to the injuries or damage which result from the landlord\u2019s neglect, present a meritorious claim, when he could remedy the evil by repairs for which he would be fully indemnified out of the rental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">In <em>Beach </em>agt. <em>Crane, (2 Comst., </em>86), defendant had covenanted to erect and maintain a gate, between the public highway and plaintiff\u2019s land across, or over a private road granted him, and for default he was held liable for actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>injury occasioned by cattle coming on to the land, in consequence of the removal of the gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Here the erection .and maintenance of .the gate was specially contracted for, and its sole object was the protection of the land from such inroads of stray cattle from the highway, the damages were properly held to result as a direct consequence of the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In <em>Myers </em>agt. Beach, (39 <em>N. Y., </em>269), the tenant was held entitled to recover, on such a covenant, the-damages he had sustained from loss of the use of rooms in a hotel, caused by a defect in the flues of the chimney, while the landlord was in default; that the -right to damages was not confined to the mere cost of the repairs, but that those resulting from the loss of use of the rooms, after the landlord had been notified of the necessity of repairs, were both certain and proximate.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">In <em>Doupe </em>agt. Genin, (45 <em>N. Y., </em>119), the court of appeals held that in respect to the obligations to make repairs, there was no distinction in the respective duties of landlord and tenant of parts of tenement houses, from those imposed by law upon parties occupying the same relation as to entire premises or parcels of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">From these authorities it is clear, that the mere agreement of the landlord to repair, has reference only to the condition of the building or 'premises demised, for the purpose of their profitable use; and the pecuniary benefit to be derived from their enjoyment; or loss from being deprived of their use in such state of repair as the agreement intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Such a simple agreement or contract in no way contemplates any destruction of life or casualties to the person or property of any one, which might accidentally result from an omission to fulfil the agreement in every respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">The only case referred to, as arising upon such an obligation and supposed to maintain a contrary doctrine, is that of <em>Johnson </em>agt. Dixon, (1 <em>Daly, </em>178), decided in 1861,; by a divided court without allusion to the principles previously announced in <em>Walker </em>agt. <em>Sway zee, </em>(5 <em>Abb., </em>136).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>The majority of the court there held the owner of a stable, who had leased to the plaintiff the use of a horse-stall, was liable to his tenant for injury to a horse, resulting' from neglect to repair the floor of the stable after notice of its defective condition..</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The decision is not based upon any mere breach of agreement to repair, but as stated in the prevailing opinion, upon the \u201c wrongful act or default of the landlord himself resulting from- his promise, when informed of the fact, <em>\u2018 </em>to attend to it\u2019 and thereby preventing the horse from being withdrawn and the accident prevented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">It is assumed in the case that the repairs <em>\u201c </em>were necessary to be done, to make the stable secure and safe for the purpose for which it w\u00e1s used, and that as matter of fact, the (such) <em>\u201c </em>obligation rested on the defendant to do it.\u201d If any such agreement, as is last above stated, existed, within the principles of the-cases above cited, it warranted the judgment, as it was made with special reference to maintaining the stall in -a secure and safe condition, for the horse to occupy it, and, no contributive negligence on the part of the plaintiff being shown, the recovery of damages resulting from a breach of a stipulation, having reference to the safety of the horse occupying the stall, was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">This decision, on such facts, does not in any way impair or affect the law as previously announced in <em>Walker </em>agt. <em>Swayzee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">There are some cases in which additional damages, besides those allowed for breach of contract on the principles above stated, have been awarded, upon the ground of its.fraudulent violation (See <em>Dewitt </em>agt. <em>Wiltze, </em>9 <em>Wend., </em>325; as explained by <em>Judge </em>Cowen, in <em>Blanchard </em>agt. <em>Ely, 21 Wend., </em>350); <em>Sedg. on Dam., 5th Ed., 223, note i). </em>Little progress has, however been made in the introduction of this element as ground for awarding additional damages for non-performance of a contract, as against the well established and certain. rule for their assessment predicated upon' the immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>pecuniary profit or advantage that would have resulted to the party contracted with, if fulfiled according to its legal force and effect <em>(Sedg. on Dam., </em>203, 208, <em>marg.) </em>But for the proposition that a landlord under contract (generally) to keep the premises in repair is for breach, also further liable to his tenant as in tort for wilful refusal or neglect to perform his obligation. No warrant is to be found in principle or authority. His subsequent parol promise, after being notified of defects, to make the necessary repairs, unless founded on a new consideration, superadds nothing to his original obligation (Doupe. agt. <em>Genin, </em>37 <em>How., </em>5), and furnishes ho ground for awarding additional damages except so far as the tenant (the landlord not having actually commenced to make the repairs) is by such promise delayed and hindered, in making them (primarily) at his own expense.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>(Turner </em>agt. <em>McCarthy, </em>4 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>547).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">If the responsibility of the defendant, for the injury sustained by the plaintiff, is to be maintained, through force of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>subrogation to the benefits of her personal obligation to her tenant to make repairs, there is no foundation for this claim; since the general covenant or agreement to repair had no reference to such an accident. Neither the case stated in the complaint, nor that made by the proof, is based'upou any such obligation by way of contract, and the defendant must be held liable, if at all, in tort (as claimed in the complaint) upon some legal obligation or duty to the plaintiff outside of any such agreement. If the plaintiff, a stranger to the landlord\u2019s agreement to repair, can avail herself of its obligation (to which I \u25a0 do not assent) her rights under it cannot extend beyond those which it l\u00e9gally assured to the tenant; and as none would have been awarded to him, had he been the sufferer, in this case none can accrue to the plaintiff, claiming through or under- him.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\"><em>Secondly. </em>There is no evidence that the railing of the piazza, when the premises were leased to John Flynn (the father) was in a dangerous condition or threatened any injury to any one.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Its deterioration or dilapidation (so far as appears) arose several years after the letting, and from natural causes or through defects thereafter occurring from natural wear and decay. \u00ab \u2019\u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">. A claim cannot exist on the part on behalf of sufferers from such causes, in an action for tort or negligence against one whose only obligation exists in contract with the tenant in possession, and one can only be founded pn. some other negligence, trespass or wilful breach of a direct public or private duty to the party inj ured.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">In the present case, the defendant bad no relations with the plaintiff, either by contract, or public or private obligation in reference to this balcony or piazza, and owed no duty to her to keep and maintain its railing in a safe condition <em>(O'Brien </em>agt. <em>Capwell, </em>59 <em>Barb. </em>504).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">But, <em>Thirdly. </em>Even it any obligation existed on the part - of the defendant as landlady, growing out of her duty <em>sic </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>utere tuo ut alienum non leedas, </em>the case presented, is not one authorizing this recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The negligence of the parents, in suffering the plaintiff toj, wander upon this balcony, and exposing her to the danger| which they had for two years known and apprehended, wasj so gross and unambiguous, as to constitute contributive neg-' ligence, and should have prevented any recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">There was no contradiction or qualification to the force of the statements of plaintiff\u2019s parents and witnesses on her behalf, of their knowledge of the precarious condition of the balcony, or of their full apprehension of the hazard, to which any one was exposed by coming out upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"ApS\">Where danger of injury being inflicted is to be apprehended and conseqences to result from the act or default of a party is likely to be serious, the highest degree of precaution and vigilance must be exercised <em>(Kelsey </em>agt. <em>Barney, 12 N. Y.</em>425), and if through neglect of this duty, which the law imposes on the party injured, of making reasonable exertions to render the injury as light as possible, the damages are unnecessarily enlarged, the increased loss falls on him <em>(Hamilton </em>agt. <em>McPherson, </em>28 <em>N.Y., </em>72).</p>\n<p id=\"Ar8\">Possessing, as the parents of this child did, knowledge of the dangerous condition of this piazza, they do not appear to have taken any, or the slightest, precaution to keep it away from the danger, or to protect it from the known risk of playing or interfering with these insecure railings; but through forgetfulness or inattention of the mother it was allowed to stroll out, and expose itself to the apprehended calamity, and it suffered such consequences as might reasonably have been expected. To permit this child of two or three years of age to unconsciously rush into such a hazard, constituted gross negligence ; as much so, as if it had been suffered to remain unattended, .at an open window, which the landlord had neglected to supply with window sash, or other guards against it falling out of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">The undisputed facts constitute a clear cause of contrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>utory negligence on the part of the parents, in charge of a child too young to exercise discretion to avoid such a danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The rights of recovery of a child are controlled by the neglect of its parents, to the same extent as if it were capable of governing its own conduct, and had been equally neglectful <em>(Sher. &amp; Red. on </em>Negligence, \u00a7\u00a7 66, 37, 48; <em>Honegsberger </em>agt. <em>Second Av. R.R. Co., </em>in court of appeals 33 <em>How., </em>193, overruling <em>S. C., </em>1 <em>Daly,, </em>89).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The injury arose from no. culpable or aggressive act of the defendant, but could at most be claimed to have happened (remotely) through her breach of contract with another.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Under these circumstances the motion to dismiss the com plaint should have been granted; and as well on that account, as for the absence of any legal responsibility on the part of the defendant for the matters complained of, the judgment should be reversed. '</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">I concur, R. L. Labbemobe,</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Daly, Ch. J., dissenting.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-6\">VBat it is presumed that this case was decided (and perhaps properly so) on the ground of contributive negligence on the part of the plaintiff*.\u2014Rep.Note. It would seem that notice of the breach of the contract to repair and the dangerous condition of the premises would be a sufficient consideration for the parol promise to repair the dilapidated premises ; and that the landlord\u2019s neglect to fulfil his promise and make such repairs after such notice, constituted gross negligence. The tenant, it is true, might, on giving the landlord proper notice to repair in a specified time, make the repairs at his own expense and deduct it from the amount of the rent, but he was not obliged to do so, and it-ia always a hazardous business for the tenant, at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">It is said that the promise of the landlord <em>to </em>repair, after notice from the tenant, of the defects superadds nothing to his original, obligation; it may be that it adds nothing to the original covenant to repair, but the non-fulfillment of the promise adds the very important element of negligence to the landlord's liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">It is also said that a claim cannot exist on the part and behalf of sufferers from such dilapidated premises, in an action for tort or negligence, against one whose only obligation exists in contract with the tenant in possession; this may be true, but when, as in this case, there is added to such obligatory contract, negligence, upon which the action is founded, it creates an additional obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">If it is intended to be held that in no event can negligence be predicated of a promise of the landlord to repair, then there ought to have been a nonsuit iu this case, as the action was wrongly brought for negligence. If the action is properly brought, founded on negligence, there would seem to be no difficulty in recovering damages, remote and consequential as well as immediate and proximate.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">Bat it is presumed that this case was decided (and perhaps properly so) on the ground of contributive negligence on the part of the plaintiff*.\u2014Rep.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
