A contract which has a penalty affixed by statute, is, of course, void; but the invalidity of a contract so prohibited does not impair a contract founded upon a new consideration and otherwise valid, <em>collateral to the void contract, </em>but not depending upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiA\">\u201c The test, whether a demand connected with an illegal transaction, is capable of being enforced at law, is whether the plaintiff requires any aid from the illegal transaction to establish his case\u201d <em>(Chitty on Contracts, Springfield ed., </em>657, <em>and cases cited).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-8\">The rule is thus stated by Chitty, in <em>Fergusson </em>agt. <em>Norman, </em>(6 <em>Scott, </em>794.), Tindal, <em>Ch.

III. ch., 89, requires under a penalty of \u00bf\u00a310, that the pawnbroker\u2019s names and business shall be painted over his door; suppose this were altogether omitted or incorrectly done, the party would be liable for the penalty <em>; </em>but it could scarcely be contended that all contracts entered into by him as pawnbroker would, therefore, be avoided\u201d <em>(Chitty on Contracts, </em>697).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-9\">The case here put by Tindal, <em>Ch. J., </em>is precisely analogous to the case at bar, and the claim of the defendants is exactly the one condemned by him. Although the plaintiffs may be liable to the penalty prescribed by statute for doing business under a firm name forbidden by statute, the contracts of such firm are not, therefore, void for illegality.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>This distinction is also clearly expressed in <em>Story on Contracts, 3d ed., </em>649, \u00a7 621, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-5\">\u201c A distinction is to be observed between cases where the contract is directly in violation of the statute, and cases where it is collaterally connected with some incidental illegality not contemplated in its terms. If the illegality do not form a portion of the contract, but be entirely collateral and capable of complete separation therefrom, it will be binding.\u2019\u2019 On this point is cited the case of <em>Johnson </em>agt. <em>Hudson, </em>(11 <em>East., </em>ISO), where a vender of tobacco failed to comply with the statute regulations requiring a license.

No </em>person shall hereafter transact business in the name of a partner not interested in his firm, and where the designation <em>11 </em>and Company,\u201d or \u201c &amp; Co.\u201d is used, it shall represent an actual partner or partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Section 2. Any person offending against the provisions of this act, shall, upon conviction thereof, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The act is entitled <em>u </em>an act to prevent persons from- transacting business under fictitious names.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Literally, the statute prohibits the transaction of business in the name of a partner not interested in the firm, and requires that the designation \u201cand Company,\u201d or <em>u </em>and Co,\u201d shall represent an actual partner. A violation of the statute is deemed, upon conviction, a misdemeanor punishable by fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">The prohibition does not, nor does the penalty, in terms apply to contracts made by such firms, and does not, therefore, in terms declare such contracts void, but the act makes it unlawful for any person or persons to transact business by, or in the name of, a fictitious firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">The answer alleges that the contract, upon which the! cause of action arose, was made by the plaintiff, in carrying on and transacting business under the firm name of <em>\u201c </em>Swords, Betty &amp; Co.,\u201d and that the addition of \u201c &amp; Co.\u201d did not then represent an actual partner; and the allegation is admitted by the demurrer to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">The contract, then, was made by a person \u2022while unlawfully using a prohibited style, the using of which was a criminal offense, punishable by fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">It is not necessary that a penal statute should contain prohibitory words. A penalty implies a prohibition, and every act done against it, is not only illegal, but absolutely void <em>(Hallett </em>agt. <em>Novion, </em>14 <em>J.

The action was upon a check which had been discounted by an unauthorized banking association; and the court held the transaction void under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">Judge Nelson, in referring to the proposition that the penalty was the only consequence of a violation of the act, says, <em>\u201c </em>there is no distinction between an act <em>malum prohibitum </em>and <em>malum in se. </em>Both are equally forbidden and unlawful, and I will add, both are immoral, and cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the foundation of a civil right, that will be enforced in a court of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In <em>Griffith </em>agt. <em>Wells, </em>(3 Denio, 226), the action was to recover for liquor sold by a person not having a license. The act of the legislature did not, in terms, prohibit the sale of liquors without a license, nor declare the act illegal. It .only inflicted a penalty upon the offender. But the court held the contract to be illegal, add no action would lie to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">An analagous case was decided in the N. Y. common pitas <em>(Ferdon </em>agt. <em>Cunningham, </em>20 <em>How., </em>154), where a contract for service by a public cartman, was held to be void, the cartman not having a license, as required by a city ordinance, which merely affixed a- penalty for keeping or using a public cart, without first obtaining a license therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\"><em>Best </em>agt. <em>Bauder </em>(29 <em>How., </em>489), although only a sp\u00e9cial term decision, is strongly ' in point. The action was for goods sold. The defense was, that the seller was engaged in the business of peddling, without a license, in violation of the revenue laws of the United States. The court overruled a demurrer to the defense, holding that the penalty in the act implied a prohibition, rendering the contract of sale void. In that case, the distinction which is suggested in some of the cases <em>(Griffith </em>agt. <em>Wells, supra, </em>and <em>Bell </em>agt. <em>Quinn, </em>2 <em>Sandf., </em>150), between a license for revenue only, and such as have in view the. protection of health or morals, or the prevention of fraud, is repudiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">In <em>Hoyt </em>agt. <em>Allen, </em>(2 <em>Hill, </em>322), although the decision was as to the sufficiency of the pleading, there is an intimation which, taken in connection with the reporter\u2019s note, sustains the principle of all the foregoing cases. And the principle is further supported by the case of the <em>U. S. Bank </em>agt. <em>Owens, </em>(2 <em>Peters, </em>527), where a contract was held void as being in violation of the charter of the bank, forbidding the taking of more than six per cent, interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Under the authority of the cases cited, we must hold the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>transaction set forth in the complaint to be illegal and void, and not enforceable in the court of justice; and, therefore, that the matter set up in the answer, constitutes a defense to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">It is impossible, I think, to apply the distinction in this case, claimed by the respondent\u2019s counsel, that this is a mere collateral transaction, not connected with, but remote from, the prohibited act. Such distinction clearly defined in the cases he has referred to where it is held, that if the illegality does not form any portion of the contract, but is merely eollatteral, and capable of complete separation from it, the contract is binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The distinction, however, cannot be made available in this case. Tqe illegal act is the transacting of business. Business cannot be transacted except by and under contracts express or implied, executory or completed. Every executory contract made in transacting business, must, necessarily, therefore, be void under the prohibition against transacting business, under a fictitious firm name. Any other application of the statute would render it wholly ineffective, as the design of the legislature as expressed in the title of the act, was, to prevent persons from transacting business.under fictitious names.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In their complaint the plaintiffs aver, that at the time they made the contract with the defendant, they were doing business under the firm name of \u201c Swords,. Betty &amp; Co.,\u201d and the answer alleges that the transaction was made with the plaintiffs, while unlawfully transacting business under such fictitious firm name.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">These several allegations, are, in my opinion, sufficient to bring the case within the provisions of the statute prohibiting the transacting of business in the name of a partner not interested in the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
