Vann, <em>for defendant.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b223-14\">Hardin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay\">\u2014Prior to the adoption of the Code in 1848, bills of discovery were allowed to obtain evidence in aid of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>actions at law <em>(Lansing </em>agt. <em>Starr, 2 Johns. Ch., </em>150 ; <em>Deas </em>agt. <em>Harvey, 2 Barb. Ch., </em>448; <em>Lane </em>agt. <em>Stebbins, </em>9 <em>Paige, </em>622).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">This practice was abolished and prohibited by section 389 of the Code ;6 and by section 388 the method provided for searching documentary evidence was provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u2022 Section 390 provides that, \u201c a party to an action may be examined as a witness * * * and subject to the same rules of examination as any other witness to testify either at \u25a0the trial, or conditionally, or upon commission ;\u201d and by section 392, it is provided that the examination \u201cmay be read by either party on the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">. I think the important question before the court, if the party is examined in court, or before the judge, if examined out of court, is as to the materiality of the proposed evidence. If -the proposed evidence relates to any of the issues raised by the pleadings, then, I am of the opinion, that it is the duty of the court to receive the evidence, (subject to its discretion- as to the order), and if the examination is before a judge, then it is his duty only to determine, whether the proposed evidence relates to any of the* material issues involved in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">By reference to <em>Bell </em>agt. <em>Richmond, </em>(50 <em>Barb., </em>571), it will be observed that it has been held by the general-term in the third district, that a party cannot be examined under these sections, before issue is joined; and in the opinion given in that case, it was remarked \u201cthat witnesses are always to be examined on matters pertinent to the issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">This last case is in accordance with <em>Cook </em>agt. <em>Bidwell, </em>(29 <em>How., </em>483), in which the court say that, \u201cthe examination cannot be had except in an action after issue, and as to matters pertinent to the issue\u201d <em>(Same Case, </em>17 <em>Abb., </em>300).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">That the party is to appear and testify, and be subjected to the same-rules of examination as any other witness has been adjudged so often,.that it is not now ah open question. As early as <em>Bonesteel </em>agt. <em>Lynde, </em>(8 <em>How., </em>226, 233), Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Wells, said of section 390, that it, \u201c in terms, declares that he may be compelled to testify the same as any' .other witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\"><em>u </em>To testify is to give evidence, and the reasonable and just interpretation of the word requires that he give evidence in the same manner as other witnesses are bound to do.\u201d This opinion was affirmed at general term in 8 <em>How., </em>352. And in giving \"effect to a party\u2019s testimony, the same rules apply as to any other witness (See opinion of Barculo, J., in <em>Roberts </em>agt. <em>Gee, </em>15 <em>Barb., </em>450).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The question presented relates to the power of the county judge to compel the defendant to answer questions which relate confessedly to the issues involved, and I have no doubt but the power is vested, and that it will be properly exercised in this case, and that it is the duty of the defendant to answer any and all questions which the county judge shall determine relate to the issues raised by the pleadings in this action (16 <em>Abb., </em>188 ; 32 <em>N. Y., </em>127).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">I see no errors in the rulings of the county judge, and the witness will, therefore, be recalled, and the examination may continue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
