The steamer Patapsco* a vessel owned or chartered by the Commercial Steamboat Company, a corporation incorporated by the laws of Rhode Island, was engaged in making weekly trips between New York and Baltimore in a line with other vessels belonging to the company.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b305-7\">On each occasion that she started from Baltimore the agent of the company gave written requisitions to Mr. Boyce, a coal miner, who had extensive coal depots at Baltimore, to deliver on board of the steamer (by name) various quantities of coal. Mr. Boyce ou receiving the above requisitions gave written orders to his agents to deliver on board of the steamer (by name) the same quantities.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b305-8\">The coal was necessary, indeed indispensible to enable the steamer to make her various voyages. To save useless accumulation of bills, Mr. Boyce tendered one general bill each month to the company (by name) making them debtor to the various accounts. The steamer had no funds to pay for the coal and the company were in an embarrassed state which shortly thereafter resulted in total bankruptcy.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b305-9\">On a libel filed <em>in rem </em>by Mr. Boyce against one of the steamships for coal used, it was <em>held </em>by the United States district court of New York, (Shipman, <em>D. J~.) </em>that he had no lien on the steamship for the coal. The United States circuit court, (Nelson, C.\u00ab/\".,) reversed the district and <em>held </em>that he had and the supreme court now affirm the circuit court holding:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b305-10\">1. That it appearing that the Patapsco was in a foreign port and that the coal was ordered for her <em>specifically \"by name </em>and delivered to the officers in charge of her; that the codl was necessary, in such a case the inference is that the credit was given to the vessel, unless it can be inferred that the master had funds* or the owners had credit and that the maierial man knew of this, or knew of such facts as should have put him on inquiry.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b305-11\">2.

When the libellant waived his privilege of cash on delivery and put the coal on board of the steamship, the presumption of law would be that he thereby gave credit to the steamship and not to the owners thereof, inasmuch as tije supplies were furnished in a foreign port.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b305-14\">5.

S. district court for the southern district of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-9\">In the district court below, the libellant, a resident of Baltimore, had filed his libel and arrested the Patapsco, a vessel owned or chartered by the Commercial Steamboat Company, a corporation incorporated by the laws of the state of Rhode Island, for coal furnished the said steamboat at Baltimore, in February and .March, 1866, to enable her to make her trips between Baltimore and New York, between which ports she was running, under a charter to and in the line of the said company. At that time the title to the vessel was registered in the N, Y. Custom House, in the individual name of Bacon, who was president of the company, and. a resident of New York, and so remained until April 2, 1866,' (but she was controled solely by the company, on or about which date a bill of sale of her was executed by Bacon to the present claimant, Borland, also a resident of New York; the bill of sale expressing a consideration of $15,000, but as appears by a letter dated April 27, 1866, written by Borland to the libellant, the actual consideration was a claim whichBorland held on the vessel amounting to $10,500, and in practical effect he only held the title as security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-10\">. The proofs in the district court below, also established-that the supplies in question consisted of six separate deliveries of bituminous coal by the appellant, on board of the Patapsco, on the following dates, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>1866, Feb, 3\u201440 tons 7 10 Tfl GO CM 00 <em>u </em>\u00cd\u00cd 10\u201441 <em>u </em>7 10 291 10 <em>u u </em>17\u201450 <em>u </em>7 10 355 00 <em>ti u </em>26\u201450 <em>u </em>7 00 350 00 <em>a </em>Mch. 14\u201425 <em>a </em>6 50 162 50 <em>a u </em>24\u201442 <em>a </em>6 50 213 00 $1,715 60</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-5\">It also established that the said supplies were used in the service of the vessel to enable her to make her trips in the line, and were, therefore, necessaries. That at the time the said coal was furnished, the owners of said vessel, the Commercial Steamboat Company, had no other coal at Baltimore, (the port of supply), by which the vessel in question, the Patapsco, could have been supplied for her said trips independent of the coal purchased of Mr. Boyce. And during February and March, 1866, the owners purchased coal of no other person for the said vessel than of Mr. Boyce.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-6\">The proofs in the district court below, also established that the supplies in question were ordered by the owners of the line, through their Baltimore agent who had authority for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-7\">\u2022 The course of dealing was as follows, viz: the engineers of the different steamships of the company, on their arrival at Baltimore, reported to the agent of the company, what coal or supplies they needed for the particular vessel, whereupon he filled up a printed circular directed to Mr. Boyce (or his deputy did so in his, the agent\u2019s, name), to furnish steamship Patapsco, or whichever one -it might be, so many tons of soft coal at the time when same was needed, and send invoice therefor. Mr. Boyce then filled up a printed order, in substance directing his agent, to deliver on board steamship Patapsco, so many tons of bitumious coal. On receipt of that order the coal was so delivered on board of the steamship, and vouchers for such delivery taken. At the end of the month a bill was made out of all the deliveries for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>month to the Commercial Steamboat Company, in which the coal delivered during the month is charged to each steamboat, and the bills of coal collected. The object of making out a general bill in that form each month was, as testified to, to save. useless accumulation of bills, and for sake of convenience.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-5\">The libellant also gave evidence that the coal was sold at the lowest cash price, and that the only credit given was the waiver of the cash on delivery, and rendition of a general bill at the end of the month. ^</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-6\">The libellant further gave evidence to show that at the time the coal was sold and delivered by Boyce to the steamship^ the company was more or less pecuniarily embarrassed in Baltimore, and that Mr. Boyce knew it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIG\">This was contested by the claimants, however.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-8\">The claimants called for the libellant\u2019s journals and ledgers\u2019, but did not call for', his books of orignal entries. The entries affecting those items of accounts are quoted in Justice Davis\u2019s opinion hereafter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-9\">The libellant further j&gt;roved that prior to February, 1866, the Commercial Steamboat Company were compelled to give mortgages on their steamships to the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, on the 6th day of February, 1866, to secure $45,000, the amount of freights. All of this coal was sold after that date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-10\">The libellant further proved, that on the 10th April, 1866, the property of \u25a0 the company, including its steamships (but not the Patapsco), were attached on claims amounting to $132,000 and upwards, in existence in and prior to February, 1866, many of which attachments were for \u25a0mechanics\u2019 liens <em>in rem., </em>and they were finally sold on the 30th June, 1866, and brought not enough to pay those attachments ; and since January, 1866, not a dollar of principal or dividend has ever been paid on the capital stock of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The cause was argued before the district court of the U.

The question in dispute is whether it was furnished on the credit of the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">The steamer was owned by John R. Bacon, at the time the article was furnished, but was running in a line owned by the Commercial Steamboat Company, a corporation chartered by the legislature of Rhode Island. This company had an office in New York, and ran their boat between that city and Baltimore. They had exclusive control of the Patapsco as well as other boats of their line, and must be deemed, for the time owners <em>pro hoc vice. </em>\u2022 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">This company had an agent in Baltimore, who attended tq their business there, including the purchase of the necessary supplies for the steamers which were required at that port.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">The steamers, several in number, had been running on this line for several months and the- agent had been in the habit of purchasing coal for them of different parties, and among others of this libellant. The amount of coal required for each vessel from time to time was ordered by the company\u2019s agent, in writing, the order in each instance designa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>ting to which ship the amount called for was to be delivered. The sales were considered to be cash, but payment on delivery was waived and the bills presented monthly, to the company\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">This was done as a matter of convenience and to avoid the multiplication of bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Purchases of coal had been made of the libellant from time to time, from December 1865 down to March 24, 1866, the date of the last charge in the account upon which this suit is brought. They were all paid by the agent up to February 1. The bills were made out to the Commercial Steamboat Company, but designating the name of the ship to which each parcel was delivered. That delivered in February and March was not paid for, and the libellant seeks to charge the ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Now, in order to do this, the libellant must prove that this coal was furnished on the credit of the ship, and that there was an apparent necessity for resorting to that credit. I think the proof fails on both these-points. The libellant dealt not with the master of the vessel, but with the accredited agent of the company, resident in Baltimore. I think that it is clear, that he looked to the company generally and not to the particular ship for his pay. Again, there is no satisfactory proof of a necessity apparent at the time for resorting to the credit of the ship. There is proof that the affairs of the company were, in fact, in a state' of embarrassment, and approaching the crisis of insolvency. But the proof fails to show that they had not sufficient credit in Baltimore to obtain supplies required for their ships at that port.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">That fact must be clearly proved before this court can assume, that the credit of each ship was or could be resorted to in order to obtain the supplies furnished to such vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The facts in this case, if not exactly the reverse, fall far short of those in the case of <em>Ross </em>agt. <em>The Steamboat Neversink, </em>where I held the boat liable.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b311-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Dennis McMahon, <em>for the libellant, and </em>Charles Donahue, <em>for the claimant.</em></attorneys>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">As I discussed the general question of law involved upon principle and authority in the latter case, I do not feel called upon to repeat or enlarge upon that discussion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Let an order be entered dismissing the libel, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">From that decree the libellant took an appeal to the circuit court, and the cause was heard before his honor Samuel Nelson, associate justice, and was argued by</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">After advisement Justice Nelson, reversed the district court, and decreed in favor of the libellant, giving the following opinion:</p>\n<author id=\"b311-9\">Nelson, <em>C. J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AeX\">\u2014The bill in this case was filed to recover ' for supplies of coal furnished in the months of February and March, 1866, at Baltimore, to the steamship Patapsco. The only question in the case is, whether or not the coal was furnished on the credit of the.vessel, or of the owners, The Commercial Steamboat Company, which ran a line of steamers from the city of New York to Baltimore, and occasionally from thence to Charleston. The arrangement was, that the coal should be furnished on the requisition of the engineers of the vessel for cash, but for convenience in making out the bills and transacting the business, they were made out against the vessel once a month and presented for payment. The weight of the evidence is, that Boyce in this arrangement, and time taken to make out and present the bills, looked to the vessel as security in the meantime for the payment of them, and did not intend, thereby to rely on the credit of the company.- The company was a corporation under the laws of the state of Rhode Island, and, of course, not accessible to him, a resident doing business in Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">The company had not long been engaged in running this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>line of steamers, and had no established credit in that city, and in the months of February and March, when the present supplies were furnished, its credit was not good.

In the case of <em>Pratt </em>agt. <em>Reed, </em>(19 <em>How., U.

We submit, that where the libellant who furnishes the goods is personally examined, no such presumption can be inferred when he does not state or claim that he trusted the credit of the vessel, or that he dealt on her credit.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b313-6\">It is a good and reasonable presumption, that when the libellant\u2019s mouth is shut to presume a credit, but when he is examined no presumption should be made.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b313-7\">III. But whatever presumption is to be drawn from the facts required to make such lien, no such presumption exists here; but the contrary is shown:</summary>\n<summary id=\"b313-8\">ls\u00bf.

The libellant having proven a sale and delivery of coal on board of a steamship, used by it in its navigation in a foreign port, ordered by the owners\u2019 agent, the presumption of law would be that the goods were purchased on the credit of the steamship itself, and the claimants must displace that presumption (See Judge Taney\u2019s remarks in <em>Thomas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>agt. <em>Osborne, </em>19 <em>How.

Where the owners of a steamboat need coal for their steamboats, and have no coal on hand for their boats, but actually buy same at the lowest cash price in a foreign port, the presumption of law would be that they had no credit to. buy it on their own responsibility otherwise than for cash. If the material man waives the preliminary, cash on delivery, the presumption of law is that he does not do it on the exclusive credit of the buyer, but rather on the credit of the ship to which it was delivered in a foreign port <em>(The Sea Lark, Sprague's decisions, </em>573). There is nothing in the. recent case of <em>Bratt. </em>agt. <em>Reed, </em>to disturb the old doctrine\u2014 <em>u </em>tacit lien arises when the circumstances necessary to create it qxist.\u201d</summary>\n<summary id=\"b314-6\">III.

The claimants rely on the entiy in the libellant\u2019s ledger and the journal entries, as conclusive evidence that the credit for the supplies in question were given to the. Commercial Steamboat Company. The original entries in the day-book were not called for by the claimants, but from the journal entries, it is apparent that the day-book entries which are thus journalized were debited to each steamer by name.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b314-8\">Entries in books are always explainable. The truth of the transaction can be shown, independent of the entry. In face of the orders of the goods for the Patapsco by name, and in face of the deliveries on that steamer itself, and of the rendition of bills aggregating the different deliveries to the several steamers by name, and of the evidence proving a delivery on the faith of the implied hypothecation of the Patapsco, the mere entries in the journal and ledger, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>are not the originals, ought not to weigh much on the subject of a personal credit. 'Even the taking of the company\u2019s note would not create a presumption that the credit was personal, and would not displace a <em>bona fide </em>lien if the note were surrendered at the trial <em>(The </em>Guy, 9 <em>Wallace, </em>758; <em>The Kalorama, </em>10. <em>Wallace, </em>204).</summary>\n<summary id=\"b315-5\">Nor ought such charges in the books possess as much weight on the subject o\u00ed a personal credit, as the fact that the material man had commenced a common law action for the claim. Yet, in the <em>Kalorama </em>(10 <em>Wall., </em>204) such suit <em>in \u00a1personam </em>in a state court was held not to be conclusive against a lien <em>in rem.</em></summary>\n<summary id=\"b315-6\">V. To displace the lien, the onus is thrown on the claimant to establish that the sale and \u25a0 delivery of the coal in question was on the exclusive credit of the Commercial Steamboat Company <em>(The Lulu, </em>10 <em>Wall., </em>192).</summary>\n<summary id=\"b315-7\">This the facts rebut.</summary>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Mr. Justice DaviS delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Boyce, a coal dealer in Baltimore, filed a libel against the steamer Patapsco, in the district court at New York, to recover a demand for six separate supplies of coal, furnished between the 3d o\u00ed February and the 26th of March, 1866, to the steamer Patapsco.- One Borland intervened as claimant. The question was whether the coal had been furnished on the credit of the vessel or on that of her owners only t</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The facts as we assume them from the weight of the evidence, itself somewhat inconsistent, were thus: The Commercial Steamboat Company, a corporation of\" Rhode Island, owned and chartered certain steamers, the Kingfisher, &amp;c., and used them as a line of steamers from New York to Baltimore.' The Patapsco was chartered by the company to run on the line, and registered at New York in the individual name of one Bacon, president of the company; though the company controlled her. The company had an agent at Baltimore, and the course of dealing was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>When the steamers would arive at Baltimore, their engineers would inform this agent \u00f3f the amount of coal they needed for their different vessels. Thereupon, the agent would fill up a printed circular directed to Boyce, requesting to furnish <em>u </em>with invoice,\u201d to that steamer, by name, (in this case the Patapsco), so many tons. of coal; saying nothing about charging anybody. Boyce would then fill up a printednorder to his clerk, directing him to furnish the coal, to the steamer named. On receipt of this latter order, the coal would be delivered on board the steamer. At the end of a month a bill would be made of all the deliverances to all the boats. The object of making out a general bill at the end of eaeh month, it appears, was to avoid a multiplication of bills and for the sake of convenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The entries in the libellant\u2019s journal were thus\u2014one example showing all:</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Baltimore, March, 1866.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Commercial St\u2019b\u2019t.

the production of it, and the bills rendered to the company were not produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The coal was sold at the lowest price, and it was necessary for the Patapsco to make her trips, and was used by her in making them. The agent of the steamship Company stated that \u201c the coal bought for the Patapsco was ordered for this steamer expressly, but on account of the Commercial Steamship Company, the same as all coal was ordered and bought for the several steamers constituting the line.\u201d <em>\u201c </em>The owners or charterers,\u201d he added \u201c were not known in the transaction, but the steamer was supposed to belong to the Commercial Steamboat Company by the parties who furnished the coal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">During the whole time that this coal was furnished, the steamboat company was in an embarrassed state. And on the 3d of February, on which day the first item of the coal for which the steamer was libelled, was furnished, the steamship company executed six promissory notes for $7,500 each, $45,000 in all, to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company; following them immediately, and by the 6th, by mortgages on three of their steamers to secure payment. \" And it owed a balance of $25,800 to the Neptune Steamboat Company on the 1st of February, 1866, so much remaining due for money laid out, paid, or advanced in the preceding year.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">On the 2d of April, 1866, nine days after the last item of coal furnished to the Patapsco, the registered owner, Bacon, executed a bill of sale of her to Borland, already mentioned as the claimant in the case, to secure to him a debt of $10,500. And on the 10th following, the company failed entirely; the failure being followed by attachments to a very large amount, much of it, like the $25,800 already mentioned, for money lent, or debts due, prior to the 3d February, 1866 ; and the result being a general break up of the company in which the creditors got but a small portion of their claim from the whole effects,of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>It was in virtue of his bill of sale above mentioned that Borland contested the libellant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AZb\">The district court dismissed the <em>libel; </em>holding that there was no credit to the vessel. The circuit court, on appeal, held that there was, and reversed the decree. From, this reversal Borland appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Whether the coal was furnished on the credit of the vessel, of of the owners is the only point of inquiry in this case. The case itself is not without its embarrassments, for the evidence, in some of its aspects, is not consistent with either theory, but the weight of it, in our opinion, enables us to assert the lien against the ship. It is undisputed that the Patapsco was m a foreign port, and that the coal was ordered for her, specifically by name, and delivered to the officers in charge of her. It is equally free from dispute that the supply of coal was necessary\u2014indeed, indispensable\u2014to enable her to make her voyage at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">In such a case the inference is, that the credit was given to the vessel, unless it can be inferred that the master liad funds, or the owners had credit, and that the material man knew of this,' or knew such facts as should have put him on inquiry <em>(The Lulu, </em>10 <em>Wall., </em>192). There is no reason to \u25a0suppose that the master had funds, or the owners of the line credit, nor that the libellant was guilty of laches. On the contrary, it is'in proof that the company which owned the line of steamships was, at the date of these transactions hopelessly insolvent and were borrowing large sums of money on a mortgage of their steamers, away from home, and in the very city where the libellant resided. It would be strange if the libellant did not know this condition of things, and, in the absence of proof on the subject, it is a reasonable inference that he did. If he had this knowledge it would be a violent presumption to suppose that he relied on the credit of the company at all for the supplies which he furnished. The company running the steamers was a distant corporation, of no established name, and without personal liability in case-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>the enterprise recently undertaken should prove a failure, and it is hard to believe that a large and intelligent coal merchant in Baltimore, in dealing with this corporation, intended to renounce his claim against the steamers in case he was not paid. It is very clear that there was no credit to the company at the time of sale, because the coal was sold for cash at the lowest market price. And when the libellant waived his privilege of cash on delivery, and put the coal on board the steamship, the presumption of law would be that he thereby gave credit to the steamship and not to the owners thereof, inasmuch as the supplies were furnished in a foreign port. If the credit was to the vessel there is a lien, and the burden of displacing it is on the claimant. He must show, affirmatively, that the .credit was given to the company to ihe exclusion of credit to the vessel. This he seeks to do by the form of charge in the libellant\u2019s journal and ledger. If it be conceded that these entries tend to support this position, they are far from being conclusive evidence on the subject. Entries' in books are always explainable, and the truth\u2019of the transaction can be shown independent of them. The form of charge in any book -of original entries does not appear, as the day-book was not called for by the claimants, nor are the <em>u </em>invoices\u201d which the libellant was directed to furnish with the coal produced. .</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">But, from the form of entry in the journal itself (where the amount furnished to each vessel is set opposite to its name), we are led to the conclusion that the day-book entries which are thus journalized were debited to each steamer by name.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ-\">If this be so, the journal entries are not inconsistent with the idea of the credit being given on the security of the ship. More especially is this apparent when it is proven that the reason why monthly accounts were made to the steamboat company in bulk was for the sake of convenience, and. to save a useless accumulation of bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">There is nothing besides this journal entry to indicate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>the coal was furnished on the personal credit of the company; and, as the other facts in the case are in favor of a charge direct to the steamship, we do not think the legal inference o\u00ed credit to the ship is removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The lien of material men for supplies in - a foreign- port is of so high a character that, in the case of <em>The St Jago de Cuba, </em>(9 <em>Wheat), </em>it was protected, along with that of seamen\u2019s wages, against a forfeiture which had accrued to the United States ; and the recent decisions in this court have had the effect to place this lien on a more substantial footing than some previous cases had seemed to have left it (Grape<em>shot, </em>9 <em>Wall., </em>129; 10 <em>Wall., </em>192, 204.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">On the whole, while we concede, that the case is not free from difficulty, we are not disposed to disturb the decree of the circuit court, in any particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
