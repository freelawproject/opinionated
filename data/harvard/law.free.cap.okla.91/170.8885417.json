The court permitted the defendant to testify, over the objections of the plaintiff, that it was orally agreed between the parties that if the defendant did not sell as many as four churns a month the defendant would not he required to pay the notes. The plaintiff offered the deposition of the president and general manager of the plaintiff company, who made the contract with the defendant, in which he testified: \u201cThere was absolutely no understanding or agreement between us other than that em-bodied in- the- written contract.\u201d This answer, upon the objection of the defendant, was excluded. No reason for the objection was pointed out by the defendant and none assigned by the court for the exclusion of this answer. The court gave this instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">\u201cYou are instructed that) if you find from the testimony in this case that the defendant could not, by reasonable diligence and effort, sell four churns per month, then you will return a verdict for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">These rulings and instructions of the court Iwere so palpably erroneous that, in view of the fact that no brief has been filed by the defendant, although served with a copy of the plaintiff in error\u2019s brief on. the 10th day of March of this year, we will not search for authorities to sustain the views here expressed. Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">By the Court: It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
