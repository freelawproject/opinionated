The records off the clerk\u2019s office show that the case-made was withdrawn by the attorneys for plaintiff in error for the purpose of preparing their brief in the case, and that the same has never been returned to the clerk\u2019s office, although frequent demand has been made therefor. Brief of plaintiff in error, however, shows that this proceeding assails the decree of divorce as well as that portion relating to custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-20\">Defendant in error has filed a motion to-dismiss this appeal upon two grounds, as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-21\">First: The clerk\u2019s records show that this case was filed on March 2, 1920, more than four months after the entry of judgment, and therefore this court is without jurisdiction to-hear and determine the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-22\">Second: Because plaintiff in error neglect- \u25a0 ed to give notice within ten days, as provided by law, of intention to appeal and therefore this court is without' jurisdiction in the premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-23\">This motion to dismiss was filed April 23, 1923, -accompanied by proof of service thereof, -and no .response has1 been filed thereto. On May TO, 1923, an amended motion to dismiss was filed, having attached thereto as-an exhibit a certified copy of the journal entry of the order of the district court of Woodward county, Okla., overruling the motion off plaintiff in error for a new trial therein, and said exhibit shows that said order was made- and entered on October 31, 1919. Proof off mailing of this amended motion to dismiss-accompanied said amended motion, and no response has been filed thereto.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-24\">\u201cEvidence dehors the record to establish certain facts affecting proceedings on appeal is admissible in an appellate court; and the admission of such evidence, when uncontro-verted, is not an assumption of- original jurisdiction.\u201d Barnes et al. v. Lynch et al., 9 Okla. 11, 59 Pac. 995.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-25\">It -appears by an examination of the motion to dismiss and the amended motion, that judgment in this action was rendered October 22, 1919, that motion for new trial was overruled October 31, 1919, and that the petition in error with ease-made was filed in this court on March 2, 1920, more than four months -after the rendition of said judgment.. It further appears by the motion to dismiss that no written notice of intention to appeal was filed in the office of the court clerk of Woodward county, Okla., within ten days after the rendition of such judgment, and no response having been filed to said motion or amended motion to dismiss, in the absence of the record, this court will consider-the allegations of said motion and amended motion to dismiss as confessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Both the written notice of intention to appeal and the perfecting of such appeal within four months from the rendition of a de-cree in a divorce action are jurisdictional. Linkugel v. Linkugel, 74 Oklahoma, 183 Pac. 55; Milam v. Milam, 76 Okla. 62, 184 Pac. 442; Rogers v. Rogers, 38 Okla. 195, 132 Pac. 476; Orcutt v. Orcutt, 25 Okla. 855, 108 Pac. 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\">For the reasons stated, and upon the authorities above cited, the appeal herein should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">By the Court: It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
