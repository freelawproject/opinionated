The record of this court does not show any extension, of time granted to the defendant for filing such brief, nor any application therefor. It is a well-established rule of this court that it is not required to search the record to find some theory upon which the judgment of the trial court may be sustained. Under the circumstances stated, where the brief filed by the plaintiff reasonably sustains-the assignments of ex*ror contained in the petition in error, the judgment will be reversed in'accordance with the prayer of the petition in error. Frost v. Haley, 63 Okla. 19, 161 Pac. 1174; Security Ins. Co. v. Droke, 40 Okla. 116; 136 Pac. 430; J. Rosenbaum Grain Co. v.

Ballard, 41 Okla. 553, 139 Pac. 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-18\">After a careful examination of plaintiff\u2019s brief herein, it is concluded that the judgment of the trial court should be reversed and the cause remanded to the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>of Cotton county, with directions to grant a new trial in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\">By the Court: It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
