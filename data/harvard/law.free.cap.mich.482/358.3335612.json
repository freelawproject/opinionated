Hultgren, with public censure and 60 days\u2019 suspension without pay for judicial misconduct. After considering respondent\u2019s actions, we conclude that they do not constitute judicial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">On July 10, 2007, the JTC filed Formal Complaint No. 82, alleging that respondent had committed judicial misconduct in violation of Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30; MCR 9.104 and MCR 9.205; and the Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct (MCJC), Canons 1,2A, and 2C.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>appointed the Honorable Norma Dotson-Sales as the master to hear the case. The master\u2019s report, issued on March 31, 2008, states the factual background:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">1. Respondent is and has been a sitting 19th District Court Judge for approximately 15 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">2. On October 13, 2006, a caller identified as Ali Beydoun, telephoned Respondent\u2019s office and requested a 15 minute appointment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">3. On October 16, 2006, Respondent held a meeting in his court chambers, for approximately 15 minutes, with Ali (a/k/a Wally) Beydoun and two (2) other men: Hussein Dabaja and Frank Dabaja (Hussein\u2019s cousin).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">4. Prior to October 16, 2006, Respondent had a casual relationship with Wally Beydoun and did not know the Dabaja cousins.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">5. During the October 16th meeting, it became apparent that Hussein Dabaja (\u201cHussein\u201d) had difficulty with the English language and that Frank Dabaja (\u201cFrank\u201d) apparently attended the meeting to act as a translator for his cousin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">6. Hussein, through Frank, claimed that he was a victim of mistaken identify [sic] regarding a credit card debt that occurred before his entry into the USA. He presented Respondent with documentation to support his claim. Said documentation included a passport and social security card.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">7. Respondent requested his secretary, Miss Hunt, to search the court computer system (i.e., Court Case Register of Actions) for any cases involving Hussein Dabaja. The court screen displayed a case titled: <em>Asset Acceptance Cor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>poration v Hussein Dabaja (\u201cAsset Acceptance\u201d) </em>which was assigned to 19th District Judge Mark W Somers and marked \u201cClosed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">8. The Court Case Register of Actions also indicated that Plaintiff in the pending matter was represented by [attorney] Thomas D. Hocking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">9. Respondent telephoned Atty. Hocking\u2019s office, spoke with Ms. Danielle Groppi, Mr. Hocking\u2019s litigation secretary, and caused a letter and the documents presented to him by Hussein Dabaja to be faxed to Atty. Hocking. The letter was written on Respondent\u2019s official 19th District Court stationery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">10. Respondent had no further contact with the three men and no contact with the Asset Acceptance matter until he received two (2) memos, dated December 14, 2006 and January 2, 2007, from Judge Somers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">11. Respondent had no discussions with Judge Somers regarding the Hussein Dabaja matter until his receipt of the above two (2) memos from Judge Somers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">12. On January 3, 2007, Respondent sent a requested reply to Judge Somers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">13. Formal Complaint No. 82 was filed on July 10,2007.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">The master\u2019s report included the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-13\">1. The relationship between the Respondent and Ali Beydoun, at best, was that of \u201cacquaintances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-14\">2. On October 16, 2006, there was no social, business or other relationship between the Respondent and Hussein Dabaja and Frank Dabaja.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-15\">3. Respondent\u2019[s] October 16, 2006, meeting with his constituents was not misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-16\">4. Respondent used poor judgment when he failed to terminate the October 16th meeting once he discovered that the subject matter was assigned to another judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-17\">5. The October 16th meeting was not an ex parte communication violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>6. Respondent\u2019s telephone call to Atty. Hocking\u2019s office was not misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">7. Respondent\u2019s actions in writing the Oct. 16th letter were not that of an intervener. Rather, he acted as a conduit to prevent a miscarriage of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">8. Respondent\u2019s use of the words \u201ca lawyer in a credit card collection mill\u201d was not misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The master also made the following conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">1. The charges contained in Formal Complaint No. 82 were not proven by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">2. Respondent\u2019s conduct in Formal Complaint No. 82 did not constitute [a] violation of the Michigan Constitution, 1963, as amended, Article 6, Section 30; MCR 9.104; MCR 9.205; or the Code of Judicial Conduct, Canons 1, 2A, 2C, or 3A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">After a public hearing, the JTC rejected the master\u2019s conclusions of law. It concluded that the facts established at the hearing demonstrated that respondent had committed judicial misconduct under all counts of the complaint. It recommended that respondent be sanctioned by public censure and 60 days\u2019 suspension without pay.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">MCR 9.225 states, in part, that this Court \u201cshall review the record of the proceedings and file a written opinion and judgment, which may accept or reject the recommendations of the commission . . ..\u201d Having reviewed the record in this case, we reject the recommendation of the JTC and adopt the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the master. In our judgment, respondent has not committed judicial misconduct. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>also agree with the master, however, that respondent\u2019s actions under the circumstances reflected poor judgment. Respondent acknowledged this conclusion at the hearing before the master. Accordingly, we caution respondent to more carefully conform his actions to the rules and provisions that guide judicial conduct.</p>\n<judges id=\"b496-5\">Weaver, Corrigan, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-10\"> Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30, states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">(2) On recommendation of the judicial tenure commission, the supreme court may censure, suspend with or without salary, retire or remove a judge for ... misconduct in office ... or conduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-12\">MCR 9.104 states in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-13\">(A) The following acts or omissions by an attorney, individually or in concert with another person, are misconduct and grounds for discipline, whether or not occurring in the course of an attorney-client relationship:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-14\">(1) conduct prejudicial to the proper administration of justice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-15\">(2) conduct that exposes the legal profession or the courts to obloquy, contempt, censure, or reproach;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>(3) conduct that is contrary to justice, ethics, honesty, or good morals;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">(4) conduct that violates the standards or rules of professional responsibility adopted by the Supreme Court[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">MCR 9.205 states in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">(B) Grounds for Action.

They believed that respondent should be sanctioned by public censure and a one-year suspension without pay.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b496-6\">YOUNG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aao6\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I concur with the majority that the respondent\u2019s actions in this case do not merit the 60-day suspension recommended by the Judicial Tenure Commission. Under the circumstances, the respondent\u2019s actions merit no more than an admonition. However, I disagree with and dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that respondent\u2019s actions did not constitute judicial misconduct. I believe that the respondent\u2019s actions constituted a clear violation of Canon 2C, as respondent <em>unquestionably </em>used the prestige of his office to advance the interests of Hussein Dabaja. Respondent contacted, both by telephone and in writing, the attorney executing a collection judgment against Hussein Dabaja, each time identifying himself as a judge of the 19th District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The facts of this case are compelling, and it is easy to understand why a judge might choose to become involved to prevent what clearly appeared to be a case of mistaken identity and a miscarriage of justice. Hussein Dabaja, along with two other men, came to respondent\u2019s office seeking respondent\u2019s assistance. A default judgment had been entered against Dabaja, an immi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>grant who spoke very little English, for a debt that plainly belonged to another man who shared the identical name.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">When respondent asked his secretary to locate the case, the computer entry indicated that a default judgment had been entered against Hussein Dabaja seven years earlier and that the case was currently closed. In his brief, respondent claims that because the computer indicated that the file was closed, respondent had \u201cno indication that any post-judgment proceedings had been reinitiated against Hussein Dabaja.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">However, I believe that the mere presence of three men appearing in his office seeking respondent\u2019s assistance for a \u201cclosed\u201d file should have put respondent on notice that <em>some </em>type of postjudgment proceeding might have been in progress.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In fact, respondent\u2019s letter to Attorney Hocking, the attorney prosecuting the collection action against Hussein Dabaja, indicates respondent\u2019s <em>actual </em>awareness that collection efforts were underway. In his letter to the collection attorney, respondent stated that \u201c[t]he Hussein A. Dabaja that <em>is being pursued for collection purposes </em>has a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>mother than the Hussein A. Dabaja that actually incurred the debt.\u201d Thus, while the fact that respondent inquired into the status of the case and it was listed as \u201cclosed\u201d in the court\u2019s computer records is a mitigating factor, that factor is undercut by the circumstances of the case, as well as respondent\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The second sentence of Canon 2C is quite clear, and contains no exceptions or exclusions: \u201cA judge should not use the prestige of office to advance personal business interests or those of others.\u201d Respondent intervened twice on behalf of Hussein Dabaja, both times in his capacity as a judge. I conclude that respondent\u2019s actions constituted judicial misconduct under the plain language of the canon. That respondent was acting to prevent a miscarriage of justice is a mitigating factor to be considered when formulating the appropriate <em>sanction, </em>but it simply does not excuse respondent\u2019s frank noncompliance with the Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">While few judges would be unmoved by the miscarriage of justice revealed to respondent, Canon 2C was drafted with an understanding of the coercion inherent in the advocacy of a judge intervening <em>as a judge </em>on behalf of another. It is for this reason that the canon states that a judge \u201cshould not use the prestige of office to advance personal business interests or those of others.\u201d The majority gives no meaning to this injunction, and, in so doing, eliminates the bright line of ethical behavior set forth in Canon 2C. As I believe the canon states a sensible restriction on \u201cjudicial advocacy\u201d \u2014 a term that is oxymoronic \u2014 the canon should be consistently enforced for the protection of the public and as a reminder to judges that they cannot be advocates for the personal business interests of others, even for worthy causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Under the majority\u2019s formulation, which concludes that no judicial misconduct occurred, a sufficiently compelling reason for using the prestige of judicial office to advance the business interests of others apparently amounts to no violation at all. Because the majority concludes that respondent\u2019s actions did not constitute judicial misconduct, I dissent. I concur, however, with the majority\u2019s rejection of the 60-day suspension recommended by the Judicial Tenure Commission. I believe that an admonition is an adequate sanction under the facts of this case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b499-4\">Taylor, C.J., and Kelly, J., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\"> The debt for medical equipment was incurred in 1986, two years before Hussein Dabaja immigrated to the United States. Moreover, Hussein Dabaja had a different social security number, different birth-date, and different maternal name than the debtor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b497-8\"> Indeed, collection proceedings occurred contemporaneously with respondent\u2019s correspondence with attorney Thomas D. Hocking. In a 2008 hearing to set aside the 1999 default judgment, Judge Mark W. Somers indicated that an order of judgment was signed by the court in August 2006 against Hussein Dabaja and his business, H &amp; G Marathon. Two separate requests and orders to seize property from Hussein Dabaja and his business were signed by the court at the end of September 2006. Hussein Dabaja filed objections to the garnishments on November 16, 2006, and those objections were denied by the court on December 8, 2006. Respondent\u2019s correspondence to Attorney Hocking was dated October 16, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
