We hold that the circuit court abused its discretion. Plaintiff failed to meet its burden of establishing that irreparable harm would result if the injunction did not issue, and even supposing plaintiff satisfied its initial burden, it failed to carry its burden in hght of defendant\u2019s contrary proffered evidence. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals and vacate the circuit court order granting the prehminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Plaintiff and defendant are parties to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) that was in effect from June 1, 2002, to June 30, 2004. Although the parties did not agree to a new CBA when that agreement expired, the existing agreement continued to govern the parties\u2019 relationship after June 30, 2004, because under its own terms the agreement was automatically extended until a new contract was negotiated or ordered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>In 2005 and 2006, defendant faced serious budget shortfalls that it sought to address in part by laying off 28 firefighters. Plaintiff maintained that the layoff plan and the manner in which defendant intended to implement it violated the terms of the CBA<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and constituted an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">On June 16, 2006, plaintiff filed a verified complaint in the Oakland Circuit Court seeking a preliminary injunction against defendant\u2019s proposed layoffs pending the resolution of an unfair labor practice charge, collective bargaining, or interest arbitration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Several days earlier, plaintiff had filed an unfair labor practice charge against defendant with the Michigan Employment Relations Commission (MERC). The verified complaint alleged that the proposed layoffs would necessitate a dramatic reorganization of the fire department and that this reorganization threatened firefighter safety. Specifically, plaintiff alleged that the layoffs would increase response time to a fire emergency, which would allegedly allow fires to escalate, making them more difficult and more dangerous to extinguish. Moreover, plaintiff claimed that this problem would be compounded by the smaller number of firefighters present at the scene of a fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>The circuit court ordered defendant to show cause why the injunction should not be granted. On June 28, 2006, the court conducted a hearing on the prehminary injunction. However, the court took no witness testimony at the hearing. Plaintiff relied on the assertions in its verified complaint, and defendant submitted several affidavits to counter plaintiffs allegations. One affidavit particularly pertinent to this case was submitted by the chief of the Pontiac Fire Department, Wilburt McAdams.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">In his affidavit, McAdams addressed many of plaintiffs allegations that the proposed layoffs threatened firefighter safety. The affidavit noted that the \u201cgreat majority\u201d of calls received by the fire department are medical runs rather than fire runs. McAdams contended that minimum staffing levels would be maintained at all times and that in the event staffing reached critically low levels, firefighters would only respond to fires and not medical runs, which would be handled by private ambulance services.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">McAdams further averred that firefighter safety at the site of a fire would not be jeopardized by the layoffs. The department\u2019s remaining 89 firefighters would continue to adhere to basic safety protocols such as the \u201cincident command system\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the \u201ctwo in, two out\u201d rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the affidavit asserted that the number of firefighters at the scene of a fire would be unaffected. McAdams claimed that the number of firefighters on each rig would actually increase from three or four to four firefighters. Finally, McAdams averred that the fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>department would continue to follow all state and local workplace safety rules and regulations and it would continue to participate in mutual aid programs where nearby communities would lend their firefighters if assistance were required.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">In a written opinion issued on June 30, 2006, the circuit court granted the preliminary injunction after ruling that plaintiff satisfied the four traditional elements for injunctive relief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court found that both the laid-off firefighters and those who would remain faced a threat of significant, irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief. With respect to the laid-off firefighters, the court found that they would \u201clos[e] their jobs, salary and benefits and create a current hardship that cannot be compensated even if a subsequent arbitration decision would award those laid off a reinstatement of their positions and back wages.\u201d As to the remaining firefighters, the court found that they</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">may be irreparably harmed since a reduction in the workforce and the closing of several City fire stations would result in a significant increased risk of harm for the remaining firefighters. Fewer firefighters would be available to respond to fires and the closing of stations caused by the [layoff] would result in the firefighters having to cover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>a larger territory. The remaining firefighters would thus not be able to respond as quickly as they used to[,] which means that they would be faced with fires that have increased in intensity or size and as a result are more dangerous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Defendant appealed the circuit court\u2019s order to the Court of Appeals, which upheld the preliminary injunction in a split, unpublished decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The majority held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it granted the injunction, particularly its findings that plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm and that plaintiff demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits. The dissenting member of the panel argued that the trial court abused its discretion because plaintiff did not meet its burden of demonstrating irreparable harm. With respect to the laid-off firefighters, the dissent noted that injunctive relief was inappropriate to remedy economic injuries. With respect to the remaining firefighters, the dissent observed that in view of defendant\u2019s proffered evidence that the layoffs would not jeopardize firefighter safety, the record did not support the trial court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Defendant filed an application with this Court seeking leave to appeal, which we granted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">We review a trial court\u2019s decision to grant injunctive relief for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We have recently offered the following articulation of the abuse of discretion standard. There are circumstances where a trial court must decide a matter and there will be no single correct outcome; rather, there may be more than one reasonable and principled outcome.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court abuses its discretion when its decision falls outside this range of principled outcomes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The Court of Appeals has succinctly stated that \u201c \u2018[i]njunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy that issues only when justice requires, there is no adequate remedy at law, and there exists a real and imminent danger of irreparable injury.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the context of labor disputes, this Court has observed that \u201cit is basically contrary to public policy in this State to issue injunctions in labor disputes absent a showing of violence, irreparable injury, or breach of the peace.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>recently reiterated the longstanding principle that \u201ca particularized showing of irreparable harm ... is... an indispensable requirement to obtain a preliminary injunction.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The mere apprehension of future injury or damage cannot be the basis for injunctive relief.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Equally important is that a preliminary injunction should not issue where an adequate legal remedy is available.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">MCR 3.310 governs the procedure for issuing a preliminary injunction. According to MCR 3.310(A)(1), unless otherwise provided by statute or court rule, an injunction may not be granted without a hearing. At this hearing, \u201cthe party seeking injunctive relief has the burden of establishing that a preliminary injunction should be issued ____\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If a court grants preliminary injunctive relief, a trial on the merits must be held within six months of the injunction issuing, except for good cause or a stipulation from the parties to extend the time.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Given the extraordinary nature of injunctive relief, our court rules contemplate expeditious resolution of the underlying claim or claims once a preliminary injunction issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">With these general precepts in mind, we must consider whether the circuit court abused its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>when it granted plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction. The first half of the circuit court\u2019s irreparable-harm analysis centered on its belief that the layoffs would inflict considerable financial hardship on the laid-off firefighters. We agree with the Court of Appeals dissent that this alleged injury is not irreparable and not the proper subject of injunctive relief. There exists an adequate legal remedy for laid-off firefighters. If the layoffs violated the CBA or constituted an unfair labor practice, MERC or a grievance arbitrator can award back pay, order reinstatement, or provide another remedy to make the laid-off firefighters whole.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Granting extraordinary equitable relief to remedy these economic injuries is unnecessary and inappropriate because they can be remedied by damages at law.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In the second half of its irreparable-harm analysis, the circuit court found that the layoffs would deplete the number of available firefighters, which would increase the remaining firefighters\u2019 workload and lengthen their response time, which in turn would require firefighters to fight larger, more intense, and more dangerous fires. Thus, firefighter safety would be jeopardized. To support this chain of logic, the circuit court appeared to adopt without reservation plaintiffs factual assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>However, while plaintiffs argument that staffing decisions might affect firefighter safety is appealing as a general proposition, upon closer scrutiny, plaintiff alleged nothing more than an apprehension of future injury or damage. Indeed, the circuit court could only speculate that the firefighters \u201cmay\u201d have been irreparably harmed by the layoffs. Neither plaintiff nor the circuit court detailed how the remaining firefighters faced <em>real </em>and <em>imminent </em>danger from the layoffs rather than future, speculative harm. Under established principles governing injunctive relief, plaintiffs verified complaint, standing alone, failed to make a particularized showing of irreparable harm. Thus, plaintiff failed to carry its burden of proof from the outset.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">In reaching this conclusion, we do not trivialize the dangers accompanying firefighting. However, because firefighting is a dangerous job, every managerial decision in the abstract might touch on a safety issue. A mere apprehension of reduced safety by the union is insufficient grounds for a court to grant equitable relief. Otherwise, the extraordinary nature of a preliminary injunction would be trivialized. Plaintiff bears the responsibility of submitting sufficiently persuasive evidence that particular, irreparable harm will result if an injunction does not issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Further, even if we assumed arguendo that plaintiff initially succeeded in demonstrating particularized, irreparable harm, it failed to carry its burden of proof in the face of contrary evidence submitted by defendant that specifically refuted plaintiffs allegations. For instance, in response to plaintiffs allegation that the number of firefighter personnel at a fire scene would be limited and reduced to unsafe levels, Fire Chief McAdams stated that the number of firefighters present at a fire would not be reduced by the layoffs and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>number of firefighters in each rig would increase from three or four to four. And McAdams averred that additional, outside support was available, if needed. For instance, because the \u201cgreat majority\u201d of calls to which the fire department responded were medical runs, private ambulance services, rather than firefighters, would be used to respond to those calls if the department was functioning at its minimum daily staffing level. Thus, the firefighters would remain available to fight fires. Also, because the department participated in mutual aid programs with the fire departments of neighboring communities, additional firefighters from other communities could be called on for assistance. Moreover, safety protocols, such as the \u201ctwo in, two out\u201d rule and the incident command system, would remain in place at the scene of every fire. Defendant submitted evidence that it would maintain the same number of firefighters at the scene of a fire, would retain existing policies to protect the health and safety of firefighters, and would use outside resources to ensure that a minimally staffed fire department did not overburden firefighters with medical runs at the expense of fighting fires. Simply put, plaintiffs nonspecific allegations of irreparable harm were refuted by the more specific, sworn statements in Fire Chief McAdams\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In the face of this conflicting evidence that blunted the force of plaintiffs safety allegations, it behooved plaintiff to do more than rely on its initial factual allegations. Plaintiff did not do so. Thus, for this additional reason, it failed to carry its burden of demonstrating irreparable harm under MCR 3.310(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">We are not second-guessing the circuit court\u2019s discretion to substitute the outcome we prefer. For reasons that are unclear, the circuit court in its written opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>granting the preliminary injunction seemed to credit only plaintiffs allegations and did not at all consider defendant\u2019s contrary evidence. Plaintiff failed to carry its burden of proof to make a particularized showing of irreparable harm and also failed to maintain this showing in the face of defendant\u2019s contrary evidence. A grant of a preliminary injunction under these circumstances falls outside the principled range of outcomes. Thus, the circuit court abused its discretion when it granted the injunction. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals and vacate the circuit court order.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Reversed; preliminary injunction vacated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b145-5\">TAYLOR, C.J., and CORRIGAN and MARKMAN, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\"> Article VII, Section 12 of the CBA provided: \u201cThis Agreement shall remain in full force and effect from July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2004, and it shall he extended automatically thereafter on a daily basis until a new contract is negotiated or ordered.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-6\"> Plaintiff relied on Article EX, Section 7.D.4 of the CBA, which provided in pertinent part that \u201c[djuring the duration of the Agreement, there will be no layoff of bargaining unit personnel....\u201d Defendant relied on other portions of the CBA that seemed to presume that defendant could lay off union members.

I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Pontiac Fire Fighters Union failed to meet its burden of showing that the proposed layoff of 28 firefighters would cause irreparable harm to the remaining firefighters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The union alleged that the layoffs would lead to the closing of fire stations and would lengthen the time for responding to fires. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>firefighters would travel longer distances to reach fires and would encounter longer-burning, and therefore more dangerous, fires. The fire chiefs affidavit on behalf of the city did not rebut this allegation. To the extent that it granted injunctive relief on the basis of this unchallenged allegation, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The union alleged in counts 9, 24, and 25 of the verified complaint that the layoffs would affect firefighter safety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">9. Plaintiff is informed and believes that if the unilateral layoff decision is implemented, the Pontiac Fire Department will undergo substantial adverse reorganization which will include the closing of fire stations, the reduction of staffing on fire apparatus, the elimination of EMS-ALS rescue units, the realignment and expansion of fire territories, the elimination of mutual aid participation for hazardous materials and technical rescue responses, and other unilateral changes many of which will constitute violations of the Agreement in such matters as staffing, reduction of personnel on vacation, and use of Kelly days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">24. The layoff of 28 fire fighters and fire fighter paramedics will reduce the fire extinguishment and medical/rescue capability of the Fire Department to unacceptable levels posing a threat and hazard to fire fighters and citizens alike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">25. The .reorganization of the Fire Department, the substantial reduction of personnel, and the closing of fire stations will increase response time to a fire scene and/or medical/rescue run. Increased response time of emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>equipment poses a hazard to responding fire fighters and citizens on the route. As a consequence of delay in responding to a fire scene, the fire escalates making extinguishment more difficult and increasing the danger to fire fighters and possibly occupants of a dwelling. The number of personnel at a fire scene will be limited and reduced to unsafe levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">The city countered these allegations with an affidavit from Fire Chief Wilburt McAdams, which stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">2. That the great majority of calls to which the department responds are medical runs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">3. That the department will continue to maintain minimum staffing levels. In the event the department is at the minimum level of seventeen firefighters on a given day, private ambulance services will be used to respond to medical runs, and the City\u2019s firefighters will be used solely for fighting fires.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">4. That, even after the layoff of the 28 firefighters, the department will have 89 firefighters, and will continue to operate utilizing both an incident command system and the \u201ctwo in two out\u201d rule which forbids any firefighter from entering a structure fire unless he/she is accompanied by another firefighter and there are two firefighters outside the structure. In addition, the department will continue to assign a safety officer to each fire. The number of firefighters at a fire scene will not be impacted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">5. Using the incident command system, firefighters will not enter a burning structure until there has been a careful assessment of the fire and the incident commander allows entry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">4.

In addition, the department will continue to participate in mutual aid, under which firefighters from other departments .. . can be called for assistance if needed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The union\u2019s complaint alleged both that fewer firefighters would be available to fight fires and that their response time would be increased. The fire chief averred that the number of firefighters available to fight fires would remain the same, and so would the safety rules. However, the fire chief did not offer a solution to the problem of increased response time. Nor did he explain how existing safety rules would protect the firefighters who would confront more intense fires.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The circuit court issued a preliminary injunction specifically on the basis of the union\u2019s allegation that the closing of fire stations would affect the remaining fire stations\u2019 response time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">. . .

Fewer fire fighters [sic] would be available to respond to fires and the closing of stations caused by the lay off would result in the firefighters having to cover a larger territory. The remaining firefighters would thus not be able to respond as quickly as they used to which means that they would be faced with fires that have increased in intensity or size and as a result are more dangerous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">The majority faults the circuit court for not considering the fire chiefs affidavit, and it faults the union for not offering additional evidence in response to the affidavit. At the show-cause hearing, the union did offer to present additional testimony and diagrams of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>runs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the union cannot be faulted for failing to present additional evidence. The majority\u2019s conclusion that the circuit court failed to consider the fire chiefs affidavit is also unpersuasive. Rather, the union met its burden of proof through the unchallenged allegations in its complaint. To the extent that the circuit court based its order on these unchallenged allegations, it did not need to address the fire chiefs other averments.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that irreparable harm to the remaining firefighters called for injunctive relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-5\">WEAVER and CAVANAGH, JJ., concurred with KELLY, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\"> The union had filed an unfair labor practice charge against defendant with the Michigan Employment Relations Commission (MERC). It requested an injunction from the circuit court \u201cpending resolution of the parties\u2019 dispute by MERC.\u201d It also asked for and received from the court an injunction to maintain the status quo pending compulsory arbitration under Act 312, MCL 423.231 <em>et seq. </em>But no Act 312 arbitration was actually pending when the circuit court issued the injunction. The injunction was properly issued in aid of MERC\u2019s jurisdiction over the unfair labor practice charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-10\"> MCR 3.310(A)(4) states that \u201c[a]t the hearing on an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue, the party seeking injunctive relief has the burden of establishing that a preliminary injunction should be issued .. ..\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b149-6\"> In deciding not to take testimony, the circuit court followed <em>Campau v McMath, </em>185 Mich App 724, 728; 463 NW2d 186 (1990). In that and other cases, the Court of Appeals held that an evidentiary hearing was not required for issuing an injunction. See also <em>Fancy v Egrin, </em>177 Mich App 714, 722; 442 NW2d 765 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b149-7\"> The court additionally concluded that the union was likely to succeed on the merits because the parties\u2019 contract clearly prohibited layoffs and was in effect until a new contract was negotiated. The city could not use financial hardship as an excuse to violate the contract it had negotiated with the union. The Court of Appeals affirmed this conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
