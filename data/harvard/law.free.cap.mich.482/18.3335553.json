We conclude that the injunction was erroneously entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Where a party seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent an alleged status quo violation, a two-step process is required. First, the moving party must satisfy the traditional four-part test that is prerequisite for issuance of any preliminary injunction. Second, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>conditions of the preliminary injunction test are met and the injunction is granted, the circuit court must promptly resolve the merits of the status quo claim. Pursuant to MCR 3.310(A)(5), if a preliminary injunction is granted, a \u201ctrial of the action on the merits must be held within 6 months after the injunction is granted, unless good cause is shown or the parties stipulate to a longer period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The status quo provision of Act 312 prevents either party from altering, without consent, \u201cexisting wages, hours, or other conditions of employment,\u201d which concern mandatory subjects of bargaining, while Act 312 arbitration is pending. The status quo provision does not prevent parties from exercising their contractual rights if they do not alter an existing wage, hour, or other condition of employment. In this case, it is defendant\u2019s implementation of its restructuring and layoff plan that is at issue. Plaintiff claims that it is a change in \u201cexisting . . . conditions of employment\u201d because it will jeopardize firefighter safety, which our precedent treats as a \u201ccondition of employment\u201d and a mandatory subject of bargaining. Defendant, on the other hand, argues that it has the contractual right to lay off firefighters. Thus, in order for the status quo provision to be violated in this case, it must be determined that the restructuring and layoff plan actually alters a condition of employment, namely firefighter safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The question is what standard a circuit court must apply in order for it to determine that an employer\u2019s challenged action actually violates the status quo provision by altering this condition of employment. The Court of Appeals in <em>Oak Park Pub Safety Officers Ass\u2019n v Oak </em>Park<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> recently adopted the standard that a staffing proposal must be \u201cinextricably intertwined with safety\u201d to be a mandatory subject of bargaining. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>We adopt this standard for circuit court review of the type of status quo violation claim presented here. A circuit court must conclude that the employer\u2019s challenged plan is so \u201cinextricably intertwined with safety\u201d that its implementation would impermissibly alter the status quo by altering this \u201ccondition\u201d of employment. The circuit court must make thorough factual findings supporting such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Here, not only did the circuit court fail to resolve the safety claim on the merits, it entered what amounted to a permanent injunction without applying the traditional injunctive standards. Thus, we hold that the circuit court erroneously granted injunctive relief and the Court of Appeals erroneously affirmed that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals, vacate the preliminary injunction entered by the circuit court, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Plaintiff is the exclusive bargaining representative of eligible Detroit Fire Department (DFD) employees. Defendant is the employer. Both are parties to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) that took effect in 1998 and expired on June 30, 2001. Until a new agreement is forged in the Act 312 arbitration, the parties continue to operate under the old CBA. That CBA states in pertinent part at Article 2.D that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">[t]he City reserves the right to lay off personnel for lack of work or funds; or for the occurrence of conditions beyond the control of the Department; or when such continuation of work would be wasteful and unproductive .... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>[w]ages, hours and conditions of employment legally in effect on the effective date of this agreement, shall, except as improved herein, be maintained during the term of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>In Article 14, the parties agreed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>It is not the intent of this Article to restrict, interfere with, prevent or hinder the City from carrying out its duties and responsibilities to the public well being, by way of illustration, but not limitation, those rights, duties and responsibilities enumerated in Article 2 and the Purpose and Intent clause hereof, subject to the City\u2019s obligations under PERA [public employment relations act] and other laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">After the CBA expired in 2001, the parties were unable to agree to a new contract. In December 2002, plaintiff invoked compulsory arbitration under Act 312 to create a successor agreement. Act 312 is meant to provide an \u201calternate, expeditious, effective, and binding\u201d arbitration process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, Act 312 requires the arbitrator to call a hearing within 15 days of being appointed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> conclude the hearing within 30 days of its commencement,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and issue a written opinion within 30 days of the conclusion of the hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, the parties waived the time limitations that Act 312 imposes on the arbitration process. As a result, the \u201cexpeditious\u201d Act 312 arbitration process is still pending after more than five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Defendant experienced serious budget shortfalls during the ongoing Act 312 arbitration. These difficult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>financial circumstances affected the operations of the DFD, leading defendant to implement a restructuring plan and a round of layoffs, effective July 1, 2005. Unfortunately, the budget problems persisted, and defendant announced, in September 2005, an additional plan to restructure the DFD. Under this plan, defendant proposed to lay off 65 firefighters, demote 10 battalion chiefs, and reduce the number of battalions from eight to five. The plan reassigned the battalion chiefs duties at \u201cgarden variety fires\u201d to the senior officer at the scene, and deactivated five engine and ladder companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Plaintiff filed suit in the Wayne Circuit Court on September 12, 2005, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the September 2005 reorganization plan from going into effect while the Act 312 arbitration was pending. Plaintiff argued that unilateral implementation of the restructuring plan violated the status quo provision of Act 312 because it required unilateral alteration of minimum staffing, job duties, seniority, parity, and emergency medical service requirements, all of which affected both firefighter safety and mandatory subjects of bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The circuit court held hearings beginning in late September, and granted plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction on October 17, 2005. The court found that there were issues of fact concerning whether the layoffs would have an impact on the safety of the firefighters \u2014 a mandatory subject of bargaining under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Local 1277, Metropolitan Council No. 23, AFSCME, AFL-CIO v City of Center </em>Line<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Center Line II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>The circuit judge sent the case to the assigned Act 312 arbitrator, Michael E Long, to decide the safety issue and render his decision by October 27, 2005, at which time the circuit judge would determine if the preliminary injunction would remain in place. Although he held hearings, the arbitrator responded to the circuit court in an October 27, 2005, opinion stating that he was \u201cnot able to make any well reasoned determination as to the resolution of this dispute.\u201d Arbitrator Long indicated that he lacked jurisdiction to decide the safety issue, observing that \u201c[t]he normal channels were not followed regarding reference of the matter to [Act] 312 arbitration.\u201d He sent the case back to the circuit court and recommended that the circuit court order the parties to mediation while keeping the injunction in place until the mediation process concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The circuit court again granted a preliminary injunction in an October 31, 2005, order following another hearing. At this hearing the court reviewed its earlier statements and conceded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">I do want to say for the record after reading the transcript of the previous hearing of the 17th, that I felt that my choice of words was inapt because it sounded like I was making a determination that there was an impact. That is not my place to do that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">However, the circuit judge clarified, \u201cI find that there\u2019s a serious question of fact as to whether or not [the restructuring plan] would have an impact on fire fighters\u2019 safety, or indeed upon working conditions or working hours.\u201d Relying on <em>Center Line II </em>and <em>Detroit Police Officers Ass\u2019n v </em>Detroit,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the court found that the reorganization and layoff plan \u201cmay implicate mandatory provisions of collective bargaining, namely the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>impact on [sic] the Plan on the hours and conditions of employment (including the safety) of the members of the plaintiff.\u201d The preliminary injunction order enjoined defendant from eliminating the battalion chiefs, ehminating the firefighting companies, and laying off the firefighters. It also ordered the parties to take all necessary steps to have the matter brought before an Act 312 panel to determine the factual questions surrounding the safely issues. The order maintained the injunction until the issuance of a final and binding Act 312 award.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court in a published decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Observing that the parties had a duty under PERA to collectively bargain about mandatory subjects of bargaining and that layoff decisions are not mandatory subjects, the panel relied on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Center Line II </em>to hold that \u201cwhere, as here, proposed layoffs and restructuring may impact the safety of working conditions for firefighters, those proposals are mandatory subjects of bargaining.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The panel agreed with the circuit court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe evidence established \u2018serious issues of fact\u2019 as to whether the proposed changes would impact safety, working conditions and working hours,\u201d and as a result \u201cthe proposed changes were subjects of mandatory bargaining, and defendant could not therefore make these unilateral alterations while the parties are engaged in compulsory arbitration.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It disagreed with defendant\u2019s argument that injunctive relief was inappropriate because the terms of the CBA permitted defendant to carry out the restructuring plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Defendant filed an application for leave to appeal with this Court. This Court granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Following oral arguments, this Court ordered supplemental briefing,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and subsequently ordered reargument.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">This Court reviews a trial court\u2019s grant or denial of a temporary injunction for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There is an abuse of discretion when the trial court\u2019s decision falls outside the range of principled outcomes.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> A question of statutory interpretation is a question of law that we review de novo.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Finally, issues of contract interpretation are also questions of law reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Public labor relations in Michigan are governed by PERA. One of PERA\u2019s primary purposes \u201cis to resolve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>labor-management strife through collective bargaining.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Under PERA a public labor union may not strike when disagreements arise in the collective bargaining process.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Because public sector labor unions in Michigan lack the right to strike, they lack a significant tool to leverage their bargaining position.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">By its own terms, Act 312 is \u201csupplementary\u201d to PERA, which was enacted over 20 years earlier.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Act 312 was intended, in the specific context of police and firefighter unions, to redress the imbalance in bargaining power created by the prohibition of strikes, and to preclude the possibility of an illegal strike by these unions that provide vital public services, namely police and fire protection. As Justice COLEMAN observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">When policemen engage in a strike, the community becomes immediately endangered by the withdrawal of their services. Likewise, our case law has often focused on the fact that fire fighters have a distinct and crucial employment relationship with a public employer.[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">[u]nder Act 312, if the public employer and the police offers\u2019 or fire fighters\u2019 bargaining unit have not reached an agreement concerning a mandatory subject of bargaining, and mediation proves unsuccessful, either party may initiate binding arbitration in order to avert a strike.[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The status quo provision of Act 312 states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">[d]uring the pendency of proceedings before the arbitration panel, existing wages, hours and other conditions of employment shall not be changed by action of either party without the consent of the other but a party may so consent without prejudice to his rights or position under this act.[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Recalling the delicate balance of bargaining power our labor statutes seek to preserve in police and firefighter labor disputes, this provision was intended to prevent either party from gaining unfair leverage during the pendency of Act 312 interest arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">Under the status quo provision, neither party without consent can alter \u201cexisting wages, hours, and other conditions of employment\u201d while Act 312 arbitration is pending. We observed in <em>Center Line II </em>that safety is a condition of employment and, as such, a mandatory subject of bargaining.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Consequently, the status quo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>provision prohibits changes to an existing condition of employment such as safety during the pendency of Act 312 arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Of chief importance in a case involving an alleged status quo violation is whether an employer\u2019s restructuring and layoff plan alters a condition of employment such as safety. The Court of Appeals recently held in <em>Oak Park </em>that where a union seeks to compel Act 312 arbitration with respect to staffing decisions, it must demonstrate that those decisions are \u201cinextricably intertwined with safety\u201d to constitute a mandatory subject of bargaining.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> If it does not, then the employer cannot be compelled to arbitrate the staffing decision under Act 312. The <em>Oak Park </em>panel rejected as \u201cunten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>able\u201d the union\u2019s proposed alternative standard that \u201cas long as a staffing decision <em>arguably </em>affects, concerns, or relates to safety \u2014 whether the effect be minimal, insignificant, or unjustifiable \u2014 the issue of staffing is a condition of employment that is subject to mandatory arbitration.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">The standards implemented by the hearing referee and MERC in this case are consistent with the requirement that only those matters that have a significant impact on conditions of employment are subject to mandatory bargaining. The impact of a staffing decision on working conditions, including safety, must be proven to be significant, not merely to <em>arguably </em>exist. ... To adopt the union\u2019s position would be tantamount to requiring that most, if not all, minimum staffing proposals \u2014 particularly with regard to [public safety officers], police officers, firefighters, and others engaged in high-risk professions \u2014 be subject to mandatory bargaining, given that a reduction in the number of these employees will arguably have some \u2014 albeit minimal\u2014 impact on safety. Such a conclusion would have the effect of invading the city\u2019s prerogative to determine the size and scope of its business, including the services it will provide. We decline to reach such a conclusion.[<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Although <em>Oak Park </em>addressed a different legal issue and not the status quo issue presented here, we find the logic and standard endorsed by <em>Oak Park </em>compelling in this context.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> A hasty or tentative finding that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>restructuring and layoff plan violates the status quo would \u201cinvad[e] the city\u2019s prerogative to determine the size and scope of its business, including the services it will provide,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> just as surely as if every employer\u2019s staffing decision that merely <em>arguably </em>affected safety conditions were subject to mandatory bargaining. Thus, whether a layoff and restructuring plan jeopardizes employee safety requires a careful examination of the plan details and a finding that the plan is \u201cinextricably intertwined with safety\u201d such that it would have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on safety.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The central problem with the circuit court\u2019s decision in this case, and by extension the Court of Appeals decision to affirm it, is that it only found that defendant\u2019s layoff and restructuring plan \u201cmay\u201d implicate a mandatory subject of bargaining and that this case \u201craised questions of fact\u201d about firefighter safety. After issuing the preliminary injunction, the circuit court never conclusively determined that the plan unlawfully altered the status quo. Indeed, the circuit court expressly stated that it was not deciding the merits of plaintiffs claim. And, when the circuit court attempted to induce Arbitrator Long to resolve the safety dispute, he declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Given the magnitude of a decision to restrain an employer\u2019s exercise of a management prerogative, this level of uncertainty in a circuit court ruling is untenable. By its terms, this injunction was to remain in place until the conclusion of Act 312 arbitration, but a determination on the merits would never have been made. On a practical level, what was termed by the circuit court a \u201cpreliminary injunction\u201d became a de facto permanent injunction, without resolving the mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>its of the alleged status quo violation. Moreover, the injunction was issued where the traditional elements required for injunctive relief had not been established. Specifically, although the circuit court found that there were \u201cissues of fact\u201d regarding the safety issue, it did not find that there was a likelihood of success on the merits in this regard, nor did the court conclude that the firefighters would suffer irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Where a party seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent an alleged status quo violation as in this case, the party must satisfy a two-step process. First, it bears the burden of proving that the traditional four elements favor the issuance of a preliminary injunction. The trial court must evaluate whether (1) the moving party made the required demonstration of irreparable harm, (2) the harm to the applicant absent such an injunction outweighs the harm it would cause to the adverse party, (3) the moving party showed that it is likely to prevail on the merits, and (4) there will be harm to the public interest if an injunction is issued.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Second, if a trial court determines that the standards for a preliminary injunction have been met and chooses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>to issue an injunction, it must promptly decide the merits of the status quo claim. MCR 3.310(A) governs preliminary injunctions. Subsection 5 requires that \u201c[i]f a preliminary injunction is granted . . . [t]he trial of the action on the merits must be held within 6 months after the injunction is granted, unless good cause is shown or the parties stipulate to a longer period.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Therefore, on remand, the circuit court must engage in this two-step inquiry. First, it must determine whether plaintiff has satisfied the traditional four-part test for a preliminary injunction, particularly that plaintiff has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits that the plan is \u201cinextricably intertwined with safety\u201d and made a showing of irreparable harm. Second, if the circuit court issues a preliminary injunction, there must be a determination on the merits that the challenged employer action is \u201cinextricably intertwined with safety\u201d as that standard was articulated in <em>Oak Park. </em>It must do more than conclude that the challenged employer action <em>arguably </em>affects safety. To that end, any decision by the circuit court that the employer action is \u201cinextricably intertwined with safety\u201d must be conclusive and supported by specific, detailed findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">We hold that the circuit court erred when it issued the preliminary injunction preventing the implementation of the restructuring plan. The circuit court issued what amounted to a permanent injunction where the underlying merits of the alleged status quo violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>would never be resolved, contrary to the requirements of MCR 3.310(A)(5). We further hold that, when a safety claim is alleged, an employer\u2019s challenged action alters the status quo during the pendency of an Act 312 arbitration only if the action is so \u201cinextricably intertwined with safety\u201d that the action would alter a \u201ccondition of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">We reverse the Court of Appeals judgment, vacate the preliminary injunction entered by the circuit court, and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b168-6\">Taylor, C.J., and Weaver, Corrigan, and Markman, JJ., concurred with YOUNG, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b168-7\">CAVANAGH, J.

In <em>Center Line II, </em>one of the central issues was the scope of an Act 312 panel\u2019s authority. This Court interpreted Act 312 in the context of PERA\u2019s distinction between mandatory and permissive subjects of bargaining, observing that \u201c[wjhile Act 312 does not specifically delineate the scope of the arbitration panel\u2019s authority, it can be inferred from an analysis which considers [PERA] . .. and Act 312 together.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651-652. We held that \u201c[g]iven the fact that Act 312 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>complements PERA and that under \u00a7 15 of PERA the duty to bargain only extends to mandatory subjects, .. . the arbitration panel can only compel agreement as to mandatory subjects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654. Thus, we concluded that the Act 312 panel in <em>Center Line II </em>exceeded the scope of its authority when it compelled the parties to accept a layoff provision as part of a new labor contract because the layoff clause, which provided that police officer layoffs for lack of funds could only be made in conjunction with layoffs and cutbacks in other departments, fell within the scope of management prerogative and was outside the realm of mandatory subjects of bargaining. However, <em>Center Line II </em>cautioned that \u201cwhile the initial decision to lay off is not a mandatory subject of bargaining, and therefore cannot be compelled in an arbitration award, it is clear that there is a duty to bargain over the <em>impact </em>of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 661. The impact of the decision to lay off, according to <em>Center Line II, </em>might implicate a mandatory subject of bargaining that triggers the duty to collectively bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">In this case, both parties appear to concede that, consistent with <em>Center Line II, </em>defendant retains the prerogative to lay off firefighters. However, plaintiff argues that the <em>impact </em>of the restructuring plan, which includes layoffs, implicates a mandatory subject of bargaining because it affects firefighter safety, a \u201ccondition of employment\u201d that should not be altered during Act 312 arbitration proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\"> <em>Oak Park, </em>277 Mich App at 329-330.

The remand is necessary because the circuit court stated its conclusions in terms that are too tentative.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">The circuit court must determine whether the union is likely to succeed on the merits of its claim that a status quo violation occurred. If it finds such a likelihood, it may presume that the union will be irreparably harmed should the violation not be enjoined for the duration of the arbitration proceedings.

In its peremptory order in that case, the Court did not consider the public policy concerns codified in Act 312.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And when the Court had an opportunity to consider whether the holding of <em>Detroit POA </em>contradicted the public policy of this state, it denied leave to appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">It is an accepted rule of statutory construction that the Court should not impose policy choices that differ from those selected by the Legislature.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The majority here acknowledges the public policy concerns that occasioned the passing of Act 312: \u201cAct 312 was intended, in the specific context of police and firefighter unions, to redress the imbalance in bargaining power created by the prohibition of strikes, and to preclude the possibility of an illegal strike by these unions that provide vital public services, namely police and fire protection.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> These policy concerns are expressly codified in two statutes: MCL 423.231, which affords arbitration to police and firefighter unions as \u201can alternate, expeditious, effective and binding procedure for the resolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>of disputes,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and MCL 423.243, which prohibits unilateral changes in the status quo while arbitration is pending.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">The traditional requirement of irreparable harm requires a determination that the injury cannot be repaired by means other than an injunction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A unilateral change in the status quo has an obviously negative effect on a union\u2019s bargaining power. It compromises the integrity of the bargaining process. Because of the bargaining disadvantage at which unilateral changes place a union, the union is unlikely to attain a retroactive restoration of the status quo. Because a strike is the only method of maintaining bargaining power in the face of a unilateral change, Act 312 aims to prevent the resort to strikes by police and firefighters. Thus, in passing Act 312, the Legislature effectively decided that any remedy other than an injunction would be inadequate. Consequently, a status quo violation presumptively causes irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Detroit POA </em>did not err in concluding that no showing of irreparable harm was necessary to enjoin violations of the status quo during Act 312 arbitration. While I concur in the decision to remand this case to the circuit court, I would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>require the union to show irreparable harm.
