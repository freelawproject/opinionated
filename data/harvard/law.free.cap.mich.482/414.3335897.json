In these consolidated appeals, the MCCA refused to indemnify its member insurers, United States Fidelity Insurance &amp; Guaranty Company (USF&amp;G) and Hartford Insurance Company of the Midwest (Hartford) (together, plaintiffs), for personal protection insurance (PIP) benefits<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in excess of $250,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The MCCA claimed that the hourly rates for attendant care services agreed to by plaintiffs were unreasonable and that it was not required to reimburse member insurers for unreasonable payments. Plaintiffs argued that the MCCA lacked authority to refuse to indemnify their claims on the grounds that the charges they paid were unreasonable. We hold that when a member insurer\u2019s policy only provides coverage for \u201creasonable charges,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the MCCA has authority to refuse to indemnify unreasonable charges. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AOo\">\n<em>A. USF&amp;G v MCCA, DOCKET NO. 133466</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">USF&amp;G provided no-fault insurance coverage for Daniel Migdal, who was injured in a motor vehicle accident on August 22, 1981. Since his injury, Daniel has required 24-hour attendant care services.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In 1988, Daniel\u2019s father, Michael Migdal, individually and as conservator of Daniel\u2019s estate, filed a first party no-fault action against USF&amp;G, seeking to recover attendant care benefits. In 1990, the parties entered into a consent judgment that provided that USF&amp;G would pay $17.50 an hour for attendant care services with an adjustment for inflation of 8.5 percent compounded annually.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The increased payments occasioned by this consent judgment have, in turn, driven this litigation. As of 2003, when this suit was filed, USF&amp;G was paying $54.84 an hour to Medical Management, a company started by Mr. Migdal to provide his son\u2019s care. Medical Management paid the nurses who actually provided Daniel\u2019s care between $21.00 and $25.00 an hour plus benefits, which raised the average hourly nursing care cost to $32 an hour. As a result, the consent judgment created a profit center for Mr. Migdal. Medical Management kept the remainder of the hourly rate paid by USF&amp;G and recovered approximately $200,000 in profits for 2003 for its operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The pay rate has continued to increase and, after Daniel\u2019s benefits exceeded the $250,000 MCCA statutory threshold,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> USF&amp;G sought indemnification from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>the MCCA under MCL 500.3104. The MCCA, however, refused to reimburse USF&amp;G beyond $22.05 an hour, a rate that it considered reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\n<em>B. HARTFORD v MCCA, DOCKET NO. 133468</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Hartford provided no-fault insurance coverage for Robert Allen, who was injured in a motor vehicle accident on November 6, 2001. Allen was prescribed 24-hour attendant care services. Hartford initially paid for those services at the rate of $20 an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">In 2003, Allen retained an attorney and demanded that Hartford pay $37 an hour for attendant care services. The parties entered into a settlement agreement that provided that Hartford would pay $30 an hour for three years (May 6, 2003, to May 6, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Hartford sought indemnification from the MCCA under MCL 500.3104 because its payments to Allen exceeded the $250,000 threshold. The MCCA contested the reasonableness of the hourly rate and refused to reimburse Hartford beyond a rate of $20 an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">USF&amp;G and Hartford each filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment against the MCCA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Each plaintiff requested that the circuit court order the MCCA to reimburse the full rate of the attendant care services each insurer was paying its insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The parties filed motions for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(9) and (10),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> disputing whether the MCCA could refuse to reimburse payments that it deemed unreasonable. The circuit courts entered conflicting judgments. In USF&amp;G\u2019s case, the court entered summary disposition in USF&amp;G\u2019s favor. The court held that MCL 500.3104 does not include a reasonableness requirement and the court could not add one; thus, USF&amp;G was entitled to summary disposition because the MCCA\u2019s argument lacked merit. In Hartford\u2019s case, the court denied Hartford\u2019s motion for summary disposition. The court held that the MCCA could refuse to reimburse unreasonable charges and that whether the charges in that case were reasonable was a question of fact.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The MCCA appealed the grant of summary disposition in USF&amp;G\u2019s favor, and Hartford appealed the denial of its motion. The Court of Appeals consolidated the appeals and held that \u201cthe MCCA is statutorily required to reimburse an insurer for 100 percent of the amount that the insurer paid in PIP benefits to an insured in excess of the statutory threshold listed in MCL 500.3104(2), regardless of the reasonableness of these payments.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals majority explained that \u201c[although MCL 500.3105 and MCL 500.3107 indicate that an insurer is only required to reimburse an insured for reasonable charges, MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>500.3104 does not include a reasonableness requirement.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the majority concluded that \u201cMCL 500.3104 requires the MCCA to reimburse the insurer for the full amount (above the statutory threshold) of PIP benefits that the insurer is bound to pay to its insured, regardless of the circumstances under which that amount was determined, whether by agreement, judgment, binding arbitration, or otherwise, or the reasonableness of that amount.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary disposition in USF&amp;G\u2019s favor, and reversed the denial of Hartford\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">This Court granted the MCCA\u2019s applications for leave to appeal in both cases and asked the parties to address \u201cwhether MCL 500.3104(2) obligates the [MCCA] to reimburse member insurers\u2019 reimbursement claims without regard to the reasonableness of the member\u2019s payments to PIP claimants.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">This Court reviews decisions to grant or deny summary disposition de novo.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Addressing the issues presented in this case requires that this Court interpret MCL 500.3104. Issues of statutory interpretation are questions of law that this Court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>\u201cWhen interpreting a statute, our primary obligation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. To do so, we begin with the language of the statute, ascertaining the intent that may reasonably be inferred from its language.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cIn interpreting the statute at issue, we consider both the plain meaning of the critical word or phrase as well as \u2018its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.\u2019 As far as possible, effect should be given to every phrase, clause, and word in a statute.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">IV ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The parties dispute whether the MCCA may review the reasonableness of charges for attendant care services and refuse to indemnify a member insurer when it deems those charges unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">\n<em>A. WHETHER THE MCCA HAS AUTHORITY TO REVIEW AND REJECT MEMBER CLAIMS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">The narrower threshold issue is whether the Legislature intended to permit the MCCA to conduct <em>any </em>review of claims submitted by member insurers. As stated, the language of the statute is the starting point to determine legislative intent. MCL 500.3104 does not expressly authorize the MCCA to review claims submitted by member insurers. MCL 500.3104(8)(g), however, does provide a broad grant of authority to the MCCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">(8) In addition to other powers granted to it by this section, the association may do all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>(g) Perform other acts not specifically enumerated in this section that are necessary or proper to accomplish the purposes of the association and that are not inconsistent with this section or the plan of operation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Accordingly, the MCCA may perform any act \u201cnecessary or proper to accomplish\u201d its purpose that is not inconsistent with \u00a7 3104 or its plan of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">This Court has explained the MCCA\u2019s purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">It was created by the Legislature in 1978 in response to concerns that Michigan\u2019s no-fault law provision for unlimited personal injury protection benefits placed too great a burden on insurers, particularly small insurers, in the event of \u201ccatastrophic\u201d injury claims. Its primary purpose is to indemnify member insurers for losses sustained as a result of the payment of personal protection insurance benefits beyond the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d level, which has been set at $250,000 for a single claimant. * * * In practice, the [MCCA] acts as a kind of \u201creinsurer\u201d for its member insurers.[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Not every member insurer claim is entitled to indemnification under \u00a7 3104(2). Section 3104(2) obligates the MCCA to indemnify member insurers as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">The [MCCA] shall provide and each member shall accept indemnification for 100% of the amount of ultimate loss sustained under personal protection insurance coverages in excess of [$250,000].[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">\u201cUltimate loss\u201d is defined as \u201cthe actual loss amounts that a member is obligated to pay and that are paid or payable by the member, and do not include claim expenses.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, incorporating that definition, the statute provides that \u201c[The MCCA] shall provide and each member shall accept indemnification for 100% of the amount of [the actual loss amounts that a member is obligated to pay and that are paid or payable by the member] sustained under personal protection insurance coverages in excess of [$250,000].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Each claim must meet the requirements of \u00a7 3104(2). First, the claim sought to be indemnified must be for the \u201cultimate loss,\u201d i.e., \u201cthe actual loss amounts that a member is obligated to pay and that are paid or payable by the member.\u201d Second, the claim must be \u201csustained under personal protection insurance coverages.\u201d And third, the loss must be in excess of the statutory threshold.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The MCCA\u2019s obligation to indemnify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>\u201c100%\u201d of the loss is not triggered unless the member insurer\u2019s claim meets all three requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The Legislature has made policy judgments in setting out these requirements. It has determined that only certain, limited claims are \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and require \u201creinsurance\u201d to alleviate the burden placed on insurers providing no-fault coverage. Thus, it is \u201cnecessary or proper to accomplish the [MCCA\u2019s] purposes\u201d and \u201cnot inconsistent with [\u00a7 3104]\u201d for the MCCA to review member insurer claims to ensure that they meet the requirements of \u00a7 3104(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Review of member insurer claims is also consistent with the MCCA\u2019s plan of operation, which, since its original plan of operation in 1978, has provided: \u201cThe Association shall, <em>upon verification of the propriety and amount of the payments made and the member\u2019s entitlement to reimbursement therefor, </em>reimburse the member the amount due it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Moreover, in <em>In re Certified Question (Preferred Risk Mut Ins Co v Michigan Catastrophic Claims Ass\u2019n), </em>this Court implicitly answered in the affirmative whether review of member claims is permitted.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> There, the plaintiff, Preferred Risk, was a member insurer that insured an Illinois resident under a policy written in Illinois. The insured was catastrophically injured in an automobile accident in Michigan. The plaintiff sought indemnification for its losses in excess of the $250,000 statutory threshold.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The MCCA denied the plaintiffs application for indemnification on the basis that the insured was not a \u201cresident.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This Court held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>indemnification requirement of \u00a7 3104(2) only applied to \u201ca policy which was written in this state to provide the security required by \u00a7 3101(1) of the no-fault act. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, this Court implicitly held that the MCCA could review claims to determine whether the member insurer is entitled to indemnification because the Court endorsed the MCCA reviewing the residency of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In addition, <em>In re Certified Question </em>supports the proposition that the MCCA may refuse to indemnify claims that do not meet the requirements of \u00a7 3104(2).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Concomitant with the absence of an obligation to indemnify is the authority to act accordingly and reject claims that do not meet the requirements of \u00a7 3104(2). Indeed, such authority to reject is \u201cnecessary or proper to accomplish\u201d the MCCA\u2019s purpose and not inconsis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>tent with either \u00a7 3104 or the MCCA\u2019s plan of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Accordingly, we hold that MCL 500.3104(8)(g) permits the MCCA to review claims submitted by member insurers and reject those that do not meet the requirements of \u00a7 3104(2). That leads to the dispositive issue whether that authority permits the MCCA to review the reasonableness of charges for attendant care services and refuse to indemnify a member insurer when it deems those charges unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\n<em>B. WHETHER THE MCCA MAY REVIEW THE REASONABLENESS OF ATTENDANT CARE CHARGES AND REFUSE TO INDEMNIFY UNREASONABLE CHARGES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 3104(2) does not contain a \u201creasonableness\u201d requirement and, instead, focus on the fact that they suffered an \u201cactual loss\u201d due to an \u201cobligation.\u201d Plaintiffs also emphasize the term \u201c100%\u201d in \u00a7 3104(2) and argue that if the MCCA indemnifies less than the full amount of their claim, it is not meeting its statutory obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Indeed, \u00a7 3104(2) does not contain the word \u201creasonable\u201d or any variation thereof, and plaintiffs have paid their insureds subject to their obligations under a consent judgment and settlement agreement, respectively. Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments, however, ignore the second requirement of \u00a7 3104(2) \u2014 that the claim must be \u201csustained under personal protection insurance coverages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A3B\">In <em>In re Certified Question, </em>this Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">the reference to \u201cpersonal protection insurance coverages\u201d under which the [MCCA] may be liable for indemnification in the event of a catastrophic loss ... is a shorthand reference to the no-fault personal protection insurance coverages that are generally the subject of the act, i.e., those which were written in this state to provide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>compulsory security requirements of \u00a7 3101(1) of the no-fault act for the \u201cowner or registrant of a motor vehicle required to be registered in this state\u201d ....[<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Policies written in this state to provide the compulsory security requirements of \u00a7 3101(1) must comply with the provisions of the no-fault act. MCL 500.3105(1) obligates a member insurer to pay PIP benefits.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> MCL 500.3107(l)(a) defines PIP benefits, in relevant part, as \u201c[allowable expenses consisting of all reasonable charges incurred for reasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d Thus, a no-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>fault policy written in this state must, at a minimum, provide PIP benefits that include <em>\u201creasonable charges </em>incurred for reasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d It follows that the losses \u201csustained under personal protection insurance coverages\u201d will <em>minimally </em>include \u201creasonable charges.\u201d Insurers are free to provide broader coverage and greater benefits than \u00a7 3107 provides.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Indeed, insurers may provide expanded coverage for actual or even unreasonable charges.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Thus, the member insurer\u2019s policy will ultimately control the standard for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>MCCA\u2019s review because the policy establishes the \u201cpersonal protection insurance coverages.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Whether the subject charges fall within the terms of the individual policies that covered Daniel Migdal and Robert Allen is not before this Court. The parties have not litigated that issue and we are without the facts necessary to resolve it. The issue before this Court is whether the requirement that member insurer claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>be \u201csustained under personal protection insurance coverages\u201d entitles the MCCA to refuse to indemnify unreasonable charges. We hold that when a member insurer\u2019s policy provides coverage only for \u201creasonable charges,\u201d the MCCA has authority to refuse to indemnify unreasonable charges. If the policy provides broader coverage, the MCCA must review for compliance with the broader coverage and indemnify claims within that coverage, but it may reject claims in excess of that coverage. Claims in excess of the member insurer\u2019s PIP coverages are not \u201csustained under personal protection insurance coverages.\u201d Thus, those claims do not meet the three statutory requirements of \u00a7 3104(2) and they do not trigger the MCCA\u2019s obligation to indemnify \u201c100%\u201d of the claimed loss. Rather, the MCCA is only obligated to indemnify \u201c100%\u201d of the portion of the claimed loss that meets all three requirements of \u00a7 3104(2). Accordingly, we remand these cases to the trial court to determine the PIP coverages provided by the individual policies at issue in these cases and, if appropriate, whether the attendant care charges were reasonable.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">All member insurer claims must meet certain requirements of \u00a7 3104(2) to be entitled to indemnification from the MCCA. The MCCA may review those claims for compliance with \u00a7 3104(2) because such review is \u201cnecessary or proper to accomplish\u201d the MCCA\u2019s purpose and is not inconsistent with \u00a7 3104 or the MCCA\u2019s plan of operation.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The MCCA may additionally reject claims that do not meet the requirements of \u00a7 3104(2).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> One such requirement is that the claimed loss must be \u201csustained under personal protection insurance coverages.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> A loss \u201csustained under personal protection insurance coverages\u201d is one sustained under a policy providing \u201cthe compulsory security requirements of \u00a7 3101(1)... .\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 3107(l)(a), such policies minimally include <em>\u201creasonable charges </em>incurred for reasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>covery, or rehabilitation.\u201d When a member insurer\u2019s policy provides coverage consistent with MCL 500.3107(l)(a), the MCCA has authority to refuse to indemnify unreasonable charges.

Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, the MCCA\u2019s authority is not limited to adjusting the member insurer\u2019s \u201cprocedures and practices\u201d; the MCCA is authorized to negotiate directly with the insured to reach a settlement of the claim and, under those circumstances, the MCCA is \u201cadjusting\u201d the amount.

Here, plaintiffs agreed to certain payments in a consent judgment and a settlement agreement and remain bound by those agreements regardless whether the MCCA indemnifies the entire claim or invokes its \u201ctakeover\u201d authority. Although member insurers are not \u201cobligated\u201d to pay their insureds until the claimed expense is actually incurred, see <em>Proudfoot v State Farm Mut Ins Co, </em>469 Mich 476, 484 (2003), any opportunity to \u201cadjust\u201d Migdal\u2019s and Allen\u2019s claims and thereby reduce plaintiffs\u2019 liability before they become obligated is severely limited by the terms of their agreements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b563-9\"> The dissent contends that the consent judgment and settlement agreement became \u201cpart of the insurer\u2019s coverage.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 448. The dissent\u2019s attempt to bootstrap the terms of the consent judgment and settlement agreement into the insureds\u2019 coverages is inconsistent with the dissent\u2019s own definition of \u201ccoverage,\u201d and is unpersuasive. We agree with the dissent that \u201c \u2018coverage\u2019 refers to protection afforded by an insurance polity or the sum of risks assumed by an insurance policy.\u201d <em>Jarrad v Integon Nat\u2019l Ins Co, </em>472 Mich 207, 217; 696 NW2d 621 (2005), citing <em>LeBlanc v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, </em>410 Mich 173, 204; 301 NW2d 775 (1981). Thus, the terms of the <em>policy </em>control the standard for the MCCA\u2019s review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b564-5\"> Each party advances a policy argument in its favor. The MCCA argues that the no-fault system is intended keep automobile insurance costs affordable. See <em>Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>476 Mich 55, 71-72; 718 NW2d 784 (2006) (\u201c[A] dominant legislative purpose permeating throughout the no-fault act is to ensure that this mandatory coverage is affordable.\u201d). The premium the MCCA charges a member insurer is passed on to its insureds. See <em>In re Certified Question, supra </em>at 729; MCL 500.3104(22). As a result, the MCCA argues, if the MCCA must incur significant additional liability for \u201cunreasonable charges,\u201d no-fault insurance costs will rise dramatically. In response, plaintiffs argue that no-fault insurance was intended to provide assured, adequate, and prompt payment. See <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 579-580; 267 NW2d 72 (1978) (\u201cThe goal of the no-fault insurance system was to provide victims of motor vehicle accidents assured, adequate, and prompt reparation for certain economic losses.\u201d); MCL 500.3142. Plaintiffs argue that if the MCCA may reject member insurer claims on the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>reasonableness of the charges, member insurers will need to seek assurances that the MCCA will reimburse certain payments before making them, thus delaying payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Both policy arguments are compelling. It is not for this Court, however, to favor one policy objective over the other. \u201c[P]olicy decisions are properly left for the people\u2019s elected representatives in the Legislature, not the judiciary. The Legislature, unlike the judiciary, is institutionally equipped to assess the numerous trade-offs associated with a particular policy choice.\u201d <em>Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>473 Mich 562, 589; 702 NW2d 539 (2005). The Legislature has made its policy choice. Given the text of MCL 500.3104(2), we believe that the Legislature intended to allow the MCCA to reject claims for charges in excess of the member\u2019s policy coverage. Thus, the parties\u2019 competing policy arguments are misplaced because this Court is without authority to replace the Legislature\u2019s choice with our own.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\"> MCL 500.3104(8)(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b565-8\"> <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\"> MCL 500.3104(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b565-10\"> <em>In re Certified Question, supra </em>at 723.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b566-8\">MARKMAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akl\">(concurring). Although I fully agree with the majority opinion, I write separately to address what I think is its failure to fully explain why its definition of \u201cpersonal insurance protection coverages,\u201d which is limited to a member insurer\u2019s initial insurance <em>policy, </em>is required by the statute. If the majority\u2019s definition is correct, the MCCA will often be allowed to review member claims for reasonableness because the policy itself will often limit claims to \u201creasonable\u201d costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the other hand, if the dissent is correct that settlement agreements and consent judgments are part of a member insurer\u2019s \u201ccoverages,\u201d and indeed may effectively become part of a member\u2019s \u201cpolicy,\u201d then the MCCA will only rarely be allowed to review claims for reasonableness. The question then posed is which of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>interpretations of \u201cpersonal insurance protection coverages\u201d is to be preferred under the law. In my view, the majority\u2019s assertion that \u201ccoverages\u201d refers to the \u201cpolicy,\u201d although ultimately the better definition, requires additional legal analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The disputed statutory provision, MCL 500.3104(2), provides that \u201c[the MCCA] shall provide and each member shall accept indemnification for 100% of the amount of the ultimate loss sustained under personal protection insurance coverages in excess of the [statutory threshold.]\u201d In interpreting this language, our primary goal is to ascertain and give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>McClellan v Collar (On Remand), </em>240 Mich App 403, 409; 613 NW2d 729 (2000). \u201cAs far as possible, effect should be given to every phrase, clause, and word in the statute.\u201d <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 237; 596 NW2d 119 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Here, the dissent has defined \u201ccoverages,\u201d in MCL 500.3104(2), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">Under the common meaning of \u201ccoverage,\u201d the contractual liability amount that an insurer agrees to pay an insured is considered a part of the insurer\u2019s coverage. [Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed).] USF&amp;G and Hartford paid funds pursuant to a consent judgment and a settlement agreement with the respective insureds. This contractual liability, or coverage, owed by each insurer is the total amount agreed to between the original contracting parties. [Posi at 448-450.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Thus, the issue becomes whether \u201ccoverages\u201d includes <em>any </em>contractual liability, which is properly insurable under the act, that a member insurer incurs at <em>any time. </em>The answer lies, I believe, in MCL 500.3104(7)(d), which requires that the MCCA,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">[i]n a manner provided for in the plan of operation, calculate and charge to members of the [MCCA] a total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>premium sufficient to cover the expected losses and expenses of the [MCCA] that the [MCCA] will likely incur during the period for which the premium is applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">This provision requires the MCCA to calculate premiums that it will charge to member insurers on the basis of the losses and expenses that the MCCA expects to incur. A principal component of this calculation is the frequency with which the MCCA will be required to reimburse member insurers for catastrophic claims, and for what amounts. Significantly, if a policy only requires a member insurer to pay \u201creasonable\u201d claims, then the MCCA will charge a lower premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">This conclusion is supported by two observations, which both assume a member\u2019s policy only requires \u201creasonable\u201d payments in accordance with MCL 500.3107. First, where a member insurer only pays \u201creasonable\u201d claims, a member will incur fewer claims that meet the catastrophic threshold for which the MCCA is required to provide reimbursement. Second, the MCCA will anticipate that, when a catastrophic claim <em>does </em>occur, any amount in excess of the statutory threshold will also be \u201creasonable.\u201d In other words, the MCCA\u2019s liability for reasonable claims will clearly be less than payments for unreasonable claims. As a result, the MCCA will charge a lower premium to member insurers if those member insurers pay only \u201creasonable\u201d claims because the MCCA\u2019s \u201cexpected losses and expenses\u201d will be less. Most importantly, the MCCA will only be able to determine the appropriate premiums that its member insurers must pay on the basis of their original policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The real question of interest then becomes what effect a subsequent settlement agreement or consent judgment that requires an arguably <em>unreasonable </em>payment will have on the MCCA\u2019s responsibility to reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>burse claims under the original insurance policy for which it has already calculated and charged its premium. This depends on what, if any, effect these agreements have on the original policy. There are two plausible interpretations of what these types of agreements seek to accomplish. The first is that these are entirely new contracts, for which the member insurers have paid no premiums as contemplated by MCL 500.3104(7)(d). Under this interpretation, the member insurer will not have complied with the statute and will not be entitled to reimbursement from the MCCA. The second interpretation is that these agreements alter or modify the existing policy by further defining that policy\u2019s pre-existing terms (i.e., what is meant by the policy\u2019s requirement that a member insurer pay reasonable personal protection insurance benefits, as required by MCL 500.3107). Under this latter interpretation, if a settlement agreement purports to alter or modify the original policy, then the member insurer will have paid premiums to the MCCA <em>before </em>the accident has occurred. However, any such alteration or modification to a pre-existing policy cannot reasonably increase the MCCA\u2019s liability because a member will only have paid premiums based on the MCCA\u2019s assessment of the initial policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\"><em>Liberty Mut Ins Co v Michigan Catastrophic Claims Ass\u2019n, </em>248 Mich App 35; 638 NW2d 155 (2002), is instructive on this point. <em>Liberty Mut </em>examined a situation in which a member insurer had an insurance policy with an out-of-state driver who subsequently moved to Michigan and catastrophically injured a Michigan resident. The member insurer paid personal protection insurance benefits to the injured Michigan resident based on the out-of-state driver\u2019s policy, even though that policy at the time of the accident was <em>not </em>a Michigan policy. However, in order to be eligible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>MCCA reimbursement, the member insurer attempted to retroactively reform its policy, including remitting unpaid premiums, so as to comply with MCL 500.3104 before submitting its claim to the MCCA. Nevertheless, the MCCA rejected the member insurer\u2019s claim, and the Court of Appeals agreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">If we were to accept plaintiffs argument, we would set a precedent by which an insurer could withhold premium payments for policyholders who moved to Michigan, then, upon a loss exceeding $250,000, the insurer could simply reform the contract, submit the previously due premium payments, and be reimbursed for claims paid in excess of $250,000. Under that situation, the MCCA would be deprived of premiums for policies on which no claims are made, thus defeating the \u201cspread the risk\u201d concept in insurance. <em>[Id. </em>at 47.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">This rationale applies with equal force to settlement agreements and consent judgments that attempt to retroactively increase the scope of a policy\u2019s coverage even <em>after a member insurer has paid its premiums </em>to the MCCA. Although the member insurers in the instant consolidated cases have paid part of their premiums to the MCCA, they have, in one sense, effectively \u201cmisrepresented\u201d to the MCCA what amounts they would pay to their insured drivers in the event of a catastrophic claim. A member insurer that informs the MCCA that it will only pay \u201creasonable\u201d claims, but then subsequently modifies the policy after the accident occurs to include unreasonable claims, has essentially sought reimbursement for claims for which it has not paid premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Additionally, unlike the member insurer in <em>Liberty Mut, </em>the member insurers in this case sought to reform the policy without even purporting to pay the premiums that would have been owed. Such a practice defeats the very purpose of MCL 500.3104(7)(d) by denying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>MCCA the opportunity to impose a properly calculated premium, which is essential to the MCCA\u2019s ability (or indeed any insurer\u2019s ability) to collect sufficient premiums to further its \u201crisk spreading\u201d function. This is clearly contrary to the language of MCL 500.3104(7)(d), which requires the MCCA to impose a premium on a member insurer that is \u201csufficient to cover the expected losses and expenses of the [MCCA] that the [MCCA] will likely incur during the period for which the premium is applicable.\u201d As a result, the majority, in my judgment, correctly concludes that the statute requires that the original policy determine the MCCA\u2019s reimbursement responsibilities.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-9\"> The dissent is correct that the reasonableness requirement of MCL 500.3107 is not integrated into the indemnification clause set forth in \u00a7 3104(2). <em>Post </em>at 457. However, the majority opinion does not attempt to incorporate this requirement into the MCCA\u2019s statutory power to review a member insurer\u2019s claim to ensure it is in compliance with the policy. Rather, it holds that the MCCA can review a member\u2019s claim for compliance <em>with the policy, </em>which, as represented by both parties, generally includes a requirement that member insurers reimburse only <em>reasonable </em>claims based on \u00a7 3107.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b571-6\">WEAVER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJhF\">(dissenting). This Court granted leave to appeal to consider whether MCL 500.3104(2) obligates the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (MCCA) to reimburse a member insurer for personal protection insurance (PIP) benefits paid to a claimant without regard to the reasonableness of the member insurer\u2019s payments of PIP benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">I dissent and would hold that the indemnification obligation set forth in MCL 500.3104(2) does not incorporate the reasonableness standard that MCL 500.3107 requires between claimants and member insurers. Furthermore, the powers granted to the MCCA in \u00a7 3104(7) are limited to adjusting the \u201cpractices and procedures\u201d of the member insurers and do not encompass adjustment to the payment amount agreed to between claimants and member insurers. Moreover, I would hold that the power granted to the MCCA under MCL 500.3104(8)(g) is limited to furthering the purposes of the MCCA, and that determining reasonableness is not one of its purposes. Finally, although the MCCA has no right to directly challenge the reasonableness of a claim, the no-fault statute does provide the MCCA with safe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>guards against negligent actions of member insurers. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"A4\">\n<em>UNITED STATES FIDELITY INSURANCE &amp; GUARANTY CO v MCCA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">In the first case of these consolidated appeals, Daniel Migdal was injured in a 1981 car accident in which he incurred catastrophic injuries. His injuries included a traumatic brain injury with cerebral spastic quadriplegia, severe oral motor apraxia, and dysphasia. Because of the extent of the injuries, Daniel was prescribed, and received, 24-hour-a-day nursing care. In 1988, Michael Migdal (Mr. Migdal), Daniel\u2019s father and the conservator of Daniel\u2019s estate, sued the no-fault insurance provider, United States Fidelity Insurance &amp; Guaranty Company (USF&amp;G), to recover expenses paid for Daniel\u2019s care. In 1990, the parties entered into a consent judgment. Pursuant to the judgment, USF&amp;G paid Mr. Migdal $35,000 in exchange for a release from all contractual liability for nursing care provided before May 10, 1989. Additionally, USF&amp;G agreed to pay $17.50 an hour for Daniel\u2019s home nursing care for the following year.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The payments would be rendered regardless of whether Daniel\u2019s parents provided the nursing care or a third party was brought in to provide the care. The hourly rate, fixed for the first year after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>judgment, was subject to an annual increase of 8.5%. The increased rate would be compounded based on the previous year\u2019s rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Pursuant to the consent judgment, USF&amp;G paid Mr. Migdal the consented-to hourly wage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Once the amount paid to Mr. Migdal had reached the statutory threshold amount of $250,000,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the MCCA began to reimburse USF&amp;G for payments made to Mr. Migdal that exceeded the threshold. However, the MCCA ultimately refused to reimburse USF&amp;G for the amount over $250,000 that USF&amp;G paid Mr. Migdal under the consent judgment. In 2003, USF&amp;G filed a complaint in the Oakland Circuit Court for a declaratory judgment that the MCCA must reimburse USF&amp;G for the total amount that USF&amp;G paid to Mr. Migdal under the consent judgment, regardless of the reasonableness of the amount. At the time, USF&amp;G was paying $54.84 an hour to Mr. Migdal for Daniel\u2019s nursing care.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The MCCA sought to only be required to reimburse USF&amp;G at a rate of $22.05 an hour, arguing that the agreed-upon rate of $54.84 an hour was unreasonable and, therefore, the MCCA should not have to reimburse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>USF&amp;G for the total amount. Meanwhile, USF&amp;G sought to have the consent judgment with Mr. Migdal revised, arguing that circumstances changed when Mr. Migdal hired a third party to care for Daniel instead of providing the nursing care himself. Mr. Migdal filed a motion for summary disposition for failure to state a claim. The court granted Mr. Migdal\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Likewise, the MCCA made a motion for summary disposition. It contended that there was no question of material fact that the payments made by USF&amp;G to Mr. Migdal were unreasonable. Moreover, the MCCA argued that the no-fault act only required reimbursement of payments that are reasonable. In a countermotion for summary disposition, USF&amp;G argued that the no-fault act required the MCCA to reimburse it for the full amount paid to Mr. Migdal, despite any unreasonableness regarding the amount paid. Alternatively, USF&amp;G argued that there was a question of material fact concerning the \u201cunreasonableness\u201d of the consent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The trial court granted USF&amp;G\u2019s motion for summary disposition, ruling that the MCCA must reimburse USF&amp;G for its \u201cultimate loss,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which included the entire amount that USF&amp;G had to pay Mr. Migdal regardless of whether the amount paid was reasonable. The trial court denied the MCCA\u2019s motion for summary disposition. The trial court entered a judgment requiring the MCCA to reimburse USF&amp;G in the amount of $1,725,072 under the no-fault act and holding the MCCA liable for future payments consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>consent judgment. The parties agreed to stay the enforcement of the order while the MCCA appealed by right in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\n<em>HARTFORD INS CO v MCCA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In the second case of these consolidated appeals, Robert Allen was injured in a 2001 car accident in which he incurred catastrophic injuries. His injuries included right-sided pleuritic effusion, brain injuries, quadriparesis, bilateral frozen shoulder, and cardiopathy. Because of the extent of the injuries, Allen was prescribed, and received, 24-hour-a-day care by a licensed nurse. Hartford Insurance Company of the Midwest (Hartford), Allen\u2019s no-fault insurer, initially paid $20 an hour for the nurse. In 2003, Hartford agreed to pay an increased rate of $30 an hour for Allen\u2019s care. Soon thereafter, Hartford\u2019s payments for Allen\u2019s care exceeded the $250,000 statutory threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The MCCA refused to reimburse Hartford for any payments above $20 an hour for the services rendered. Hartford filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment that would require the MCCA to pay Hartford $571,847.21 as reimbursement for payments exceeding the no-fault threshold. Additionally, Hartford sought a declaration that the MCCA must reimburse Hartford for the total payments above the $250,000 threshold, regardless of the reasonableness of the payments. After the initial filing, Hartford moved for summary disposition, arguing that the no-fault act required the MCCA to reimburse Hartford for the entire amount paid to Allen that exceeded the threshold, regardless of the reasonableness of that amount. The MCCA argued that it only had to reimburse Hartford for reasonable payments and that there was insufficient discovery concerning the reasonableness of the amount of the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>ments. The circuit court judge ruled that reasonableness was an element in determining how much the MCCA must reimburse Hartford and that there was insufficient discovery to determine whether the payments were reasonable. Hartford immediately appealed the trial court\u2019s holding requiring the element of reasonableness to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The Court of Appeals consolidated the USF&amp;G and Hartford cases and held that <em>\u201cMCL 500.3104 </em>does not incorporate a \u2018reasonableness\u2019 requirement and requires the MCCA to reimburse insurers for the <em>actual </em>amount of PIP benefits paid in excess of the statutory threshold.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Emphasis in the original). The MCCA sought leave to appeal in this Court, and this Court granted leave.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Statutory interpretation is a question of law, which this Court reviews de novo. <em>In re Investigation of March 1999 Riots in East Lansing (People v Pastor), </em>463 Mich 378, 383; 617 NW2d 310 (2000). This Court reviews de novo a trial court\u2019s decision regarding a motion for summary disposition. <em>Herald Co v Bay City, </em>463 Mich 111, 117; 614 NW2d 873 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">The issue before this Court involves how much of a member insurer\u2019s coverages the MCCA must indemnify in the event of a catastrophic injury. Specifically, is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>MCCA liable for reimbursement of PIP payments based on potentially unreasonable claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The outcome of these cases depends on this Court\u2019s interpretation of the language in MCL 500.3104. An overarching rule of statutory construction is \u201cthat this Court must enforce clear and unambiguous statutory provisions as written.\u201d <em>In re Certified Question Preferred Risk Mut Ins Co v Michigan Catastrophic Claims Ass\u2019n, </em>433 Mich 710, 721; 449 NW2d 660 (1989) (quotations omitted). \u201cIf the language of [a] statute is unambiguous, the Legislature must have intended the meaning clearly expressed, and the statute must be enforced as written.\u201d <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 236; 596 NW2d 119 (1999). However, \u201cwhat is \u2018plain and unambiguous\u2019 often depends on one\u2019s frame of reference.\u201d <em>Shiffer v Gibraltar School Dist Bd of Ed, </em>393 Mich 190, 194; 224 NW2d 255 (1974). In order to ascertain this frame of reference, the contested provisions must be read in relation to the statute as a whole and work in mutual agreement. <em>In re Certified Question, </em>433 Mich at 722. See also <em>State Treasurer v Wilson, </em>423 Mich 138, 144; 377 NW2d 703 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Additionally, the frame of reference shares a deep nexus with the intent of the Legislature. \u201cThe primary goal of statutory interpretation is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Title Office, Inc v Van Buren Co Treasurer, </em>469 Mich 516, 519; 676 NW2d 207 (2004), quoting <em>In re MCI Telecom Complaint, </em>460 Mich 396, 411; 596 NW2d 164 (1999). Fundamentally, \u201c[t]his task begins by examining the language of the statute itself. The words of a statute provide the most reliable evidence of [the Legislature\u2019s] intent. . . .\u201d <em>Sun Valley, </em>460 Mich at 236 (citation and quotation marks omitted). This Court must \u201cconsider both the plain meaning of the critical word or phrase as well as \u2018its placement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>purpose in the statutory scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237, quoting <em>Bailey v United States, </em>516 US 137, 145; 116 S Ct 501; 133 L Ed 2d 472 (1995). \u201cAs far as possible, effect should be given to every phrase, clause, and word in the statute. The statutory language must be read and understood in its grammatical context, unless it is clear that something different was intended.\u201d <em>Sun Valley, </em>460 Mich at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">In interpreting \u00a7 3104, this Court first must determine how \u00a7 3104(2) corresponds with \u00a7 3107 and how these two provisions correspond within the scheme of the entire statute. Section 3104(2) requires that the MCCA \u201cshall provide and each member shall accept indemnification for 100% of the amount of ultimate loss sustained under personal protection insurance coverages in excess of the following amounts in each loss occurrence .... \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 3107(l)(a) defines \u201cpersonal protection insurance <em>ben</em>efits\u201d as \u201c[allowable expenses consisting of all reasonable charges incurred for reasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery or rehabilitation.\u201d This provision requires that all PIP benefits claimed and paid between the insurer and the insured must be reasonable. The MCCA argues that this Court should incorporate the \u00a7 3107 definition of \u201cbenefits\u201d into \u00a7 3104(2) where \u00a7 3104(2) refers to \u201ccoverages.\u201d However, I would decline to do so because the phrase \u201cpersonal protection insurance <em>benefits\u201d </em>has a distinct meaning from the phrase \u201cpersonal protection insurance <em>coverages\u201d </em>that is found in \u00a7 3104(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">When the Legislature uses different words, the words are generally intended to connote different meanings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Simply put, \u201cthe use of different terms within similar statutes generally implies that different meanings were intended.\u201d 2A Singer &amp; Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction (7th ed), \u00a7 46:6, p 252. If the Legislature had intended the same meaning in both statutory provisions, it would have used the same word. This construction rule is the corollary to the rule that \u201cwords used in one place in a statute have the same meaning in every other place in the statute.\u201d <em>Little Caesar Enterprises v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>226 Mich App 624, 630; 575 NW2d 562 (1997). Therefore, I disagree with the MCCA and would hold that the definition of personal protection insurance <em>benefits </em>found in \u00a7 3107(1)(a) (including the reasonableness standard) is not equivalent to the definition of personal protection insurance <em>coverages </em>in \u00a7 3104(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The distinctive use of the term \u201ccoverages\u201d is important. <em>LeBlanc v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, </em>410 Mich 173, 204; 301 NW2d 775 (1981) (\u201c \u2018Coverage\u2019, a word of precise meaning in the insurance industry, refers to protection afforded by an insurance policy, or the sum of the risks assumed by a policy of insurance.\u201d). Although the terms \u201cbenefits\u201d and \u201ccoverages\u201d are related because of their close proximity in the statute,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the proximity of these two terms does not mean that they are synonymous.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Section 3107 excludes from the definition of \u201callowable expenses\u201d within PIP \u201ccoverages\u201d hospital charges in excess of reasonable and customary semi-private room charges and funeral and burial expenses in amounts specified in the policy (subject to a range specified in that section). This leaves all other charges open to PIP \u201ccoverage.\u201d The fact that the Legislature limited the exceptions to \u201ccoverage\u201d so narrowly indicates that the term \u201ccoverage\u201d is a broader term than \u201cbenefits.\u201d Moreover, since \u201ccoverages\u201d is never given a more restrictive definition elsewhere in the statute, the word must be afforded its ordinary everyday meaning. <em>Sun Valley, </em>460 Mich at 237 (\u201cThe statutory language must be read and understood in its grammatical context, unless it is clear that something different was intended.\u201d). In the grammatical context, the meaning of \u201ccoverages\u201d is its common meaning, limited only by the specific statutory exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\u201cCoverage\u201d is defined in dictionaries as the \u201c[ejxtent of protection afforded by an insurance policy [or the] amount of funds reserved to meet liabilities,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as \u201cprotection against a risk or risks specified in an insurance policy,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as \u201cthe risks within the scope of an insurance policy,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and as the \u201camount and extent of risk covered by insurer.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under the common meaning of \u201ccoverage,\u201d the contractual liability amount that an insurer agrees to pay an insured is considered a part of the insurer\u2019s coverage.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> USF&amp;G and Hartford paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>funds pursuant to a consent judgment and a settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>agreement with the respective insureds. This contractual liability, or coverage, owed by each insurer is the total amount agreed to between the original contracting parties. The reasonableness of the agreed payment amount is not a factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The meaning of \u201ccoverages\u201d in MCL 500.3107 becomes clearer after considering \u201c \u2018its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sun Valley, </em>460 Mich at 236, quoting <em>Bailey, </em>516 US at 145. In the statute, \u201ccoverages\u201d is positioned just after \u201cultimate loss.\u201d \u201cUltimate loss\u201d is statutorily defined as the \u201cactual loss amounts that a member is <em>obligated </em>to pay and that are paid or payable by the member ... .\u201d MCL \u00a7 3104(25)(c) (emphasis added). The obligation of the insurer is to fulfill its duty by honoring its contractual coverages. The duty to perform the contract relates back to the ultimate loss insofar as the ultimate loss includes payment of the obligation, i.e., the total contracted amount. Consequently, the MCCA must reimburse the insurers for 100 percent of the ultimate loss, which reflects the amount agreed between the insurer and the insured, and subject to PIP coverage. The ultimate loss specifically refers to coverage, which is broader than benefits and is not statutorily limited to reasonable payments.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Moreover, the MCCA is not a no-fault insurer of its member companies and the member companies are not injured persons entitled to no-fault indemnification. Thus, the relationship between the MCCA and its members is not subject to the reasonableness requirements found in MCL 500.3107. Rather, the Legislature provided in \u00a7 3104(2) that the MCCA would \u201cindemnify\u201d the insuring members for PIP payments. The Legislature did not state that the MCCA would \u201cinsure\u201d or \u201creinsure\u201d the members for amounts greater than the threshold. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed) defines \u201cindemnify\u201d as \u201c[t]o restore the victim of a loss, in whole or in part, by payment. . .; to secure against loss or damage. .. .\u201d Indemnification is not a contingent plan like an insurance plan. Instead, it is a set security meant to assist against certain circumstances. Here, those circumstances arise when the PIP amount contracted by the insurer exceeds the statutory threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Section 3401(1) states that the MCCA is \u201cnot subject to any laws.. . with respect to insurers.\u201d Thus, the MCCA is not a no-fault insurance agency, and consequently it is not a reinsurance agency either. Because the MCCA is not a no-fault insurer, but, rather, an indemnitor of no-fault insurers for benefits in excess of the statutory threshold, \u00a7 3107 does not directly bind the MCCA; it only binds the insurance members and the insured. Section 3107 \u201cmakes both reasonableness and necessity explicit and necessary elements of a <em>claimant\u2019s </em>[insured\u2019s] recovery. . ..\u201d <em>Nasser v Auto Club Ins </em>Ass\u2019n, 435 Mich 33, 49; 457 NW2d 637 (1990) (emphasis added). Specifically, it is the insurance company that has the right to deny a claim (or part of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>claim) for unreasonableness under \u00a7 3107. The <em>insured </em>then has the burden to prove that the charges are in fact reasonable. See generally <em>Nasser, </em>435 Mich 33, <em>Manley v Detroit Automobile Inter-Ins Exch, </em>425 Mich 140; 388 NW2d 216 (1986), and <em>LaMothe v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>214 Mich App 577; 543 NW2d 42 (1995). Given that the established burden of proof is on the insured, it is counterintuitive to conclude that the member insurance company would benefit from not having the burden of proof in one instance against an insured, but having the burden in another instance against the MCCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The MCCA maintains that the foregoing statutory constructions will lead to higher costs to the insured and will be a disincentive for member insurers to keep payments reasonable. These fears are unfounded. The MCCA is an unincorporated nonprofit association, whose purpose is to provide insurers with indemnification for PIP policies that exceed a certain threshold. See MCL 500.3104(1). The Legislature created the MCCA \u201cin response to concerns that Michigan\u2019s no-fault law provision for unlimited [PIP] benefits placed too great a burden on insurers, particularly small insurers, in the event of \u2018catastrophic\u2019 injury claims.\u201d <em>In re Certified Question, </em>433 Mich at 714. The MCCA maintains that it should have the ability to unilaterally stop making indemnification payments to a member when it determines that the claim payments are unreasonable. Yet, the MCCA acknowledges that a member can take the MCCA to court over a reasonableness dispute, which would leave a finder of fact as the ultimate authority over whether the payments are reasonable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>In essence, under the MCCA\u2019s preferred outcome, when a member insurer makes an agreement with an insured (often in a court setting, whether it be an arbitration hearing, consent judgment, or declaratory judgment), the member must then sue the MCCA if the MCCA finds that the payment is unreasonable. If this Court were to accept the MCCA\u2019s argument, the logical consequence would be that member insurers would be reluctant to settle with the claimant. The member insurer could then force a jury trial with every catastrophically injured claimant under this benefit in order to secure a verdict with a \u201creasonable\u201d stamp on the result. This outcome goes against the legislative purpose of assuring efficient and quick recovery for claimants in the no-fault system. <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 578-579; 267 NW2d 72 (1978) (\u201cThe goal of the no-fault insurance system was to provide victims of motor vehicle accidents assured, adequate, and prompt reparation for certain economic losses.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">In response to the MCCA\u2019s concerns, it should be pointed out that the MCCA is not without a safeguard to protect against unreasonable payments. The Legislature specifically laid out powers that the MCCA could exercise to guard against the possibility that an insurer might take inadequate steps to obtain a review and reasonable settlement of catastrophic claims. MCL 500.3104(7)(b) states that the MCCA shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">Establish procedures by which members shall promptly report to the association each claim that, on the basis of the injuries or damages sustained, may reasonably be anticipated to involve the association if the member is ultimately held legally liable for the injuries or damages. Solely for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>purpose of reporting claims, <em>the member shall in all instances consider itself legally liable for the injuries or damages. </em>The member shall also advise the association of subsequent developments likely to materially affect the interest of the association in the claim. [Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">This statutory language establishes that the MCCA must create a structure whereby members are bound and liable to the MCCA to deliver paperwork regarding potential claims that would exceed the threshold and consequently affect the MCCA. The MCCA\u2019s plan of operation likewise echoes these statutory requirements.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Specifically, this language requires that the MCCA\u2019s safety check over the member\u2019s claim must occur upon the member\u2019s <em>anticipation </em>that the payment will affect the MCCA, or if the agreement has already been made, when circumstances change and the member believes the payment to the insured will soon affect the MCCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">It is <em>only </em>at these times, not after, that the MCCA can take action regarding the claim. MCL 500.3104(7)(g). Accordingly, the MCCA must respond in accordance with \u00a7 3104(7)(g). Under \u00a7 3104(7)(g), the MCCA must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">[e]stablish procedures for reviewing claims procedures and practices of members of the association. <em>If the claims procedures or practices of a member are considered inad</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>equate to properly service the liabilities of the association, the association may undertake </em>or may contract with another person, including another member, <em>to adjust or assist in the adjustment of claims </em>for the member on claims that create a potential liability to the association and may charge the cost of the adjustment to the member. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">More clearly, when \u00a7 3104(7) (g) is read in conjunction with \u00a7 3104(7)(b), the outcome is that the MCCA is required to review those reports by members that anticipate needing indemnification and to assess the adequacy of the <em>procedures or practices </em>of the member.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Upon a finding of inadequacy, the MCCA can adjust the <em>practices or procedures </em>of the member.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> One of the key protections here is that MCCA has the power and duty to adjust <em>only </em>\u201cprocedures and practices\u201d of the member that produce an unreasonable payment amount; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>power does not include the power to adjust the amount.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The MCCA has the power to adjust situations that it anticipates will compromise its indemnification or will require it to pay unreasonable claims only if it can find fault with the member\u2019s methods or calculation of charges. Furthermore, the MCCA has the power, in adjusting the procedures and practices of member insurers, to require member insurers to inform the MCCA of any claim that could foreseeably exceed the statutory threshold and to afford the MCCA the opportunity to object to proposed settlement agreements regarding those claims. By requiring submission of proposed settlement agreements for the MCCA approval, the MCCA could protect against having to later pay unreasonable claims from member insurers. The exercise of these powers is the MCCA\u2019s safeguard from a member\u2019s neglect of its duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Finally, the MCCA argues that \u00a7 3104(8)(g) gives it the power to question reasonableness regardless of the statute\u2019s other provisions. Specifically, \u00a7 3104(8)(g) allows the MCCA to \u201c[p]erform other acts not specifically enumerated in this section that are necessary or proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>to accomplish the purposes of the association and that are not inconsistent with this section or the plan of operation.\u201d However, this section does not give the MCCA <em>carte blanche </em>to simply avoid whichever member insurer\u2019s agreement that it finds unreasonable. The power granted under \u00a7 3104(8)(g) is limited to accomplishing the \u201cpurposes of the association.\u201d More importantly, the exercise of this power cannot be \u201cinconsistent with this section or the plan of operation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plan of operation, created by \u00a7 3104(17), must be <em>\u201cconsistent </em>with the objectives and provisions of this section, which shall provide for the economical, fair, and nondiscriminatory administration of the association <em>and for the prompt and efficient provision of indemnity.\u201d </em>MCL 500.3104(17) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Section 3104(8)(g) allows the MCCA to fulfill the specific requirements of the statute. Accordingly, I would interpret \u00a7 3104(8)(g) as granting the MCCA the limited power to further its purpose of prompt and efficient indemnification to its members. To interpret that section as granting any further power, such as the power to decline indemnification on the basis of the reasonableness of the indemnification amount, would be inconsistent with the intention of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">I would hold that the indemnification obligation set forth in \u00a7 3104(2) does not incorporate the reasonableness standard that \u00a7 3107 requires between claimants and member insurers. Furthermore, the powers granted to the MCCA in \u00a7 3104(7) are limited to adjusting the \u201cpractices and procedures\u201d of the member insurers and do not encompass adjustment to the payment amount agreed to between claimants and member insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Finally, I would hold that the power granted to the MCCA under \u00a7 3104(8) (g) is limited to furthering the purposes of the MCCA, and that determining reasonableness is not one of its purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Accordingly, I dissent and would affirm the Court of Appeals holding that the MCCA must reimburse its member insurers 100 percent of the ultimate loss exceeding the statutory threshold for claims regardless of the reasonableness of the amount.</p>\n<judges id=\"b590-7\">CAVANAGH and KELLY, JJ., concurred with WEAVER, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\"> Mr. Migdal created a company to manage Daniel\u2019s care.

However, the majority erroneously limits the term \u201ccoverages\u201d by incorporating into its definition the reasonableness requirement for \u201cbenefits\u201d found in \u00a7 3107. However, as the various definitions of \u201ccoverage\u201d reveal, \u201ccoverages\u201d is not such a specific term that it can be limited to the amount of \u201cbenefits\u201d payable under a policy. Rather, \u201ccoverages\u201d is a broad term that applies to different categories of risks. Hence, the Legislature used \u201cbenefits\u201d and \u201ccoverages\u201d as distinct terms with distinct meanings. By incorporating the reasonableness requirement of \u201cbenefits\u201d into \u201ccoverages,\u201d the majority blurs the meaning of the terms and ignores the broad common meaning of \u201ccoverages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The majority opinion relies significantly on language from <em>In re Certified Question </em>that limits the indemnification requirement of \u00a7 3104(2) to \u201ca policy which was written in this state to provide the compulsory security requirements of \u00a7 3101(1) of the no-fault act for the \u2018owner or registrant of a motor vehicle required to be registered in this state.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Certified Question, </em>433 Mich at 723. The majority seizes on this language as \u201cimplicitly\u201d holding that the MCCA may review claims to determine whether members are entitled to indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>In re Certified Question </em>in this case is flawed. First, it notes that the <em>In re Certified Question </em>Court allowed the MCCA to determine whether the insured was a \u201cresident\u201d of the state. Once the residency question was resolved, the Court determined that the MCCA was not required to indemnify the insurer because \u00a7 3104(2) does not apply to PIP payments to nonresidents. Therefore, the benefits at issue in <em>In re Certified Question </em>were paid pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 3163 of the no-fault act, not \u00a7 3101. By contrast, the policies at issue here clearly were written to provide the security required by \u00a7 3101. <em>In re Certified Question </em>at most only gave the MCCA the authority to reject indemnification for benefits paid to nonresidents under \u00a7 3163. Thus, to the extent that the majority opinion relies on <em>In re Certified Question </em>as determinative here, it errs. The majority goes too far by endorsing an extension of the holding of <em>In re Certified Question </em>to allow the MCCA to resolve <em>any </em>question about whether \u00a7 3104(2) applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Further, in <em>In re Certified Question, </em>once the residency question was answered, it was objectively clear from the statutory language that \u00a7 3104(2) did not apply. In contrast, in this case the majority extends the reasoning of <em>In re Certified Question </em>to allow the MCCA to make subjective \u201creasonableness\u201d determinations about the insurer\u2019s payment of PIP benefits. Yet nothing in the statutory scheme explicitly gives the MCCA the authority to make such a determination. The majority claims that \u201c[cjoncomitant with the absence of an obligation to indemnify is the authorify to act accordingly and reject claims that do not meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>requirements of \u00a7 3104(2).\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 427.1 disagree. Again, <em>In re Certified Question </em>only relieved the MCCA of its obligation to indemnify benefits paid under \u00a7 3163. <em>In re Certified Question </em>did not, explicitly or implicitly, grant the MCCA additional authority beyond the authority granted to it by the plain language of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b582-8\"> The MCCA argues that if there is not a reasonableness factor for them to enforce, then the member insurers will have no incentive to make reasonable settlement deals that do not exceed the statutory threshold amount because the insurers will not be liable to pay anything beyond the threshold amount. However, one incentive comes from higher premiums paid to the MCCA. See MCL 500.3104(7)(d) (requiring that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>MCCA assess its member companies an annual premium on each of their no-fault policies written in Michigan). If all the individual members act in a manner that does not regard the reasonableness of their settlements, then insurance premiums will increase greatly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\"> Presumably, under the statute, the costs of this trial would be covered or charged to the member insurer. See MCL 500.3104(7)(g) (the MCCA \u201cmay charge the cost of adjustment to the member\u201d that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>MCCA deems to have inadequate practices or procedures); MCL 500.3104(7)(b) (\u201cSolely for the purpose of reporting claims, the member shall in all instances consider itself legally liable for the injuries or damages.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b586-9\"> Section 3104 includes numerous other rules for the MCCA, such as membership requirements, liability, and creation of a \u201cplan of operation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b586-10\"> Art X, \u00a7 10.01 of the plan of operation provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-11\">Members shall report to the Association such information as the Board may require on forms prescribed by the Board: (a) As soon as practicable after the loss occurrence, Members shall report each claim which, on the basis of the injuries or damages sustained, may reasonably be anticipated to result in a Reimbursable Ultimate Loss, and for purposes of reporting the Member shall consider itself legally liable for the injuries and damages.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\"> The MCCA argued that since part of \u00a7 3104(7)(g) uses the term \u201cmay\u201d instead of \u201cmust\u201d in describing some of its potential powers, the MCCA has greater power than what directly follows in the statute to limit or control the individual member insurers. The MCCA wishes to conclude that since the section does not set forth a duty to act in a specific way (e.g., review claims), it allows the MCCA to act how <em>it </em>wants regarding member claims, including questioning their reasonableness. This is erroneous. The starting general presumption and purpose of the MCCA is to indemnify insurers for payments beyond the threshold amount, so that smaller insurance firms can continue to exist in the no-fault world of Michigan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\"> The plan of operation also echoes the statute in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">If a Member or 3103 Member refuses to timely submit the reports or information required of it pursuant to Section 10.01 or otherwise, or if the Board should determine that the reports and information submitted by a Member or 3103 Member are unreliable or incomplete, the Board may, at the member\u2019s expense, direct that an authorized representative of the Association (which may be another member) shall audit and inspect such member\u2019s records and compile the required information and data. [Art X, \u00a7 10.02.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b588-7\"> Although \u00a7 3104(7)(g) states that the MCCA may \u201cadjust or assist in the adjustment of claims,\u201d the practical effect of \u00a7 3104(7)(g) is that only the MCCA is able to adjust a member insurer\u2019s procedures and practices with regard to the reasonableness of the amounts paid to insureds. When the MCCA asserts its power to adjust or assist in the adjustment of a claim, the MCCA effectively steps into the shoes of the member insurer. The claim that the MCCA reviews for adjustment purposes is the claim made by the insured to the member insurer, not the reimbursement claim made by the member insurer to the MCCA. Thus, the MCCA, standing in the shoes of the member insurer, is limited to the member insurer\u2019s power to review the insured\u2019s claim for reasonableness as spelled out in the member insurer\u2019s policy, a settlement agreement, or a consent judgment. With regard to the reasonableness of the amount paid to the insured, the amount is still dictated by the amount that the member insurer is \u201cobligated\u201d to pay to the insured.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
