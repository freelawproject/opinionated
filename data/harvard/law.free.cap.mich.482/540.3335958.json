The trial court held that defendant is not entitled to a new trial because he failed to establish actual prejudice. The Court of Appeals, on the other hand, held that defendant is entitled to a new trial because the presence of the convicted felon on his jury did prejudice him. We do not believe that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial under these circumstances because the trial court did not clearly err in concluding that defendant failed to establish that he was actually prejudiced. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the Court of Appeals for it to address defendant\u2019s remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct for forcing his then-girlfriend\u2019s seven-year-old daughter to perform fellatio on him. Before sentencing, defendant learned that one of the jurors had concealed the fact that he had been convicted of assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct in 1991 and 1999 for having assaulted his sister and another person to whom he referred as an \u201cadopted child\u201d who was \u201cmore like a niece.\u201d An evidentiary hearing was held. The juror in question stated that he did not reveal his prior convictions on his juror questionnaire because they were old and he did not believe that they were even on his record anymore.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He further stated that because he had pleaded guilty in both of his criminal cases, he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>never before been through a jury selection process. When asked whether he had been intentionally untruthful so that he could sit as a juror, he answered, \u201cno,\u201d and he indicated that he \u201cdidn\u2019t really want to sit on the panel in the first place . . . .\u201d The juror further testified that he had tried to be fair during the trial and that he never tried to improperly persuade the jury. Following this testimony, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, ruling that there was no evidence that defendant had suffered actual prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court explained that if the parties had known about the juror\u2019s past convictions, the prosecutor, not the defendant, would have most likely been the one seeking to excuse this juror. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded for a new trial on the basis of juror misconduct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued January 17, 2008 (Docket No. 273488). We granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal and limited the issues to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">(1) whether the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction and remanding this case to the circuit court for a new trial pursuant to <em>People v DeHaven, </em>321 Mich 327 (1948); (2) whether <em>DeHaven </em>was wrongly decided or has been superseded by MCL 600.1354(1); (3) whether a criminal defendant must establish actual prejudice pursuant to MCL 600.1354(1) where the challenged juror was excusable for cause; (4) how the \u201cactual prejudice\u201d standard for purposes of MCL 600.1354(1) should be defined; and (5) whether the juror\u2019s failure to disclose his status as a felon, which disqualified him from serving on the jury, constituted structural error pursuant to <em>Neder v United States, </em>527 US 1 (1999). [481 Mich 851, 851-852 (2008).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">A trial court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>People v Cress, </em>468 Mich 678, 691; 664 NW2d 174 (2003). \u201cClear error exists if the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>People v Johnson, </em>466 Mich 491, 497-498; 647 NW2d 480 (2002). A trial court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for a new trial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Cress, </em>468 Mich at 691. An abuse of discretion occurs only \u201cwhen the trial court chooses an outcome falling outside [the] principled range of outcomes.\u201d <em>People v Babcock, </em>469 Mich 247, 269; 666 NW2d 231 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">There are several statutory qualifications that a person must satisfy in order to be eligible to serve as a juror. MCL 600.1307a(l) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\">To qualify as a juror a person shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>(a) Be a citizen of the United States, 18 years of age or older, and a resident in the county for which the person is selected, and in the case of a district court in districts of the second and third class, be a resident of the district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">(b) Be able to communicate in the English language.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">(c) Be physically and mentally able to carry out the functions of a juror. Temporary inability shall not be considered a disqualification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">(d) Not have served as a petit or grand juror in a court of record during the preceding 12 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">(e) <em>Not have been convicted of a felony. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">If a potential juror does not satisfy one of these statutory qualifications, a party may challenge the potential juror for cause. MCR 2.511(D)(1). There are also several other grounds that would justify a challenge for cause. MCR 2.511(D) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-10\">It is grounds for a challenge for cause that the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-11\">(1) <em>is not qualified to be a juror,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-12\">(2) is biased for or against a party or attorney;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-13\">(3) shows a state of mind that will prevent the person from rendering a just verdict, or has formed a positive opinion on the facts of the case or on what the outcome should be;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-14\">(4) has opinions or conscientious scruples that would improperly influence the person\u2019s verdict;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-15\">(5) has been subpoenaed as a witness in the action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-16\">(6) has already sat on a trial of the same issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-17\">(7) has served as a grand or petit juror in a criminal case based on the same transaction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-18\">(8) is related within the ninth degree (civil law) of consanguinity or affinity to one of the parties or attorneys;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-19\">(9) is the guardian, conservator, ward, landlord, tenant, employer, employee, partner, or client of a party or attorney;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>(10) is or has been a party adverse to the challenging party or attorney in a civil action, or has complained of or has been accused by that party in a criminal prosecution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">(11) has a financial interest other than that of a taxpayer in the outcome of the action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">(12) is interested in a question like the issue to be tried. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">MCR 6.412(D)(2) provides that if \u201cthe court finds that a ground for challenging a juror for cause is present, the court on its own initiative should, or on motion of either party must, excuse the juror from the panel.\u201d Similarly, MCL 600.1337 states that \u201c[wjhen the court finds that a person in attendance at court as a juror is not qualified to serve as a juror, or is exempt and claims an exemption, the court shall discharge him or her from further attendance and service as a juror.\u201d Finally, MCL 600.1354(1) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">Failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall not... affect the validity of a jury verdict unless the party ... claiming invalidity has made timely objection and unless the party demonstrates <em>actual prejudice </em>to his cause and unless the noncomplianee is substantial. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">In the instant case, because the juror in question was a convicted felon, he was not statutorily qualified to serve as a juror under MCL 600.1307a(l)(e). However, as a result of the juror\u2019s false answers on his juror questionnaire, neither of the parties nor the tried court had any knowledge of the juror\u2019s felony convictions, and, thus, the parties did not challenge the juror pursuant to MCR 2.511(D)(1) and the trial court did not discharge the juror pursuant to MCL 600.1337 and MCR 6.412(D)(2). Accordingly, the issue here is whether defendant is entitled to a new trial as a result of this convicted felon having served on his jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Although a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to be tried by an impartial jury, US Const, Am VI;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a criminal defendant does not have a constitutional right to be tried by a jury free of convicted felons.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Instead, the right to a jury free of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>convicted felons is granted by statute. And by statute, a violation of this \u201cright\u201d only requires a new trial if the defendant demonstrates that such a violation \u201cactually] prejudice[d]\u201d him. MCL 600.1354(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">A juror\u2019s failure to disclose information that the juror should have disclosed is only prejudicial if it denied the defendant an impartial jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201c[Defendants] are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>entitled to a new trial unless the juror\u2019s failure to disclose denied [the defendants] their right to an impartial jury.\u201d <em>McDonough Power Equip, Inc v Greenwood, </em>464 US 548, 549; 104 S Ct 845; 78 L Ed 2d 663 (1984). \u201c \u2018The misconduct must be such as to reasonably indicate that a fair and impartial trial was not had . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Nick, </em>360 Mich 219, 230; 103 NW2d 435 (1960), quoting 39 Am Jur, New Trial, \u00a7 70, p 85.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">In <em>Froede v Holland Ladder &amp; Mfg Co, </em>207 Mich App 127, 135; 523 NW2d 849 (1994), the Court of Appeals held that actual prejudice was established because the juror at issue had deliberately misrepresented her criminal history on the juror questionnaire and had previously hired an assassin to kill a drug informant who had agreed to testify against the juror\u2019s ex-husband (a notorious drug kingpin). However, the Court of Appeals \u201ccaution[ed] that our opinion is not to stand for the proposition that prejudice will always be found when a convicted felon makes a misrepresentation on a juror questionnaire or at voir dire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals clearly indicated that its bases for finding actual prejudice were the juror\u2019s <em>deliberate </em>misrepresentation and the nature of the juror\u2019s criminal history, i.e., she hired an assassin to kill a potential witness. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>In <em>People v Carey, </em>110 Mich App 187, 193; 312 NW2d 205 (1981), the Court of Appeals held that the trial court did not err in failing to declare a mistrial when it was discovered shortly after deliberations had begun that one of the jurors was a convicted felon, in part because defendant did not demonstrate that he had been actually prejudiced. In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on the fact that the \u201cjuror testified that his convictions would not affect his ability to render an impartial verdict.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">As we explained earlier, defendants have a constitutional right to an impartial jury. However, as Justice COOLEY, writing for this Court, explained, jurors are \u201cpresumed to be. . . impartial, until the contrary is shown.\u201d <em>Holt v People, </em>13 Mich 224, 228 (1865). The burden is on the defendant to establish that the juror was not impartial or at least that the juror\u2019s impartiality is in reasonable doubt. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>In <em>Nick, </em>the defendant argued that he was entitled to a new trial because one of the jurors had failed to disclose the fact that her father was an attorney practicing in the area and defense counsel had made some reference to her father during the trial. This Court held that the defendant was not entitled to a new trial because he had not established that the juror was not impartial. <em>Nick, </em>360 Mich at 234. As this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">\u201c[I]t is well established that not every instance of misconduct in a juror will require a new trial. The general principle underlying the cases is that the misconduct must be such as to affect the impartiality of the jury .... A new trial will not be granted for misconduct of the jury if no substantial harm was done thereby to the party seeking a new trial.... The misconduct must be such as to reasonably indicate that a fair and impartial trial was not had ....\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 230, quoting 39 Am Jur, New Trial, \u00a7 70, p 85.][<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>In the instant case, defendant\u2019s only complaint about the juror at issue in this case is that he is a convicted felon.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, defendant has offered no evidence that the juror was not impartial. In <em>Holt, </em>13 Mich at 229, the Court concluded that the juror\u2019s own admission that he had formed a partial opinion regarding the defendant\u2019s guilt before the trial even began was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>sufficient to rebut that juror\u2019s impartiality.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> If even such an admission is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of impartiality, we fail to see how a juror\u2019s mere <em>status </em>as a convicted felon can be considered sufficient to rebut that presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Defendant has not offered any evidence to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the convicted felon\u2019s presence on his jury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That is, defendant has offered no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>evidence to establish that the juror was partial. The juror testified that his status as a felon did not affect his deliberations and that he did not share this information with the other jurors or try to improperly persuade the rest of the jurors in any way.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> There is simply no evidence that this juror improperly affected any other jurors. Furthermore, as the trial court explained, this juror would likely have been more harmful to the prosecutor than to defendant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Having been previously convicted of similar offenses, the juror, if anything, likely would have been sympathetic towards defendant.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> For these reasons, we do not believe that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>trial court clearly erred in ruling that defendant had not demonstrated that he was actually prejudiced by the convicted felon\u2019s presence on his jury.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>In addition, the presence of a convicted felon on defendant\u2019s jury did not constitute structural error. A structural error is a \u201cfundamental <em>constitutional </em>error[] that \u2018def[ies] analysis by \u201charmless error\u201d standards.\u2019 \u201d <em>Neder v United States, </em>527 US 1, 7; 119 S Ct 1827; 144 L Ed 2d 35 (1999) (emphasis added; citations omitted). Here, there was no constitutional error. As discussed above, there is no constitutional right to have a jury free of convicted felons. Therefore, that a convicted felon sat as a juror on defendant\u2019s jury did not constitute a structural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The Court of Appeals in the instant case relied heavily on <em>People v DeHaven, </em>321 Mich 327; 32 NW2d 468 (1948), <em>People v Daoust, </em>228 Mich App 1; 577 NW2d 179 (1998), <em>People v Manser, </em>250 Mich App 21; 645 NW2d 65 (2002), and <em>People v Crear, </em>242 Mich App 158; 618 NW2d 91 (2000), to conclude that defendant is entitled to a new trial. However, none of those cases involved the question that is at issue here: whether the presence of a convicted felon on a defendant\u2019s jury requires a new trial. Furthermore, none of those cases involved the application of MCL 600.1354(1) because none involved \u201cfailure[s] to comply with the provisions of [chapter 13 of the Revised Judicature Act, MCL 600.1300 <em>et </em>seq.],\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and because <em>DeHaven </em>was decided before MCL 600.1354(1) was even enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In <em>DeHaven, </em>a case in which the defendant was charged with and ultimately convicted of raping his 13-year-old stepdaughter, two related jurors failed to disclose that one of their family members had been convicted of raping his 13-year-old daughter. The trial court found that the jurors had not been dishonest during voir dire, that they had indicated that they could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>fairly and impartially sit as jurors, and that any prejudices the jurors did have would likely have benefitted the defendant anyway. For these reasons, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. This Court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">After indicating that the \u201cright to be tried by an impartial jury is a constitutional guaranty,\u201d <em>DeHaven </em>concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">The normal person revolts at the thought of a father or stepfather raping a 13-year-old girl. We are of the opinion that the relationship of these two jurors to one who had committed a similar crime was such that it deprived them of the capacity to act impartially. Defendant has the right to a trial by an impartial jury. We cannot say that he had such a trial. <em>[DeHaven, </em>321 Mich at 334.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">As discussed earlier, <em>DeHaven </em>is distinguishable from the instant case because the former did not involve a juror who was a convicted felon and it did not involve MCL 600.1354(1).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In addition, it appears that <em>DeHaven </em>reviewed de novo the question whether the two jurors were biased, rather than for clear error. As discussed above, an appellate court must review a trial court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, <em>Cress, </em>468 Mich at 691, and the appellate court should only reverse such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>findings if it is \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>466 Mich at 497-498. In <em>DeHaven, </em>the trial court determined that the jurors were not biased, but, even if they were, such bias would have benefitted the defendant. <em>DeHaven, </em>321 Mich at 331. <em>DeHaven, </em>however, did not even mention the trial court\u2019s factual findings in its analysis, and clearly reviewed the issue de novo. That is, <em>DeHaven </em>concluded that the jurors were biased and that they were biased against the defendant, without giving any significance to the fact that the trial court, which was obviously in the better position to determine whether the jurors were biased and against which party, had already concluded that the jurors were not biased, but, if they were, they were biased in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><em>DeHaven </em>also reviewed de novo, rather than for an abuse of discretion, the issue whether defendant was entitled to a new trial. As discussed earlier, a trial court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for a new trial must be reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Cress, </em>468 Mich at 691. An abuse of discretion occurs only \u201cwhen the trial court chooses an outcome falling outside [the] principled range of outcomes.\u201d <em>Babcock, </em>469 Mich at 269. In <em>DeHaven, </em>the trial court held that the defendant was not entitled to a new trial. However, <em>DeHaven, </em>without giving any significance at all to the trial court\u2019s decision, held that the defendant was entitled to a new trial. That is, <em>DeHaven </em>clearly engaged in de novo review, rather than the abuse of discretion review that it should have.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Moreover, our \u201charmless error\u201d jurisprudence has evolved significantly since <em>DeHaven </em>was decided in 1948. As explained in <em>People v Bell, </em>473 Mich 275, 294; 702 NW2d 128 (2005) (opinion by CORRIGAN, J.), \u201cour harmless error jurisprudence has evolved a great deal. . . .\u201d Errors generally no longer require automatic reversal. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750, 774; 597 NW2d 130 (1999). Instead, a preserved, nonconstitutional error is not a ground for reversal unless the defendant proves that it is \u201cmore probable than not that the error was outcome determinative.\u201d <em>People v Lukity, </em>460 Mich 484, 495-496; 596 NW2d 607 (1999). Even a preserved, constitutional error is generally not a ground for reversal if the prosecutor proves that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>People v Anderson (After Remand), </em>446 Mich 392, 406; 521 NW2d 538 (1994).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> An unpreserved error is not a ground for reversal unless the defendant can demonstrate that the error was plain, that it affected the outcome, and that it resulted in the conviction of an actually innocent person or \u201c \u2018 \u201cseriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d ....\u2019\u201d <em>Carines, </em>460 Mich at 763-764 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">With regard to the specific issue here, i.e., juror misconduct, this Court has held that \u201ca verdict in a criminal case should not be upset because of alleged misconduct on the part of members of the jury unless \u2018substantial harm\u2019 has resulted . . . .\u201d <em>Nick, </em>360 Mich at 230. \u201c \u2018 \u201c[A litigant] is entitled to a fair trial hut not a perfect one\u201d for there are no perfect trials.\u2019 \u201d <em>McDon</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number><em>ough, </em>464 US at 553 (citations omitted). \u201cWe have ... come a long way from the time when all trial error was presumed prejudicial and reviewing courts were considered \u2018 \u201ccitadels of technicality.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201cThe harmless-error rules . .. embody the principle that courts should exercise judgment in preference to the automatic reversal for \u2018error\u2019 and ignore errors that do not affect the essential fairness of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. DeHaven, </em>however, made absolutely no mention of any \u201charmless error\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Finally, the crux of DeHaven's holding was that a defendant has a constitutional right to an impartial jury and, because the jurors at issue in <em>DeHaven </em>lacked the capacity to act impartially, the defendant was entitled to a new trial. <em>DeHaven, </em>321 Mich at 334. There is no question that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to be tried by an impartial jury. US Const, Am VI; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20. However, the instant question is whether the presence of a convicted felon on defendant\u2019s jury denied defendant his right to an impartial jury.

On the morning of the second day of defendant\u2019s trial, during a break in the girlfriend\u2019s testimony, one of the jurors indicated that he may have attended junior high school with the girlfriend. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s request to remove the juror, and the Court of Appeals held that defendant was not entitled to a new trial.

Furthermore, if the defendant were correct that every conviction that was obtained from a jury with an unqualified juror on it had to be reversed, all jury verdicts would be second-guessed.

Because Michigan\u2019s rule <em>does </em>list grounds for challenges for cause, and because one of these grounds is that the juror is not qualified to sit as a juror (which qualifications do not pertain to a juror\u2019s capability of being impartial), our standard to obtain a new trial does not focus on whether a \u201ccorrect response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause,\u201d but, instead, focuses on whether the juror was impartial.

The majority concludes that the trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The court ruled that defendant had failed to establish that he was actually prejudiced, pursuant to MCL 600.1354(1), by the presence of a convicted felon on his jury. The majority finds no clear error in this ruling. For the reasons set forth below, I believe that the Court of Appeals properly reversed the trial court and granted defendant a new trial. Its opinion should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The Ottawa County Prosecutor\u2019s Office charged defendant with one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC I). The charge was based on defendant\u2019s alleged act of forcing his ex-girlfriend\u2019s seven-year-old daughter to perform fellatio on him. Following a two-day jury trial, defendant was convicted as charged. Defense counsel then learned that one of the deliberating jurors, Jesse Lara, was a registered sexual offender. Defendant filed a motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct. Lara had answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question on his juror questionnaire regarding whether he had ever been a defendant in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The trial court held an evidentiary hearing. Lara testified that he had been convicted of assault with intent to commit sexual conduct involving penetration seven years before and criminal sexual conduct 15 years before. As a result of these convictions, he was required to register with the Michigan Public Sexual Offender Registry. Lara also testified that one of his victims was his sister. He referred to the other as \u201can adopted child\u201d who was \u201cmore like a niece.\u201d Lara further stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>he had completed and signed a juror questionnaire that contained the following question: \u201cHave you ever been a victim, witness, plaintiff, or defendant in a criminal or civil suit?\u201d The questionnaire also asked whether he had been convicted of a felony, misdemeanor, or traffic violation. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to both questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Lara justified his \u201cNo\u201d answers by stating that he had been untruthful \u201cbecause that was a long time ago.\u201d He claimed that he thought his convictions would remain on his record only \u201cfor maybe seven years.\u201d Essentially, he claimed that he believed his convictions to be too old to matter. Lara acknowledged that he never asked for clarification from the trial judge or lawyers for either party about whether he was required to divulge his prior criminal convictions. Accordingly, he did not volunteer his convictions during voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Lara claimed that he tried to be fair during the trial. He asserted that he never tried to persuade the jury in any particular way because of his personal criminal history. He said that he never disclosed his prior convictions during deliberations or the fact that he had personal experience with how criminal cases are handled.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The judge concluded that Lara was truthful during the evidentiary hearing. The judge also determined that, had Lara answered the questions on the juror questionnaire truthfully, the prosecutor would have had him excused from the jury. The judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">I have fairly equal confidence that a defense attorney, knowing that the person . .. convicted of a crime is called to sit as a juror, especially a trial of someone who is accused of a similar type of crime, would not exercise a peremptory challenge.... Defendant does not indicate to this court that he would have exercised a peremptory challenge had he known.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>There is no evidence presented at this hearing or anything from any other source that Mr. Lara\u2019s presence on the jury resulted in actual prejudice to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Accordingly, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded for a new trial. The Court relied on <em>People v DeHaven.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It determined that, because the crimes committed by defendant and Lara were similar in that they involved criminal sexual conduct, defendant had not been afforded a fair and impartial jury. Thus, defendant had been prejudiced within the meaning of \u00a7 1354(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">We granted leave to appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to determine (1) whether the Court of Appeals properly relied on <em>DeHaven, </em>(2) whether <em>DeHaven </em>has been superseded by \u00a71354(1), (3) whether a criminal defendant must establish actual prejudice pursuant to \u00a7 1354(1) if the challenged juror was excusable for cause, (4) how the actual prejudice standard for purposes of \u00a7 1354(1) should be defined, and (5) whether Lara\u2019s failure to disclose his status as a convicted felon, which disqualified him from serving as a juror, constitutes structural error pursuant to <em>Neder v United States.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AXE\">A. <em>LEGAL BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">Juror qualifications are set forth in several statutes relevant to this case. MCL 600.1307a provides, in rel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>evant part, that in order to qualify as a juror, a person shall not have been convicted of a felony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Failure to comply with this provision renders a potential juror challengeable for cause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u201c[i]f...the court finds that a ground for challenging a juror for cause is present, the court on its own initiative should, or on motion of either party must, excuse the juror from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the panel.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This rule was also codified in MCL 600.1337, which states, \u201cWhen the court finds that a ... juror is not qualified to serve... , or is exempt and claims an exemption, the court shall discharge him or her from further attendance and service as a juror.\u201d Thus, the Legislature has made clear that those not meeting the relevant qualifications for jury service are not to be included on a jury. Finally, MCL 600.1354(1) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">Failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall not... affect the validity of a jury verdict unless the party ... claiming invalidity has made timely objection and unless the party demonstrates actual prejudice to his cause <em>and </em>unless the noncompliance is substantial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Michigan courts have examined the legal effect of violations of these principles on numerous occasions. The facts of the leading case on the issue, <em>People v DeHaven, </em>are strikingly similar to those of the instant case. In <em>DeHaven, </em>the defendant was charged with the rape of his 13-year-old stepdaughter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The case was submitted to a jury, which returned a guilty verdict.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant moved for a new trial, arguing that two of the jurors had failed to disclose that a member of their family had been imprisoned for a similar offense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court denied the motion, ruling that the jurors had not been prejudiced and that nothing indicated that, if they had been prejudiced, it would likely have benefited the defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant appealed. This Court held that the relationship of the two jurors to a person who had committed a similar crime deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>them of the capacity to act impartially.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because criminal defendants are guaranteed the right to a trial by an impartial jury by both the United States<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and Michigan constitutions,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Court unanimously reversed defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">This Court revisited the issue of juror misconduct in <em>People v Hannum.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendant in <em>Hannum </em>was granted a new trial when a member of the jury failed to disclose that he was a township police officer and special county sheriffs deputy. The Court, relying on <em>DeHaven, </em>held that the defendant had been denied a fair trial by an impartial jury because the lack of disclosure of the pertinent fact \u201ccan hardly be thought to have insured an impartial trial any more so than in <em>DeHaven . . . </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Furthermore, the Court noted, \u201c[w]ould any experienced trial lawyer, or, for that matter, the public gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>ally, feel differently as to the capacity of a local police officer to sit as a juror and consider impartially the case of a defendant charged with a crime committed in the community? We think not.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The Court of Appeals addressed the same issue in <em>People v </em>Manser.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Manser </em>involved a defendant charged with CSC I and CSC II.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The defendant was convicted of both charges.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> On appeal, he argued that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury because the trial court had refused to remove a juror. The juror had failed initially to disclose information relevant to her ability to sit objectively in judgment of the case.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Specifically, the juror had failed to disclose that she had engaged in \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d with a cousin when both were preteens.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The Court of Appeals agreed that this failure to disclose warranted a new trial. It held that, had the juror disclosed during voir dire the inappropriate sexual conduct with her cousin, grounds for dismissal for cause would have been presented.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Moreover, the Court noted that, had the information been revealed during voir dire, a peremptory challenge would have been used if a challenge for cause had been denied.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Finally, the Court held that seating a juror who withheld information that should have been revealed presents too great a risk that the jury will not be impartial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>By failing to be forthcoming with her account of the inappropriate sexual conduct she experienced with an older relative, [the juror] subverted the efforts of the trial court and defense counsel to assure that persons having that kind of background were not seated as factfinders. This resulted in at least an appearance of impropriety... .[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The Court concluded by stating that, under these circumstances, the trial court should have granted defendant some form of relief. It should have either considered the propriety of proceeding with 11 jurors or granted defendant a mistrial.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In <em>People v Daoust,</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court of Appeals addressed whether the trial court deprived the defendant of a fair trial by refusing to remove a juror during trial. At a break in a witness\u2019s testimony, one of the jurors indicated to a bailiff that he may have attended the same junior high school as the witness.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The defendant conceded that there were no circumstances justifying the juror\u2019s discharge for cause. However, he argued that he would have exercised a peremptory challenge to remove the juror had he known of the juror\u2019s link to the witness during voir dire.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request to remove the juror.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> On appeal, the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">[W]hen information potentially affecting a juror\u2019s ability to act impartially is discovered after the jury [has been] sworn, the defendant is entitled to relief... if he can establish (1) that he was actually prejudiced by the pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>ence of the juror in question or (2) that the juror was properly excusable for cause.[<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The defendant in <em>Daoust </em>did not argue that he had been actually prejudiced or that the juror was removable for cause. Hence, the Court held that he was not entitled to relief.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">B. <em>APPLICATION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The aforementioned cases demonstrate a longstanding adherence to a principle expounded in both the federal and state constitutions: criminal defendants are entitled to a fair and impartial jury. I believe that defendant was not afforded this right given the fact that Lara was allowed to participate as a juror. Under \u00a7 1307a, to qualify as a juror, a person must not have been convicted of a felony. Because Lara had been convicted of CSC, he was admittedly not qualified to be a juror. Defendant raised the issue of Lara\u2019s disqualification as soon as Lara\u2019s convictions became known.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">Pursuant to \u00a7 1354(1), noncompliance with juror qualifications results in error requiring reversal only if the noncompliance actually prejudices the defendant and if the noncompliance is substantial. It remains undisputed that Lara\u2019s disqualification is a substantial violation under \u00a7 1354(1). He failed to satisfy the criteria necessary to serve as a juror set forth in MCR 2.511(D) and \u00a7 1307a. The question then becomes whether defendant was actually prejudiced within the meaning of \u00a7 1354(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\"><em>DeHaven </em>and its progeny are reasonably similar to this case. In <em>DeHaven, </em>the defendant was convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>rape for engaging in sexual conduct with his stepdaughter. During voir dire, the court asked prospective jurors whether any had experience with a criminal case and whether any of their relatives had been involved in a similar case involving rape. All answered in the negative, including a juror who had a family member who had been convicted of raping a minor. A second juror, who was also related to the family member, also denied any such prior experience. In reversing the conviction and remanding for a new trial, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">In the case at bar the jurors stated on <em>voir dire </em>examination that they could fairly and impartially sit as jurors in the case; and that there was no other case that they had heard about which would influence their verdict.... We are of the opinion that the relationship of these two jurors to one who had committed a similar crime was such that it deprived them of the capacity to act impartially. Defendant has the right to a trial by an impartial jury. We cannot say that he had such a trial.[<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Here, the crimes of which defendant is accused and that Lara committed relate to CSC. Moreover, Lara himself committed the crimes, not merely a relative, as in <em>DeHaven. </em>The Court of Appeals in this case recognized the similarity, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">Here, the crimes committed by... defendant and the challenged juror were also similar in nature [like those in DeHaven], relating to criminal sexual conduct. Moreover, the challenged juror himself had committed the crimes, not just a relative as in <em>DeHaven. </em>Further, while the challenged juror proclaimed that he was fair, impartial, and listened to the evidence, arguments, and instructions, the jurors in <em>DeHaven </em>also claimed an ability to be fair and impartial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>yet the Supreme Court reversed. Accordingly, defendant was not afforded a fair and impartial jury and was thus prejudiced.[<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Thus, the Court of Appeals explicitly determined that defendant had been prejudiced. Given the obvious factual similarities between the two cases, I believe the Court of Appeals properly relied on <em>DeHaven. </em>Likewise, although the challenged jurors in <em>DeHaven </em>indicated that they had been fair, impartial, and had listened to the evidence, so too did Lara. However, as the <em>DeHaven </em>Court found this effort to be insufficiently protective of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial jury, the Court of Appeals properly granted defendant a new trial.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The majority struggles at length to distinguish <em>DeHaven </em>and <em>Daoust. </em>It claims that <em>DeHaven </em>used a de novo standard of review of the trial court\u2019s finding that the two jurors were biased, rather than the clear error standard used today.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> According to the majority, the <em>DeHaven </em>Court also used a de novo standard of review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>when deciding defendant was entitled to a new trial.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> At the outset, the standard of review in <em>DeHaven </em>is irrelevant to the issue presently before the Court of whether defendant was denied a fair and impartial trial in this case.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> More importantly, however, wholly absent from <em>DeHaven </em>is any language indicating which standard of review was used. Therefore, the majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>DeHaven </em>on this basis is unavailing.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>With respect to <em>Daoust, </em>the majority makes no attempt to distinguish the relevant facts. Yet it concludes that, to the extent that <em>Daoust </em>holds that a new trial is required whenever a juror would have been excusable for cause, it is overruled.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> However, there is no need for the majority to overrule <em>Daoust. </em>It could be read harmoniously with \u00a7 1354(1) in that, if a juror is excusable for cause and is left impaneled, actual prejudice results.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Furthermore, I believe <em>Manser </em>provides guidance and demonstrates the soundness of the Court of Appeals decision in this case. A juror in <em>Manser </em>indicated after trial had begun that she had engaged in conduct similar in nature to that alleged against the defendant. Despite the defendant\u2019s attempt to remove the juror, the court continued the trial with the juror impaneled. In reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction, the Court noted that the juror was removable for cause and thus defendant was entitled to a new trial. Although the Court did not use the word \u201cprejudice,\u201d its holding essentially stated that the defendant was prejudiced by a juror whose presence created the appearance of a potential bias. Here, Lara would have been removable for cause pursuant to MCR 2.511(D) had he disclosed his previous convictions. Moreover, it is without question that Lara\u2019s presence created, at a minimum, an appearance of potential bias.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Therefore, the Court of Appeals properly granted defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Finally, the majority attempts to distinguish <em>Froede v Holland Ladder &amp; Mfg </em>Co.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> <em>Froede </em>involved a juror who misrepresented her criminal history on the juror questionnaire. The juror had hired an assassin to kill a drug informant who had agreed to testify against the juror\u2019s ex-husband. In applying \u00a7 1354(1), the Court of Appeals granted a new trial because it held that the juror\u2019s criminal conviction and misrepresentation of her criminal background constituted actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The Court pointed out several noteworthy considerations that bear on this case. First, <em>Froede </em>was a civil case. Although MCR 6.412(D)(2) requires that a trial court in a criminal case excuse a juror challenged for cause under MCR 2.511(D), there is no similar requirement in civil matters. As the Court noted, \u201cwe find that the existence of potential biases or prejudices of a juror with a prior felony conviction is substantially lessened in a civil case as opposed to a criminal case.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Thus, explicit in the Court\u2019s holding is its recognition that, in criminal cases, the potential for a convicted felon\u2019s bias to reveal itself is higher than in civil cases. Second, the Court noted that the conviction could \u201creflect on the juror\u2019s honesty, and, given the nature of the conviction, th[e] juror may well have infected the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Based as it was on the principles expounded in <em>DeHaven, Hannum, Manser, Daoust, Crear, </em>and <em>Froede, </em>the Court of Appeals decision to grant defendant a new trial was well reasoned. Moreover, the Court explicitly held that defendant was prejudiced and thus satisfied the statutory requirement set forth in \u00a7 1354(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">III. RESPONSE TO THE MAJORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The majority opinion is deficient in several respects. First, it fails to address how the \u201cactual prejudice\u201d standard for purposes of \u00a7 1354(1) should be defined.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>As stated earlier, \u00a7 1354(1) requires a finding of actual prejudice resulting from an error in order for reversal to be required. However, nowhere in that section is there a definition of \u201cactual prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><em>DeHaven </em>and its progeny, including <em>Daoust </em>and <em>Crear, </em>suggest that a defendant need only establish (1) that he was either actually prejudiced by the disqualified juror\u2019s participation or (2) that the juror was excusable for cause. This line of cases seems to suggest that actual prejudice occurs automatically upon a juror\u2019s improper participation in a case. While \u00a7 1354(1) and caselaw may seem to offer different interpretations of what a defendant must establish to obtain a new trial, it is unquestionable that one must show actual prejudice. However, because the statute does not offer its own definition of \u201cactual prejudice,\u201d a starting point for analysis is the dictionary definition of the words. \u201cActual\u201d means \u201c(1) existing in act, fact, or reality; real\u201d and \u201c(2) existing now; present; current.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> \u201cPrejudice\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">(1) an unfavorable opinion or feeling formed beforehand or without knowledge, thought, or reason. (2) any preconceived opinion or feeling, either favorable <em>or </em>unfavorable. (3) unreasonable feelings, opinions, or attitudes, [especially] of a hostile nature, regarding a racial, religious, or national group. (4) such attitudes considered collectively.... (5) damage or injury; detriment .... (6) to affect with a prejudice.[<footnotemark>47</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">On the basis of these definitions, a defendant should have to demonstrate an existing unfavorable opinion or the presence of a preconceived opinion or feeling, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>whether favorable or unfavorable.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Applying this requirement to this case, the Court of Appeals should be affirmed. Lara must have had preconceived notions about defendant, whether favorable or unfavorable, merely because he had committed crimes similar to those charged here.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> This reasoning is also in line with <em>DeHaven, Hannum, Manser, Crear, </em>and <em>Daoust.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">This result also makes practical sense, which highlights the second flaw in the majority opinion. Trial courts must exclude unqualified jurors if facts are present indicating that a juror is unfit for service.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> It logically follows, then, that a defendant should not be burdened with proving prejudice beyond what a court must find to exclude an unqualified juror. To do so would allow jurors to conceal relevant information and then sit on juries anyway. In effect, this would create an insurmountable standard for a defendant to overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Promoting juror honesty is a laudable goal and one that is essential to the selection of a fair and impartial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>jury in criminal cases. It is likewise essential to the fair administration of justice. If the standard for obtaining a new trial based on juror dishonesty is so high that it can rarely be established, then there is no remedy for defendants convicted by dishonest jurors.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> It is for this reason that the majority opinion becomes unworkable and manifestly unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Furthermore, there is no indication that the Legislature intended such a heightened standard. Section 1354(1) merely indicates that \u201cactual prejudice\u201d must be shown. If jurors such as Lara sit on juries despite their lack of qualifications, evidentiary hearings will be necessary to determine whether the disqualified juror infected the entire jury. This would require the presence of all deliberating jurors. Arguably, such a hearing would border on impeachment of a verdict through cross-examination of the jurors regarding their deliberations, a practice that is discouraged.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The holding of such evidentiary hearings would become extremely burdensome on the court system. Yet it remains unclear in what other way a defendant could meet an actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>prejudice burden under the majority\u2019s standard. Essentially, overturning a verdict because of juror misconduct becomes impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Finally, the majority engages in a purely speculative exercise in its attempt at labeling Lara and other unqualified jurors who have been convicted of felonies as favorable to criminal defendants. Without question, criminal defendants are entitled to a fair trial, which includes the impaneling of an impartial jury. The seating of a biased juror, irrespective of which way his or her bias is expected to cut, is an error in the eyes of the law. This is evidenced by statutes and court rules that seek to weed out such errors.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Indeed, assuming \u2014 or guessing, as the majority does \u2014 who benefits from the bias is folly. At some point, a juror\u2019s past experience must lead to a presumption of bias because of the juror\u2019s inherent knowledge from experience. In this case, this presumption exists because Lara\u2019s past experiences are so similar to the current defendant\u2019s alleged crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The majority wrongly speculates that convicted felons on juries will help defendants. Moreover, it should not engage in any exercise that could harm the administration of justice. Essentially, the majority opines that a convicted felon\u2019s bias is acceptable because it is assumed that most felons will be sympathetic toward defendants. Is it now the law that all felons are assumed to be sympathetic to defendants and thus they can never be challenged by defendants for bias? Moreover, are felons\u2019 biases always assumed against prosecutors, such that if the parties\u2019 positions in this case were reversed, the prosecutor would have a strong claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>bias? Are felons so homogenous that such a broad generalization is worthy of judicial codification? I think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The Court of Appeals properly held that defendant was entitled to a new trial.

This argument is unpersuasive for several reasons. First, in <em>Crear, supra </em>at 167, the Court of Appeals, relying on <em>Daoust </em>(which relied on <em>DeHaven) </em>held that a defendant must establish (1) that he was actually prejudiced by the presence of the juror in question or (2) that the juror was properly excusable for cause. <em>Crear </em>was decided in light of \u00a7 1354(1) in 2000 and implicitly acknowledged the import of \u00a7 1354(1) by recognizing that actual prejudice must be shown to warrant a new trial. Second, <em>Crear </em>can be read harmoniously with \u00a7 1354(1) by incorporating the failure to remove a juror excusable for cause into the parameters of actual prejudice within the meaning of the statute. This is entirely possible, especially given the lack of a definition for \u201cactual prejudice\u201d in \u00a7 1354(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b704-8\"> <em>Ante </em>at 557.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b705-5\"> <em>Ante </em>at 558.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b705-6\"> The majority mistakenly mingles the standard of review in this case with the standard of review used in <em>DeHaven. </em>I agree that the proper standard in this case is review of the trial court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. The decision on the motion for a new trial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. My agreement ends there.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">It is not relevant what standard the <em>DeHaven </em>Court applied. <em>DeHaven </em>is devoid of any indication of the deference (or lack thereof) paid to the trial court\u2019s decision in that case. Thus, it is mere conjecture for the majority to state that the <em>DeHaven </em>Court improperly engaged in a review de novo. <em>Ante </em>at 557-558.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\"> The majority opinion seems to overrule <em>DeHaven </em>because it applied the wrong standard of review. Yet, the majority avoids outright abrogation of <em>DeHaven </em>by simply stating that <em>DeHaven\u2019s </em>holding is neither binding nor persuasive precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Furthermore, the majority discards DeHaven\u2019s reasoning because the case was decided before the enactment of \u00a7 1354(1). Yet, the majority relies on <em>Froede v Holland Ladder &amp; Mfg Co, </em>207 Mich App 127; 523 NW2d 849 (1994), and <em>People v Carey, </em>110 Mich App 187; 312 NW2d 205 (1981), as support for its framing of \u201cactual prejudice.\u201d This reliance makes little sense given that these cases also predate \u00a7 1354(1). See also <em>People v Graham, </em>84 Mich App 663; 270 NW2d 673 (1978), which held that the party moving for a new trial must present proof of actual prejudice. If not, it must satisfy the trial court that the moving party would have successfully challenged for cause or otherwise dismissed the juror had the truth been revealed before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">I conclude that <em>DeHaven </em>is precedential with respect to Lara\u2019s lack of qualification to serve as a juror and defendant\u2019s entitlement to a new trial. <em>DeHaven </em>should either be read as controlling or should be overruled. If <em>DeHaven </em>is not applicable here, then it is not applicable anywhere and should not be left hanging in the wind.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b706-5\"> <em>Ante </em>at 561.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b706-6\"> The majority conflates \u201cactual prejudice\u201d with \u201cactual bias.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 554 n 16. Section 1354(1) requires a showing of actual prejudice. This is not the same as actual bias. Indeed, as recognized explicitly by <em>Holt v People, </em>13 Mich 224 (1865), and implicitly by <em>DeHaven, Hannurn, Manser, Daoust, Crear, </em>and <em>Froede, </em>the appearance of partiality or bias creates a reasonable doubt sufficient to satisfy \u00a7 1354(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\"> <em>Froede, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\"> <em>Id. </em>at 133.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b707-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 134. In <em>Froede, </em>the trial court found that the juror had deliberately misrepresented her criminal history. In this case, the trial court found that Lara was not \u201cattempting to be deceitful or that he had any ulterior motive in answering the[] [jury] question[naire].\u201d The majority distinguishes <em>Froede </em>on this basis. While the trial court found that Lara\u2019s responses lacked deceit, Lara had no incentive to state that he had been dishonest or deliberately misrepresented his criminal history. Thus, absent an admission by Lara, the trial court had no basis on which to determine whether Lara had been deceitful in answering the questionnaire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\"> The closest the majority comes to defining actual prejudice is its assertion that juror misconduct is only prejudicial if it denies a defendant an impartial jury. <em>Ante </em>at 548. Essentially, this is an outcome-determinative standard in disguise. The majority further opines that \u201c[t]he burden is on the defendant to establish that the juror was not impartial. . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 550, citing <em>Holt v People, </em>13 Mich 224, 228 (1865). However, <em>Holt </em>requires a defendant to show only that a juror\u2019s impartiality is in reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 227. Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s analysis, <em>Holt </em>does not either explicitly or implicitly require a defendant to prove actual bias by the disqualified juror. Yet actual bias is what the majority requires in this case. Indeed, although the majority correctly cites <em>Holt, </em>it fails to recognize that the reasonable doubt standard in <em>Holt </em>requires less than actual bias to establish actual prejudice. Compare <em>ante </em>at 550 with <em>ante </em>at 554 n 16. The majority, under the guise of statutory interpretation, is effectively legislating from the bench by crafting the words \u201cactual bias\u201d into \u00a7 1354(1), when no such language exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Furthermore, the majority\u2019s analysis fails to provide guidance to lower courts. Specifically, it leaves unresolved how a defendant is to prove actual prejudice (or partiality as the majority would have it) absent an admission by a juror that he possessed bias in rendering a verdict. The majority also selectively cites Note, <em>When jurors lie: Differing standards for new trials, </em>22 Am J Crim L 733, 737 (1995), for the proposition that some states require a showing of juror bias before they will grant a defendant a new trial. <em>Ante </em>at 549 n 9. However, this article reveals that the states employ different standards including (1) a showing of possible bias, (2) a showing that the juror would have been struck for cause had the undisclosed information been revealed on voir dire, and (3) a showing of no bias at all. <em>See TK Stanley, Inc v Cason, </em>614 So 2d 942, 949 (Miss, 1992); <em>Gainesville Radiology Group v Hummel, </em>263 Ga 91, 93; 428 SE2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>786 (1993); <em>Wright v Bernstein, </em>23 NJ 284, 294-295; 129 A2d 19 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\"> <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b709-10\"> <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b710-9\"> Contrary to the majority\u2019s belief, this standard does not contradict <em>Holt. Holt </em>requires that a defendant show only that a juror\u2019s impartiality is in reasonable doubt. This proof is merely a means to demonstrate actual prejudice as required by \u00a7 1354(1). In any event, it is noteworthy that the majority exhibits its usual unquestioning confidence in its ability to decide which dictionary definition of a word the Legislature intended. See, e.g., <em>Liberty Hill Housing Corp v City of Livonia, </em>480 Mich 44, 57-58; 746 NW2d 282 (2008). Plucking one definition from a basket of many is nothing less than speculation in the guise of omniscience.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b710-10\"> I refute the majority\u2019s contention that it is \u201cpure speculation\u201d to believe that an ex-felon would have some sort of \u201cprejudice,\u201d as defined above, about a defendant. <em>Ante </em>at 553 n 15. One convicted of the same crime charged against a defendant would, at a minimum, be thoroughly familiar with the nature of the crime(s) charged. The convict would know how such crimes are committed, the emotions and feelings associated with the guilt accompanying the criminal act(s), and criminal procedure in general.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b710-11\"> MCR 6.412(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b711-6\"> Section 1354(1) requires a showing of actual prejudice. However, the majority opinion interprets actual prejudice so narrowly that prejudice will be impossible to prove, absent a juror admitting actual bias. <em>Ante </em>at 552-554. This standard is too strict. Often, jurors will not admit bias, especially after rendering a verdict, because they have a stake in defending their decision. Furthermore, the majority opinion implies that anytime a former juror states that he or she was unbiased, a defendant cannot demonstrate prejudice. Presumed bias must be accepted in some instances, and this is one such instance. In fact, the majority opinion\u2019s exceedingly narrow standard effectively renders the jury qualification standards meaningless. Any verdict that was rendered with an unqualified juror is unassailable because simply showing a lack of qualification(s) is not enough to show prejudice. I believe that the juror qualifications set forth in MCR 2.511(D) should be given more force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\"> <em>Consumers Power Co v Allegan State Bank, </em>388 Mich 568; 202 NW2d 295 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b712-7\"> The majority ignores the purpose of MCR 2.511(D) and MCL 600.1337.
