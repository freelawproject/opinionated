The Court of Appeals in this case considered the aggregate of complications plaintiff faced and concluded that plaintiff satisfied the statute, using <em>Fulton\u2019s </em>requirement that the difference between his chance of a better result without malpractice and his chance of a better result despite the alleged malpractice was greater than 50 percentage points. I conclude that the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) does not apply to this case. Moreover, I believe the second sentence is unenforceable because it provides no guidance regarding its meaning or how courts are to apply it. A medical-malpractice plaintiff must prove that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant. Because the evidence presented at trial would support the jury\u2019s verdict under my analysis, I conclude that there is no need to conduct a new trial and would therefore affirm the result of the Court of Appeals judgment but not its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Plaintiff suffered the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm that had gone undetected despite physical examinations and testing by a number of physicians.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>He underwent emergency surgery to repair the rupture, but, in part because of preexisting conditions, amputation of both legs at mid-thigh was ultimately necessary. After surgery, plaintiff continued to experience multiple organ failure and other complications, including acute renal failure, sepsis, rhabdomyolysis, osteomyelitis, recurrent pancreatitis, and depression. His home required structural changes to accommodate his wheelchair and specialized needs, and his wife quit her employment to assist with his daily care needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Plaintiff brought a medical-malpractice suit against the radiologist and two vicariously liable entities on the theory that a negligent diagnosis resulted in the rupture and all resulting harm. At the jury trial, plaintiff presented experts who testified that, had the aneurysm been properly diagnosed, elective surgery could have been performed. Such elective surgery would have greatly increased plaintiffs chance of a better medical outcome, including a reduction of the risk of amputation and other health complications. Plaintiffs medical experts testified that a patient having elective surgery to repair an aortic aneurysm has a 95 percent chance of attaining a good result, which includes surviving the rupture, as well as avoiding additional medical complications. In contrast, misdiagnosed patients whose aneurysms rupture have only a 10 percent chance to achieve a good result. Specifically, the experts opined that 80 percent of patients with a rupture of an aortic aneurysm die, either en route to obtain medical care or during the emergency surgery. Of the 20 percent of patients with ruptures who manage to survive, 40 to 50 percent have some form of complication. This contrasts markedly with those undergoing elective repair, who face less than a 5 percent risk of dying or suffering serious complications.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Defendants argued that the risk of death should be factored out because plaintiff avoided it and that the risk of complications other than death was 5 to 12 percent for elective surgery and up to 40 percent for emergency surgery. Taking the numbers most favorable to plaintiff, 5 and 40, defendants argued that the difference was at best 35 percent. The specific risk of amputation suffered by plaintiff was 1 percent for elective surgery and 5 percent for emergency surgery: a paltry difference of 4 percent. The trial court disagreed with defendants\u2019 theory, however, and instructed the jury to consider the aggregate risk of complications.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff for a total amount of $2,327,835. Following reduction for the damages cap<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and collateral sources, the court entered a judgment in the amount of $1,936,682, of which $1,640,800 was for the verdict and the remainder was for interest, costs, and attorney fees. The trial court denied defendants\u2019 postjudgment motions for a new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished opinion per curiam, issued April 17, 2007 (Docket No. 265048). On the issue of \u201closs of opportunity,\u201d it agreed with the trial court that plaintiff had met the requirements of the statute because he had gone from a 95 percent chance of attaining a good result to a 10 percent chance of attaining a good result. <em>Id. </em>at 5. The Court considered the aggregate of all the increased risks that plaintiff faced as a result of the alleged malpractice and applied the <em>Fulton </em>formula to that aggregate risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">This Court granted leave to appeal, directing the parties to address</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>(1) whether the requirements set forth in the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) apply in this case; (2) if so, whether the \u201closs of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result\u201d should be determined by considering the aggregate increased risk posed by the alleged malpractice, including risks associated with injuries that the patient did not suffer and any increased risk of death, or whether the only consideration should be the increased risk of the specific injury or injuries suffered by the patient; (3) whether <em>Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp, </em>253 Mich App 70 (2002), was correctly decided, or whether a different approach is required to correctly implement the second sentence of \u00a7 2912a(2), such as that described in Roy W Waddell, M.D.\u2019s <em>A Doctor\u2019s View of Opportunity to Survive: Fulton\u2019s Assumptions and Math are Wrong, </em>published in the March 2007 edition of the Michigan Bar Journal at 32; and (4) whether the Court of Appeals erred when it determined that the plaintiffs met the requirements of \u00a7 2912a(2). [480 Mich 895 (2007).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">II. STANDARD OP REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">This Court reviews de novo a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, viewing the evidence and all legitimate inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Sniecinski v Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>469 Mich 124, 131; 666 NW2d 186 (2003). Similarly, we review de novo questions of statutory interpretation. <em>Wickens v Oakwood Healthcare Sys, </em>465 Mich 53, 59; 631 NW2d 686 (2001). When interpreting a statute, the Court\u2019s primary goal is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>Brown v Detroit Mayor, </em>478 Mich 589, 593; 734 NW2d 514 (2007). The first step is to review the language of the statute. <em>Id. </em>If the statute is unambiguous on its face, we presume that the Legislature intended the meaning expressed, and judicial construction is neither required nor permissible. <em>Id. </em>However, when a statute is ambiguous on its face \u2014 that is, equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>susceptible to more than a single meaning \u2014 judicial construction is appropriate to determine the meaning. <em>Lansing Mayor v Pub Service Comm, </em>470 Mich 154, 164-166; 680 NW2d 840 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">At issue in this case is subsection 2 of MCL 600.2912a, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or defendants. In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%. [MCL 600.2912a(2).][<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Although the lower courts did not question the applicability of the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) to plaintiffs claim, treating it as one for loss of opportunity, this Court expressly requested the parties to address the issue. Plaintiff argues that he never pleaded his claim as one for loss of an opportunity; instead, his is a simple case of physical injury directly caused by negligence. In his brief, he asserts that a case involving a loss of opportunity occurs in very specific circumstances: \u201cwhere a plaintiff cannot prove that the defendant\u2019s acts or omissions proximately caused his injuries, but can prove that the defendant\u2019s acts or omissions deprived him of some chance to avoid those injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>This definition is in accord with Michigan caselaw. In the first Michigan case to refer to the legal theory of \u201cthe value of lost chance,\u201d the Court of Appeals explained: \u201cThis theory is potentially available in situations where a plaintiff cannot prove that a defendant\u2019s actions were the cause of his injuries, but can prove that the defendant\u2019s actions deprived him of a chance to avoid those injuries.\u201d <em>Vitale v Reddy, </em>150 Mich App 492, 502; 389 NW2d 456 (1986). The Court in <em>Vitale </em>noted that allowing such claims would expand existing common law, and it declined to do so, stating that such a decision \u201cis best left to either the Supreme Court or the Legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504. In a footnote, the Court observed that the wrongful-death statute, MCL 600.2922,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\">requires proof that the wrongful acts or omissions were the cause of death. The statutory provision would not allow a plaintiff to recover in a situation where he could prove only that defendant\u2019s acts or omissions were the cause of a lost chance but could not prove that defendant\u2019s acts or omissions were the cause of death. <em>[Id. </em>at 504 n 4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">In accord with this analysis, this Court has stated: \u201cThe lost opportunity doctrine allows a plaintiff to recover when the defendant\u2019s negligence <em>possibly, </em>i.e., [by] a probability of fifty percent or less, caused the plaintiffs injury.\u201d <em>Weymers v Khera, </em>454 Mich 639, 648; 563 NW2d 647 (1997) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <em>Weymers </em>Court aptly described the lost-opportunity doctrine as \u201cthe antithesis of proximate cause.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In cases in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>which the plaintiff alleges that the defendant\u2019s negligence more probably than not caused the injury, the claim is one of simple medical malpractice. <em>Id. </em>at 647-648.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">In <em>Falcon v Mem Hosp, </em>436 Mich 443; 462 NW2d 44 (1990), this Court first recognized a claim for lost opportunity to survive. <em>Falcon </em>was a wrongful-death case in which this Court allowed a claim to go forward even though the plaintiffs granddaughter would have had only a 37.5 percent chance of surviving a medical accident had she received proper care. Because proper medical procedures had not been followed, the granddaughter\u2019s chance of surviving the accident went to essentially zero. The lead opinion in <em>Falcon </em>admitted that the plaintiff could not show that the malpractice had more likely than not caused her granddaughter\u2019s death, but could show that it had caused her granddaughter to lose a \u201csubstantial opportunity of avoiding physical harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470 (LEVIN, J.). The lead opinion disavowed the traditional rule that requires a plaintiff to show that, but for the defendant\u2019s negligence, the patient would not have suffered the physical harm, saying that the \u201cmore probable than not standard, as well as other standards of causation, are analytic devices \u2014 tools to be used in making causation judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451. Instead, despite the fact that the plaintiff could not show that the doctor\u2019s malpractice had more probably than not caused her granddaughter\u2019s death, the plaintiff had a claim because the malpractice did cause her granddaughter harm. The 37.5 percent chance for a better outcome was \u201chardly the kind of opportunity that any of us would willingly allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>our health care providers to ignore.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460. This harm occurred <em>before </em>the granddaughter\u2019s death, at the moment \u201c[w]hen, by reason of the failure to implement [certain] procedures,\u201d she was denied any opportunity of living. <em>Id. </em>at 469, 471 n 44. The lead opinion characterized its holding as requiring the plaintiff to show, more probably than not, that the malpractice reduced the opportunity of avoiding harm: \u201cfailure to protect [the granddaughter\u2019s] opportunity of living.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 469. Loss of her 37.5 percent opportunity of living, the lead opinion stated, \u201cconstitutes a loss of a substantial opportunity of avoiding physical harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The lead opinion in <em>Falcon </em>thus concluded that the loss-of-opportunity claim accrued not when the patient died, but at the moment she went from having a 37.5 chance of survival to having no chance of survival. Under this theory, a plaintiff would have a cause of action independent of that for the physical injury and could recover for the malpractice that caused the plaintiff to go from a class of patients having a \u201cgood chance\u201d to one having a \u201cbad chance.\u201d Without this analysis, the plaintiff in <em>Falcon </em>would not have had . a viable claim because it could not have been shown that the defendant more probably than not caused the physical injury. Until <em>Falcon, </em>medical-malpractice plaintiffs alleging that the defendant\u2019s act or omission hastened or worsened the injury (such as by failing to diagnose a condition) had to prove that the defendant\u2019s malprac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>tice more probably than not was the proximate cause of the injury. See, e.g., <em>Morgan v Taylor, </em>434 Mich 180; 451 NW2d 852 (1990); <em>Naccarato v Grob, </em>384 Mich 248, 252; 180 NW2d 788 (1970); <em>Skeffington v Bradley, </em>366 Mich 552; 115 NW2d 303 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">When the Court decided <em>Falcon, </em>MCL 600.2912a read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">In an action alleging malpractice the plaintiff shall have the burden of proving that in light of the state of the art existing at the time of the alleged malpractice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">(a) The defendant, if a general practitioner, failed to provide the plaintiff the recognized standard of acceptable professional practice in the community in which the defendant practices or in a similar community, and that as a proximate result of the defendant failing to provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">(b) The defendant, if a specialist, failed to provide the recognized standard of care within that specialty as reasonably applied in light of the facilities available in the community or other facilities reasonably available under the circumstances, and as a proximate result of the defendant failing to provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Three years after <em>Falcon, </em>the Legislature enacted 1993 PA 78, amending MCL 600.2912a to add the second subsection. In its entirety, the statute as amended reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-10\"><em>(1) Subject to subsection (2), </em>in an action alleging malpractice, the plaintiff <em>has </em>the burden of proving that in light of the state of the art existing at the time of the alleged malpractice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-11\">(a) The defendant, if a general practitioner, failed to provide the plaintiff the recognized standard of acceptable professional practice <em>or care </em>in the community in which the defendant practices or in a similar community, and that as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>a proximate result of the defendant failing to provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">(b) The defendant, if a specialist, failed to provide the recognized standard of <em>practice or </em>care within that specialty as reasonably applied in light of the facilities available in the community or other facilities reasonably available under the circumstances, and as a proximate result of the defendant failing to provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\"><em>(2) In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or defendants. In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%. </em>[New language emphasized.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">As can be seen, the Legislature retained the already-existing language, making it subsection 1 of the statute. Both subsection 1(a) and subsection 1(b) require the plaintiff to show that, \u201cas a proximate result of the defendant failing to provide [the appropriate standard of practice or care], the plaintiff suffered an injury.\u201d Further, the Legislature added subsection 2. Specifically, the first sentence of this new subsection codifies and reiterates the common-law requirement that a plaintiff show that the defendant\u2019s malpractice more probably than not caused the plaintiffs injury. The second sentence of subsection 2 adds that, in medical-malpractice cases, a \u201cplaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%.\u201d However, one must keep in mind that the relevant caselaw when subsection 2 was enacted held that the lost-opportunity doctrine applies <em>\u201cin situations where a plaintiff cannot prove that a defendant\u2019s actions were the cause of his injuries </em>. . . .\u201d <em>Vitale, supra </em>at 502 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>(emphasis added). That is, the first sentence of subsection 2 requires plaintiffs in every medical-malpractice case to show the defendant\u2019s malpractice proximately caused the injury while, at the same time, the second sentence refers to cases in which such proof not only is unnecessary, but is impossible. Accordingly, I conclude that the two sentences of subsection 2 create a paradox, allowing claims in the second sentence while precluding them by the first sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">While it is tempting to argue, as Justice CAVANAGH does, that the Legislature intended to allow as an \u201cinjury\u201d a plaintiffs lost chance alone, without proof of physical injury, this Court addressed that issue in <em>Wickens. </em>In <em>Wickens, supra </em>at 60, the Court stated that the first sentence of subsection 2 \u201cexpressly limits recovery to injuries that have already been suffered and more probably than not were caused by the defendant\u2019s malpractice.\u201d A reduction of a person\u2019s chances of avoiding injury is not itself a present injury, but is only an indication of the likelihood of suffering a future injury. <em>Id. </em>at 60-61. Therefore, because of the statutory present-injury requirement, the plaintiff in <em>Wickens </em>could not recover for her reduced expected life span\u2014 the exact kind of injury that <em>Falcon </em>allowed. Moreover, it has never been the law in this state that a negligence suit can be sustained when the alleged negligence did not cause a physical injury to a person or property. <em>Henry v Dow Chem Co, </em>473 Mich 63, 75-76; 701 NW2d 684 (2005). The Legislature would have understood that this is what the term \u201cinjury\u201d encompassed when it enacted the language reiterating this traditional requirement: the plaintiff must have an <em>injury </em>proximately caused by the defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Ford Motor Co v City </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>of Woodhaven, </em>475 Mich 425, 439-440; 716 NW2d 247 (2006). Thus, what the Legislature intended by the statute was likely something more traditional: a situation in which an injury might have occurred anyway, but in which the defendant\u2019s act or omission hastened or worsened it in such a way that the plaintiff suffered more severe physical injury than he or she would have had the negligence not occurred. As noted, before <em>Falcon, </em>such cases were litigated under the ambit of traditional medical-malpractice law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In my view, there is little question that the statute cannot be interpreted as written. Avoiding the underlying paradox of the statute allowing in one sentence suits that in another sentence it precludes, the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Appeals, interpreting the second sentence by itself in <em>Fulton, </em>found two possible, and fully contradictory, constructions, each of which could be achieved only by adding words to the statute. The <em>Fulton </em>Court expressed the issue before it as whether the second sentence of the statute requires a plaintiff to show \u201conly that the <em>initial </em>opportunity to survive before the alleged malpractice was greater than fifty percent... or, instead, that the opportunity to survive was <em>reduced by </em>greater than fifty percent because of the alleged malpractice ....\u201d <em>Fulton, supra </em>at 77-78 (emphasis added). The Court noted that the statute was ambiguous because reasonable minds could differ regarding which of these meanings could be read from the words of the statute. The Court concluded that the first interpretation required that the word \u201cinitial\u201d be inferred to modify \u201copportunity\u201d and that the second required that the words \u201closs of\u201d be inferred to modify \u201copportunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80. Apparently finding itself obligated to choose one of these two interpretations, the Court then decided that the second construction was the one intended by the Legislature because it reflected the Legislature\u2019s rejection of Falcon.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court asserted that the lead opinion in <em>Falcon </em>had focused on the \u201cextent of the loss\u201d and that the Legislature was insisting on a greater loss for the claim to be actionable. Id. at 82-83. However, <em>Falcon\u2019s </em>focus was almost entirely on the plaintiffs initial opportunity being substantial, and so it is <em>equally </em>plausible that the Legislature merely intended for a plaintiff to have an initial opportunity of more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>than 50 percent. Both interpretations proposed in <em>Fulton </em>implicate a negative reaction to <em>Falcon, </em>and nothing in the statutory language, the statutory context, or the statute\u2019s history gives any further clues to assist in choosing the \u201ccorrect\u201d interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">It is confounding to attempt to ascertain just what the Legislature was trying to do with this amendment. Even if it was trying to create a remedy for the \u201cinjury\u201d of a reduction in chances following medical malpractice, by imposing the threshold of greater than 50 percent it may well have eliminated most of the cases that might benefit from such a rule. For example, if the patient in <em>Falcon </em>had enjoyed a greater than 50 percent initial likelihood of survival (that is, she was not likely to die even with proper treatment), the plaintiff probably would have brought a standard medical-malpractice case, and the jury would have decided proximate cause in the usual way. It was only because the plaintiff could not show that the patient more probably than not would have survived but for the doctor\u2019s negligence that prompted the plaintiff to seek her remedy under the doctrine of lost opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">As written, the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) can be made understandable only by adding words or by redefining \u201cinjury\u201d in a way significantly contrary to the mass of caselaw at the time the sentence was added. Another possible alternative reading is that the second sentence of subsection 2 was intended not to create a new type of claim, but to limit courts from expanding the common law so far as to allow cases like <em>Falcon. </em>None of these multiple, contradictory interpretations can be shown to be the \u201ccorrect\u201d construction of legislative intent. Choosing between them can only be a guess. Moreover, it remains that the second sentence impossibly conflicts with the requirement of a proxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>mate cause of the injury in both the first sentence of subsection 2 and in subsection 1. Accordingly, I conclude that the second sentence of subsection 2 cannot be judicially enforced because doing so <em>requires </em>the Court to impose its own prerogative on an act of the Legislature.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">I find the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2), as written, substantially incomprehensible because (1) it either cannot be harmonized with the proximate-cause requirement of the rest of the statute or creates by implication a new cause of action contrary to common law and (2) it provides no guidance regarding its correct application. The remaining portions of MCL 600.2912a should continue in effect. MCL 8.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">This would leave, for medical-malpractice claims, the requirement imposed by the statute that \u201cthe plaintiff has the burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or defendants.\u201d MCL 600.2912a(2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In addition, the word \u201cinjury\u201d would continue to retain its meaning in tort of a present physical injury to person or property. I believe that, by codifying and restating the requirements of causation and injury in existence at the time <em>Falcon </em>was decided, the Legislature effectively overruled <em>Falcon </em>and reinstated the traditional elements of medical-malpractice claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>In accord with my conclusion that the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) is incomprehensible as written, I would hold that Fulton\u2019s construction of that part of the statute is no longer good law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>1 believe that the Legislature intended to retain the traditional proximate-cause requirement in effect before <em>Falcon </em>and that that is what a plaintiff must prove.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">IV APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Although I believe that the lower courts erred by applying <em>Fulton </em>and that the trial court incorrectly instructed the jury on the issue of whether plaintiff had shown that defendant\u2019s negligence caused him to lose a greater than 50 percent chance of a better result, I would conclude that it is not necessary to order a new trial. For each defendant, the trial court instructed the jury that it had to find by a preponderance of the evidence (1) that the defendant was professionally negligent, (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>that plaintiff sustained injury and damages, and (3) that the professional negligence or malpractice of that defendant was a proximate cause of the injury and damages. After giving these instructions, the court farther instructed the jury: \u201cI\u2019m going to talk about damages. In an action alleging claims of professional negligence against a physician, even if you find professional negligence, the Plaintiff cannot recover unless the Plaintiffs chance of having a better result was changed by greater than 50 percent.\u201d Thus, after being instructed that it had to find the traditional elements of medical malpractice and, in addition, had to find that plaintiff had lost an opportunity of greater than 50 percent, the jury returned a verdict indicating it had found that all these elements were satisfied. Indeed, a review of the record shows that plaintiff suffered amputations and other injuries, and from the testimony presented the jury could have concluded that it was more likely than not that the amputations and other injuries were caused by the defendants\u2019 negligence and would not have occurred absent that negligence. Most importantly, regardless of the jury\u2019s finding of lost opportunity, it is clear from the way the instructions were given that the jury found that the traditional elements were met: defendants\u2019 negligence more probably than not caused plaintiffs injuries. Thus, I believe that the jury properly found that plaintiff had satisfied the causation and injury elements. Accordingly, I would hold that reversal is not required and would affirm the result of the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">V SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In an attempt to clarify for the reader the majority and minority positions on each issue, I provide the following summary:</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>All seven justices would affirm the result of the Court of Appeals decision and the judgment for plaintiff. Six of the justices believe that this is not a lost-opportunity case; Justice MARKMAN would hold that it is such a case. All seven justices believe that <em>Fulton\u2019s </em>analysis is incorrect or should be found to no longer be good law, though their reasons for doing so vary.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Justices CORRIGAN and YOUNG and I would find that <em>Fulton </em>is no longer good law because we would hold that the statute is unenforceable as written. Justice MARKMAN would hold that <em>Fulton </em>is inconsistent with the statutory language. Justices Weaver, Cavanagh, and Kelly would hold that <em>Fulton </em>is incorrect because it erroneously added words to the statute when analyzing the phrase \u201cthe opportunity.\u201d Of the four justices holding that the statute is not unenforceable as written (Justices WEAVER, CAVANAGH, Kelly, and Markman), only Justice Markman would define the term \u201copportunity\u201d in accordance with the Waddell article, while the other three (Justices WEAVER, CAVANAGH, and Kelly) would define it in accordance with <em>Falcon, </em>but with a higher threshold than <em>Falcon </em>required. The same four justices (Justices WEAVER, Cavanagh, Kelly, and Markman) would hold that loss of the opportunity is, by itself, a compensable injury, although the opportunity must be \u201clost\u201d \u2014 that is, the bad result must occur \u2014 in order for a claim to accrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Given this montage of issues and positions created by the language of this statute, it would be helpful for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Legislature to reexamine its goal and the policies it wishes to promote and strive to better articulate its intent in that regard.</p>\n<judges id=\"b297-5\">Corrigan and Young, JJ., concurred with Taylor, C.J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">CAVANAGH, J. I agree with Chief Justice TAYLOR that the evidence presented in this case supports a traditional medical-malpractice claim; thus, I concur that the jury\u2019s verdict should be upheld. However, I do not agree with the conclusion that the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) is incomprehensible and unenforceable. Therefore, I respectfully disagree with Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019s analysis of that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Chief Justice TAYLOR identifies two problems with MCL 600.2912a(2) that he believes render it partially unenforceable: (1) the first and second sentences conflict and (2) the second sentence is incomprehensible. I disagree, because the circumstances of the 1993 amendment of this statute clarify the meaning of the statutory language and resolve both concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">THE ORIGINS OF THE LOSS-OF-OPPORTUNITY DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">The history of the loss-of-opportunity doctrine is highly relevant to the interpretation of MCL 600.2912a(2) because this Court\u2019s adoption of the doctrine evidently prompted the Legislature to add that provision. In <em>Falcon v Mem Hosp, </em>436 Mich 443; 462 NW2d 44 (1990), this Court first recognized the loss-of-opportunity doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Falcon </em>involved a wrongful-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>death claim brought on behalf of a woman who had suffered an amniotic embolism during childbirth. As in all negligence cases, the plaintiff was required to show causation to establish a valid medical-malpractice claim. <em>Falcon </em>discussed various causation theories. Some courts have required a plaintiff to establish \u201cthat it is more probable, measured as more than fifty percent, that, but for such negligence, the patient would not have suffered the physical harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449 (LEVIN, J.). <em>Falcon </em>termed this the \u201cmore probable than not standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451. Under this standard, \u201ca plaintiff who establishes that the patient would have had more than a fifty percent opportunity of not suffering physical harm had the defendant not acted negligently, recovers one hundred percent of the damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450. The plaintiff in <em>Falcon </em>could not have maintained a wrongful-death action under the more-probable-than-not standard \u2014 the decedent only had a 37.5 percent chance of surviving even without the alleged malpractice, so it was not more probable than not that the physician\u2019s malpractice caused the decedent\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">While the plaintiff in <em>Falcon </em>could not recover for the injury of her granddaughter\u2019s wrongful death, we ruled that the plaintiff nevertheless had a different cause of action available to her. <em>Falcon </em>adopted the approach taken by other courts that recognized <em>\u201closs of an opportunity </em>for a more favorable result, <em>as distinguished from the unfavorable result, </em>as compensable in medical malpractice actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461 (emphasis added). \u201cUnder this approach, damages are recoverable for the loss of opportunity although the opportunity lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>was less than even, and thus it was not more probable than not that the unfavorable result would or could have been avoided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461-462. Thus, the <em>Falcon </em>decision explicitly recognized loss of an opportunity to avoid physical harm as a distinct <em>injury. </em>A plaintiff could bring a claim for loss of an opportunity to avoid death, even if she could not maintain a claim for the death itself because she could not establish causation for the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><em>Falcon\u2019s </em>approach to calculating damages for a loss-of-opportunity claim also indicates that it treated the lost opportunity as a distinct injury, not simply a direct physical-harm injury that enjoyed a lower causation standard. Because the plaintiffs granddaughter in <em>Falcon </em>allegedly lost a 37.5 percent chance of survival, we concluded that the appropriate measure of damages would be \u201c37.5 percent times the damages recoverable for wrongful death. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471. Thus, generally speaking, \u201c \u2018[t]he proper computation of damages would limit the damages recoverable to only that amount of reduced chance of recovery actually caused by the physician\u2019s negligent conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472 n 47 (citation omitted). We consulted <em>Mays v United States, </em>608 F Supp 1476, 1482-1483 (D Colo, 1985), for its method of computing damages attributable to the defendant. <em>Falcon, </em>436 Mich at 471-472 (LEVIN, J.). In <em>Mays, </em>malpractice had reduced the patient\u2019s opportunity to survive from 40 to 15 percent, so the court computed the damages by multiplying the opportunity lost (40 minus 15) by the net pecuniary loss to determine the damages for the harm caused by the defendant. <em>Id. </em>Calculating the damages this way permitted the plaintiff \u201cto recover damages only for the reduction in the patient\u2019s opportunity of survival.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472. This calculation isolates the value of the injury that can be causally linked to a defendant\u2019s negligence \u2014 the loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>of an opportunity. The value of a loss-of-opportunity claim is measured by the <em>extent of </em>the loss; so, clearly, the injury being compensated is the loss of a particular amount of opportunity. By contrast, the measure of damages in a traditional claim for wrongful death or physical harm is, generally speaking, the value of damages attributable to the death or physical harm; as such, the injury being compensated is the death or physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">In sum, when <em>Falcon </em>adopted the loss-of-opportunity doctrine, it recognized that the injury of loss of an opportunity was distinct from the injury of suffering the associated physical harm \u2014 which, in that case, was death. However, <em>Falcon </em>indicated that not all losses of opportunity were actionable; rather, a plaintiff must suffer the loss of a <em>substantial </em>opportunity for a better result. \u201cThe cause of action accrues when harm and damages result from the loss of a substantial opportunity for a better result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470 n 43. We concluded \u201cthat loss of a 37.5 percent opportunity of living constitutes a loss of a substantial opportunity of avoiding physical harm,\u201d but declined to \u201cdecide what lesser percentage would constitute a substantial loss of opportunity\u201d in other circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Finally, <em>Falcon </em>emphasized that a loss-of-opportunity cause of action was not exempt from the more-probable-than-not standard of causation. \u201cUnder this approach, the plaintiff must establish more-probable-than-not causation. He must prove, more probably than not, that the defendant reduced the opportunity of avoiding harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462. Unlike a claim for wrongful death or physical injury, the \u201cpatient. .. need not show that it was probable, measured as more than fifty percent, that the course of the disease and treatment would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470 n 43. Instead, \u201c[i]t is suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>cient to show, more probably than not, that had there been a correct diagnosis, the patient would have had a substantial opportunity of avoiding the course of the disease and treatment that occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, while a claim for loss of opportunity addresses a different injury than a cause of action for the physical injury itself, it is still subject to the same standard of proof of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><em>Falcon\u2019s </em>enunciation of the loss-of-opportunity doctrine is significant, because it apparently provoked the Legislature to amend MCL 600.2912a. In 1993, the Legislature amended that provision by adding a second subsection, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or defendants. In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%. [MCL 600.2912a(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The amendment was widely understood to be a direct reaction to the <em>Falcon </em>decision. As a majority of this Court noted, after <em>Falcon </em>adopted the lost-opportunity doctrine, \u201c[o]ur Legislature immediately rejected <em>Falcon </em>and the lost opportunity doctrine. MCL 600.2912a(2) . . . .\u201d <em>Weymers v Khera, </em>454 Mich 639, 649; 563 NW2d 647 (1997). I agree that the amendment of MCL 600.2912a(2) was a reaction to <em>Falcon, </em>but I would not characterize it as a rejection of the lost-opportunity doctrine entirely. It merely established the threshold for loss-of-opportunity claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">THE PROPER INTERPRETATION OF MCL 600.2912a(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">The Legislature\u2019s addition of MCL 600.2912a(2) should be read in light of the <em>Falcon </em>decision. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Court follows the principle that when a statute uses a common-law term and there is no clear legislative intent to alter the common law, the term will be interpreted as having the same meaning as at common law. <em>Ford Motor Co v City of Woodhaven, </em>475 Mich 425, 439; 716 NW2d 247 (2006). Additionally, the Legislature is presumed to be aware of judicial interpretations of existing law when passing legislation. <em>Id. </em>at 439-440. In this instance, the Legislature appears to have reacted to a particular opinion of this Court, so that opinion\u2019s holdings offer considerable insight into the Legislature\u2019s intent. When interpreting MCL 600.2912a(2), then, it is important to keep in mind several principles established by the <em>Falcon </em>decision: (1) loss-of-opportunity claims are subject to the more-probable-than-not standard for proving causation, (2) the \u201cinjury\u201d in a loss-of-opportunity claim is the loss of a substantial opportunity to avoid physical harm, not the actual physical harm itself, and (3) loss of a 37.5 percent opportunity of living constitutes a compensable loss of a substantial opportunity to avoid physical harm. Chief Justice TAYLOR interprets MCL 600.2912a(2) without considering these principles from <em>Falcon, </em>and thus comes to the mistaken conclusion that the statute is unenforceable and inconsistent with the lost-opportunity doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The first sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) assigns a medical-malpractice plaintiff \u201cthe burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or defendants.\u201d Chief Justice TAYLOR concludes that this sentence precludes lost-opportunity claims because those claims only arise when a plaintiff cannot prove that a defendant\u2019s negligence more probably than not caused the plaintiffs injury. <em>Ante </em>at 157. But this overlooks two principles gleaned from <em>Falcon </em>that the Legislature would have been aware of while drafting this sentence: loss-of-opportunity claims are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>subject to the more-probable-than-not standard of causation and, in such claims, the \u201cinjury\u201d is the loss of an opportunity to avoid the physical harm, not the associated physical harm itself. When the first sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) is interpreted according to Falcon\u2019s articulation, its causation requirement does not preclude claims for loss of opportunity. It simply codifies the causation requirement that applies to claims for the injury of suffering physical harm as well as claims for the injury of the loss of an opportunity to avoid physical harm. Just like <em>Falcon, </em>MCL 600.2912a(2) requires that a plaintiff asserting a cause of action for loss of opportunity prove that the defendant more probably than not caused the loss of an opportunity to survive or the loss of an opportunity to achieve a better result.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The first sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) should also be interpreted in accordance with <em>Falcon\u2019s </em>understanding of the word \u201cinjury.\u201d In medical-malpractice cases, the underlying injury is quite often death or some physical harm. But <em>Falcon </em>identified a distinct injury in medical-malpractice cases \u2014 the loss of a substantial opportunity to avoid physical harm. This is significant, because a lost-opportunity plaintiff, by definition, cannot prove that a defendant\u2019s malpractice more probably than not caused the patient to suffer physical harm or death. Take the example of a patient who before treatment had a 40 percent chance of survival as the result of a preexisting condition. If that patient died after being negligently treated by a physician, the plaintiff would not be able to prove that the physician\u2019s malpractice more probably than not (50 percent or greater) caused the patient\u2019s death. There was a 60 percent chance that the patient would have died regardless of the malpractice, as a result of the preexisting condition. But the plaintiff might be able to show that the physician\u2019s malpractice more probably than not caused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>patient to lose up to a 40 percent chance of avoiding death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The first sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) simply places this burden to prove causation on a plaintiff, whether the alleged injury is the physical harm itself or the loss of an opportunity to avoid harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Moreover, the explicit recognition of the loss-of-opportunity doctrine in the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) supports the conclusion that the Legislature did not intend to preclude lost-opportunity claims by adopting the more-probable-than-not standard of causation. The second sentence states: \u201cIn an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater than <em>50%.\u201d </em>MCL 600.2912a(2). If the Legislature had intended to reject the lost-opportunity doctrine, it would have entirely prohibited plaintiffs from recovering for a loss of an opportunity. Instead, it permitted recovery for loss of an opportunity under certain circumstances \u2014 if the opportunity was greater than 50 percent. This sentence merely sets the threshold for invoking the loss-of-opportunity doctrine. It requires that a plaintiffs premalpractice opportunity to survive or achieve a better result was greater than 50 percent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>The conclusion that the first and second sentences of MCL 600.2912a(2) do not conflict is also related to the proper interpretation of the second sentence. Chief Justice TAYLOR identifies an ambiguity in the second sentence that, he contends, can only be resolved by adding words or by redefining the term \u201cinjury.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 160.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals also identified this ambiguity in <em>Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp, </em>253 Mich App 70; 655 NW2d 569 (2002). <em>Fulton </em>described the ambiguity: the second sentence of the statute requires a plaintiff to show either that the <em>premalpractice </em>opportunity was greater than 50 percent or that the opportunity was <em>reduced </em>by more than 50 percent. <em>Id. </em>at 77. In short, the ambiguous term is the statute\u2019s second use of the word \u201copportunity.\u201d I disagree with the conclusion that none of the multiple, contradictory interpretations can be shown to be the correct construction of legislative intent. While reasonable minds could differ with respect to the meaning of this statute, the correct interpretation can be discerned by conventional means of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The proper interpretation of the second use of the word \u201copportunity\u201d in MCL 600.2912a(2) can be resolved by simply considering the entire text of the sentence. The first time \u201copportunity\u201d is used, the statute speaks of recovery for \u201closs of an opportunity to survive.\u201d MCL 600.2912a(2). By using this term from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>Falcon </em>without modification, the Legislature adopted <em>Falcon\u2019s </em>articulation of the lost-opportunity cause of action. And we know from <em>Falcon </em>that by the very nature of a lost-opportunity claim, the opportunity alleged to have been lost must be the premalpractice opportunity. The word \u201copportunity\u201d in the phrase \u201closs of an opportunity\u201d must refer to the premalpractice opportunity because that is the opportunity that is lost in some measure and, thus, creates a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The second time \u201copportunity\u201d is used in the sentence, it is not preceded by the phrase \u201closs of an.\u201d But the statute\u2019s replication of the term \u201copportunity\u201d within the same sentence clearly indicates that they relate to each other and are to be construed identically. Thus, the term \u201copportunity\u201d in isolation has the same meaning that it does within the phrase \u201closs of an opportunity to survive.\u201d Accordingly, a plaintiff cannot recover for the loss of an opportunity unless <em>the </em>opportunity \u2014 the premalpractice opportunity that was allegedly lost in some measure \u2014 was greater than 50 percent. Thus, this interpretation does not require that any words be added to the sentence; it merely requires the word \u201copportunity\u201d to be construed consistently within the same sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The other proposed meaning of the statute\u2019s second use of the word \u201copportunity\u201d would conflict with the sentence\u2019s first use of the word. Instead of reading the phrase \u201cunless the opportunity was greater than 50%\u201d as written, this interpretation would infer the words \u201closs of\u201d in front of \u201copportunity.\u201d Justice MARKMAN advocates this interpretation. He concludes that \u201cthe opportunity\u201d clearly refers back to the \u201closs of an opportunity,\u201d and thus the sentence means that the loss of the opportunity must be greater than 50 percent. <em>Post </em>at 195. But this interpretation conflates the phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u201closs of an opportunity\u201d with the phrase \u201cthe opportunity.\u201d It assumes that the Legislature used the phrase \u201cthe opportunity\u201d as a shorthand reference for \u201closs of an opportunity\u201d and requires the reader to infer the phrase \u201closs of\u201d before the second use of the word \u201copportunity.\u201d This interpretation is less plausible than my interpretation, which gives the term \u201copportunity\u201d the same meaning regardless of whether it appears alone or within the phrase \u201closs of an opportunity,\u201d and does not require reading language into the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In sum, I cannot conclude that this competing interpretation is correct when it poses linguistic problems that are not found in the other interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Moreover, interpreting the word \u201copportunity\u201d to mean premalpractice opportunity comports with the purpose of the statute and the context in which it was adopted, while the other interpretation does not. <em>Falcon </em>adopted the loss-of-opportunity doctrine to provide a cause of action to plaintiffs who could not establish causation for physical harm, but could establish causation for the loss of a substantial opportunity to avoid that physical harm. MCL 600.2912a(2) cannot limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>recovery for the loss of an opportunity to cases in which the loss was greater than 50 percent, because any plaintiff who satisfied that condition would have a traditional medical-malpractice claim for the death or physical harm itself.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A plaintiff who can show that malpractice caused the loss of a more than 50 percent opportunity to avoid death or physical harm can meet the more-probable-than-not standard of causation for the associated death or physical harm. This interpretation would permit a loss-of-opportunity claim when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>plaintiffs chance for survival was reduced from 80 percent to 20 percent, but not when the plaintiffs chance for survival was reduced from 80 percent to 40 percent. It would not make sense to permit a plaintiff whose chance of survival was reduced from 80 percent to 20 percent to bring a lost-opportunity claim, because that plaintiff could show that the negligence more probably than not caused the death, thus establishing a traditional wrongful-death claim. Meanwhile, the statute would deny recovery for the loss of an opportunity to a plaintiff who suffered death, but could only show that the malpractice reduced his opportunity to survive from 80 percent to 40 percent. The plaintiff in that case would be left with no cause of action at all; he could not meet the more-probable-than-not standard of causation for the injury of death, and he would be precluded from bringing a lost-opportunity claim because he lost only 40 percent of his opportunity. This cannot be the result intended by the Legislature. This interpretation of the statute would prevent <em>Falcon's </em>intended class of plaintiffs from bringing a loss-of-opportunity claim, while still recognizing a cause of action for loss of opportunity. It would provide a class of plaintiffs who already have a traditional medical-malpractice cause of action with an additional cause of action for loss of opportunity. Such a result is illogical in light of one significant purpose of the statute \u2014 to codify the loss-of-opportunity doctrine recognized in <em>Falcon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Finally, interpreting the statute as referring to the premalpractice opportunity is consistent with the history of the amendment. That is, MCL 600.2912a(2) is understood to be a legislative reaction to <em>Falcon. </em>MCL 600.2912a(2) retained the loss-of-opportunity doctrine, so it could not have been intended to entirely preclude the class of plaintiffs recognized by <em>Falcon </em>from bringing such claims; such a drastic step would be entirely at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>odds with the rationale of the loss-of-opportunity doctrine. Rather, MCL 600.2912a(2) retained the doctrine, but set the threshold at 50 percent, so that only plaintiffs who had a greater than 50 percent premalpractice opportunity to survive or achieve a better result could bring a claim. This interpretation is the only reasonable explanation for the Legislature\u2019s action \u2014 it aligns with the Legislature\u2019s apparent intent to both endorse the doctrine and place a limit on it. In sum, I concur with Chief Justice TAYLOR that plaintiff in this case proved a traditional medical-malpractice claim based on his physical injuries and that the jury\u2019s verdict should be upheld.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Plaintiff did not assert, or need to resort to, a claim for loss of opportunity. However, I disagree that the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) is substantially incomprehensible. The correct interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>tation of the second sentence can be discerned by an examination of the text of the statute. The result of this analysis is confirmed by the history of both the loss-of-opportunity doctrine and the statute. There is no internal conflict within the statute. The loss-of-opportunity doctrine is entirely consistent with the more-probable-than-not causation standard, so there is no conflict between the first and second sentences of MCL 600.2912a(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">RESPONSE to justice markman</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Justice Markman\u2019s approach to interpreting MCL 600.2912a(2) is grounded in several faulty premises. The first is that traditional medical-malpractice cases require that there be \u201cno question that the proper treatment would have resulted in a good outcome,\u201d because otherwise \u201cit cannot be proved that the improper treatment caused the bad outcome.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 217. This proposition would preclude plaintiffs with preexisting conditions that might have contributed <em>slightly </em>to their injuries from bringing medical-malpractice claims. It would also preclude medical-malpractice claims from arising in situations in which proper medical treatment does not <em>always </em>succeed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This proposition cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>correct. Plaintiffs alleging medical malpractice, regardless of whether they have preexisting conditions, are not required to prove that a defendant was a 100 percent cause of their injuries; they must simply prove more-probable-than-not causation. After all, traditional medical-malpractice claims are subject to the same principles of causation as other negligence claims. As Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 41, p 270, notes, \u201c[w]hen a child is drowned in a swimming pool, no one can say with certainty that a lifeguard would have saved the child; but the experience of the community permits the conclusion that the absence of the guard played a significant part in the drowning.\u201d There is no reason to treat medical-malpractice claims any differently in this regard. For example, even if an expert testified that a properly performed medical procedure will avoid a bad result 99 percent of the time, a jury could still conclude that the physician\u2019s negligence was more probably than not the cause of the bad result. See <em>post </em>at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Second, Justice MarkmAN\u2019s approach suggests that the factor distinguishing a medical-malpractice claim from a lost-opportunity claim is whether there is another possible cause of an injury, such as a preexisting condition. He states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">... I conclude that a \u201clost opportunity\u201d case is one in which it is at least possible that the bad outcome would have occurred even if the patient had received proper treatment. By contrast, if there is no question that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>proper treatment would have resulted in a good outcome, then the patient who suffered a bad outcome has a traditional medical-malpractice action. <em>[Post </em>at 186.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">But this definition of a lost-opportunity case is contrary to both the doctrine as described by <em>Falcon </em>and the doctrine as adopted by the Legislature in MCL 600.2912a(2). The distinction between a lost-opportunity case and a medical-malpractice case does not pivot on a plaintiffs preexisting condition or the absolute certainty that proper medical treatment would have prevented the harm the plaintiff suffered. Rather, the determining factor is whether the plaintiff can prove, more probably than not, that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused physical harm. If a plaintiff can prove more-probable-than-not causation for physical harm, then he has a medical-malpractice claim for that injury. If not, he may have a claim for loss of opportunity to avoid harm, if he can prove that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused that injury: the loss of an opportunity to avoid harm. Of course, many lost-opportunity cases arise when a plaintiff has a preexisting condition that could have caused physical harm without negligence, but this is a correlation, not a cause. The fact that a plaintiff has a preexisting condition does not, by itself, cause a claim to be a lost-opportunity claim rather than a medical-malpractice claim. Similarly, the existence of other possible causes for a bad result does not determine the cause of action available to that plaintiff. Specifically, the possibility that a patient\u2019s disease or injury itself may have caused the bad result does not mean that the patient cannot bring a traditional medical-malpractice claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rather, as <em>Falcon </em>ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>plained, traditional medical-malpractice claims require a plaintiff to show that the negligence more probably than not caused physical harm. <em>Falcon, </em>436 Mich at 449. The Legislature adopted <em>Falcon\u2019s </em>term \u201closs of opportunity\u201d as well as the traditional more-probable-than-not standard of causation. Accordingly, there is no reason to conclude that the distinguishing feature between medical-malpractice claims and lost-opportunity claims is the existence of other possible causes of the harm, as Justice MARKMAN appears to posit.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">These faulty suppositions are significant, because they lead Justice MARKMAN to endorse Dr. Roy Waddell\u2019s formula for calculating loss of opportunity. Waddell\u2019s formula purports to calculate a plaintiffs lost opportunity to survive by determining \u201cwhat percent of patients who would die without treatment\u201d could otherwise \u201cbe saved with treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If proper treatment creates a greater than 50 percent chance of survival within the set of patients who would have died without treatment, then a cause of action exists. But Waddell\u2019s formula is flawed for several reasons. It operates from a mistaken understanding of a lost-opportunity case. The formula identifies plaintiffs who can show that negligence was more than a 50 percent cause of their death or physical harm. But that set of plaintiffs can, by definition, maintain a traditional cause of action for medical malpractice for the injury of death or physical harm itself. Accordingly, his formula would preclude true lost-opportunity plaintiffs from bringing claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>and provide medical-malpractice claimants with lost-opportunity causes of action for which they have no need. Moreover, aside from its theoretical problems, the Waddell formula is blatantly inconsistent with the language of MCL 600.2912a(2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is inconceivable that Justice MARKMAN can read the sentence \u201cIn an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%\u201d and conclude that it should be translated into this formula:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">(Premalpractice chance) - (Postmalpractice chance) x 100 (Postmalpractice chance)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">This formula has no basis in the language of MCL 600.2912a(2) or <em>Falcon. </em>MCL 600.2912a(2) simply requires that the opportunity was greater than 50 percent. Again, it is noteworthy that my interpretation does not require adding any inferred language to the statute. A plaintiffs premalpractice opportunity to survive or to achieve a better result must simply have been \u201cgreater than 50%.\u201d The approach taken by Justice MARKMAN and Dr. Waddell requires this sentence to be rewritten to state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>that the plaintiffs opportunity to survive or to achieve a better result must have been decreased by 50 percent. See <em>post </em>at 195-197.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Finally, the Waddell approach leads to such anomalous results that it cannot possibly reflect the intention of the Legislature. The Legislature crafted MCL 600.2912a(2) as a reaction to <em>Falcon, </em>which permitted a lost-opportunity cause of action when the plaintiffs premalpractice opportunity to survive was 37.5 percent. As Justice MARKMAN acknowledges, if a plaintiff dropped from a 99.99 percent premalpractice chance of survival to a 99.97 percent postmalpractice chance of survival, the Waddell formula would conclude that the plaintiff had experienced an actionable 66.67 percent loss of opportunity. On the other hand, recovery would be barred if a plaintiff dropped from a 60 percent premalpractice chance of survival to a 40 percent chance of survival, because the plaintiff would have experienced only a 33 percent loss of opportunity. It is unlikely that the Legislature intended to compensate a loss of just 0.02 percentage points, while simultaneously precluding a loss of 20 percentage points. It is more likely that the Legislature disagreed with the threshold limit for lost-opportunity cases established by <em>Falcon, </em>37.5 percent, and amended MCL 600.2912a(2) to raise the threshold to 50 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">RESPONSE TO CHIEF JUSTICE TAYLOR</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">While we reach different interpretations of MCL 600.2912a(2), I nevertheless agree with Justice MARKMAN that Chief Justice TAYLOR errs by concluding that the second sentence of the statute is incomprehensible and unenforceable. I share Justice MARKMAN\u2019s objection to the unprecedented approach Chief Justice TAYLOR has taken in concluding that this statute is unenforceable simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>because it presents a complex matter of interpretation. While the fracture of this Court on this matter certainly illustrates the difficulty of interpreting this statute, I disagree that it compels the conclusion that the statute is unenforceable. And, in fact, Chief Justice Taylor\u2019s opinion paradoxically indicates that the statute will continue to be enforced unless the Legislature amends it, because the <em>Fulton </em>panel\u2019s interpretation will remain controlling law. <em>Ante </em>at 164 n 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">I disagree with Chief Justice Taylor\u2019s conclusion that the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) is incomprehensible and cannot be judicially enforced. Therefore, I respectfully disagree with his analysis of that provision. However, I agree that the jury\u2019s verdict should be upheld, because plaintiff has presented evidence that supports a traditional medical-malpractice claim.</p>\n<judges id=\"b317-7\">Weaver and Kelly, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-8\"> Throughout this opinion, \u201cplaintiff\u201d refers to Carl Stone; the claim of his wife, Nancy Stone, is derivative in nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-8\"> MCL 600.1483.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b283-9\"> In addition, subsections 1(a) and (b) of the statute both include language requiring the plaintiff to show that, \u201cas a proximate result of the defendant failing to provide [the appropriate standard of practice or care], the plaintiff suffered an injury.\u201d MCL 600.2912a(1)(a) and (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\"> Although this Court decided <em>Weymers </em>long after the statute at issue was enacted in 1993, the negligence alleged in <em>Weymers </em>occurred before 1993.

Long before <em>Falcon v Mem Hosp, </em>436 Mich 443; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>462 NW2d 44 (1990), plaintiffs successfully brought actions for medical malpractice even though they had preexisting conditions or might have had a bad result despite being properly treated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b286-6\"> Only Justice Archer joined Justice Levin\u2019s lead opinion. Justice Boyle wrote a concurrence, joined by Justice Cavanagh, that agreed that tort law should allow a claim for \u201clost opportunity to survive\u201d when \u201cthe negligence of the defendant more probably than not caused the loss of opportunity.\u201d <em>Falcon, supra </em>at 472-473 (Boyle, J., concurring). However, the concurrence noted that \u201cany language in the lead opinion suggesting that a similar cause of action might lie for a lost opportunity of avoiding lesser physical harm is dicta.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\"> While <em>Falcon </em>superficially recognized this, it determined that the patient\u2019s death, which could not be said to have been caused by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>doctor\u2019s malpractice, was the physical injury she suffered. By permitting the plaintiff to recover for a different injury (loss of an opportunity to survive), the Court ignored the fundamental requirement that a tort plaintiff must suffer a physical injury that was caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence. Instead of clarifying that it was significantly redefining \u201cinjury\u201d in a wholly new way, the lead opinion in <em>Falcon </em>first focused almost completely on relaxing the burden of proof regarding causation. See, e.g., <em>Falcon, supra </em>at 449-453 and nn 5 and 6, 455-457 (Levin, J.). Then it recited foreign cases holding that a reduction in chances is a compensable injury and determined that to be sound. <em>Id. </em>at 461-468. The opinion did not appear to recognize that this was contrary to a considerable body of existing Michigan caselaw. See <em>id. </em>at 494 (Riley, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe recovery of damages for the loss of a mere chance eviscerates the principles that underlie our tort law.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b290-14\"> Justice Cavanagh asserts that a plaintiff cannot claim a lost opportunity \u201cunless [the] plaintiff suffered a verifiable <em>loss.\u201d Post </em>at 172 n 2. Justice Makkman appears to agree with him that a bad result must occur, otherwise the opportunity has not been lost. <em>Post </em>at 197. Certainly, in such cases the defendant\u2019s conduct might have increased the likelihood of a bad result. Yet if the plaintiff is unable to show that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused the bad result, how can he or she nonetheless show that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused the opportunity to be lost? This is the heart of the problem with allowing loss-of-opportunity claims: either the patient has a concrete injury, in which case he or she should be required to prove causation, or the plaintiff does not, in which case the defendant should not be held liable.

In any formula assessing causation, patients who would have had a favorable outcome regardless of treatment need to be taken out of the equation. See, e.g., Waddell, <em>A doctor\u2019s view of \u201copportunity to survive\u2019\u2019: </em>Fulton\u2019s <em>assumptions and math are wrong, </em>86 Mich B J 32 (March 2007).

Thus, a majority of this Court agreed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>fundamental principles of the loss-of-opportunity doctrine, although Justice Boyle and I would have limited the discussion to the harm that the <em>Falcon </em>plaintiff suffered-death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-5\"> Chief Justice Taylor\u2019s concern that redefining \u201cinjury\u201d in this way would permit recovery for a \u201clost chance alone, without proof of physical injury\u201d is unfounded. <em>Ante </em>at 157. By definition, one does not suffer the loss of an opportunity to survive unless death occurs. Otherwise, there would have been no opportunity lost. Similarly, a claim for the loss of an opportunity to achieve a better result does not arise unless a plaintiff suffered a verifiable <em>loss. </em>The loss is the injury that the lost-opportunity doctrine recognizes. Typically, proof of an actionable loss will involve actual physical harm suffered by the plaintiff. Defining injury as such will not allow a plaintiff to recover for a potential future injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b304-6\"> For example, a patient who had a premalpractice opportunity to survive of 60 percent, and whose chance of survival was reduced to 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>percent because of malpractice, would have a cause of action for loss of opportunity to survive if he ultimately died. The plaintiff in that case would not have a wrongful-death action because it was not more probable than not that the negligence caused the patient\u2019s death.

But, in fact, the statute simply requires that <em>\u201cthe opportunity </em>was greater than 50%.\u201d MCL 600.2912a(2) (emphasis added). The fact that Justice Markman is compelled to recharacterize the text of the statute in this way strongly suggests that his interpretation infers the word \u201clost\u201d before the word \u201copportunity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b308-4\"> Justice Markman asserts that I am incorrect on this point because, for example, plaintiff in this case can show that he lost an 80 percent opportunity to achieve a better result (no amputation), but \u201ccannot prove that defendant\u2019s malpractice caused the amputation, as he would be required to do in a traditional medical-malpractice action... because there was at least a 1 percent chance that plaintiff would have suffered an amputation even with proper treatment.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 214. From this argument, it would appear that Justice Markman believes that medical-malpractice actions require a plaintiff to prove that a defendant\u2019s negligence was a 100 percent cause of his injury.

[Anno: <em>Medical malpractice-. \u201cLoss of chance\" causality, </em>54 ALR4th 10, 18 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The Legislature codified this position in MCL 600.2912a(2), which gives the plaintiff the burden of proving that the defendant\u2019s negligence more probably than not proximately caused his injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\"> There was adequate evidence that the doctor\u2019s malpractice proximately caused plaintiffs injuries. It is undisputed that plaintiffs aneurysm ruptured and that he suffered amputation of his legs as a result. The jury heard testimony that, had plaintiff been diagnosed earlier and undergone elective surgery, his chance of having complete success with no complications would have been approximately 95 percent, his chance of death would have been 1 to 5 percent, and his chance of amputation would have been 1 percent. Given the rupture, his approximate chance of complete success with no complications dropped to 5 to 10 percent, his chance of death became 60 to 90 percent, and his chance of surviving, but suffering amputation, became 5 percent. When a patient\u2019s chance of complete success drops from 95 percent to less than 10 percent because of a doctor\u2019s malpractice, and the patient suffers one of the natural complications, the jury\u2019s conclusion that the malpractice proximately caused that injury is warranted. If the jury in this case could only have considered the specific risk of amputation, as Justice Makkman suggests, <em>post </em>at 216 n 25, plaintiff would essentially be penalized for managing to survive an event that few others do. While the risks associated with harms that were not actually suffered by a plaintiff are not relevant to the extent of a plaintiffs lost opportunity, potential risks stemming from a physician\u2019s malpractice may be relevant to the jury\u2019s determination of whether malpractice caused a plaintiff to suffer a particular harm rather than achieve a good result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\"> Justice Markman cites no authority for the proposition that a plaintiff may only recover for traditional medical malpractice if proper treatment would not have resulted in the bad result suffered by the plaintiff.

I think it is more than merely possible that the Legislature did not have this concept in mind when it crafted this law; notably, Waddell\u2019s article was not even published until 2007, long after the Legislature amended MCL 600.2912a(2) in 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b317-8\">Markman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ago\"><em>(concurring in the result only). </em>We granted leave to appeal to address the proper interpretation of the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2), which states: \u201cIn an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%. \u201d Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019S opinion concludes that this sentence is \u201csubstantially incomprehensible,\u201d and, therefore, \u201cunenforceable.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 147, 161, 164. Although this statutory language is by no means a model of clarity, I am in accord with Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s opinion that the \u201clost opportunity\u201d provision is enforceable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>However, Justice CAVANAGH concludes that the \u201clost opportunity\u201d provision requires only that the patient\u2019s premalpractice chance to survive or obtain a better result be greater than 50 percent. Finally, he concludes that this is not even a \u201clost opportunity\u201d case. In these respects, I also disagree with his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Instead, I conclude that a \u201clost opportunity\u201d case is one in which it is at least possible that the bad outcome would have occurred even if the patient had received proper treatment. By contrast, if there is no question that the proper treatment would have resulted in a good outcome, then the patient who has suffered a bad outcome has a traditional medical-malpractice action. In order for a traditional medical-malpractice plaintiff to prevail, he or she must prove that the bad outcome was more probably than not caused by the defendant\u2019s malpractice. In order for a \u201clost opportunity\u201d plaintiff to prevail, he or she must prove that the \u201clost opportunity\u201d to achieve a better result was more probably than not caused by the defendant\u2019s malpractice and that the \u201clost opportunity\u201d was greater than 50 percent. In order to determine whether the \u201clost opportunity\u201d was greater than 50 percent, the postmalpractice chance of obtaining a better result must be subtracted from the premalpractice chance, the postmalpractice chance must then be subtracted from 100, the former number must be divided by the latter number, and then this quotient must be multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage. If this percentage is greater than 50, the plaintiff may be able to prevail; if this percentage is 50 or less, then the plaintiff cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Because it is possible that the bad outcome in the instant case, i.e., amputation, would have occurred even if plaintiff had received proper treatment, given that there was some chance of amputation in the latter circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>stance, this is a \u201clost opportunity\u201d action. Because plaintiffs \u201clost opportunity\u201d was greater than 50 percent,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I would affirm the result reached by the. Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">I. \u201cLOST OPPORTUNITY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">A. COMMON LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">This Court first recognized a \u201clost opportunity\u201d claim in <em>Falcon v Mem Hosp, </em>436 Mich 443; 462 NW2d 44 (1990). In <em>Falcon, </em>the plaintiffs expert witness testified that had the defendant physician not been negligent, the plaintiffs decedent would have had a 37.5 percent chance of surviving. Before <em>Falcon, </em>plaintiffs claiming medical malpractice were required to prove that the malpractice in fact caused the patient\u2019s physical harm. <em>Falcon, </em>436 Mich at 448-449 (LEVIN, J.). Thus, in a wrongful-death case grounded in medical malpractice, the plaintiff was required to prove that the malpractice in fact caused the patient\u2019s death. In <em>Falcon, </em>the defendants argued that because the patient\u2019s premalpractice chance of survival was only 37.5 percent, the plaintiff could not prove that the malpractice caused the patient\u2019s death; the patient might very well have died even with proper treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Although this Court agreed with the defendants that the plaintiff could not prove that the malpractice caused the patient\u2019s death, it nonetheless held that the plaintiff could prove that the malpractice caused the patient to suffer the loss of a 37.5 percent opportunity to survive. <em>Id. </em>at 460. \u201cIn reducing [the patient\u2019s] opportunity of living. . ., her physician caused her harm, although it cannot be said . . . that he caused her death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>thus see the injury resulting from medical malpractice as not only, or necessarily, physical harm, but also as including the loss of opportunity of avoiding physical harm\u201d because a \u201cpatient goes to a physician precisely to improve his opportunities of avoiding, ameliorating, or reducing physical harm . ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461. Thus, we recognized a \u201closs of an opportunity for a more favorable result, as distinguished from the unfavorable result [itself], as compensable in medical malpractice actions.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cUnder this approach, damages are recoverable for the loss of opportunity although the opportunity lost was less than even, and thus it is not more probable than not that the unfavorable result would or could have been avoided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461-462.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>However, even \u201c[u]nder this approach, the plaintiff must establish more-probable-than-not causation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462. That is, the plaintiff \u201cmust prove, more probably than not, that the defendant reduced the opportunity of avoiding harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, in both a traditional medical-malpractice action, in which the alleged injuiy is the physical injury itself, and a \u201clost opportunity\u201d action, in which the alleged injury is the \u201clost opportunity\u201d to achieve a better result, the plaintiff must prove that it is more probable than not that the defendant\u2019s malpractice caused the injuiy. In other words, the difference between these two causes of action is not the standard of proof for causation, but the nature of the alleged injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">This Court also held that the \u201clost opportunity\u201d must be a \u201csubstantial\u201d lost opportunity. <em>Id. </em>at 470. However, this Court did not define the parameters of a \u201csubstantial\u201d lost opportunity other than to say that the \u201closs of a 37.5 percent opportunity of living constitutes a loss of a substantial opportunity of avoiding physical harm.\u201d <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This Court explained that a \u201c37.5 percent opportunity of living is hardly the kind of opportunity that any of us would willingly allow our health care providers to ignore.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Finally, this Court held that \u201crecovery should be allowed <em>\u2018only </em>for the lost chance of survival.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471 (citation omitted) (emphasis in original). That is, the \u201c \u2018proper computation of damages would limit the damages recoverable to only that amount of reduced chance of recovery actually caused by the physician\u2019s negligent conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472 n 47 (citation omitted). Therefore, we concluded that if the jury were to find that the physician\u2019s malpractice more probably than not had caused the patient to lose a 37.5 percent opportunity to survive, \u201c37.5 percent times the damages recoverable for wrongful death would be an appropriate measure of damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In <em>Weymers v Khera, </em>454 Mich 639, 642; 563 NW2d 647 (1997), this Court refused to \u201crecognize a cause of action for the loss of an opportunity to avoid physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>harm less than death.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although <em>Weymers </em>did not overrule <em>Falcon, </em>it clearly disagreed with Falcon<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and \u201crefuse[d] to extend <em>Falcon.\u201d Id. </em>at 649. In <em>Weymers, </em>the plaintiffs expert testified that \u201cif defendants had given plaintiff proper care she would have had a thirty to forty percent chance of retaining the functioning of her kidneys.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 644. However, the plaintiff did not receive proper care and her kidneys totally failed, requiring her to undergo a kidney transplant. Because the plaintiffs premalpractice chance to avoid kidney failure was not greater than 50 percent, <em>Weymers </em>held that she could not prove that the malpractice more probably than not caused her kidney failure. The Court refused to recognize a cause of action for the plaintiffs \u201clost opportunity\u201d to avoid kidney failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In doing so, <em>Weymers, </em>in my judgment, mischaracterized the \u201clost opportunity\u201d doctrine that had been developed in <em>Falcon. Weymers </em>stated: \u201cThe antithesis of proximate cause is the doctrine of lost opportunity,\u201d because the \u201clost opportunity doctrine allows a plaintiff to recover when the defendant\u2019s negligence possibly, i.e., a probability of fifty percent or less, caused the plaintiffs injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648. <em>Weymers </em>also accused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number><em>Falcon </em>Court of \u201clower[ing] the standard of causation\u201d and \u201callow[ing] [a plaintiff] to recover without establishing cause in fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 650. Finally, <em>Weymers </em>stated that under the <em>Falcon </em>approach, \u201cthe plaintiff must show that there is a substantial possibility that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused his injury,\u201d and, thus, a plaintiff is allowed \u201cto recover for his injury even though it was more likely than not that he would have suffered the injury if the defendant had not been negligent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Although <em>Weymers </em>noted that <em>Falcon </em>had \u201cdefined the injury as the loss of opportunity to avoid the harm, i.e., the death, rather than the harm itself,\u201d <em>Weymers </em>failed to recognize the significance of this distinction, as shown by its very next sentence, which stated that <em>Falcon\u2019s </em>approach allows \u201c \u2018a plaintiff [to] receive[] compensation despite the greater probability that he or she would have suffered the injury even if the physician had used due care.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651 n 19 (citation omitted). This is further shown by the fact that the <em>Weymers </em>majority believed that it would have to \u201cscrap[]\u201d or \u201cdiscard\u201d causation in order to \u201crecognize a cause of action for the loss of an opportunity to avoid physical harm less than death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">However, as discussed earlier, <em>Falcon </em>did not lower the standard of causation when it adopted the \u201clost opportunity\u201d doctrine. <em>Falcon, </em>436 Mich at 462 (LEVIN, J.). Instead, it applied the same standard of causation, i.e., more probable than not, to a new type of injury, i.e., a \u201clost opportunity\u201d to survive. <em>Id. Falcon </em>specifically held that a plaintiff bringing a \u201clost opportunity\u201d claim \u201cmust prove, more probably than not, that the defendant reduced the opportunity of avoiding harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Therefore, <em>Weymers </em>erred when it described the \u201clost opportunity\u201d doctrine developed in <em>Falcon </em>as lowering the standard of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">B. STATUTORY PROVISION</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In 1993, three years after <em>Falcon </em>was decided, the Legislature enacted MCL 600.2912a(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or defendants. In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Everybody agrees that this provision was enacted in response to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Falcon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">In <em>Wickens v Oakwood Healthcare Sys, </em>465 Mich 53, 62; 631 NW2d 686 (2001), this Court held that \u201ca living plaintiff may not recover for loss of an opportunity to survive on the basis of a decrease in her chances of long-term survival.\u201d The plaintiffs expert testified that the defendants\u2019 negligent one-year delay in diagnosing her breast cancer had caused plaintiff to suffer a reduction in her chances of surviving another 10 years. This Court relied on the first sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2), which states that a medical-malpractice plaintiff \u201chas the burden of proving that he or she <em>suffered an injury </em>that more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We held that this provision \u201cexpressly limits recovery to injuries that have already been suffered and more probably than not were caused by the defendant\u2019s malpractice.\u201d <em>Wickens, </em>465 Mich at 60. \u201cThus, plaintiff can only recover for a present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>injury not for a potential future injury.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Because the plaintiff in <em>Wickens </em>survived, she had not suffered a loss of an opportunity to survive. <em>Id. </em>That is, a person who survives cannot be said to have suffered a loss of an opportunity to survive. A person does not suffer a loss of an opportunity to survive until that person ceases to survive. Although we held that the surviving plaintiff in <em>Wickens </em>could not bring a claim for a loss of an opportunity to survive, this Court did hold that the plaintiffs claims that the delayed diagnosis resulted in the \u201cneed for more invasive medical treatments, emotional trauma, and pain and suffering\u201d could proceed because she had already suffered those injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In <em>Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp, </em>253 Mich App 70, 77-78; 655 NW2d 569 (2002), the Court of Appeals described the issue as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">whether the second sentence of [MCL 600.2912a(2)] requires a plaintiff in order to recover for loss of an opportunity to survive to show only that the initial opportunity to survive before the alleged malpractice was greater than fifty percent, as argued by plaintiff, or, instead, that the opportunity to survive was reduced by greater than fifty percent because of the alleged malpractice, as argued by defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The Court held that the language \u201cthe opportunity\u201d was ambiguous, because it could be referring to the \u201cinitial opportunity\u201d or it could be referring to the \u201closs of opportunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80. However, because the Court believed that \u201cMCL 600.2912a(2) was enacted to codify and increase the requirements [set forth in <em>Falcon] </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>what constitutes a \u2018substantial loss of opportunity,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 82, quoting <em>Falcon, </em>436 Mich at 470, and because <em>Falcon </em>\u201cdid not focus on the initial opportunity to survive, but focused on whether the decrease in the decedent\u2019s opportunity to survive was substantial,\u201d <em>Fulton, </em>253 Mich App at 81, the Court chose the latter interpretation, <em>id. </em>at 83. That is, the Court held that the \u201clost opportunity,\u201d not just the initial opportunity, must \u201cexceed 50 percent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">I agree with this. The second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) reads: \u201cIn an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for <em>loss of an opportunity </em>to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless <em>the opportunity </em>was greater than 50%. \u201d (Emphasis added.) This sentence first refers to the \u201closs of an opportunity\u201d and then to \u201cthe opportunity.\u201d In my judgment, the language \u201cthe opportunity\u201d clearly refers back to the \u201closs of an opportunity.\u201d Therefore, the second sentence can reasonably be read to mean that the loss of the opportunity must be greater than 50 percent. In contrast, there is no reasonable means of reading the language \u201cinitial opportunity\u201d into the sentence. Therefore, I agree with <em>Fulton\u2019s </em>conclusion that the lost opportunity, not just the initial opportunity, must be greater than 50 percent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The Court of Appeals in <em>Fulton </em>next concluded that because the plaintiffs premalpractice chance of survival was 85 percent and her postmalpractice chance of survival was 60 percent to 65 percent, her \u201clost opportunity\u201d was 20 percent to 25 percent and, thus, because the plaintiffs \u201clost opportunity\u201d was not greater than 50 percent, she could not recover under MCL 600.2912a(2). However, <em>Fulton </em>did not offer any explanation as to why it merely subtracted the postmalpractice chance from the premalpractice chance to determine the \u201clost opportunity.\u201d This might have been the correct method of determining the \u201clost opportunity\u201d if MCL 600.2912a(2) required that such a loss be \u201cgreater than 50 percentage points.\u201d However, MCL 600.2912a(2) requires that the \u201clost opportunity\u201d be \u201cgreater than 50%. \u201d There is a significant distinction between 50 percentage points and 50 percent. As Dr. Roy Waddell, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon in Grand Rapids, has explained: \u201cA decrease in survival rate from 50 percent to 10 percent is a <em>40-percentage-point </em>decrease, but it is an 80 <em>percent </em>decrease.\u201d Wad-dell, <em>A doctor\u2019s view of \u201copportunity to survive\u201d: Fulton\u2019s assumptions and math are wrong, </em>86 Mich B J 32, 33 (March 2007) (emphasis in original). Similarly, a reduction in wages from $5 an hour to $1 an hour is not a 4 percent reduction in wages; rather, it is an 80 percent reduction in wages. See amicus curiae brief on behalf of Dr. Roy W Waddell, pp 12-13.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>The other problem with <em>Fulton\u2019s </em>method of calculating the \u201clost opportunity\u201d is that it does not differentiate between those patients who would have survived regardless of whether they received proper or improper treatment and those patients who needed the proper treatment in order to survive.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Such a differentiation is necessary because only those in the latter group have truly suffered a \u201clost opportunity\u201d as a result of the improper treatment. That is, if a patient would have survived regardless of whether he received proper or improper treatment, the improper treatment cannot be said to have caused him to lose an opportunity to survive. On the other hand, if the patient would have survived only if he had received the proper treatment, the improper treatment <em>can </em>be said to have caused him to lose an opportunity to survive. MCL 600.2912a(2) requires us to determine whether the patient more likely than not fell into the latter category rather than the former category, because the statute only allows a plaintiff to recover for a \u201closs of an opportunity\u201d that was \u201cgreater than 50%\u201d and that was \u201ccaused by the negligence of the defendant.. . .\u201d Dr. Waddell\u2019s calculation does just that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">(Premalpractice chance)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> - (Postmalpractice chance)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 100 - (Postmalpractice chance)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>The quotient resulting from this numerator and denominator is then multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This number must be \u201cgreater than 50%\u201d in order to satisfy the requirement of the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2). For instance, if the patient\u2019s pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>malpractice chance to achieve a better result was 80 percent and, as a result of the defendant\u2019s malpractice, the patient\u2019s postmalpractice chance is reduced to 20 percent, the patient has suffered a 75 percent loss of an opportunity to survive.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">What the Waddell formula essentially does is test the sufficiency of the expert testimony, which is typically presented in the form of two statistics: the likelihood that a patient would have had a good outcome with proper treatment (the \u201ctreated survival rate\u201d) and the likelihood that a patient would have had a good outcome with negligent treatment (the \u201cuntreated survival rate\u201d). The Waddell formula allows a court analyzing this data to determine whether the plaintiff, when the patient has experienced a bad outcome, has created a question of material fact concerning whether proper treatment more likely than not would have made a difference. The formula does this by identifying the universe of patients who would have had a bad outcome (the denominator) and the subset of those patients who could have been favorably treated (the numerator).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">It is easiest to start with the formula\u2019s denominator. This denominator consists of the universe of all patients who would have had a bad outcome, for whatever reason. This group includes two subsets of patients: those who would have had a bad outcome because they received negligent treatment, and those who would have had a bad outcome despite receiving proper treatment. The formula identifies this group by subtracting from 100 the percentage of patients who would have had a good outcome even without proper treatment; in other words, it subtracts the \u201cuntreated survival rate\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>from 100. In this way, a court can take the expert\u2019s statistics and identify those patients who were not treated properly and who experienced a bad outcome. A patient who is the subject of a medical-malpractice action is a member of this group. But we cannot determine whether the patient is a member of this group because he or she was denied the proper treatment or because he or she would have suffered a bad outcome even with proper treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">One more calculation must then be made in order to answer the dispositive question posed by the statute: whether it is more likely than not that the patient would have benefited from proper treatment or, put another way, whether the \u201copportunity to survive or . . . to achieve a better result\u201d was \u201cgreater than 50%.\u201d MCL 600.2912a(2). A court has to determine what percentage of those patients with a bad outcome (those patients in the denominator) would have benefited from treatment. This brings us to the Waddell formula\u2019s numerator. The numerator consists of those patients who would have had a bad outcome only if they had been negligently treated. It is calculated by subtracting the \u201cuntreated survival rate\u201d from the \u201ctreated survival rate,\u201d thus identifying those patients who required treatment to avoid a bad outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Once the numerator and denominator have been calculated, comparison of these two numbers by their quotient allows a court to reasonably determine whether improper treatment more likely than not made a difference in the patient\u2019s outcome. If the number of patients who would have had a bad outcome only if they had been negligently treated (the numerator) comprises more than half of the number of patients who would have had a bad outcome overall (the denominator), then the plaintiff has established that proper treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>more likely than not would have made a difference. In other words, when this has been shown, the plaintiff has created a question of material fact concerning whether the \u201copportunity\u201d\u2014 the benefit that would have been realized by a group of patients from the treatment that was not given to this specific patient \u2014 was greater than 50 percent. Such a plaintiff has presented adequate expert testimony to establish a \u201clost opportunity\u201d cause of action within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">As Dr. Waddell has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">[T]he intent of the law is to disallow damages unless it can be shown that <em>proper treatment creates a better than even </em>(\u201cgreater than 50%\u201d) <em>chance of survival of the patients who would have died without treatment. </em>In other words, if appropriate treatment <em>cannot </em>save at least half of the patients who otherwise would have died, then you do not have sufficient evidence to show that the negligence made the difference in the adverse outcome (death). Conversely, if good treatment <em>can </em>save more than half of the patients who otherwise would have died, then you have adequate evidence that the poor treatment or negligence was likely to blame for the bad outcome. This is exactly what this definition of opportunity measures. [Waddell, 86 Mich B J at 33 (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">MCL 600.2912a(2) only allows a plaintiff to recover for a \u201closs of an opportunity\u201d that was \u201cgreater than 50%\u201d and that was \u201ccaused by the negligence of the defendant ... .\u201d Use of Dr. Waddell\u2019s formula, which generates the actual percentage lost rather than the number of percentage points lost, and excludes those who would have achieved a good result regardless of the malpractice, best ensures, in my judgment, that these statutory requirements are satisfied.

RESPONSE TO CHIEF JUSTICE TAYLOR</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Chief Justice Taylor\u2019s opinion concludes that the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) is \u201csubstantially incomprehensible,\u201d and, therefore, \u201cunenforceable.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 147, 161, 164.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Although he does not expressly rely on the \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d doctrine, he is apparently doing just that, because I am unaware of any other doctrine that would allow a court to conclude that a statutory provision is \u201cunenforceable\u201d on the basis that it is \u201csubstantially incomprehensible.\u201d The enactments of the Legislature are, as a rule, enforceable in the courts of this state absent a violation of the Michigan or the United States constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d doctrine derives from the Due Process Clause. \u201c \u2018It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>prohibitions are not clearly defined.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Howell, </em>396 Mich 16, 20 n 4; 238 NW2d 148 (1976), quoting <em>Groyned, v City of Rockford, </em>408 US 104, 108; 92 S Ct 2294; 33 L Ed 2d 222 (1972). \u201cThe void-for-vagueness doctrine reflects the principle that <em>\u2018a </em>statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that [persons] of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.. . violates the first essential of due process of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roberts v United States Jaycees, </em>468 US 609, 629; 104 S Ct 3244; 82 L Ed 2d 462 (1984), quoting <em>Connally v Gen Constr Co, </em>269 US 385, 391; 46 S Ct 126; 70 L Ed 2d 322 (1926). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">\u201cthis prohibition against excessive vagueness does not invalidate every statute which a reviewing court believes could have been drafted with greater precision. Many statutes will have some inherent vagueness, for \u2018[in] most English words and phrases there lurk uncertainties.\u2019 Even trained lawyers may find it necessary to consult legal dictionaries, treatises, and judicial opinions before they may say with any certainty what some statutes may compel or forbid. All the Due Process Clause requires is that the law give sufficient warning that men may conduct themselves so as to avoid that which is forbidden.\u201d <em>[People v Petrella, </em>424 Mich 221, 255; 380 NW2d 11 (1985) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d doctrine serves three related interests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">\u201cFirst, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to he prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application. Third, but related, where a vague statute \u2018abut[s] upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms,\u2019 it \u2018operates to inhibit the exercise of [those] freedoms.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Howell, </em>396 Mich at 20 n 4, quoting <em>Groyned, </em>408 US at 108-109.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">I would add that the \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d doctrine also ensures that the \u201cjudicial power\u201d of this state, see Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1, is not inappropriately exercised by \u201cinterpreting\u201d a statute whose language is simply not susceptible to reasonable interpretation; an attempt to give meaning to such a statute will inevitably devolve into a legislative or policy-making determination on the part of a branch of government whose responsibilities do not entail such determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d doctrine has generally been held applicable only to criminal statutes or to laws infringing First Amendment freedoms. Indeed, to the best of my knowledge, this Court has <em>never </em>struck down a civil statute that does not implicate First Amendment freedoms under the \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d doctrine. Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019S opinion cites no Michigan or federal caselaw to the contrary. Nor can any support for his conclusion be found in any of the parties\u2019 briefs or the numerous amicus curiae briefs filed in this Court. Indeed, not one of those briefs even suggests that the \u201clost opportunity\u201d provision in MCL 600.2912a(2) is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">This Court has held that a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">statute may he challenged for vagueness on the grounds that it</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">\u2014is overbroad, impinging on First Amendment freedoms, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">\u2014does not provide fair notice of the conduct proscribed, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u2014is so indefinite that it confers unstructured and unlimited discretion on the trier of fact to determine whether an offense has been committed. <em>[Woll v Attorney General, </em>409 Mich 500, 533; 297 NW2d 578 (1980).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Chief Justice Taylor\u2019s opinion does not indicate on which of these grounds it finds the \u201clost opportunity\u201d provision to be unconstitutionally vague. The first ground certainly is not pertinent, because the \u201clost opportunity\u201d provision does not impinge on any First Amendment freedoms. Neither of the other two grounds seems to be pertinent either, as both seem to pertain to criminal offenses, given that the second ground refers to \u201cthe conduct proscribed\u201d and the third ground refers to \u201cwhether an offense has been committed.\u201d The \u201clost opportunity\u201d provision neither \u201cproscribe[s]\u201d conduct nor confers \u201cunlimited discretion on the trier of fact to determine whether an offense has been committed.\u201d Therefore, there does not seem to be any basis under our current case-law to strike down the \u201clost opportunity\u201d provision as being unconstitutionally vague. Chief Justice TAYLOR should, at the least, explain and justify his extension of this doctrine, which enables this Court to strike down an enactment of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In <em>A B Small Co v American Sugar Refining Co, </em>267 US 233; 45 S Ct 295; 69 L Ed 589 (1925), the United States Supreme Court held that a buyer could not elude a contract to purchase refined sugar on the basis that the seller was charging an \u201cunjust\u201d or \u201cunreasonable\u201d price in violation of a federal statute, because the federal statute was unconstitutionally vague. It is noteworthy that although <em>American Sugar </em>involved a civil breach-of-contract action, the statutory language invalidated was a criminal statute. However, even putting that aside, the Court held that the provision was unconstitutionally vague because it required people to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u201cconform to a rule or standard which was so vague and indefinite that no one could know what it was.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238-239.

As discussed throughout this opinion, I simply do not believe that the provision at issue is incapable of being understood. MCL 600.2912a(2) may conceivably be unwise or imprudent, it could conceivably have been drafted with greater clarity and precision, and its interpretation may require an unusual investment of judicial effort, but it is not incapable of being understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In <em>Exxon Corp v Busbee, </em>644 F2d 1030, 1031 (CA 5, 1981), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that a state commercial regulatory statute was not unconstitutionally vague, because it was not \u201c \u2018impossible to divine.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) That court explained that \u201c[b]ecause the statute is not concerned with either the first amendment or the definition of criminal conduct,... we must be lenient in evaluating its constitutionality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1033. It further explained that \u201cuncertainty in this statute is not enough for it to be unconstitutionally vague; rather, it must be <em>substantially incomprehensible.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Finally, the court indicated that \u201cthe parties themselves have offered possible interpretations\u201d of the provision, and then concluded that \u201c[t]hese attempts at statutory construction illustrate that [the provision] is, while most assuredly not a \u2018model of clarity,\u2019 at least amenable to some sensible construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1034 (cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>tion omitted).

In cases of doubt, every possible presumption, not clearly inconsistent with the language and the subject matter, is to be made in favor of the constitutionality of the act. <em>[Sears v Cottrell, </em>5 Mich 251, 259 (1858) (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u201cWe are duty bound under the Michigan Constitution to preserve the laws of this state. . . .\u201d <em>People v Bricker, </em>389 Mich 524, 528; 208 NW2d 172 (1973).

Once again, I disagree. Chief Justice TAYLOR states that under the first sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2), a plaintiff must prove that the defendant\u2019s malpractice caused the injury, while under the second sentence, a plaintiff cannot prove that the defendant\u2019s malpractice caused the injury. What he fails to recognize is that in a \u201clost opportunity\u201d action, the injury is not the death or the physical harm, but the \u201clost opportunity\u201d to avoid the death or physical harm,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and that a \u201clost opportunity\u201d plaintiff <em>does </em>have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>to prove that the defendant\u2019s malpractice more probably than not caused <em>this </em>injury. As we explained in <em>Falcon, </em>436 Mich at 461 (LEVIN, J.): \u201cWe thus see the injury resulting from medical malpractice as not only, or necessarily, physical harm, but also as including the loss of opportunity of avoiding physical harm.\u201d However, even \u201c[u]nder this approach, the plaintiff must establish more-probable-than-not causation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462. That is, the plaintiff \u201cmust prove, more probably than not, that the defendant reduced the opportunity of avoiding harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, in both a traditional medical-malpractice action, in which the alleged injury is the death or the physical harm itself, and in a \u201clost opportunity\u201d action, in which the alleged injury is the \u201clost opportunity\u201d to avoid the death or the physical harm, the plaintiff must prove that it is more probable than not that the defendant\u2019s malpractice caused the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Contrary to Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019S contention, then, the two sentences in MCL 600.2912a(2) are not inconsistent. Pursuant to the first sentence, all medical-malpractice plaintiffs must prove that the defendant\u2019s malpractice more probably than not caused the alleged injury. Pursuant to the second sentence, a \u201clost opportunity\u201d plaintiff must prove that the \u201clost opportunity\u201d was greater than 50 percent. Therefore, in order to satisfy both sentences, a \u201clost opportunity\u201d plaintiff must prove that the defendant\u2019s malpractice more probably than not caused the \u201clost opportunity\u201d <em>and </em>that the \u201clost opportunity\u201d was greater than 50 percent. There is nothing inconsistent about these sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>However, there is something inconsistent about Chief Justice Taylor\u2019s opinion. He concludes that the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) is so \u201csubstantially incomprehensible\u201d that it is \u201cunenforceable.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 147, 161, 164. Yet, despite this conclusion, he repeatedly asserts that when the Legislature enacted the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) it \u201cintended\u201d certain things. See, e.g., <em>ante </em>at 158, where the he states that the Legislature \u201cintended\u201d the \u201clost opportunity\u201d provision to apply to \u201c situation [s] in which an injury might have occurred anyway, but in which the defendant\u2019s act or omission hastened or worsened it in such a way that the plaintiff suffered more severe physical injury than he or she would have had the negligence not occurred,\u201d and <em>ante </em>at 162, where he states that \u201cthe Legislature intended to retain the traditional proximate-cause requirement in effect before <em>Falcon </em>.... \u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> If this provision is so vague \u2014 indeed of a constitutional dimension, as Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019S opinion essentially concludes\u2014 how can he be so certain what the Legislature intended by it? Either we know what the Legislature intended by this provision or we do not; Chief Justice TAYLOR cannot have it both ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">IV RESPONSE TO JUSTICE CAVANAGH</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In his opinion, Justice CAVANAGH concludes that the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) requires only that the patient\u2019s premalpractice chance to obtain a better result be greater than 50 percent. As explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>earlier, I agree with him that the phrase \u201cthe opportunity\u201d in MCL 600.2912a(2) refers back to the language \u201closs of an opportunity.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> However, I disagree with his conclusion that \u201closs of an opportunity\u201d refers to the patient\u2019s premalpractice chance to obtain a better result. Instead, I believe that \u201closs of an opportunity\u201d clearly refers to the opportunity that the patient actually lost as a consequence of the defendant\u2019s malpractice. MCL 600.2912a(2) states that \u201cthe plaintiff cannot <em>recover </em>for loss of an opportunity .. . unless the opportunity was greater than 50%. \u201d (Emphasis added.) That is, the opportunity that MCL 600.2912a(2) refers to is the \u201clost opportunity\u201d for which the plaintiff may \u201crecover.\u201d The plaintiff cannot necessarily recover for the entire premalpractice chance to obtain a better result; instead, he or she can only recover for the portion of the premalpractice chance that was actually lost. Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s opinion states that \u201cthe opportunity alleged to have been lost must be the premalpractice opportunity.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 174 (emphasis added). This is plainly incorrect. Instead, the chance alleged to have been lost <em>may </em>be the entire premalpractice chance; however, it <em>may also </em>be only a portion of the premalpractice chance, as in the instant case in which plaintiffs opportunity to obtain a better result was reduced from 99 percent to 95 percent. Justice CAVANAGH seems to recognize this, because he states that \u201cthe premalpractice opportunity ... is the opportunity that is lost <em>in some measure </em>. . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 174 (emphasis added). In fact, at one point, he seems to reach the same conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>sion that I do \u2014 \u201ca plaintiff cannot recover for the loss of an opportunity unless <em>the </em>opportunity \u2014 the premalpractice opportunity that was allegedly lost in some measure \u2014 was greater than 50 percent.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 174 (emphasis in original). That is, the portion of the premalpractice opportunity that was lost must be greater than 50 percent. However, at other points, he states inconsistently that the word \u201copportunity\u201d refers only to the premalpractice opportunity. <em>Ante </em>at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s opinion also contends that \u201cMCL 600.2912a(2) cannot limit recovery for the loss of an opportunity to cases in which the loss was greater than 50 percent, because any plaintiff who satisfied that condition would have a traditional medical-malpractice claim for the death or physical harm itself.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 175-176. Justice CAVANAGH similarly contends that Dr. Waddell\u2019s \u201cformula would preclude true lost-opportunity plaintiffs from bringing claims and provide medical-malpractice claimants with lost-opportunity causes of action for which they have no need.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 182-183. These contentions, I believe, are incorrect. For example, in the instant case, although, pursuant to Dr. Waddell\u2019s formula, plaintiff suffered the loss of an 80 percent opportunity to achieve a better result, i.e., no amputation, plaintiff cannot prove that defendants\u2019 malpractice caused the amputation, as he would be required to do in a traditional medical-malpractice action. He cannot prove that defendants\u2019 malpractice caused the amputation because there was at least a 1 percent chance that plaintiff would have suffered an amputation even with proper treatment. However, plaintiff <em>did </em>prove that defendants\u2019 malpractice caused him to suffer the loss of an 80 percent opportunity to achieve a better result, i.e., no amputation. Therefore, contrary to Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s contention, it is possible to have a situation in which the \u201clost opportunity\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>exceeds 50 percent, but the plaintiff cannot satisfy the requirements of a traditional medical-malpractice action, and Dr. Waddell\u2019s formula identifies those plaintiffs who cannot satisfy the requirements of a traditional medical-malpractice action but who can satisfy the \u201clost opportunity\u201d requirements of MCL 600.2912a(2).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>In order to satisfy traditional medical-malpractice action requirements, there must be no question that the proper treatment would have resulted in a good outcome (at least with regard to the specific injury suffered by the patient), because if there is any chance that a patient who received proper treatment might nevertheless have suffered the specific bad outcome ultimately suffered by the patient, it cannot be proved that the improper treatment caused the bad outcome. If there is any chance that the proper treatment could have resulted in the bad outcome, the chances of a good outcome with proper treatment and the chances of a good outcome with improper treatment must be compared. That is, under those circumstances, although the plaintiff cannot prove that the defendant\u2019s malpractice caused the bad outcome because the bad outcome might have occurred even with proper treatment, the plaintiff may be able to prove that the defendant\u2019s malpractice increased the patient\u2019s chances of obtaining a bad outcome and, thus, caused him or her to suffer a \u201clost opportunity\u201d to achieve a better result. This is the only coherent concept of a \u201clost opportunity\u201d cause of action under MCL 600.2912a(2).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>v CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">A \u201clost opportunity\u201d action is one in which it is possible that the bad outcome would have occurred even if the patient had received proper treatment. On the other hand, if there is no question that the proper treatment would have resulted in a good outcome and the patient has suffered a bad outcome, the plaintiff possesses a traditional medical-malpractice action. In order for a traditional medical-malpractice plaintiff to prevail, the plaintiff must prove that the bad outcome was more probably than not caused by the defendant\u2019s malpractice. In order for a \u201clost opportunity\u201d plaintiff to prevail, the plaintiff must prove that the \u201clost opportunity\u201d to achieve a better result was more probably than not caused by the defendant\u2019s malpractice and that the \u201clost opportunity\u201d was greater than 50 percent. In order to determine whether the \u201clost opportunity\u201d was greater than 50 percent, the postmalpractice chance of obtaining a better result must be subtracted from the premalpractice chance; the postmalpractice chance must then be subtracted from 100; the former number must be divided by the latter number; and then this quotient must be multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage.

Moreover, I am cognizant that the Legislature may not specifically have had in mind the concept later embodied in Dr. Waddell\u2019s formula when it enacted MCL 600.2912a(2). However, it is the actual language of a statute to which this Court must ultimately be faithful. <em>People v Schaefer, </em>473 Mich 418, 430; 703 NW2d 774 (2005) (\u201cWhen interpreting a statute, it is the court\u2019s duty to give effect to the intent of the Legislature as expressed in the actual language used in the statute.\u201d).

Nonetheless, the only conclusion I reach in this opinion is that, whatever was in the recesses of Senator A\u2019s or Representative B\u2019s minds in the Legislature, they and their colleagues crafted a statute that is consistent with Dr. Waddell\u2019s formula and inconsistent with Justice Cavanagh\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\"> 80 - 20 100 - 20 x 100 = 75%</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b334-9\"> I acknowledge that the Waddell approach appears to lead to anomalous results in those situations in which there is only a slight loss of an opportunity. For example, as defendants point out, if the premalpractice chance of survival was 99.99 percent and the postmalpractice chance was 99.97 percent, the \u201clost opportunity\u201d would be 66.67 percent. Possibly, this would not constitute a practical problem, because experts are not generally able to predict opportunities with this degree of precision.

Nonetheless, if the Legislature wants to avoid the possibility of such an anomalous result, it could require, for example, that there be a threshold <em>percentage-point </em>loss as a result of the defendant\u2019s malpractice, say 5 or 10 percentage points, in addition to the requirement of the loss being \u201cgreater than 50%.\u201d Finally, I would emphasize that I am neither advocating for nor against the Waddell calculation as a matter of fairness or sound public policy; I simply believe that it is in accordance with the Legislature\u2019s directions in MCL 600.2912a(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b334-10\"> Although, for the reasons discussed above, I agree with the result reached by the Court of Appeals, I respectfully disagree with its calculation of the \u201clost opportunity.\u201d In addition, I disagree with its conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>that <em>all </em>the risks to which the patient was exposed should be considered when determining the patient\u2019s \u201clost opportunity.\u201d Instead, I believe that <em>only </em>those risks associated with the injuries that the patient actually suffered should be considered, since the whole point of a negligence action is to establish that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused a specific injury.

I disagree. In <em>Wickens, </em>this Court simply held that a surviving plaintiff has not lost an opportunity to survive. That is, a surviving plaintiff cannot recover damages for the possibility that he or she may die sometime in the future. There must be a present injury. Therefore, in a \u201clost opportunity to survive\u201d action, the patient must have failed to survive; and, in a \u201clost opportunity to achieve a better result\u201d action, the patient must have failed to achieve the better result. Those plaintiffs who survived, and those who achieved the better result, have simply suffered no \u201clost opportunity\u201d at all, and thus have no grounds on which to seek a recovery. However, those patients who did not survive, and those patients who did not achieve a better result, <em>do </em>have a present injury, even though the plaintiffs in those cases cannot prove that the defendant\u2019s malpractice caused the death or the physical harm, and these plaintiffs can recover as long as they can prove that the defendant\u2019s malpractice caused the patients to lose an opportunity to survive or achieve a better result and that the \u201clost opportunity\u201d was greater than 50 percent.

These assertions are simply incompatible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b347-5\"> Although Justice Cavanagh states that he disagrees with my distinction between a \u201clost opportunity\u201d action and a traditional medical-malpractice action, at other points in his analysis he seems to agree with it. For instance, he states that a plaintiff would not be able to recover for the patient\u2019s death in a traditional medical-malpractice action if the patient only had a 40 percent premalpractice chance of survival, because the plaintiff \u201cwould not be able to prove that the physician\u2019s malpractice more probably than not... caused the patient\u2019s death\u201d since \u201c[t]here was a 60 percent chance that the patient would have died regardless of the malpractice, as a result of the preexisting condition. But the plaintiff might be able to show that the physician\u2019s malpractice more probably than not caused the patient to lose up to a 40 percent chance of avoiding death,\u201d i.e., recover for the \u201clost opportunity\u201d in a \u201clost opportunity\u201d action. <em>Ante </em>at 171-172. This is precisely the distinction that I make between \u201clost opportunity\u201d actions and traditional medical-malpractice actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Yet at other points Justice Cavanagh seems to misunderstand my distinction between \u201clost opportunity\u201d actions and traditional medical-malpractice actions. For instance, he states that my distinction must be wrong because we have long held that the medical malpractice does not have to be the sole cause of the injury in order for a medical-malpractice plaintiff to prevail. <em>Ante </em>at 176 n 6, 179-182. However, my distinction is not inconsistent with this holding. To the contrary, I agree with Justice Cavanagh that the medical malpractice does not have to be the sole cause of the injury. For example, if Bill broke Tom\u2019s leg and Dr. Jones committed medical malpractice in treating Tom\u2019s broken leg, resulting in permanent damage to Tom\u2019s leg, Tom may still be able to prevail in a traditional medical-malpractice action for the permanent damage to his leg. He would be able to prevail in such an action if proper treatment would not have resulted in permanent damage. However, if there was a chance that Tom\u2019s leg would have been permanently damaged even with proper treatment, then Tom would only be able to recover for his \u201clost opportunity\u201d of avoiding the permanent damage. Contrary to Justice Cavanagh\u2019s contentions, my analysis would not \u201cpreclude plaintiffs with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>preexisting conditions that might have contributed <em>slightly </em>to their injuries from bringing medical-malpractice claims\u201d; it would not \u201cpreclude medical-malpractice claims from arising in situations in which proper medical treatment does not <em>always </em>succeed\u201d; and it would not \u201cpreclud[e] a medical-malpractice claim unless administering proper treatment would never produce permanent damage.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 179, 182 n 9 (emphasis in original). Furthermore, I agree with Justice Cavanagh that the \u201cfact that a plaintiff has a preexisting condition does not, by itself, cause a claim to be a lost-opportunity claim rather than a [traditional] medical-malpractice claim.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 181. As explained above, even though Tom had a pre-existing condition, i.e., a broken leg, Tom would still have a traditional medical-malpractice action if proper treatment would not have resulted in permanent damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Finally, Justice Cavanagh concludes that the instant case is not a \u201clost opportunity\u201d cause of action. <em>Ante </em>at 178. However, this seems to be inconsistent with his <em>own </em>definition of a \u201clost opportunity\u201d cause of action. He defines a \u201clost opportunity\u201d action as one in which the \u201clost opportunity\u201d was not greater than 50 percent. <em>Ante </em>at 171-172 and n 2, 176-177. He calculates this \u201clost opportunity\u201d by subtracting the post-malpractice chance of obtaining a better result from the premalpractice chance. <em>Ante </em>at 171-172 and n 2, 176-177. In the instant case, the premalpractice chance was 99 percent and the postmalpractice chance was 95 percent. Therefore, pursuant to Justice Cavanagh\u2019s <em>own </em>formula, plaintiffs \u201clost opportunity\u201d was 4 percent. Given that plaintiffs \u201clost opportunity\u201d was less than 50 percent, I do not understand why he concludes that this is not a \u201clost opportunity\u201d cause of action. Further, I do not understand why he believes that this plaintiff should prevail, given his conclusion that MCL 600.2912a(2) simply codified <em>Falcon </em>and added the requirement that the premalpractice chance must be greater than 50 percent. As Justice Cavanagh explains, <em>Falcon </em>held that the \u201clost opportunity\u201d must be \u201csubstantial.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 168, quoting <em>Falcon, </em>436 Mich at 470 n 43 (Levin, J.). Does Justice Cavanagh believe that a 4 percent \u201clost opportunity\u201d is \u201csubstantial\u201d? Justice CAVANAGH, <em>ante </em>at 178 n 7, attempts to avoid this dilemma by making the same mistake as the Court of Appeals, i.e., considering <em>all </em>potential risks rather than only those risks associated with the injury actually suffered by plaintiff. See n 18 <em>supra. </em>For example, given that plaintiff did not die, it is inappropriate to take into consideration, as Justice CAVANAGH does, the fact that plaintiffs <em>risk </em>of death increased as a result of the medical malpractice. <em>Id. </em>Contrary to Justice Cavanagh\u2019s contention, not considering plaintiffs increased risk of death does not \u201cpenalizeG [plaintiff] for managing to survive,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 178 n 7; it simply does not calculate his entitlement to a recovery in malpractice on the basis of a death that he never suffered. I cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>comprehend why Justice CAVANAGH thinks that considering an increased <em>risk </em>of death is \u201crelevant to the jury\u2019s determination of whether malpractice [has] caused a plaintiff to suffer a <em>particular </em>harm,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 178 n 7 (emphasis added), when the \u201cparticular harm\u201d actually suffered was other than death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b349-5\"> Given that (a) Chief Justice Taylor\u2019s analysis would render the \u201clost opportunity\u201d provision null and void, (b) Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s analysis is inconsistent and incompatible with the language of the statute, and (c) the analysis in this opinion has no votes other than my own, I urge the Legislature to revisit MCL 600.2912a(2) at its earliest opportunity. If the Legislature wishes to maintain the \u201clost opportunity\u201d doctrine, it should enact a provision that indicates such an intention, and that sets forth in as clear a manner as possible the requirements a \u201clost opportunity\u201d plaintiff must satisfy.

It is ironic, as Chief Justice Taylor points out, <em>ante </em>at 164 n 14, that the majority holding in <em>Fulton </em>continues apparently to he the law of our state, despite the fact that not a single justice on this Court agrees with this holding and despite the fact that three justices (those supporting Justice Cavanagh\u2019s opinion), who support the <em>dissent </em>in <em>Fulton, </em>are effectively marshaled in support of this conclusion. Nonetheless, I think that Chief Justice Taylor\u2019s analysis in this regard is correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
