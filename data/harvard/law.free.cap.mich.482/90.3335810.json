This Court has not always been precise in articulating the proper standard for reviewing such interpretations. However, in accordance with longstanding Michigan precedent and basic separation of powers principles, we hold and reaffirm that an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is entitled to \u201crespectful consideration,\u201d but courts may not abdicate their judicial responsibility to interpret statutes by giving unfettered deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation. Courts must respect legislative decisions and interpret statutes according to their plain language. An agency\u2019s interpretation, to the extent it is persuasive, can aid in that endeavor.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">In this case, the Court of Appeals did not properly review the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute. Despite having understandable reservations about the agency\u2019s interpretation, the Court affirmed the agency\u2019s interpretation merely because it was \u201cplausible.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>However, the plain language of the statute does not support the agency\u2019s interpretation. Therefore, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision to uphold the agency\u2019s construction of the statute. Under the proper interpretation of the statute, SBC Michigan (SBC)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not violate the statute as the Public Service Commission (PSC) had erroneously concluded. However, we agree with and affirm the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that the PSC had no jurisdiction over wiring inside a customer\u2019s home. Thus, we remand this case to the PSC with the instruction that it must modify its August 1, 2005, order to eliminate any PSC regulation of \u201cinside wiring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Accordingly, the Court of Appeals judgment is reversed in part and affirmed in part and the case is remanded to the PSC for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">This case began in April 2001, when William J. and Sandra M. Rovas, SBC customers, called to report an interruption in their service. SBC sent a technician, who checked the wiring outside their home and erroneously determined that the problem was inside the customers\u2019 home. Because the technician believed that the problem was inside the home, he left a note informing the customers that they would be charged $71 for the service call. Eventually, SBC realized the error and reversed the charge, but not before sending the customers a bill for the $71.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Despite the fact that SBC reversed the erroneously sent bill, the customers filed a complaint with the PSC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>alleging, inter alia, a violation of \u00a7 2502(l)(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Michigan Telecommunications Act, MCL 484.2101 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The PSC agreed with the customers and found that SBC\u2019s statements to the customers that (1) the problem was inside their home and (2) they owed SBC $71 for the service call were both \u201cfalse,\u201d and therefore, constituted violations of \u00a7 2502(1)(a). For erroneously sending a retracted $71 bill, the PSC fined SBC $15,000 for violating \u00a7 2502(l)(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the PSC decision in an unpublished opinion per curiam, noting, however, that given the context of the term \u201cfalse\u201d in the statute, \u201cit is plausible this provision is not intended to proscribe a statement that is simply not true or correct, but is only intended to proscribe those statements tending to deceive or mislead.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals affirmed the PSC because the panel believed it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>\u201ccharged with giving great deference to the PSC\u2019s construction of a statute which the Legislature has required the PSC to enforce, and therefore the mere establishment of an alternative interpretation of a statute to that given by the PSC will not satisfy [SBC\u2019s] burden of proving the PSC\u2019s interpretation was unlawful or unreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the panel was concerned that a portion of the PSC order implementing its interpretation was \u201cambiguous\u201d and remanded for clarification. Specifically, the panel and SBC were concerned that the order required SBC to enter each consumer\u2019s home to verify that the problem originated inside the house. This Court denied SBC\u2019s interlocutory application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">On remand, the PSC clarified its order by noting that \u201cSBC need not enter a customer\u2019s premises <em>every </em>time that SBC is called upon to make a service trip\u201d;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> however, SBC may not charge for services \u201cif those services are reasonably necessary to diagnose problems attributable to its own facilities or exclude those facilities as a possible cause of service disruptions.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">In a published opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed in part and remanded to require the PSC to issue a modified order.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In doing so, the panel relied on federal law and held that \u201cinside wiring services\u201d (services for problems with the wiring inside the customer\u2019s home) were not subject to regulation by the PSC because such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>problems are not within the PSC\u2019s authority. Thus, the panel held that the PSC could not regulate \u201ccorrect determination^ by SBC excluding its facilities as the cause of service disruption\u201d because a correct determination that the problem originated inside the customer\u2019s home necessarily involves \u201cinside wiring.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Both the PSC and SBC have appealed to this Court, and this Court granted both applications.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">As a general proposition, this Court reviews de novo questions of law, such as the proper interpretation of a statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, the primary issue in this case is the proper standard of review of an administrative agency\u2019s construction of a statute. That standard of review is discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">This case implicates the powers, and the boundaries of the powers, of all three branches: the Legislature, the judiciary, and administrative agencies, which are part of the executive branch.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, separation of powers principles will aid in the analysis of the proper consideration due an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The people of the state of Michigan have divided the powers of their government \u201cinto three branches: legislative, executive and judicial.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u201c[n]o <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>person exercising the powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch except as expressly provided in this constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u201cThe legislative power of the State of Michigan is vested in a senate and a house of representatives.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Simply put, legislative power is the power to make laws.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In accordance with the constitution\u2019s separation of powers, this Court \u201ccannot revise, amend, deconstruct, or ignore [the Legislature\u2019s] product and still be true to our responsibilities that give our branch only the judicial power.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> While administrative agencies have what have been described as \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d powers, such as rulemaking authority, these agencies cannot exercise legislative power by creating law or changing the laws enacted by the Legislature.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Since the time of <em>Marbury v </em>Madison,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> interpreting the law has been one of the defining aspects of judicial power. \u201cAlthough we may not usurp the lawmaking function of the legislature, the proper construction of a statute is a judicial function, and we are required to discover the legislative intent.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Administrative agen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>cies exercise what have been described as \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d powers.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> However, such power is limited and is not an exercise of constitutional \u201cjudicial power.\u201d The primary \u201cjudicial\u201d function exercised by administrative agencies is confined to conducting contested cases, like the one at issue here. These administrative contested cases resemble trials. Constitutionally and statutorily, these administrative fact-finding exercises are entitled to a degree of deference defined by statute and our constitution.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> However, fact-finding in an administrative contested case, much like in a trial before a circuit court, is a far different endeavor than construing a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">I. REVIEW OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY\u2019S INTERPRETATION OF A STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">With these separation of powers principles in mind, we now turn to the proper standard, under Michigan law, for reviewing an agency\u2019s construction of a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">A. MICHIGAN JURISPRUDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Unlike the United States Constitution, the Michigan Constitution specifically recognizes administrative agencies. Furthermore, the constitution explicitly provides for judicial review of administrative decisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">All final decisions, findings, rulings and orders of any administrative officer or agency existing under the constitution or by law, which are judicial or quasi-judicial and affect private rights or licenses, shall be subject to direct review by the courts as provided by law. This review shall include, as a minimum, the determination whether such final decisions, findings, rulings and orders are authorized by law; and, in cases in which a hearing is required, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>whether the same are supported hy competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record. Findings of fact in workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud unless otherwise provided hy law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">In the absence of fraud, error of law or the adoption of wrong principles, no appeal may be taken to any court from any final agency provided for the administration of property tax laws from any decision relating to valuation or allocation.[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The constitutional provision provides for review to determine: (1) that the decision is authorized by law, and (2) if a hearing is required, that the decision is supported by record evidence.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> However, the provision does not stand for the proposition that agencies can assume this Court\u2019s constitutional role as the final arbiter of the meaning of a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Before evaluating the standard of review applicable to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute, it is helpful to delineate the agency functions not at issue in this case. This distinction is important because there are different standards of review for different agency functions. As noted earlier, agencies perform both \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>and \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d functions. First, there is the rule-making function. A reviewing court must determine whether the Legislature, in accordance with the separation of powers principles discussed, properly delegated authority to the agency to promulgate the rule at issue.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> That question concerns the constitutionality of the statute, a legal issue that this Court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> If the Legislature has properly delegated the rulemaking authority, then the only question before the court is whether the agency \u201chas exceeded its authority granted by the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The other agency function not at issue in this case is fact-finding in contested cases. The constitution requires that such agency findings be \u201csupported by competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Review of an administrative agency\u2019s fact-finding is akin to an appellate court\u2019s review of a trial court\u2019s findings of fact in that an agency\u2019s findings of fact are entitled to deference by a reviewing court. In its fact-finding capacity, the agency has reviewed evidence, such as witness testimony, and it is in the best position to evaluate the credibility and weight of that evidence. Similar to the clear error standard of review for circuit courts, under the constitutional and statutory standards of review, a reviewing court must ensure that the finding is supported by record evidence; however, the reviewing court does not conduct a new evidentiary hearing and reach its own factual conclusions, nor does the reviewing court subject the evidence to review de novo.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Keeping these other administrative functions distinct from review of an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute during a contested case is very important to ensure that the appellate court applies the proper standard of review. A review of our own cases suggests that when courts are unmindful of these differing functions, they also tend to muddle the distinct standards of review that apply to each. This Court has uniformly held that statutory interpretation is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Thus, concepts such as \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d or \u201cclear error,\u201d which are similar to the standards of review applicable to other agency functions, simply do not apply to a court\u2019s review of an agency\u2019s construction of a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals panel in this case did not apply a de novo standard of review when assessing the PSC\u2019s interpretation of MCL 484.2502(l)(a). While there are some opinions that seem to stand for the proposition that agency statutory interpretations are reviewed for \u201creasonableness\u201d or an \u201cabuse of discretion,\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> those standards do not apply to the interpretation of a statute, and they threaten the separation of powers principles discussed earlier by allowing the agency to usurp the judiciary\u2019s constitutional authority to construe the law and infringe on the Legislature\u2019s lawmaking authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">However, \u201c[w]e acknowledge that our past case law has not been entirely consistent regarding the subject of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>the amount of deference to be given when an administrative agency with expertise in its field construes a statute governing the area regulated by the agency.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> We believe that this is due in large part to the Court\u2019s failure consistently to use the same articulation of the proper standard of review for an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute and to carefully apply the correct standards of review for different types of agency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">This Court announced the proper standard of review for agency statutory construction more than 70 years ago in <em>Boyer-Campbell v Fry,</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which dealt with the proper construction of the General Sales Tax Act. The <em>Boyer-Campbell </em>Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">the construction given to a statute by those charged with the duty of executing it is always entitled to the most respectful consideration and ought not to be overruled without cogent reasons. However, these are not binding on the courts, and [w]hile not controlling, the practical construction given to doubtful or obscure laws in their administration by public officers and departments with a duty to perform under them is taken note of by the courts as an aiding element to be given weight in construing such laws and is sometimes deferred to when not in conflict with the indicated spirit and purpose of the legislature.[<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">This standard requires \u201crespectful consideration\u201d and \u201ccogent reasons\u201d for overruling an agency\u2019s interpretation. Furthermore, when the law is \u201cdoubtful or obscure,\u201d the agency\u2019s interpretation is an aid for discerning the Legislature\u2019s intent. However, the agency\u2019s interpretation is not binding on the courts, and it cannot conflict with the Legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the language of the statute at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>Boyer-Campbell </em>remains good law, and it has been used repeatedly by this Court.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> However, in some of our later cases, this Court and the Court of Appeals have employed recitations of standards that do not follow the language of <em>Boyer-Campbell </em>or apply to review of agency\u2019s statutory construction. While these recitations do not necessarily substantively conflict with <em>Boyer-Campbell, </em>they add to the confusion discussed earlier.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> For example, <em>inLudington Service Corp v Acting Comm\u2019r of Ins, </em>this Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision to overturn one portion of the agency\u2019s decision because the agency relied on an interpretation of a statute that conflicted with the statute\u2019s plain meaning.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> First, the Court reversed a number of the agency\u2019s factual determinations because they were not supported by \u201ccompetent, material, and substantial evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The Court then turned to the statutory interpretation question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>and used the following standard of review in reaching that conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-4\">Finally, while this Court affords deference to an agency\u2019s findings of fact, we can always review an agency\u2019s legal findings. Both the Michigan Constitution and the applicable statute permit this Court to set aside the commissioner\u2019s findings if they are in violation of the constitution or a statute, or affected by other substantial and material error of law.[<footnotemark>41</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">To that end, the Court held that \u201calthough this Court affords an agency some statutory deference, the agency\u2019s interpretation is not binding on this Court, and cannot be used to overcome the statute\u2019s plain meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> This standard does not directly conflict with <em>Boyer-Campbell </em>because the plain meaning of the statute still controlled the outcome; however, by referring to \u201cdeference\u201d with regard to both the agency\u2019s fact-finding and its statutory interpretation, the Court sowed the seeds of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Another example of a confusing articulation of the standard is illustrated in <em>Adrian School Dist v Michigan Pub School Employee Retirement </em>Sys,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> where this Court held that \u201c[t]he agency must interpret the statute it administers, and its interpretations are entitled to great weight.\u201d The case cited for this proposition, <em>Magreta v Ambassador Steel Co,</em><footnotemark><em>44</em></footnotemark><em> </em>did not actually use the words \u201cgreat weight,\u201d but, rather, quoted the general <em>Boyer-Campbell </em>standard discussed earlier. While the <em>Adrian School Dist </em>Court independently construed the statute, by employing a term such as \u201cgreat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>weight,\u201d this Court again allowed for the possibility that the judiciary must defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">A similar blurring of standards occurred in <em>Catalina Marketing Sales Corp v Dep\u2019t of </em>Treasury,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> in which this Court held that, while it \u201caffords deference to the construction of statutory provisions by any particular department of the government and used for a long period, the department\u2019s interpretation is not binding on this Court and cannot be used to overcome the statute\u2019s plain meaning. . . .\u201d <em>Catalina </em>adds the concept of deference to longstanding agency interpretations to the general deference referenced in Ludington:<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Like <em>Ludington, Catalina </em>recognizes the fundamental requirement that the statute\u2019s plain meaning controls.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Furthermore, the Court rejected the agency\u2019s interpretation because it conflicted with the plain meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Because this Court\u2019s decisions that used imprecise language still made clear that the plain language of the statute was the controlling legal consideration, the varying deference standards articulated in them seem to have had negligible outcome determinative effect. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>However, by employing words such as \u201cdeference,\u201d which can imply that the judiciary must accede to the agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute, this Court has unmistakably added to the confusion in this area of the law.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Given this Court\u2019s difficulty in hewing to the correct standard it set forth in <em>Boyer-Campbell, </em>the Court of Appeals has understandably relied on some of the confusing articulations of standards made by this Court and thereby used the erroneous \u201cdeference\u201d or \u201cgreat weight\u201d standard to allow agencies improperly to assume the courts\u2019 role as the final arbiter of a statute\u2019s meaning. For instance, the Court of Appeals panel in this case quoted <em>In re Michigan Cable Telecom Ass\u2019n </em>Complaint<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> for the proposition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">[a]s a general rule, we will <em>defer </em>to the construction placed on a statute by the governmental agency charged with interpreting it, unless the agency interpretation is <em>clearly erroneous. </em>An agency\u2019s initial interpretation of new legislation is not entitled to the same measure of <em>deference </em>as is a longstanding interpretation. However, merely establishing that smother interpretation of a statute is plausible does not satisfy a party\u2019s burden of proving by <em>clear and convincing </em>evidence that the PSC\u2019s interpretation is <em>unlawful </em>or unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">This hybrid \u201cstandard of review\u201d is a prime example of the mixing and matching of the standards of review applicable to the different functions of an agency. Relying on this muddled and unduly deferential \u201cstandard,\u201d the panel acceded to an agency interpretation that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>panel believed to be contrary to the plain meaning of the statute. When considering an agency\u2019s statutory construction, the primary question presented is whether the interpretation is consistent with or contrary to the plain language of the statute. While a court must consider an agency\u2019s interpretation, the court\u2019s ultimate concern is a proper construction of the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">By using a deferential standard inconsistent with <em>Boyer-Campbell, </em>the panel below abdicated its judicial authority to construe statutes. By acceding to the agency\u2019s interpretation, the panel gave greater consideration to the agency\u2019s interpretation than it would have given a circuit judge\u2019s construction. Given that statutory construction is the domain of the judiciary, it is hard to imagine why a different branch\u2019s interpretation would be entitled to more weight than a lower court\u2019s interpretation. As established in <em>Boyer-Campbell, </em>the agency\u2019s interpretation is entitled to respectful consideration and, if persuasive, should not be overruled without cogent reasons. Furthermore, the agency\u2019s interpretation can be particularly helpful for \u201cdoubtful or obscure\u201d provisions. But, in the end, the agency\u2019s interpretation cannot conflict with the plain meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u201cRespectful consideration\u201d is not equivalent to any normative understanding of \u201cdeference\u201d as the latter term is commonly used in appellate decisions. To avoid further confusion, courts should rely on the <em>Boyer-Campbell </em>articulation of the standard of review for an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute instead of more recent cases, which have erroneously introduced inappropriate concepts such as \u201cdeference.\u201d Furthermore, courts should carefully separate the different agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>functions under consideration and apply the proper standard of review for each.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">B. A NOTE ON THE FEDERAL CHEVRON<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> DEFERENCE DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Some have urged that this Court adopt the <em>Chevron </em>deference doctrine, which federal courts use to review agency interpretations.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The <em>Chevron </em>test requires the court to make two inquiries. First, the court must consider \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> This inquiry may be dis-positive because \u201c[i]f the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The separation of powers principles discussed above provide the basis for this inquiry and result because \u201c[t]he judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction and must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">However, \u201cif the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The <em>Chevron </em>test for the permissibility of the agency\u2019s construction differs slightly depending on whether Congress explicitly or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>implicitly delegated authority to the agency \u201cto fill any gap\u201d left by Congress. \u201cIf Congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> An explicit delegation largely refers to the authority bestowed by Congress upon agencies to promulgate rules to enforce a statute.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> On the other hand, an implicit delegation arises when the legislation does not address a specific factual situation or where the statute is ambiguous.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">If Congress has given the agency an explicit delegation, then the \u201cregulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> When the delegation is implicit, \u201ca court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>made by the administrator of an agency.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> To that end, the Supreme Court has \u201crecognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive department\u2019s construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer, and the principle of deference to administrative interpretations.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">While the <em>Chevron </em>inquiries are comparatively simple to describe, they have proven very difficult to apply.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> This Court has never adopted <em>Chevron </em>for review of state administrative agencies\u2019 statutory interpretations, and we decline to adopt it now.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The vagaries of <em>Chevron </em>jurisprudence do not provide a clear road map for courts in this state to apply when reviewing administrative decisions. Moreover, the unyielding deference to agency statutory construction required by <em>Chevron </em>conflicts with this state\u2019s administrative law jurisprudence and with the separation of powers principles discussed above by compelling delegation of the judiciary\u2019s constitutional authority to construe statutes to another branch of government. For these reasons, we decline to import the federal regime into Michigan\u2019s jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">II. PROPER INTERPRETATION OF MCL 484.2502(l)(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Having determined that agencies\u2019 constructions of statutes are entitled to respectful consideration, but are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>not binding on courts and cannot conflict with the plain language of the statute, we now turn to review \u00a7 2502(1)(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">(1) A provider of a telecommunication service shall not do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">(a) Make a statement or representation, including the omission of material information, regarding the rates, terms, or conditions of providing a telecommunication service that is false, misleading, or deceptive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The critical question here was the meaning of \u201cfalse\u201d and, thus, whether this statute penalized merely factually inaccurate statements, as the PSC concluded, or whether \u201cfalse\u201d includes a requirement that the inaccuracy be intentionally communicated. Importantly, the PSC did not actually provide an analysis for its \u201cconstruction\u201d of the statutory language. In its February 25, 2002, order, the PSC discussed the parties\u2019 arguments concerning this section. The hearing referee had found that the \u201cinaccuracies\u201d at issue stemmed from the difficulties inherent in diagnosing the problem experienced by the SBC customers. SBC argued that the \u201cmisdiagnosis\u201d in this case was not the type of activity proscribed by the statute and the hearing referee agreed. The customers and the PSC staff contrarily argued that any <em>untrue </em>statement was subject to the statutory sanctions. The PSC agreed with the customers and the PSC staff, rejecting the hearing referee\u2019s application of the statute. In reaching that conclusion, the PSC first discussed three facts: (1) when the customers reported the problem, SBC\u2019s automated system informed them that they would only be charged for problems with inside wiring; (2) the technician, without entering the customers\u2019 house, informed the customers that the problem was inside and that the customers owed $71; and (3) the customers received an invoice for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>$71 from SBC\u2019s automated billing process, even though SBC had determined that the problem was with the outside wiring. The PSC then concluded that, \u201c[b]ased on these facts, the company\u2019s statements to [the customers] on April 3 and 4, 2001 were false,\u201d and therefore, SBC violated \u00a7 2502(l)(a). However, the PSC did not conclude that the false statements were intended to deceive.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In reaching this conclusion, the PSC did not analyze the language of the statute, nor did it provide a rationale for its unexplained conclusion that the statutory term \u201cfalse\u201d meant \u201cuntrue\u201d or \u201cincorrect.\u201d The PSC\u2019s bald assertion that SBC violated the statute is not a \u201cconstruction\u201d of the statute. Therefore, under the <em>Boyer-Campbell </em>standard, there is little here for any reviewing court to \u201crespectfully consider.\u201d The PSC, having failed to offer a construction of its own that would warrant any consideration, requires that we provide, as the panel below should have provided, an interpretation of the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The Court of Appeals acknowledged that \u201cfalse\u201d has multiple meanings, and the panel listed the following definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">\u201c1. not true or correct; erroneous; wrong: <em>a false statement. </em>2. uttering or declaring what is untrue; lying: <em>a false witness. </em>3. not faithful or loyal; treacherous; hypocritical: <em>a false friend. </em>4. tending to deceive or mislead; deceptive: <em>a false impression .. . </em>.\u201d[<footnotemark>65</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">The panel indicated that it favored the \u201ctending to deceive or mislead\u201d fourth definition because of the statutory context. Furthermore, the panel stated that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>found insufficient evidence in the record to support an intent by SBC to mislead its customers. However, relying on an erroneous standard of review, the panel upheld the decision of the PSC because the agency\u2019s interpretation \u201cwas quite literal and certainly not unlawful or unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">By ignoring the statutory context, the PSC\u2019s implicit interpretation of \u201cfalse\u201d was erroneous. \u201cAs a general matter, words and clauses will not be divorced from those which precede and those which follow. When construing a series of terms ... we are guided by the principle that words grouped in a list should be given related meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> In other words, this Court applies the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>which \u201cstands for the principle that a word or phrase is given meaning by its context of setting.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The statute prohibits telecommunications providers from making \u201ca statement or representation . . . that is false, misleading, or deceptive.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> The context of the word \u201cfalse\u201d is the key to determining which of the multiple definitions of that term the Legislature intended, and the other related statutory terms\u2014 \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201cdeceptive\u201d \u2014 provide that context. \u201cMislead\u201d means \u201c1. to lead or guide in the wrong direction. 2. to lead into error of conduct, thought, or judgment; lead astray,\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> and \u201cdeceive\u201d means \u201cto mislead by a false appearance or statement; trick.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>both \u201cmislead\u201d and \u201cdeceive\u201d require the perpetrator intentionally to trick or lead astray his or her victim. These definitions provide insight into which \u201crelated meaning\u201d of \u201cfalse\u201d the Legislature intended. The definition of \u201cfalse\u201d that has a related meaning to the other descriptive statutory terms is the fourth definition cited by the Court of Appeals: \u201ctending to deceive or mislead; deceptive.\u201d Thus, a mere mistaken communication would be insufficient to make a \u201cfalse\u201d statement penalized under this statute. The fact that the SBC\u2019s technician\u2019s statement was simply \u201cuntrue\u201d or that a bill mistakenly sent in reliance on the technician\u2019s incorrect diagnosis constitute insufficient proof to establish falsity required by the statute.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Thus, we conclude that only statements that are <em>intentionally </em>false qualify as violations of the statute, and the Court of Appeals statutory construction determination and the PSC\u2019s conclusion that a statutory violation occurred must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">III. THE PROPRIETY OF THE COURT OF APPEALS REMAND ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">In its first opinion, the Court of Appeals held that the remedy provision of the PSC\u2019s February 25, 2002, order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>was ambiguous and remanded for clarification. The Court was unsure whether the PSC required SBC to enter each customer\u2019s home to verify that the problem stemmed from wiring inside the customer\u2019s home. On remand, the PSC ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\">The Commission should clarify the discussion section of its February 25, 2002 order to indicate that SBC need not enter a customer\u2019s premises <em>every </em>time that SBC is called upon to make a service trip, but that it may not impose charges to recover the cost of services it provides to inspect, diagnose, and repair malfunctions covered by its tariff obligation, including the cost of conducting routine physical checks of its own facilities, in response to complaints or inquiries, if those services are reasonably necessary to diagnose problems attributable to its own facilities or exclude those facilities as a possible cause of service disruptions.[<footnotemark>72</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In its second opinion, the Court of Appeals cited federal authority<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> for the proposition that states were generally precluded from regulating services provided by telephone companies for \u201cinside wiring.\u201d However, states are free to regulate the telephone companies\u2019 networks or \u201coutside wiring.\u201d On the basis of these principles, the panel took issue with the portion of the order directing \u201cSBC not to impose charges for services that \u2018exclude [SBC\u2019s] facilities as a possible cause of service disruptions.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The Court held that this sentence violated the federal regulations because \u201ca correct determination by SBC excluding its facilities as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>cause of service disruption inherently constitutes a correct determination that the disruption was caused by the customer\u2019s inside wiring.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> The panel remanded to the PSC to remove any regulation of \u201cinside wiring,\u201d including fees attributable to <em>correct </em>determinations that the problem originated with the customer\u2019s inside wiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The parties agree that SBC cannot charge for services performed for \u201coutside wires\u201d and that the PSC cannot regulate services on \u201cinside wiring.\u201d The issue is whether the PSC\u2019s August 1, 2005, order is a permissible regulation of \u201coutside wires\u201d or an impermissible regulation of \u201cinside wires.\u201d We agree with the Court of Appeals that, to the extent the order prohibits SBC from charging for services associated with a problem caused by inside wiring, it is improper. While SBC may have to inspect its outside wires to confirm that a problem is with the customer\u2019s inside wiring, the fact remains that if the problem is with the inside wiring, then SBC had to make a service call for an inside wiring problem. The PSC cannot regulate that service and must amend its order to eliminate that improper regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">With today\u2019s decision, we reaffirm the <em>Boyer-Campbell </em>standard of review, which provides a longstanding and clear standard for appellate courts to apply to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute. In accordance with separation of powers principles and this Court\u2019s older cases, we hold that agency interpretations are entitled to respectful consideration, but they are not binding on courts and cannot conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>with the plain meaning of the statute. While the agency\u2019s interpretation may be helpful in ascertaining the legislative intent, courts may not abdicate to administrative agencies the constitutional responsibility to construe statutes. Giving uncritical deference to an administrative agency would be such an improper abdication of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Applying the proper standard to the statute at issue in this case, the PSC\u2019s interpretation is erroneous, as was the panel\u2019s undue deference to that construction. The Court of Appeals alternative interpretation (which it did not adopt) represents the proper interpretation of this statute. Under the appropriate interpretation of the statute, merely incorrect statements made with no intent to deceive are not subject to sanctions. Additionally, the PSC must modify its order to incorporate a correct construction of the statute and eliminate any regulation of inside wiring.</p>\n<judges id=\"b250-6\">Taylor, C.J., and Corrigan and Markman, JJ, concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-9\"> We will use \u201cSBC\u201d to refer to SBC Michigan and its predecessor, Ameritech Michigan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\"> MCL 484.2502(1)(a).

However, I see a noticeable lowering of the standard in the majority\u2019s actual application of it in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The majority overturns the PSC\u2019s decision for no cogent reason. The agency\u2019s decision was not based on the erroneous statutory construction that the majority attributes to it. This case risks sending the unfortunate message that, from now on, reviewing courts need not afford agency decisions any careful consideration at all. I cannot join the majority in sending this message.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">I would uphold the PSC\u2019s decision because it correctly applied MCL 484.2502(l)(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to prohibit statements made with reckless disregard of their truth or falsity or with knowledge of their falsity. It comports with the meaning of the statute. Consequently, it is entitled to great weight, deference, or the most respectful consideration, regardless of the name this Court gives to the proper standard of review of an agency\u2019s statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The record supports the PSC\u2019s conclusion. Ameritech Michigan, the predecessor of SBC Michigan, charged a $71 service fee for an inside wiring problem without ascertaining that the customers\u2019 loss of service originated inside the home. It billed the fee even after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>learning that the loss of service was due to a problem in its own network. The PSC correctly concluded that the service fee was predicated on false statements. The agency\u2019s conclusions, supported as they are by facts and law, should not be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">I. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATIONS BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The majority borrows its conclusion that an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is entitled to \u201crespectful consideration\u201d from this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Boyer-Campbell Co v Fry.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It suggests that this standard of review cannot exist by any other name. It specifically rejects other decisions of the Court in which the standard of review was to \u201cdefer\u201d to agency interpretations, to accord them \u201cgreat weight,\u201d or to review their \u201creasonableness. \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Yet, the Court in <em>Boyer-Campbell </em>used these very terms interchangeably. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">Legislative resolutions are not law, although they <em>axe </em>entitled to <em>respectful </em>consideration,... and \u201cthe construction given to a statute by those charged with the duty of executing it is always entitled to <em>the most respectful consideration </em>and <em>ought not to be overruled without cogent </em>reasons.\u201d However, these are not binding on the courts, and \u201c|w]hile not controlling, the practical construction given to doubtful or obscure laws in their administration by public officers and departments with a duty to perform under them is taken note of by the courts as an aiding element to be given <em>weight </em>in construing such laws and is sometimes <em>deferred to when not in conflict with the indicated spirit and purpose of the </em>legislature.\u201d[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>The Court concluded in <em>Boyer-Campbell </em>that the interpretation of the general sales tax act made by the state board of administration was \u201creasonable and sensible.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><em>Boyer-Campbell </em>does not stand for the proposition that the standard of review of agency decisions should be known by one name only. Nor does the fact that, over the years, the Court has used various terms to denote the proper standard of review indicate that it has been inconsistently applied. As the majority acknowledges, regardless of the language used, \u201cthis Court\u2019s decisions ... made clear that the plain language of the statute was the controlling legal consideration.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The actual name given to the standard of review has \u201cnegligible outcome-determinative effect,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as long as the standard is properly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">There is nothing shocking about the Court deferring to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute that the agency administers and that falls within its particularized expertise. \u201cDeference\u201d is simply another name for respectful consideration.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under \u00e1 properly applied standard of review, an agency\u2019s statutory interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>is entitled to deference when it comports with the Legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the plain language of the statute. Of importance is not what the Court calls the standard of review, but how it applies it.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">II. THE PSC\u2019S CONSTRUCTION OF MCL 484.2502(1)(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The majority purports to review the PSC\u2019s construction of MCL 484.2502(l)(a) de novo. As it acknowledges, the PSC never specifically interpreted the meaning of the phrase \u201cfalse, misleading, or deceptive\u201d in its decision.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But it did apply the statute to the facts of the case, as it is entitled to do in the case of an unambiguous statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The meaning that the PSC accorded to the phrase \u201cfalse, misleading, or deceptive\u201d can be inferred indirectly from the legal conclusions it drew from the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Although the majority recites the PSC\u2019s legal conclusions, it does not review them independently. Rather, it relies on the review of them made by the first Court of Appeals panel, and, in so doing, it repeats that panel\u2019s mistakes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The majority reviews the decision of the first Court of Appeals panel de novo, but it does not directly review the decision of the PSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The first Court of Appeals panel concluded that the PSC understood \u201cfalse\u201d to mean \u201cnot true or correct\u201d and, consequently, deemed a \u201cfalse\u201d statement to mean a simple mistake.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In essence, the panel assumed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the PSC interpreted MCL 484.2502(l)(a) as imposing strict liability for any inaccurate statement, no matter how innocently made. The majority adopts this erroneous interpretation of the agency\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It concludes that the PSC\u2019s statutory interpretation is erroneous because, in the phrase \u201cfalse, misleading, or deceptive,\u201d which is its proper context, the word \u201cfalse\u201d does not mean \u201cuntrue.\u201d The majority concludes that it means <em>\u201cintentionally </em>false\u201d or \u201cintended to deceive.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It derives its interpretation of \u201cfalse\u201d from the dictionary definitions of the words \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201cdeceptive.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">But the majority\u2019s conclusion that the statute refers to untrue statements made with an intent to deceive falls short of the mark. This occurs because it collapses two distinct elements of \u201cdeceit\u201d into the phrase \u201cintent to deceive\u201d: (1) knowledge or reckless disregard of the falsity of a statement and (2) intent that the statement cause detrimental reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u201cDeceit,\u201d also known as \u201cfalse or fraudulent misrepresentation,\u201d is a legal term of art with a long history in the common law. Legal terms of art are generally accorded their established meaning in the law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In addition, statutes are construed so as not to abolish by implication \u201cwell-settled common-law principles.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cfraudulent misrepresentation\u201d as \u201c[a] false statement that is known to be false or is made recklessly \u2014 without knowing or caring whether it is true or false \u2014 and that is intended to induce a party to detrimentally rely on it.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In Michigan, fraudulent representation requires</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">\u201c(1) [t]hat defendant made a material representation; (2) that it was false; (3) that when he made it he knew that it was false, or made it recklessly, without any knowledge of its truth and as a positive assertion; (4) that he made it with the intention that it should be acted upon by plaintiff; (5) that plaintiff acted in reliance upon it; and (6) that he thereby suffered injury. \u201d[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">As these definitions make clear, the intent element of deceit consists of (1) knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of a statement, and (2) an intent that a person detrimentally rely on the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">The PSC\u2019s decision shows that the agency <em>did </em>apply the statute according to the established rules for false representation. The PSC applied the statute to the following facts: (1) the customers were told that the $71 service fee would be applied only if the problem was caused by inside wiring, (2) without so much as entering the home, the technician left a tag stating that the problem was with the inside wiring and the customers owed a $71 service fee, and (3) the customers subsequently received a $71 bill for the service call, even though, in the meantime, SBC had made several repairs to its own network that solved the customers\u2019 problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The PSC expressly stated that the $71 service fee did not result from a \u201csimple misdiagnosis.\u201d Rather, it concluded that SBC\u2019s \u201cpropensity for assuming that the problem is with the inside wiring whenever a service technician finds a dial tone at the network interface, and for assessing the $71 charge without first verifying that the problem actually arises from within the customer\u2019s premises can lead to repeated violations of the MTA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Because the PSC expressly declined to characterize the problem as a simple misdiagnosis, it is clear that it did not interpret the statute as imposing strict liability for simple mistakes. It deemed SBC\u2019s statements false because SBC initially imposed the $71 service fee without knowing that the problem the customers had complained of originated inside the customers\u2019 home. And it reimposed the fee after it ascertained that the problem was in its own network, not inside the home. These statements were made with at least a reckless disregard of their truth or falsity. They were made with an intent to cause the customers to pay the $71 service fee in reliance on SBC\u2019s representations that the problem originated inside the home. Thus, they were made with an intent to deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Had the PSC expressly interpreted the statute, or had it stated its conclusions differently, it might have avoided the confusion its decision has engendered. However, it cannot be seriously faulted for not specifically stating that it applied the statute according to the rules of deceit. Those rules are well established and clearly deducible from the agency\u2019s legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The agency concluded that SBC assumes that a problem arises inside a customer\u2019s home without sufficiently testing its own network and without verifying that the problem is inside the home. The underlying premise of this conclusion is that SBC charges the service fee regardless of its lack of knowledge of the true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>origin of the customer\u2019s loss of service. Such a charge is in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of its assumption that the problem is inside the home.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The Court misconstrues the agency\u2019s application of the statutory provision, and a misconstruction cannot constitute a \u201ccogent reason\u201d for overturning an agency\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">III. THE RECORD EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE PSC\u2019S DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">In light of the fact that the PSC applied the statute correctly, the question becomes whether its factual findings are \u201csupported by competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> If supported by such evidence, they are entitled to deference, as the majority concedes.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The first Court of Appeals panel disagreed with the PSC\u2019s factual findings. It believed that the service fee was based on a simple diagnostic error.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The panel was unclear what evidence supported the PSC\u2019s conclusion that the charging of a service fee by SBC presented a systemic problem.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> By contrast, the second Court of Appeals panel found substantial evidence supporting the PSC\u2019s conclusion.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Indeed, substantial evidence on the whole record does support the conclusion that SBC based its charge of the service fee on an assumption. It assumed that, if its employee detected a dial tone at the network interface, the customer\u2019s problem was located inside the house. This assumption was in conscious disregard of the fact, well known by SBC, that there was a frequent problem of an intermittent signal transmitted by SBC\u2019s own facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The complaining customer, William Rovas,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> an engineer, presented the following evidence: He thoroughly checked his telephone line at the interface of his phone line and the SBC network line. He found that the line went dead after 8 to 15'minutes and diagnosed the problem as an intermittent dial tone. Rovas attempted to apprise SBC of his diagnosis during his initial service telephone call, but the SBC voice-mail system reduced his message to a cryptic \u201cno dial tone.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Certain that the problem was in SBC\u2019s network, the technically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>sophisticated Rovas unplugged the telephone equipment inside his home to give the SBC technician a clear outside line.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The SBC technician who made the first service visit left a tag on the door of the Rovases\u2019 home. On the tag, he had marked a box that corresponded to the following preprinted text: \u201cThe outside lines were checked. The problem shows to the inside premises. A charge of $71 applies to today\u2019s visit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Rovas was understandably baffled. First, his own testing had shown that the SBC network was sending an intermittent signal. Second, the tag did not indicate how the technician could have concluded that the problem was inside without entering the premises. Third, the tag did not identify what problem inside the premises the technician had actually diagnosed and whether that problem was the same one of which Rovas had complained.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Rovas additionally complained that, although SBC eventually correctly diagnosed the problem as an intermittent dial tone and fixed its own network, the service fee still appeared on the monthly telephone bill. Rovas\u2019s evidence established that SBC charged the fee without ascertaining that the problem was inside the home, then billed Rovas for it, knowing that the problem was outside the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>SBC offered several witnesses. Notably not among them was the technician who had left the tag and charged the service fee. The PSC staff placed a continuing objection to the speculative testimony of Tom Dunning, the dispatch control manager. He testified that the technician must have followed SBC\u2019s procedures. He must have used an intelligent field device (IFD), Dunning stated, capable of checking both the inside and outside wiring at the network interface outside the Rovases\u2019 home. Dunning testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\">If the technician went and tested at the network interface, found the ... network was providing dial tone to the network interface, he would assume that the trouble, because he did have good dial tone, could have been in the customer\u2019s home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">He would look in with his IFD. He would test it both ways. If there was a shorted out [sic], he would have obviously known that, but by looking inside, and he did not see any equipment on the inside, so he would bill the customer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Dunning also testified that an intermittent dial tone was something the technicians dealt with on a daily basis. However, he did not identify any procedures that SBC followed to distinguish this common problem from a problem inside a home. Rather, according to his testimony, technicians were reprimanded only if they took no corrective action when they found no dial tone at the network interface.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The hearing referee and the first Court of Appeals panel agreed with SBC that the problem of an intermittent dial tone is difficult to diagnose or fix. They reasoned that the technician incorrectly diagnosed the problem because the telephone equipment inside the home had been unplugged. This view of the evidence is both incorrect and one-sided.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>First, the hearing referee and the Court of Appeals gave the SBC technician the benefit of the doubt, assuming that he tested the inside wires even though the service tag did not indicate it. Nor did the tag identify the problem that the technician diagnosed inside the home. I find it inappropriate to give SBC the benefit of the doubt under the circumstances. Because SBC asserted that the technician made an innocent mistake, it had the burden to prove that assertion. It also controlled its own witnesses. Yet, the technician was not called to testify about the basis for his diagnosis. Instead, SBC relied on Dunning\u2019s speculation that the disconnected equipment inside the home led to the service-fee charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Additionally, Dunning did not explain what justified the technician\u2019s assumption that the problem of which the customer had complained stemmed from the disconnected equipment inside the home. The lack of equipment inside may signal a number of things, including, in this case, that the customer intentionally disconnected his phone. Unlike a shorted wire, disconnected equipment does not necessarily qualify as a \u201cproblem\u201d with inside wiring. The assumption that disconnected equipment is a malfunction inside the home may lead to repeated charges of a service fee although the malfunction is in the outside network. Such charges are all the more inappropriate when, as in this case, the customer has attempted to help SBC isolate the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Lastly, both the hearing referee and the first Court of Appeals panel assumed that it was difficult to diagnose the Rovases\u2019 problem as an intermittent dial tone. SBC\u2019s witnesses testified that it was difficult to diagnose what causes an intermittent dial tone. Dunning explained that it may be caused by a weatherworn conductor somewhere on the outside line. Indeed, SBC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>never identified the precise cause of the problem in this case and ultimately connected the Rovases to a new telephone line.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">But the fact that the cause of an intermittent dial tone is difficult to identify does not mean that it is difficult to identify the problem as an intermittent signal from SBC\u2019s network. In fact, when Rovas first called SBC, he had already concluded that the SBC network was sending an intermittent signal to his home. He attempted to relate his conclusion to SBC. Rovas\u2019s frustration with SBC was in large part due to the company\u2019s apparent incompetence in light of his correct original diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">No witness testified that SBC\u2019s technicians were trained to check whether a customer\u2019s problem was due to an intermittent signal in SBC\u2019s network. On the contrary, SBC\u2019s procedures allowed technicians to assume that an outside line was functional as long as it sent a signal at the moment of testing. SBC\u2019s procedures were clearly inadequate, considering that an intermittent dial tone is an everyday concern that requires more than a momentary testing of the outside line.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">On the entire record before it, the agency was justified in its conclusion that SBC failed to establish that this was a case of a simple misdiagnosis. SBC\u2019s own procedures made it clear that its technicians were permitted to assume without further testing that an outside line was functional if it sent a signal when tested once. The technicians did not attempt to determine whether the customer\u2019s telephone equipment had been disconnected. The technicians charged a service fee after insufficient testing. The tag did not identify the problem that justified the fee, nor did it match the technician\u2019s diagnosis with the problem of which the consumer complained.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>If an intermittent dial tone occurs daily and SBC does not require its technicians to adequately test for it before charging a service fee, SBC recklessly ignores a known problem. Additionally, SBC neglects to take the improper service fee off the customer\u2019s telephone bill even after it knows that the complained-of problem is in its own network. The fee is refunded only if the customer complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">As the PSC concluded, these company practices can lead to repeated violations of the MTA. SBC charges a service fee on the pretext that a complained-of problem is inside the customer\u2019s home. In that way, it imposes part of the cost of repair on the customer in cases of an intermittent dial tone caused by problems in the outside lines. SBC does so in violation of its duty to repair its own network without direct charge to its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The PSC\u2019s decision is supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record. Despite the first panel\u2019s faulty reasoning, both it and the second Court of Appeals panel correctly affirmed the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">IV THE PSC\u2019S ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The PSC has now twice attempted to limit the circumstances under which SBC can charge its $71 service fee. The agency amended its original order to clarify that a technician is not always required to enter a customer\u2019s home in order to verify that the complained-of problem originates inside. The amended order prohibits, among other things, the imposition of a fee for services needed to \u201cexclude SBC\u2019s facilities as a possible cause of service disruptions.\u201d The second Court of Appeals panel took issue with this language and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>remanded the order to the PSC for additional modification to avoid the impression that the PSC impermissibly regulates inside wiring.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">I concur with the majority in affirming this part of the second Court of Appeals decision. I believe that the PSC\u2019s order needs to more accurately address the problem of SBC\u2019s knowing or reckless failure to test for an intermittent dial tone at the network interface.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">v CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The majority holds that a Michigan agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute that is within its area of expertise is not binding on the courts. Also, an agency interpretation cannot conflict with the plain meaning of the statute. There is nothing new or controversial about these holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The majority also holds that an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute entrusted to it is not entitled to \u201cgreat weight\u201d or \u201cdeference.\u201d It is instead entitled to \u201crespectful consideration.\u201d It is not clear what is distinct about this interpretative rule, and the majority neglects to explain the distinction. It neglects also to explain how to apply its \u201cnew\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Noteworthy is the fact that the majority also neglects to include in its rule certain crucial language from <em>Boyer-Campbell, </em>the opinion on which it relies. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>reciting the correct rule, <em>Boyd </em>mentions giving \u201cmost respectful consideration.\u201d But it does not stop there: it goes on to say that the construction accorded to a statute by an administrative agency charged with the duty of executing it \u201cought not to be overruled without cogent reasons.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Boyer-Campbell </em>then cites with approval another Michigan Supreme Court decision, <em>Owosso Bd of Ed v Goodrich.</em><footnotemark><em>33</em></footnotemark><em> Owosso </em>states that courts are to give <em>weight </em>to the practical construction accorded to statutes by agencies and that agencies\u2019 interpretations should sometimes be <em>deferred to.</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Hence, it is not clear what, if any, meaningful change the majority makes in the standard of review applicable to agencies\u2019 interpretations of statutes that they enforce. What is important here is the majority\u2019s erroneous application of the standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">I dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion because it overturns the PSC\u2019s decision on the ground that the PSC incorrectly construed the phrase \u201cfalse, misleading, or deceptive\u201d to impose strict liability for incorrect statements. The PSC did not impose strict liability. Rather, on the evidence before it, it correctly concluded that SBC assessed a service fee before it knew that the customers\u2019 problem was inside the home. It then billed the customers with knowledge that the problem was in the outside line. SBC\u2019s procedures indicated that the failure to test for an intermittent dial tone at the network interface was a systemic problem rather than a one-time mishap.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">I conclude that the first Court of Appeals panel reached the correct result even though the panel mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>interpreted the agency\u2019s decision and deferred to the agency for the wrong reasons. I would affirm the decision of the second Court of Appeals panel in its entirety. The panel correctly deferred to the PSC after concluding that the agency\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence on the record. I would uphold the PSC\u2019s decision and would remand the case to the agency for clarification of its order. The limitations it imposed on SBC\u2019s ability to charge the $71 service fee concern only SBC\u2019s premature imposition of the fee based on insufficient testing for a commonly occurring problem.</p>\n<judges id=\"b267-5\">Cavanagh and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-9\"> <em>Ante </em>at 108.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\"> The Michigan Telecommunications Act (MTA), MCL 484.2101 <em>et seq., </em>states at MCL 484.2502:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">(1) A provider of a telecommunication service shall not do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">(a) Make a statement or representation, including the omission of material information, regarding the rates, terms, or conditions of providing a telecommunication service that is false, misleading, or deceptive.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b252-10\"> <em>Boyer-Campbell Co v Fry, </em>271 Mich 282; 260 NW 165 (1935).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b252-11\"> <em>Ante at </em>103-107.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b252-12\"> <em>Boyer-Campbell, </em>271 Mich at 296-297 (emphasis added; citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\"> <em>Id. </em>at 300.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\"> <em>Ante </em>at 106.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\"> <em>Ante </em>at 106.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b253-9\"> <em>Random, House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001) defines \u201cdeference\u201d as \u201c1. respectful yielding to the opinion... of another.... 2. respectful or courteous regard.\u201d The majority suggests that \u201cyielding\u201d to an agency interpretation of a statute has led to \u201cnearly unfettered deference\u201d by lower courts. <em>Ante </em>at 104 n 38.
