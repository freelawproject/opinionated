G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152. From a decree ordering the payment of compensation to the employee the insurer appealed. The employee admittedly sustained a personal injury. The only question for determination is whether on subsidiary findings of the Industrial Accident Board warranted by the evidence the employee\u2019s injury arose \u201cout of and in the course of his employment\u201d as the board decided. \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">The board made these subsidiary findings of fact: The employee was employed as a painter by the Mount Hope Farm. The employer\u2019s premises consisted of about fourteen hundred acres of land with forty tenement buildings. The \u201cemployee\u2019s work took him to various parts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>farm, and it was part of the employment agreement that transportation was to be furnished by the employer from a point nearest to the employees\u2019 homes to the different places of employment. It was a condition of the employment that the employees were to use the transportation furnished by the employer and were barred from using their private cars.\u201d The house in which the employee worked on the date of the accident was about one and one half miles from his home. On the morning of February 9, 1935, the employee \u201cwas picked up ... in accordance with the daily routine, near his home and transported by truck, furnished by the employer, to a point near a driveway in front of ... a section of the Mount Hope Farm ... at which place the employee was assigned for work that day. Shortly before 4:30 p.m., in accordance with the usual practice, and ... in accordance with instructions given him, the employee . . . proceeded to this point on the driveway of land of the employer to await the coming of the truck which would take him to his home. He proceeded ... to a point about six feet from the travelled part of the highway\u201d on land of the employer in front of the house where he had been painting and while waiting there was struck by an automobile operated by another employee and injured. The board found that \u201cthe only occasion for this employee\u2019s presence at the aforementioned place and at this specific time was the fact of his employment,\u201d and that \u201cit was a necessary incident of his employment for this employee to be at this particular place at this time in order that he might board the truck which was expressly provided by the employer as a means of transportation, this being in conformity with his employer\u2019s instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The subsidiary findings were warranted by the evidence. The insurer objects to the finding last recited with special reference to the words \u201cparticular place.\u201d It is apparent, however, from the context, that these words are not to be construed' with mathematical exactness, but mean a place at or near the driveway where the employee could board the truck. With the words so construed the finding ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>jected to was warranted by the evidence. The employee on the findings was at such a place.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The subsidiary findings support the conclusion that the employee\u2019s injury arose \u201cout of and in the course of his employment.\u201d According to these findings his employment for the day had not come to an end when the accident occurred. Though the employee when injured was on his way home he was on his employer\u2019s premises where his employment carried him. See <em>Mannering\u2019s Case, </em>290 Mass. 517, 519, and cases cited. Under the agreement of employment transportation of the employee to and from his work by the employer was an incident of the employment. <em>Donovan\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 76. <em>Vogel\u2019s Case, </em>257 Mass. 3, 4-5. Compare <em>Lee\u2019s Case, </em>279 Mass. 357, 361. The employee while waiting on his employer\u2019s premises for such transportation had not gone outside the scope of the employment. Compare <em>Horton\u2019s Case, </em>275 Mass. 572, 573; <em>Eifler\u2019s Case, </em>276 Mass. 1, 2. The risk of injury while he was so waiting was a hazard to which his employment exposed him. This hazard included the risk of being struck by an automobile. <em>Bresnahan </em>v. <em>Barre, </em>286 Mass. 593. See also <em>Keaney\u2019s </em>Case, 232 Mass. 532. Though the risk of his being struck by an automobile turning off the travelled part of the way onto the employer\u2019s premises resembled the risk to which pedestrians travelling on public ways are exposed, it was not a risk common to such travellers but was a special risk of the employment. <em>Hornby\u2019s Case, </em>252 Mass. 209, and similar cases relied on by the insurer are not controlling. A causal relation between the employment and the employee\u2019s injury is shown. Since the injury did not arise out of a risk of the street discussion of the statute providing for compensation for an injury \u201carising out of an ordinary risk of the street\u201d is not required. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
