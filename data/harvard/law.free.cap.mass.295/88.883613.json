As she neared the curb at the northwest corner \"where it rounds from the north side of Cambridge Street into the west side of Foster Street she moved to her right to avoid a puddle of water which had formed in the gutter and there was other evidence from which the jury could find that after stepping up on the top of the curbing with one foot, her other foot struck against the edge of the raised portion of the granolithic sidewalk at the point where it was one and one half inches above the top of the curbing and she was thrown to the ground and suffered the injuries complained of.\u201d There was evidence that Cambridge Street was a busy street; that the plaintiff had passed over the intersection of these streets many times before she fell, and had seen puddles of water there on previous days, but had never before noticed the condition of the sidewalk. There was evidence from which the jury could have found that the sidewalk had been in the same condition as it was at the time of the accident for a period of five years previously thereto. At the close of the evidence the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>filed a \"motion for a directed verdict in its favor. This motion was allowed, and the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">The questions whether negligence of the plaintiff contributed to cause her injury and whether the sidewalk was defective within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 84, \u00a7 15, were for the jury to determine. The case is governed in principle by <em>George </em>v. <em>Haverhill, </em>110 Mass. 506; <em>Marvin </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>158 Mass. 464; <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>177 Mass. 82; <em>Guidi </em>v. <em>Great Barrington, </em>272 Mass. 577; <em>George </em>v. <em>Malden, </em>274 Mass. 606, and <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>287 Mass. 445. The facts in the following cases distinguish them from the present case: <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>6 Cush. 524; <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>174 Mass. 181; <em>Isaacson </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>195 Mass. 114; <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>256 Mass. 468; <em>Rowett </em>v. <em>North Adams, </em>288 Mass. 50, and cases cited at page 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">We are of opinion that the motion of the defendant for a directed verdict in its favor was improperly granted. A majority of the court are of opinion that the entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
