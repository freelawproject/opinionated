The case was referred under the usual rule to an auditor whose findings of fact were not to be final. The case was then submitted to a judge of the Superior Court, sitting without a jury, on the auditor\u2019s report' without other evidence. The finding was for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed from that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The case is not rightly here. This is not one of the cases which can be brought before this court by appeal. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 96. <em>Samuel </em>v. <em>Page-Storms Drop Forge Co. </em>243 Mass. 133, 134. <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Hathaway Baking Co. </em>284 Mass. 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">It may not be inappropriate to add that, even if the case were rightly here, no error of law appears in the finding of the trial .judge. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>204 Mass. 34, 41. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>247 Mass. 178, 180, 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
