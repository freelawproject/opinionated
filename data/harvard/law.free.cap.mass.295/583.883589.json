The testimony of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>fendant and the occupants of the automobile was that the defendant was driving four feet away from the snow bank (and the plaintiff, while testifying, indicated with his hands a space of about five to six feet as the distance the. automobile was from the bottom of the snow bank); that after sounding his horn the defendant continued on without changing his course or slackening his speed; that the plaintiff, after calling to the other children to \u201clook out for the automobile,\u201d tried to push his sled back from Market Street; that instead of moving back the sled went forward down the snow bank carrying the plaintiff with it, his head striking the right rear wheel of the automobile, which at that time had nearly passed the place where the plaintiff had been sitting; and that the only injuries the plaintiff received consisted of a depressed fracture of the skull, seven inches one way and four the other, \u201cwith some of the bone gone and one piece displaced which was subsequently found by the surgeon and replaced.\u201d The trial judge found that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care, and that \u201cthe defendant was negligent in driving so close to the snow pile when there were children upon it, and the whole width of the road was available for his passage, and in not reducing his speed as he approached the intersection where the coasting was going on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The defendant filed six requests. The judge refused to give the third and fourth on the ground that he found as facts that the plaintiff was not negligent, and that the defendant was negligent. The fifth was given because he found as a fact that there was no wilful or reckless conduct on the part of the defendant. He stated that he gave the first, second, and sixth requests  as correct statements of law, but found as a fact that the plaintiff was not coasting. He found for the plaintiff and assessed damages in the sum of $3,650. The case was reported to the Appellate Division, which ordered the report dismissed. From this order the defendant appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>If the plaintiff had been injured while coasting upon the street in violation of an ordinance he would not be entitled to recover for injuries caused by negligence of the defendant. <em>Query </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>273 Mass. 92, 95. The evidence warranted a finding that at the time he was injured he was not coasting, but that, after calling to the other children who were present to look out for the defendant\u2019s automobile, he made an effort to push his sled away from Market Street; and that instead of the sled moving back it went forward into the street carrying the plaintiff with it. There is little, if any, dispute about the facts. The evidence warranted a finding that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care, and, in the opinion of a majority of the court, that the defendant was negligent. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>273 Mass. 432, 436. <em>Hedman </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>278 Mass. 437, 438. <em>Stacy </em>v. <em>Dorchester Awning Co.
