Her testimony that she was struck by the truck of the defendant was corroborated by a witness who testified in her behalf. It was admitted at the trial that the truck was being operated by the defendant\u2019s chauffeur who was then and there engaged in the defendant\u2019s business; and there was evidence that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care and that the driver of the truck was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The defendant called a policeman and the chauffeur, each of whom testified that the plaintiff was not struck by the truck of the defendant. To rebut this testimony the plaintiff introduced the official report of the policeman made on the evening of the accident, which, in part, was as follows: \u201cDecember 23, 1919, at 4:15 p.m. The above date a Ford Car light delivery truck owned by C. F. Crocker of West Somerville and operated by Edward L. Murray of 16 Whitman Street, West Somerville, knocked a woman down at the junction of College Avenue and Davis Square. The railroad gates were just being lowered down at the time of the accident and the driver in order not to crash through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>gates turned sharply to the right and struck the woman who was walking on the sidewalk.\u201d To rebut the testimony of the chauffeur the plaintiff offered evidence that immediately after the accident the plaintiff said to the chauffeur, \u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d and he said, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d This evidence was excluded on the defendant\u2019s objection, and the exception saved to the ruling by the plaintiff is the only question presented for determination by the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The reply of the chauffeur to the question of the plaintiff, if made, could have been found in significance equivalent to, \u201cYes, I did strike you, but it was purely accidental.\u201d If the words of reply be capable of such, or of a similar, interpretation of the chauffeur\u2019s meaning, the plaintiff might fairly argue that they were inconsistent with his testimony, and had a legitimate tendency to impeach his testimony. The evidence was material, and the exclusion was a substantial error. <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>214 Mass. 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
