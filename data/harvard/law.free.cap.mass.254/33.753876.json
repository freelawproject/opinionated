The judge further found that no misrepresentations were made to him by the defendants or either of them, and that no undue influence was exerted by them, and that the plaintiff made the transfers voluntarily with full knowledge of what he was doing and with the intention of giving the property to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">A decree dismissing the bill was entered in accordance with the findings, and the only question presented by the plaintiff\u2019s appeal is, whether upon an examination of all the evidence the findings should be reversed because plainly wrong. <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Bird, </em>193 Mass. 200, 202. <em>Martell </em>v. <em>Dorey, </em>235 Mass. 35, 40. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Mosher, </em>243 Mass. 149, 152. <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>246 Mass. 139. The testimony, which was in large part oral, amply supports and justifies the findings made, and the decree dismissing the bill must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
