The question of law is, whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant the jury in finding that the second automobile was driven by an agent of the defendant acting within the scope of his authority. The chief of police of the town where the accident occurred testified that he had a talk with the defendant in the presence of his brother of the following tenor: \u201c I asked Louis Hamel if Herbert was working for him and he says, he was .... Working for him at the time of the accident. I says: \u2018 Do you know you had no right to hire him as he had only an operator\u2019s license? \u2019 He didn\u2019t make no reply to me. \u2018You are hiring him contrary to law.\u2019 . . . He made no reply to that. Well, he said he was working for him.\u201d This testimony, if believed, was sufficient to warrant an inference that the automobile at the time of the collision was being driven by his brother while employed by the defendant and acting within the scope of his authority. <em>Kenyon </em>v. <em>Vogel, </em>250 Mass. 341. <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Vozzela, </em>247 Mass. 552. The cases at bar are distinguishable from decisions like <em>Washburn </em>v. <em>R. F. Owens Co. 252 </em>Mass. 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The exceptions are sustained. Entries of verdicts for defendant under leave reserved are set aside. The original verdicts returned by the jury are to stand. Judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff in each case for the amount found by the original verdict of the jury. <em>Kaminski </em>v. <em>Fournier, </em>235 Mass. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
