This finding must stand provided there is evidence in its support. <em>Pass\u2019s </em>Case, 232 Mass. 515. <em>Chisholm\u2019s Case, </em>238 Mass. 412, 419. <em>Walker\u2019s Case, </em>243 Mass. 224, 225. The burden of proof rests upon the employee to establish his claim by a fair preponderance of evidence. <em>Sponatski\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 526. The testimony need not be narrated. It was sufficient, with the rational inferences susceptible of being drawn therefrom, to warrant a finding that a belt flew off a pulley and struck the employee with such force as to cause, either by the impact or his consequent fall, a fracture of his skull. Although there was no eye-witness of the accident, the conclusion of the board is justified. There were specific physical facts affording a definite conception of the way in which the injury to the employee occurred. The case at bar is distinguishable from <em>Sanderson\u2019s Case, </em>224 Mass. 558, <em>Dube\u2019s Case, </em>226 Mass. 591, <em>Foster\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. 386, 388, and similar authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
