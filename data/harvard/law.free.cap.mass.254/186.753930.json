The report states that the defendant was \"engaged in the taxi business.\u201d The evidence introduced by the plaintiff tended to show that one Dore and his wife \"were staying at the plaintiff\u2019s home\u201d; that Dore \"hired the defendant to take him and the plaintiff and her family to the depot\u201d; that while on this journey the defendant\u2019s automobile collided with another automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>through the defendant\u2019s negligence; and that after the accident the defendant refused \u201cto accept the pay for the use of the machine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The defendant testified that \u201cMr. Dore came to my house and he wanted to hire me to take two passengers down to the Fall River Station. I gave him a price of $3 on two passengers .... I drove up to the house and the whole crew of them got in, which was five or six. I was hired to take two passengers down to the station.\u201d The two he \u201cwas hired to take\u201d were \u201cMr. and Mrs. Derousseau . . . He didn\u2019t mention anybody else. He said he wanted to take two passengers to the station.\u201d To the question \u201cSo that the $3 you were getting was merely for the hire of Mr. and Mrs. Derousseau?\u201d he answered, \u201cFor the two passengers.\u201d He was then asked: \u201cTell us how this little girl [meaning the plaintiff] got in,\u201d he replied: \u201cShe walked out with the rest of them from the house and they all hopped in.\u201d He further testified \u201cThey were all friends of him; he knew all the people\u201d and \u201cI couldn\u2019t say 'you can\u2019t get on\u2019\u201d; that Dore \u201ca couple of days afterwards\u201d offered me \"the payment. I said, 'No, I didn\u2019t get you quite to the station and it will be all right. \u2019 \u201d He was then asked if he meant the payment of the $3, to which he answered \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">At the close of the testimony the defendant requested the trial judge to rule: (1) \u201cUpon all the evidence it is for you to say whether the plaintiff was a passenger for hire, or a gratuitous passenger or a guest\u201d; and (2) \u201cIf the plaintiff was a guest or a gratuitous passenger in the automobile of the defendant, the plaintiff cannot recover unless the defendant was guilty of gross negligence.\u201d These requests were refused. The judge charged the jury: \u201cAs a matter of law upon the evidence the plaintiff was a passenger for hire,\u201d to which ruling, and to refusals to rule, the defendant excepted. The case is in this court on a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The defendant in the words of the report \u201cwas engaged in the taxi business.\u201d We construe this to mean that he conducted the business of carrying passengers for hire. According to his own testimony the plaintiff entered his vehicle. It must be inferred, therefore, that he undertook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>to carry her as a passenger. If the defendant were a common carrier of passengers, on the defendant\u2019s own testimony the relation of passenger and carrier was established; she became a passenger for hire. <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>200 Mass. 537, 542. It was said in <em>Lauchtamacher </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>214 Mass. 103, at page 104: \u201cIf . . . the conductor had seen the plaintiff while coming to the car, or in his attempt to get on by taking hold of the car and placing his right foot on the running board, and either expressly or by implication had assented, there would have been evidence of a contract for transportation.\u201d See <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Railroad, </em>8 Allen, 227, 232, and <em>Geddes </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Railroad, </em>103 Mass. 391, 394, 395. In the case at bar the facts testified to by the defendant, and upon which he relies, show that he saw the plaintiff enter the taxicab and expressly or impliedly assented. We do not consider it necessary to decide whether the meagre facts disclosed on this record are sufficient to show that the defendant was a common carrier of passengers. See in this connection <em>Haddad </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>247 Mass. 369, 371, where it was said: \u201cAlthough he was in the business of letting automobiles for hire, it does not necessarily follow that he was a common carrier, either of passengers or goods.\u201d <em>Copeland </em>v. <em>Draper, </em>157 Mass. 558, 560. <em>Seaver </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>179 Mass. 329, 330. <em>Houle </em>v. <em>Lewonis, </em>245 Mass. 254. <em>Terminal Taxicab Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>241 U. S. 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Assuming, but without deciding, that the defendant was not a common carrier of passengers in a strictly technical sense, being engaged in \u201cthe taxi business,\u201d and waiting to receive passengers at the plaintiff\u2019s home and actually carrying them, he was in fact a carrier of passengers; he held himself out as such and was bound to use reasonable care according to the contract. As bearing on this question see <em>Hinds </em>v. <em>Steere, </em>209 Mass. 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">' The facts in the case at bar, which would show that the plaintiff was a passenger for hire if the defendant was a common carrier, were adequate to make out a contract for the conveyance of the plaintiff as a passenger for hire by the defendant even if he were not a common carrier. Taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>these facts as testified to by the defendant, and by which he is bound, in the fight most favorable to him, they show that he operated and owned a taxicab; that at the request of Dore, he went with his taxicab to the plaintiff\u2019s home, and was ready to receive passengers; that with his knowledge and consent, without objection, and with no suggestion that the plaintiff was to be carried as a free passenger, he received her as a passenger and was conveying her to her destination when she was injured. As matter of law, on these facts, a-contract, for the conveyance of the plaintiff, as a passenger for hire, was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\"><em>Massaletti </em>v. <em>Fitzroy, </em>228 Mass. 487, is not applicable. The plaintiff in that case was invited to ride gratis in the defendant\u2019s motor car. In the case of a common carrier, it has been held that he is required to exercise a degree of care consistent with the nature of the business in which he is engaged, even though there is no contract for hire or where the passenger is carried gratuitously. Under such conditions a duty rests.in the common carrier to convey the passenger safely. <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Old Colony &amp; Fall River Railroad, </em>3 Allen, 18, 20, 21. <em>Wilton </em>v. <em>Middlesex Railroad, </em>107 Mass. 108. <em>Beckwith </em>v. <em>Cheshire Railroad, </em>143 Mass. 68. <em>Littlejohn </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Railroad, </em>148 Mass. 478, 484. <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Great Western Railway, </em>L. R. 2 Q. B. 442. See <em>Black </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>193 Mass. 448, 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">It follows that there was no error in the instructions given or in the refusal to give the instructions asked for.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\n<em>Judgment to be entered on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
