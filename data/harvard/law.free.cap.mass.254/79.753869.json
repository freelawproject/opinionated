Tirrell was employed by the defendant, but at the time of the collision he was driving the automobile for his own purposes, and not in connection with the defendant\u2019s business. In the Superior Court a verdict was directed for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">The automobile was lent to Tirrell. He was using it on an errand of his own. This evidence was not contradicted. In these circumstances the defendant is not liable for the negligence of Tirrell. <em>Marsal </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>225 Mass. 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">There was evidence that the automobile was registered \u201cunder a number plate issued to the defendant Barr as a dealer of cars, . . . that the number plate of the car was 01407 D, and that this is a dealer\u2019s number \u201d; that <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>the automobile which figured in the accident had been used by\u2019 \u2019 Tirrell \u201cfor several months prior to the accident\u201d; that he \u201cused the car <em>\u2018 </em>only as a loan \u2019; . . . that he used the car to drive to Boston to buy supplies; . . . that the automobile in question was kept at all times in the defendant\u2019s garage\u201d; that the car was \u201cloaned\u201d to him (Tirrell) when he went to work for ' the defendant in January, 1918, and he used the car until he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>ceased to work for Barr in December, 1920. It also appeared that Tirrell had an operator\u2019s license but not a chauffeur\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The plaintiff contends that the defendant\u2019s motor car was registered under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 5. That section provides that all motor vehicles owned or controlled by a dealer shall be regarded as registered under the general number or mark issued to him by the registrar, \u201cuntil sold or let for hire or loaned for a period of more than five successive days.\u201d The contention of the plaintiff is that, the automobile in question having been registered under this section of the statute, it was \u201cloaned\u201d for more than five successive days and it therefore ceased to be a registered car; and when used by Tirrell on the public ways with the permission of the owner, it was a public nuisance. <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Northampton Street Railway, </em>202 Mass. 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Assuming that the automobile was registered under this section, and assuming, without deciding the point, that if said section was in fact violated the vehicle when used with the defendant\u2019s permission upon the public highways would be an outlaw, there is nothing to show that it was \u201cloaned\u201d for more than five successive days within the meaning of the statute. It \u201cwas kept at all times in the defendant\u2019s garage.\u201d It was used by Tirrell in the defendant\u2019s business and was \u201cloaned\u201d to him at different times during the term of his employment, but the evidence does not show that at any time it was out of the defendant\u2019s possession for five successive days or was \u201cloaned\u201d for that length of time. When the car was operated by Tirrell for his own pleasure he \u201cnever paid for it and the use of it was not included in his salary.\u201d The occasional \u201cloaning\u201d of a motor vehicle during a period of time of more than five days is not illegal; it is a \u201cloaning\u201d for a period of more than five successive days which is prohibited. The automobile was not lent to Tirrell in violation of the statute, when he operated it in the defendant\u2019s business as his agent. And even if the defendant was a dealer in the sense in which that word is used in the statute, the evidence does not show there was a \u201cloaning\u201d of the vehicle for more than five successive or consecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>tive days in violation of the statute. See <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>Woodis, </em>246 Mass. 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\">Tirrell had an operator\u2019s license. We do not understand that the plaintiff now contends that the fact that he did not have a chauffeur\u2019s license is material.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
