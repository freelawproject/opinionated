The plaintiff brought to the defendant\u2019s farm about seven hundred and fifty \u201cFibopak boxes\u201d which the defendant was to pack with apples. The price was fixed at $1 a bushel. When the plaintiff called about November 15 over four hundred and twenty-five of the boxes had been packed, but upon inspection the boxes were not full nor the apples properly packed. The plaintiff having observed these con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>ditions, a discussion followed, and the plaintiff told the defendant he would not accept the apples unless they were repacked properly. The defendant refused to repack, and after further discussion the parties agreed \u201cto call the deal off.\u201d The situation then was, that the defendant had the boxes filled more or less with his own apples which the defendant said he would remove although he had no other containers, and wooden boxes were hard to get at that season. The plaintiff thereupon said to the defendant that he must have the boxes within two weeks or they would be of no use to him, and if the defendant did not return them within two weeks he would have to pay twenty-two cents for each box, the cost price, and the defendant replied \u201call right.\u201d The plaintiff carried off the empty boxes leaving four hundred and sixty-seven boxes in the defendant\u2019s possession. The boxes have never been returned, and, upon being asked when he would pay, the defendant said he did not know, and later wrote to the plaintiff that, having consulted counsel, he did not intend to pay. If the plaintiff wanted the boxes he could come and get them.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The intention of the parties was a question of fact. Williston on Sales, (2d ed.) \u00a7 270, G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 27. And it could be found that by the words \u201c all right,\u201d the defendant assented to, and accepted the terms proposed by the plaintiff, and that the proposal and acceptance was not an agreement to make a contract, nor an offer to return which never became binding as the defendant contends, but a contract of sale upon condition, whereby the plaintiff agreed to pass title, and the defendant agreed to take title, and pay for the boxes at twenty-two cents each if he did not return them within two weeks. <em>Gutlon </em>v. <em>Marcus, </em>165 Mass. 335, 336. <em>Burgess Sulphite &amp; Fibre Co. </em>v. <em>Bromfield, </em>180 Mass. 283. <em>Brodky </em>v. <em>George H.

We find no prejudicial error in the admission of evidence. The finding for the plaintiff discloses no error of law, and the order of the Appellate Division dismissing the report is</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
