J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aol\">The sole issue in this appeal is whether contracts of insurance that the plaintiff, Spring-dale Donuts, Inc., purchased from the defendants, Aetna Casualty and Surety Company of Illinois, Farmington Casualty Company and Aetna Casualty and Surety Company,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> required the defendants to defend and to indemnify the plaintiff with respect to claims brought against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>it by two of its employees, Helen Ritch and her daughter, Tina Ritch (claimants). We conclude that they did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">The following facts and procedural history are undisputed. The plaintiff is the operator of a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts shop (shop) located on Hope Street in Stamford. During parts of 1992 and 1993, the plaintiff employed the claimants as cashier-clerks at the shop. In 1995, the claimants brought separate actions in federal court against the plaintiff, claiming that they had been the victims of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the claimants alleged that in the course of their employment at the shop, a fellow employee, Sherif Mohamed, had sexually assaulted them and had made frequent lewd and lascivious remarks, requests and gestures to them. Maintaining that they had suffered mental anxiety and distress, and humiliation as a result of Mohamed\u2019s conduct, the claimants sought to recover damages from the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>for negligent failure to remedy sexually harassing conduct in the workplace, for sexual discrimination in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (8), and for sexual harassment in violation of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1991, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Thereafter, the plaintiff sought coverage from the defendants for the claims that had been brought against it by the claimants. The plaintiff relied on the following contracts, or policies, of insurance: (1) a workers\u2019 compensation and employer\u2019s liability policy (workers\u2019 compensation policy) issued by Farmington Casualty Company; (2) a commercial general liability policy issued by Aetna Casualty and Surety Company of Illinois; and (3) a commercial excess liability (umbrella) policy issued by Aetna Casualty and Surety Company.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendants denied coverage under the policies, and refused to defend or indemnify the plaintiff with respect to the claimants\u2019 actions. The plaintiff subsequently reached settlement agreements with the claimants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defendants refused to reimburse the plaintiff for expenses related to those settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">In March, 1996, the plaintiff instituted the present action against the defendants, seeking damages under the theories of waiver, breach of contract and violation of the covenant of good faith. The trial court determined that the policies did not provide coverage for the underlying claims and concluded, therefore, that the defendants had no duty to defend or indemnify the plaintiff with respect to the underlying claims. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the defendants had no duty to defend it in the underlying actions brought by the claimants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiff argues that: (1) the workers\u2019 compensation policy provides coverage for the underlying actions, although the underlying complaints do not state claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits; (2) the allegations contained in the underlying complaints fall within the slander and invasion of privacy provisions of the commercial general liability policy; and (3) the personal injury and bodily injury provisions of the umbrella policy provide coverage for the underlying claims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Before reaching the merits of the dispute between the parties, we set forth the standard of review. \u201cIt is the function of the court to construe the provisions of the contract of insurance.\u201d <em>Gottesman </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>177 Conn. 631, 634, 418 A.2d 944 (1979). The \u201c[interpretation of an insurance policy, like the interpretation of other written contracts, involves a determination of the intent of the parties as expressed by the language of the policy.\u201d <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Bulaong, </em>218 Conn. 51, 58, 588 A.2d 138 (1991). \u201cThe determinative question is the intent of the parties, that is, what coverage the . . . [insured] expected to receive and what the [insurer] was to provide, as disclosed by the provisions of the policy. . . . It is axiomatic that a contract of insurance must be viewed in its entirety, and the intent of the parties for entering it derived from the four comers of the policy. . . . The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>policy words must be accorded their natural and ordinary meaning . . . [and] any ambiguity in the terms of an insurance policy must be construed in favor of the insured because the insurance company drafted the policy.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Imperial Casualty &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>246 Conn. 313, 324-25, 714 A.2d 1230 (1998). \u201cA necessary predicate to this rule of construction, however, is a determination that the terms of the insurance policy are indeed ambiguous. . . . The fact that the parties advocate different meanings of the [insurance policy] does not necessitate a conclusion that the language is ambiguous.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Figueiredo, </em>223 Conn. 31, 37, 610 A.2d 1296 (1992). \u201c[B]ecause the proper construction of a policy of insurance presents a question of law, the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the policy is subject to de novo review on appeal.\u201d <em>Peerless Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>241 Conn. 476, 483, 697 A.2d 680 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The plaintiff first contends that the trial court improperly concluded that, under its workers\u2019 compensation policy, the defendants had no duty to defend the plaintiff against the claimants\u2019 underlying claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiff contends that: (1) the coverage provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation policy are ambiguous and, therefore, must be construed against the defendants; and (2) so construed, the coverage provisions of the policy encompass not only claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, but also actions, such as the underlying claims, that are based upon allegations possibly capable of supporting claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>We note at the outset that it is well settled that \u201can insurer\u2019s duty to defend, being much broader in scope and application than its duty to indemnify, is determined by reference to the allegations contained in the [underlying] complaint. See, e.g., <em>Keithan </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co., </em>159 Conn. 128, 138, 267 A.2d 660 (1970). The obligation of the insurer to defend does not depend on whether the injured party will successfully maintain a cause of action against the insured but on whether he has, in his complaint, stated facts which bring the injury within the coverage. If the latter situation prevails, the policy requires the insurer to defend, irrespective of the insured\u2019s ultimate liability. ... It necessarily follows that the insurer\u2019s duty to defend is measured by the allegations of the complaint. . . . Hence, if the complaint sets forth a cause of action within the coverage of the policy, the insurer must defend. ... On the other hand, if the complaint alleges a liability which the policy does not cover, the insurer is not required to defend. <em>Smedley Co. </em>v. <em>Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co., </em>[143 Conn. 510, 517, 123 A.2d 755 (1956)].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Flint </em>v. <em>Universal Machine Co., </em>238 Conn. 637, 646-47, 679 A.2d 929 (1996). Thus, only if the underlying complaints set forth a cause of action within the coverage of the plaintiffs workers\u2019 compensation policy did the policy obligate the defendants to defend the plaintiff in those actions. We turn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>our attention, therefore, to the terms of the plaintiffs workers\u2019 compensation policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The plaintiff maintains that the language of the coverage provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation policy is ambiguous. Part 1 (C) of the plaintiffs policy provides that the insurer has \u201cthe right and duty to defend at [its] expense any claim, proceeding or suit against [the plaintiff] for benefits payable by this insurance. . . . [The insurer has] no duty to defend a claim, proceeding or suit that is not covered by this insurance.\u201d Part 1 (B), pertaining to benefits payable by the workers\u2019 compensation policy, provides that the insurer \u201cwill pay promptly when due the benefits required of [the plaintiff] by the workers compensation law. \u201d Thus, the policy unambiguously states that the defendants are obligated to defend any claim, proceeding or suit against the plaintiff for benefits payable by the workers\u2019 compensation policy. The benefits payable by the workers\u2019 compensation policy are limited to only those required of the plaintiff by workers\u2019 compensation law. Consequently, the defendants are obligated to defend any claim, proceeding or suit against the plaintiff for benefits payable by the plaintiff pursuant to the workers\u2019 compensation law. Thus, if the plaintiff is not required to pay benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation law, the coverage of the policy clearly is not invoked and, therefore, the defendants\u2019 duty to defend is not triggered. See <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>178 Conn. 664, 425 A.2d 131 (1979) (insurance contract covering workers\u2019 compensation liability does not cover claims for benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">In the plaintiffs view, the use in part 1 (C) of the word \u201csuit\u201d in the phrase \u201cdefend . . . any claim, proceeding or suit against [the plaintiff] for benefits payable by this insurance\u201d creates an ambiguity because, in order to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>employees bring \u201cclaims\u201d rather than \u201csuits\u201d against their employers. We previously have stated, however, that we \u201cwill not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity, and words do not become ambiguous simply because lawyers or laymen contend for different meanings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 696, 703, 569 A.2d 1131 (1990). Viewed in its entirety, the policy language unequivocally indicates that the policy was intended to provide coverage only for claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Because the underlying claims were filed in federal court, not with the workers\u2019 compensation commission, and did not state any claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the underlying claims are not within the purview of the plaintiffs workers\u2019 compensation policy. We conclude, therefore, that the defendants had no duty under the plaintiffs workers\u2019 compensation policy to defend the plaintiff against the underlying claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The plaintiff next argues that the trial court improperly concluded that the defendants had no duty pursuant to its commercial general liability policy to defend the plaintiff against the underlying claims. Specifically, the plaintiff maintains that the allegations set forth in the underlying complaints are covered by the policy because (1) the allegations constitute claims for slander, and (2) they also constitute claims for invasion of privacy. We disagree with both of those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The applicable provision of the plaintiffs commercial general liability policy, which is set forth at part (1) (a) of coverage B,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides that the insurer \u201cwill pay those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>sums that the [plaintiff] becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of [a] \u2018personal injury\u2019 . . . to which this insurance applies. [The insurer] will have the right and duty to defend any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking those damages. . . .\u201d Section V (10) of the policy provides in relevant part that \u201c \u2018[p]ersonal injury\u2019 means injury . . . arising out of . . . [o]ral . . . <em>publication </em>of material that slanders ... a person . . . [or] [o]ral . . . <em>publication </em>of material that violates a person\u2019s right of privacy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, in order for the allegations of the underlying complaints to fall within the policy coverage for personal injury claims, the complaints must allege personal injury arising out of the oral \u201cpublication\u201d of material that slandered the claimants or that violated their right of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The plaintiff maintains that the claimants\u2019 allegations that Mohamed made frequent lewd and lascivious remarks to them constitute allegations of oral publication of such material. The term \u201cpublication,\u201d however, generally refers to the communication of words to a third person. See <em>Torosyan </em>v. <em>Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>234 Conn. 1, 27-28, 662 A.2d 89 (1995); <em>Yavis v. Sullivan, </em>137 Conn. 253, 261-62, 76 A.2d 99 (1950). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201cpublication\u201d as the \u201ccommunication (as of news or information) <em>to the public.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Publication is defined in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) as the \u201ccommunicat[ion] [of] defamatory words orally ... to some <em>third person </em>capable of understanding their defamatory import . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Common sense dictates that a lay person would understand the term \u201cpublication\u201d to mean the communication of words to a third person. Because the underlying, complaints did not allege \u201cpublication\u201d of material to a third party, but instead were based entirely on comments directly made only to the claimants, we conclude that the complaints do not set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>forth allegations of a personal injury to which the plaintiffs commercial general liability policy applies. The policy, therefore, does not provide coverage for the underlying complaints, and, consequently, the defendants had no duty pursuant to the commercial general liability policy to defend the plaintiff in the underlying actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The plaintiffs final contention is that, even if the underlying claims are not within the purview of its workers\u2019 compensation and commercial general liability policies, the plaintiffs umbrella policy nevertheless obligated the defendants to defend the plaintiff against the underlying claims. The defendants argue, however, that policy exclusions contained in the umbrella policy explicitly preclude coverage for the underlying claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The applicable provisions of the umbrella policy provide coverage for personal injury and bodily injury. The policy defines \u201c[pjersonal injury,\u201d in relevant part, as an injury other than bodily injury arising out of \u201c [discrimination because of . . . sex . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cBodily injury\u201d is defined as \u201cbodily injury, shock, fright, mental injury, disability, mental anguish, humiliation, sickness or disease sustained by a person, including death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>resulting from any of these at any time.\u201d Exclusion 3 (h) of the umbrella policy provides, however, that the policy does not apply to \u201c \u2018[p]ersonal injury\u2019 consisting of discrimination directly or indirectly <em>related to the employment </em>or prospective employment of any person or persons by any insured.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The plaintiff contends that the personal injury provisions of the umbrella policy obligated the defendants to defend the plaintiff against the underlying claims because those claims alleged discrimination on the basis of sex. The defendants argue, to the contrary, that, because the underlying complaints were brought to remedy discrimination directly related to the claimants\u2019 employment, those claims specifically are excluded from umbrella policy coverage by exclusion 3 (h). The plaintiff concedes that the defendants\u2019 interpretation of the scope of exclusion 3 (h) is plausible, but argues that the exclusion applies only to discriminatory hiring practices. We recognize that if an exclusion clause is ambiguous, it must be construed against the drafter. <em>Imperial Casualty &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 325. \u201cThe fact that the parties advocate different meanings of [an] exclusion clause [however] does not necessitate a conclusion that the language is ambiguous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Figueiredo, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 37. In our view, the terms of exclusion 3 (h) are clear and unambiguous and, therefore, leave no room for construction. The exclusion explicitly precludes coverage for personal injuries that arise out of sex discrimination during employment, as well as personal injuries that arise out of sex discrimination during hiring.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>The underlying complaints alleged that the claimants were subjected to discrimination during their employment at the shop. Specifically, the complaints alleged that the \u201caction[s] [were] brought to remedy discrimination on the basis of sex in the terms, conditions and privileges of employment. . . .\u201d The claims, therefore, were within policy exclusion 3 (h). Consequently, the plaintiffs umbrella policy did not provide coverage for the claims made in the underlying complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">The plaintiff also maintains that the underlying claims are within the purview of the bodily injury provisions of the umbrella policy. \u201cBodily injury\u201d is defined in the umbrella policy as \u201cbodily injury, shock, fright, mental injury, disability, mental anguish, humiliation, sickness or disease sustained by a person, including death resulting from any of these at any time.\u201d Exclusion 3 (c) of the umbrella policy provides, however, that the policy does not apply to \u201c \u2018[b]odily injury\u2019 consisting of humiliation, mental injury or mental anguish directly or indirectly related to the employment of any person or persons by any insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The underlying complaints alleged injuries consisting of \u201cmental anxiety, distress of mind and humiliation.\u201d The plaintiff concedes that exclusion 3 (c) explicitly precludes coverage for the claims of humiliation, but argues that the exclusion does not preclude coverage for the claims of mental anxiety or distress of mind. The plaintiff acknowledges that an ordinary reading of the term \u201cmental injury\u201d in exclusion 3 (c) would include mental anxiety and distress of mind. The plaintiff argues, however, that the use of the words \u201cmental anguish\u201d in the policy directly after the term \u201cmental injury\u201d indicates an intention to limit the meaning of \u201cmental injury\u201d to \u201cmental anguish.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">In our view, however, the language of the policy exclusion unambiguously evidences an intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>exclude from policy coverage claims for humiliation, mental injury and mental anguish. If the term \u201cmental anguish\u201d had been intended to explain, rather than supplement, the term \u201cmental injury,\u201d the policy would have stated \u201chumiliation <em>or </em>mental injury, i.e., mental anguish.\u201d The claims stated in the underlying complaints for mental anxiety and distress of mind clearly are claims based upon \u201cmental injury.\u201d Consequently, those claims are within the penumbra of exclusion 3 (c). Therefore, the plaintiffs umbrella policy did not provide coverage for the underlying claims and, consequently, the defendants had no duty to defend the plaintiff under the umbrella policy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and MCDONALD, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-14\"> We refer herein to Aetna Casualty and Surety Company of Illinois, Farmington Casualty Company and Aetna Casualty and Surety Company collectively as the defendants.

Neither party argues that the plaintiff\u2019s insurance policies provide coverage for that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">Tina Ritch\u2019s complaint presented claims identical to those contained in Helen Ritch\u2019s complaint.

The plaintiff contends that, pursuant to <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Automobile Ins.

Id., 800-801. We stated that an insurer should raise issues of a policy\u2019s limitation of liability by special defense. Id., 806. The present case, however, does not involve issues of limitation of liability, but rather involves a claim of noncoverage of insurance \u2014 a matter of policy interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b833-7\"> The plaintiff makes a claim for coverage only under coverage B, \u201cPersonal Injury and Advertising Injury Liability,\u201d and not under coverage A, \u201cBodily Injury and Property Damage Liability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\"> Both parties agree that the trial court improperly determined that there was no coverage under the umbrella policy because there was no coverage under either the workers\u2019 compensation policy or the commercial general liability policy.

The plaintiff stated in its trial court brief: \u201cIt should be noted that the [claimants] claimed sexual assaults by a co-worker \u2014 not by [the plaintiff] or its officers or directors.\u201d Section II of the umbrella policy, entitled \u201cWHO IS AN INSURED,\u201d provides, however, that \u201c[njoperson is an insured as respects <em>\u2018bodily injury\u2019to afellow employee </em>unless insurance for such liability is afforded by the \u2018underlying insurance.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Because there is no claim that liability for the sexual assault by Mohamed against a fellow employee is afforded coverage by any underlying insurance, there is no coverage for this claim under the umbrella policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b838-7\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqVI\">dissenting. Although I disagree with much of the majority opinion, I will limit my discussion to the majority\u2019s rejection of the plaintiffs claim that one of the defendant insurers was obligated to defend under a policy covering personal injuries \u201carising out of . . . [ojral . . . publication of material that slanders ... a person . . . [or] [o]ra! . . . publication of material that violates a person\u2019s right of privacy.\u201d The majority claims that that defendant had no duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>defend because the underlying complaints brought against the plaintiff did not properly allege publication of the relevant statements. This is simply wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The majority acknowledges, as it must, that \u201c[t]he obligation of the insurer to defend does <em>not </em>depend on whether the injured party will successfully maintain a cause of action against the insured but on whether [s]he has, in [her] complaint, stated facts which bring the injury within the coverage.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Instead, it is the <em>possibility </em>of ultimate coverage that triggers the duty to defend. See <em>West Haven </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>894 F.2d 540, 544 (2d Cir. 1990) (\u201c[i]f an allegation of the complaint falls <em>even possibly </em>within the coverage, then the insurance company must defend the insured\u201d [emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>West Haven v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>639 F. Sup. 1012, 1017 (D. Conn. 1986) (same); <em>Schwartz v. Stevenson, </em>37 Conn. App. 581, 585, 657 A.2d 244 (1995) (same); see also <em>Lee v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>178 F.2d 750, 753 (2d Cir. 1949) (\u201c[w]hen ... the complaint comprehends an injury which <em>may </em>be within the policy, we hold that the promise to defend includes it\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Schurgast v. Schumann, </em>156 Conn. 471, 489, 242 A.2d 695 (1968) (\u201cwhether [insurer] had a duty to defend the . . . action . . . depends on whether the complaint in that action stated facts which <em>appear </em>to bring . . . claim of damage within the policy coverage\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Missionaries of the Co. of Mary, Inc. v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>155 Conn. 104, 110, 230 A.2d 21 (1967) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">It is therefore of no moment that neither of the underlying complaints brought against the plaintiff by two of its former employees expressly alleged the element of publication; a very high probability of publication is implicit in both pleadings. According to each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>underlying complaints, the \u201cobscene, lewd and lascivious remarks [and] requests\u201d were sufficiently \u201cfrequent\u201d and \u201crepeated\u201d that they \u201ccreatefd] a sexually harassing workplace.\u201d At a bare minimum, it is possible that at least some of these remarks and requests were made in the presence of third parties \u2014 either fellow employees or patrons of the shop where the statements were made. As Judge Learned Hand put it (in an opinion from which we have recently quoted with approval<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>), \u201cwe should resolve the doubt in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety </em>Co., supra, 178 F.2d 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">In my view, the majority\u2019s procrustean reading of the underlying complaints allows the defendant insurer to escape its contractual obligation to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-6\"><em> Flint </em>v. <em>Universal Machine Co., </em>238 Conn. 637, 647, 679 A.2d 929 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
