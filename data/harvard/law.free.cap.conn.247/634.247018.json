App. 916, 703 A.2d 1194 (1997); affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment, dated November 16,1996, finding the defendant in violation of probation and imposing the previously suspended three year sentence of incarceration. The defendant has, therefore, been incarcerated since that date. We have determined, for reasons that will appear in a full opinion to be released subsequently,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the dispositional phase of the probation revocation proceeding was flawed and that, therefore, that aspect of the judgment must be reversed and a new dispositional hearing held. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>243 Conn. 339, 703 A.2d 109 (1997). In order to give full effect to our determination, however, it is necessary that the defendant\u2019s incarceration be terminated immediately, pending the new dispositional hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction (1) to reverse the judgment of the trial court in part and (2) to remand the case to the trial court for a new dispositional hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-10\"> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mourning, </em>249 Conn. 242, 733 A.2d 181 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b659-11\"> We assume, also, that, if the defendant still wishes to have a psychological evaluation for purposes of the new hearing, he will be given an opportunity to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
