General Statutes \u00a7 14454a<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposes on the owner of a leased automobile liability for injuries to third parties caused by the tortious conduct of the automobile\u2019s lessee. The specific issue before us is whether that statute bars the enforcement of a clause in an automobile lease that requires the lessee to \u201cindemnify and hold harmless\u201d the owner that has fulfilled its statutory obligation to pay damages to injured third parties. We conclude that the statute does not invalidate the indemnity clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The named plaintiffs, Robert Smith and Michael Palmer, brought actions against the defendant Christopher J. Moore alleging that Moore\u2019s negligence and recklessness in driving his leased automobile had caused them to suffer personal injuries. Relying on \u00a7 14454a, they also sought damages from the named defendant, Mitsubishi Motors Credit of America, Inc. (Mitsubishi), as the owner of the automobile leased to Moore.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Palmer settled his claim against Mitsubishi for $287,500, and Smith, after a jury trial, obtained a judgment against Mitsubishi for $265,000. The merits of those underlying proceedings are not at issue in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">In response to the named plaintiffs\u2019 complaints, Mitsubishi filed answers and cross claims against Moore for indemnity. In its cross claims, Mitsubishi alleged that Moore was liable both because of an indemnity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>clause in the automobile lease and because of common-law principles of indemnity. Moore moved for summary judgment on both claims, and Mitsubishi moved for summary judgment on the claim regarding the indemnity clause in the lease. The trial court granted Moore\u2019s motions and denied Mitsubishi\u2019s motions and rendered judgments accordingly. Mitsubishi appealed from the judgments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Mitsubishi, the appellant, has raised three issues challenging the rulings of the trial court. It claims that the court improperly held that: (1) the contractual indemnity clause was unenforceable as inconsistent with the policy of \u00a7 14-154a; (2) the contractual indemnity clause was unenforceable on the ground of unconscionability; and (3) common-law indemnity has no applicability in this case. Because we agree with Mitsubishi\u2019s first two contentions, we need not decide its common-law claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">PUBLIC POLICY</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The automobile lease that Mitsubishi drafted and Moore signed was a two page document that contained numerous provisions for the protection of Mitsubishi.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 4 The clause that the trial court found to be unenforceable provides in relevant part: \u201c13. INDEMNITY, LIENS AND FINES. ... I agree to indemnify you (that is, I will pay you) and hold you harmless for losses, damages, claims, injuries and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) that result from this Lease, or from the manufacture, selection, delivery or possession of the Vehicle, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>which relate to the condition, maintenance, use or operation of the Vehicle. My agreement to indemnify you and hold you harmless will survive termination of this Lease and repossession of the Vehicle.\u201d The clause appears on the first page of the lease, where it is set off in a separate paragraph from clauses that, in similar type, disclaim warranties, impose liability for damage to the vehicle and specify default. Moore has not claimed ambiguity in the language of paragraph thirteen or any other clause in the lease. Compare <em>Burkle </em>v. <em>Car &amp; Truck Leasing Co., </em>1 Conn. App. 54, 57, 467 A.2d 1255 (1983) (evaluating clarity of indemnity clause where plaintiff had alleged ambiguity).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The trial court concluded that the indemnity clause violated the statutory policy of \u00a7 14-154a and thus was unenforceable on public policy grounds. In the court\u2019s view, such a clause was an impermissible attempt to override the obligations that the statute imposed on Mitsubishi. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">For more than 100 years, \u00a7 14-154a and its statutory antecedents have imposed on owners of leased vehicles obligations that significantly supplement common-law principles of vicarious liability. We have construed the statute as having created a \u201cstatutory suretyship,\u201d pursuant to which the owner of a leased automobile, driven by an authorized driver, is directly liable for injuries caused by the operation of the vehicle. See <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 280, 284, 287-88, 472 A.2d 306 (1984); <em>Levick </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>51 Conn. 461, 469 (1884).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The purpose of the statutory suretyship imposed by \u00a7 14-154a is to protect members of the public from injuries caused by the improper use of a leased automobile. Each of our decided cases concerning \u00a7 14-154a and its predecessors illustrates and enforces that statutory purpose, because each involved litigation between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>injured parties and the owner of the automobile. <em>Pedevillano </em>v. <em>Bryon, </em>231 Conn. 265, 268-69, 648 A.2d 873 (1994); <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>supra, 192 Conn. 282-83; <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>162 Conn. 363, 369, 294 A.2d 577 (1972); <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>145 Conn. 34, 37, 138 A.2d 705 (1958); <em>Farm Bureau Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kohn Bros. Tobacco Co., </em>141 Conn. 539, 542-43, 107 A.2d 406 (1954); <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Deconinck, </em>113 Conn. 237, 240, 155 A. 231 (1931); <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Daniels\u2019 U-Drive Auto Renting Co., </em>108 Conn. 333, 336, 143 A. 163 (1928); <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>107 Conn. 728, 731, 142 A. 403 (1928); <em>Levick </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>supra, 51 Conn. 468-69.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In the trial court, and in this appeal, Moore urges that \u00a7 14-154a serves a second purpose as well. That purpose, he argues, is to shield a negligent operator of a leased automobile from contractual liability to the automobile\u2019s owner. For three reasons, we are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">First, and most important, the text of the statute provides no support for Moore\u2019s position. It addresses liability \u201cfor any <em>damage </em>to any person or property <em>caused by the operation of such motor vehicle </em>while so rented or leased, <em>to the same extent as the operator would have been liable </em>if he had also been the owner.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 14-154a. Moore is not a person who has been \u201cdamaged\u201d by his own negligent operation of the leased automobile. The persons who have been \u201cdamaged\u201d are the named plaintiffs. Without exception, all our cases have construed the statutory language of \u201cdamage\u201d as referring to the claims of the parties injured by the tortious operation of the automobile. In <em>Farm Bureau Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kohn Bros. Tobacco Co., </em>supra, 141 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>543-44, we held, furthermore, that an owner of an automobile who must pay damages under the statute may recover from a driver who negligently caused the injury. Moore has cited no appellate case to the contrary, and we have found none. In our view, it would turn the statute on its head to construe the intended protection of injured members of the public to include protection of the tortfeasor who himself caused the injuries to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Second, Moore\u2019s position would make Mitsubishi an insurer of Moore\u2019s tort liability. Moore does not, and cannot, point to any clause in the automobile lease that would bear such a construction. The unambiguous indemnity clause expressly states the opposite, making Moore liable to Mitsubishi for payments made by Mitsubishi as a result of Moore\u2019s tortious conduct. Moore has articulated no reason why, as a matter of public policy, a tortfeasor should not be held accountable for the damages that he himself has caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Third, Mitsubishi\u2019s duty as a statutory surety does not conflict, in any way, with its right to enforce the indemnity clause in its automobile lease. It has long been the law that, after payment, a surety is entitled to reimbursement from an underlying obligor who has notice of the suretyship. \u201cFrom time immemorial courts of equity have recognized the surety\u2019s right to reimbursement upon payment of his principal\u2019s debt. . . . For a long time ... it has been generally recognized that the surety, upon payment, may recover of his principal in an action at law for money paid to the principal\u2019s use. . . . [C]ourts of law today treat the right of reimbursement as founded upon a contract implied in fact . . . .\u201d L. Simpson, Handbook on the Law of Suretyship (1950) \u00a7 48, pp. 225-26. For an updated statement of the same principle, see Restatement (Third), Suretyship and Guaranty \u00a7 22, pp. 93-94 (1996); see generally <em>John-sons. Mortenson, </em>110 Conn. 221, 229, 147 A. 705 (1929). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Moore has cited no contrary precedent in Connecticut law, and we have been unable to find any. The indemnity clause in the lease in this case, therefore, makes express what the common law has held to be implicit in the concept of suretyship.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">For these reasons, we conclude, contrary to the trial court, that \u00a7 14-154a does not preclude, as a matter of public policy, the enforcement of an indemnity clause in an automobile lease in cases in which the lessee, as tortfeasor, has caused injuries for which the owner has paid damages. An automobile owner\u2019s statutory liability to injured third persons does not shield such a lessee from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">UN CON SCIONABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The contractual indemnity clause was contained in an automobile lease that was a form contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moore claims, and the trial court held, that the clause was unenforceable because it was unconscionable. The classic definition of an unconscionable contract is one \u201cwhich no man in his senses, not under delusion, would make, on the one hand, and which no fair and honest man would accept, on the other.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Lacob, </em>31 Ill. App. 3d 137, 142, 334 N.E.2d 435 (1975), quoting <em>Hume </em>v. <em>United States, </em>132 U.S. 406, 410, 10 S. Ct. 134, 33 L. Ed. 393 (1889). In practice, we have come to divide this definition into two aspects of unconscionability, one procedural and the other substantive, the first intended to prevent unfair surprise and the other intended to prevent oppression. See <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>Montes, </em>223 Conn. 80, 88-89, 612 A.2d 1130 (1992). We are not persuaded that Moore presented sufficient evidence on either aspect to sustain the trial court\u2019s judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Procedural Unconscionability</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The trial court held no evidentiary hearing on the issue of procedural unconscionability. It made no express findings of fact relating thereto. We may infer that it relied exclusively on the affidavit filed by Moore with respect to Mitsubishi\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its cross claim, and on the copy of the lease that was attached as an exhibit. Mitsubishi filed no counteraffidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">It is an understatement to characterize Moore\u2019s affidavit as sparse.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The only paragraph of relevance to his claim is paragraph three. That paragraph provides only: \u201cNo one called my attention to section 13 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Agreement, entitled, \u2018Indemnity, Liens and Fines.\u2019 My attention was mainly directed to the provisions concerning insurance, mileage, payment and signatures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">As Mitsubishi aptly observes, that statement is notable for what it does not assert. Moore does not state that he: (1) was a consumer leasing the automobile for consumer purposes;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (2) had no opportunity to read the two page automobile lease as a whole; (3) had difficulty, because of the size of the type and the location of the indemnity clause in the lease, in reading the text of the clauses in the lease that had not specifically been called to his attention; (4) had failed to understand the indemnity clause because of its use of obscure legalese; (5) had been unable to read or understand the indemnity clause in the lease because he was illiterate or blind or otherwise disabled from having access thereto; (6) had no opportunity to bargain over the clauses in the lease because Mitsubishi\u2019s competitors used similar form contracts; or (7) had no prior experience with standard terms in automobile leases.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">To establish a basis for its finding of procedural unconscionability, the trial court, therefore, must have concluded, without <em>any </em>evidence of overreaching, that Mitsubishi\u2019s use of a form contract imposed on it a sua sponte duty to direct the attention of any potential individual lessee to important clauses contained in the automobile lease. To state so unconditional a proposition is to refute it. We have never held that principles of unconscionability supersede, in toto, the duty of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>contracting party to read the terms of an agreement or else be deemed to have notice of the terms. See, e.g., <em>G &amp; R Tire Distributors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>177 Conn. 58, 61-62, 411 A.2d 31 (1979); <em>Ursini </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>118 Conn. 554, 562, 173 A. 789 (1934); see also <em>Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shute, </em>499 U.S. 585, 593-95, 111 S. Ct. 1522, 113 L. Ed. 2d 622 (1991); <em>Northwestern National Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>916 F.2d 372, 377-78 (7th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The closest we have come to addressing this issue directly is in <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 88-91. In that case, having identified the purpose of the unconscionability doctrine as the prevention of unfair surprise; id., 88; we concluded that procedural unconscionability had not been established. Id., 91. Among the factors that we considered significant was the fact that the defendants who sought to invoke the doctrine had been advised by the plaintiff, ab initio, about the contents of the disputed clause in the mortgage that the defendants had signed. Id., 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Our decision in <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc., </em>afforded us no opportunity to consider whether, in the absence of such advice, enforcement of the mortgage would have been procedurally unconscionable. In light of the principles expressed throughout our case law, we hold today that procedural unconscionability cannot be predicated solely on the failure by a commercial party proffering a form contract to an individual party to direct the individual\u2019s attention to specific terms of a contractual agreement. See generally 1 E. Farnsworth, Contracts (2d Ed. 1998) \u00a7\u00a7 4.26 and 4.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court improperly determined that Moore had proved procedural unconscionability in Mitsubishi\u2019s dealings with him. Neither the lease itself, nor Moore\u2019s affidavit incorporat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ing the lease factually supported the trial court\u2019s ruling in favor of Moore. The court therefore had no basis for its expansive statement that the indemnity clause in this case was unconscionable because the underlying transaction involved \u201ca corporate entity and an individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Substantive Unconscionability</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Even in the absence of procedural unconscionability, Moore might avoid liability under the indemnity clause in the lease if he could establish that the clause was substantively unconscionable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The opinion of the trial court might be construed to have come to such a conclusion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 11 If it did so, we disagree with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The principal reason why Moore\u2019s claim of substantive unconscionability cannot be sustained is that it is no more than a reformulation of his public policy argument about the relationship between the indemnity clause and \u00a7 14-154a. That argument we have already rejected in part I of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">In addition, however, Moore argues that the indemnity clause is unfair and oppressive because other terms in the lease agreement provided Mitsubishi with sufficient protection against damages claims. He points especially to the automobile insurance clause, paragraph twenty-one, which required him to obtain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>maintain, among other things, liability coverage of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per incident.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In his view, read in the context of the lease as a whole, the indemnity clause was unreasonably favorable to Mitsubishi.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">We find Moore\u2019s position untenable. First, the trial court never ruled expressly on that argument, and Moore\u2019s brief does not indicate in what manner, if any, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>it was presented to that court. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Second, the argument depends on an interpretation of the interconnection among various provisions in the lease that is difficult to square with Moore\u2019s failure ever to allege that the indemnity clause was ambiguous. Finally, the argument presumes that a contract clause is oppressive if it allocates to a tortfeasor all of the uninsured costs attributable to the tortfeasor\u2019s misconduct. We know of no authority for this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">In conclusion, on the record before it, the trial court improperly granted Moore\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Mitsubishi\u2019s motion for summary judgment. As a matter of law, an indemnity clause in an automobile lease does not violate public policy in general or \u00a7 14-154a in particular. As a matter of fact, the indemnity clause in this lease was enforceable because it was neither procedurally nor substantively unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The judgments in favor of Moore are reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgments for the named defendant on its cross claims against Moore.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-154a provides: \u201cAny person renting or leasing to another any motor vehicle owned by him shall be liable for any damage to any person or property caused by the operation of such motor vehicle while so rented or leased, to the same extent as the operator would have been liable if he had also been the owner.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\"> Moore was the operator of a leased motor vehicle, and Mitsubishi was the vehicle\u2019s owner under the definitions of \u201coperator\u201d and \u201cowner\u201d provided by General Statutes \u00a7 14-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b369-9\"> Although Mitsubishi properly filed its appeal in the Appellate Court, we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b369-10\"> For example, in paragraph twenty-four, the lease limited the mileage that was allowable for the lease term; in paragraph seven, it required the lessee to pay for vehicle maintenance; and, in paragraph twenty-one, it specified the amount of motor vehicle liability insurance that the lessee was required to carry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\"> The named plaintiffs in this case relied on \u00a7 14-154a as the basis for their claim for recovery of damages from Mitsubishi.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\"> Although Moore characterizes the form contract as a contract of adhesion, the record contains nothing to substantiate that characterization.

I appoint you to be my agent and attomey-in-fact to collect any money paid under the insurance, to endorse checks or drafts related to payment, and to settle or release any insurance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">\u201cThe insurance coverage must be written by a company that is reasonably satisfactory to you. Coverage must begin before the Vehicle is delivered to me, and it must continue until after I return the Vehicle to you. Both before the Vehicle is delivered to me and at any later time, I must give you whatever written proof that you request that I have obtained the insurance required under this Lease. I must cooperate with you and the insurer in the event of any loss or damage to the Vehicle. I must report any accident to you within 48 hours and provide you with the time, place and circumstances of the accident, as well as any information concerning injuries to any person or other property. If I am sued or threatened with suit, I must immediately send you the documents I receive (or the operator of the Vehicle receives) concerning that claim.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b379-10\"> Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court may reverse or modify the decision of the trial court if it determines that the factual findings are clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record, or that the decision is otherwise erroneous in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">\u201cThe court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. The court may in the interests of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
