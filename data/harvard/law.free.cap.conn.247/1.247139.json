We reverse the judgment of the trial court insofar as it enjoins the commissioner\u2019s nonlawyer representatives from preparing, signing and filing termination petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">The relevant facts and procedural history are undisputed. On February 20,1997, a social worker employed by and acting on behalf of the department of children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>and families (department) filed a petition, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 17a-112,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to terminate the parental rights of the respondents, Beatrice C. and Darrel S., with respect to their minor child, Darlene C.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 2 Although the social worker had signed the termination petition, her signature was not verified.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Following a trial on the merits, the trial court, in a memorandum of decision dated January 2, 1998, determined that Darrel S. had completely abandoned the child and that Beatrice C. had no ongoing relationship with her, both proper statutory grounds for the termination of parental rights. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court, however, dismissed the petition without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>prejudice to its refiling<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5on the basis of two purported defects: (1) the petition had not been executed by the social worker under oath as required by Practice Book \u00a7 1023.1 (l),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> now Practice Book \u00a7 26-1 (Z); and (2) the petition had been drafted, signed and filed by a person who was not an attorney.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With respect to the latter ground for dismissal, the court determined that the conduct constituted the unauthorized practice of law. Consequently, the court, without first affording the commissioner an opportunity to be heard, invoked its authority under General Statutes \u00a7 51-88 (c),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>tice Book \u00a7 29,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> now Practice Book \u00a7 2-44, and, sua sponte, ordered the commissioner to \u201ccease and desist from the further unauthorized practice of law; to wit, filing petitions for the termination of parental rights in the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters, drafted, signed and filed by persons not admitted to the practice of law . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">In support of its decision to enjoin the drafting, signing and filing of termination petitions by nonlawyers, the court remarked, first, on the serious nature of the rights implicated in the context of termination petitions, and the history of problems that the court had observed as a result of faulty pleadings prepared by department personnel not admitted to the practice of law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>court observed that improper pleadings occur \u201cwith great frequency in juvenile court proceedings throughout the state [and] have led to public harm in that [1] they have delayed the proceedings; [2] they have put the respondents, and the State, to unnecessary expense for lawyers, publication expenses and related costs of service; [3] they have wasted available court time and staff resources; [4] [t]he time invested by [social workers] in preparing inadequate legal cases is time that could far better be spent improving their performance of the social service vocation for which they are trained . . . and ... [5] they have needlessly extended the already unacceptable time frame for permanent placement and adoption of children.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 11 (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The court next examined the nature of the individual tasks relating to termination petitions that are performed by nonlawyers and concluded that such activities constituted the practice of law by persons who are not attorneys in violation of \u00a7 51-88.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Acknowledging that \u201c[attempts to define the practice of law have not been particularly successful,\u201d the court nonetheless observed that \u201cdetermining the legal theory of a case, drafting the papers necessary to commence a legal action, checking the various possible legal grounds, signing the pleadings and submitting them to the court [are] acts that are commonly understood to [constitute] the practice of law.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The court noted that the statutory provisions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>authorize the commissioner <em>to file </em>termination petitions in court do not expressly authorize nonlawyers also to perform the legal work preparatory to such filings. The court further noted that General Statutes \u00a7 17a-47,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which discusses the prosecution of <em>neglect </em>petitions by attorneys employed by the office of the attorney general, indicates that attorneys are required to perform all the legal work associated with such petitions, and, by implication, termination petitions as well. The court concluded, moreover, that any effort by the legislature to authorize the preparation and filing of pleadings by nonlawyers on behalf of the commissioner would intrude impermissibly into the judicial sphere, thereby violating principles of separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The commissioner appealed to the Appellate Court from that portion of the judgment of the trial court ordering her to cease and desist from the unauthorized practice of law,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, now Practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Book \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). On appeal, the commissioner contends that the injunction was improper because: (1) the commissioner and her designees are expressly authorized under \u00a7 17a-112,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 26-1 <em>(l),</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>formerly Practice Book \u00a7 1023.1 (l), to execute termination and neglect petitions;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and (2) the drafting, signing and filing of such petitions do not constitute the practice of law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The commissioner also claims that the issuance of the injunction, without prior notice and an opportunity to be heard, violated her right to fundamental fairness. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>We conclude that, because the drafting, signing and filing of termination petitions by nonlawyer representatives of the commissioner are expressly permitted both by statute and Practice Book section,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> such activities do not constitute the unauthorized practice of law.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We therefore reverse the portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment enjoining these practices.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">We conclude, first, that the trial court improperly determined that \u00a7 17a-112 does not authorize the enjoined activities.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Under our statutory scheme, the department is charged with the responsibility of creating and administering a statewide program of services for children and youth who are \u201cabused, neglected, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>uncared for.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-3.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Consistent with this responsibility, the legislature has expressly authorized the commissioner to file termination and neglect petitions under \u00a7 17a-112,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> respectively. Our statutes, moreover, confer upon <em>designees </em>of the commissioner, as well, \u201call . . . powers and duties\u201d necessary to carry out the department\u2019s responsibilities. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-6 (n).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">There is nothing in the unambiguous language of either \u00a7 17a-112 (a) or \u00a7 46b-129 (a) to suggest that, although the commissioner or her designee may file petitions thereunder, only attorneys are authorized to draft and sign such petitions. \u201cIn interpreting the language of a statute, the words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning and their natural and usual sense unless the context indicates that a different meaning was intended.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mattatuck Museum-Mattatuck Historical Society </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>238 Conn. 273, 278,679 A.2d 347 (1996). If the legislature intended to limit the role of nonlawyers in connection with the drafting of termination and neglect petitions, it easily could have expressed this intent. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Desimone, </em>241 Conn. 439, 455, 696 A.2d 1235 (1997). That the legislature did not intend such a result is further supported by the fact that both \u00a7\u00a7 17a-112 and 46b-129 expressly distinguish between petitions that are to be filed by attorneys, on the one hand, and petitions that may be filed by the commissioner or nonlawyers, on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">We also disagree with the trial court that \u00a7 17a-47<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> precludes nonlawyers from preparing neglect petitions \u2014 and, by implication, termination petitions \u2014 on behalf of the commissioner. Section 17a-47 provides that assistant attorneys general who are assigned to the department shall \u201cdiligently prosecute petitions of neglect,\u201d and, further, that the department \u201cshall cooperate with such attorneys in preparation of their cases and shall render such assistance to them as shall be necessary to protect the best interest of the child named in the petition.\u201d It appears that the trial court construed the term \u201cprosecute\u201d broadly to encompass not only the activities that follow the filing of a petition, but also the work done in preparation of such filing. In common parlance, however, the term \u201cprosecute\u201d means \u201cto follow to the end: press to execution or completion: pursue until finished . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the procedures currently employed by the department and the assistant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>attorneys general who are assigned to work with department personnel are fully consistent with this meaning of the term. See footnote 13 of this opinion. Moreover, we refuse to read into the statutory requirement that department employees shall \u201ccooperate with . . . attorneys in [the] preparation of their cases\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 17a-47; a proviso prohibiting the commissioner or her designees from preparing and filing either neglect or termination petitions.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Such a proviso is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>neither implicit in the statutory language of \u00a7 17a-47 nor is its inclusion warranted for any other reason. We therefore agree with the commissioner that the legislature has expressly authorized the commissioner or her designees to prepare, sign and file petitions for the termination of parental rights.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">Furthermore, as we previously have indicated, Practice Book \u00a7 26-1 <em>(l)</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>permits any person authorized by statute to execute termination and neglect petitions. Because we have concluded that the statutory scheme authorizes the commissioner and those acting on her behalf to prepare, sign and file termination petitions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the commissioner and her designees likewise are authorized to engage in such activities under Practice Book \u00a7 26-1 <em>(1). </em>We note, moreover, that the judicial branch has manifested its assent to the statutorily authorized activities by approving forms to be used for filing neglect and termination petitions that, although providing for the verification of signatures, contain no signature line for an attorney. Judicial Branch form JD-JM-40, Rev. 4-91 (termination petition); Judicial Branch form JD-JM-38, Rev. 11-88 (neglect petition).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Therefore, even if it is assumed, arguendo, that the activities enjoined by the trial court constitute the practice of law, such activities do not violate Practice Book \u00a7 29 because they are not \u201cunauthorized\u201d within the meaning of that Practice Book section. Similarly, because the legislature also has expressly authorized the activities enjoined by the trial court, they do not violate the general proscription of \u00a7 51-88 against the practice of law by nonlawyers. It hardly would comport with logic to conclude that activities for which the legislature has made express statutory provision nevertheless violate a more general provision. \u201cIt is a well-settled principle of [statutory] construction that specific terms covering the given subject matter will prevail over general language of the same or another statute which might otherwise prove controlling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>239 Conn. 638, 653, 687 A.2d 134 (1997). Thus, in light of the fact that both the legislative and judicial branches of our government have expressly authorized the activities enjoined by the trial court, they do not, ipso facto, violate either \u00a7 51-88 or Practice Book \u00a7 29. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court improperly rendered judgment enjoining the commissioner or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>her designees from drafting, signing and filing termination petitions in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The portion of the judgment enjoining the commissioner from filing petitions for the termination of parental rights that have been prepared, signed and filed by persons not admitted to the practice of law is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and KATZ, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 17a-112 provides in relevant part: \u201cTermination of parental rights of child committed to commissioner, (a) In respect to any child in the custody of the Commissioner of Children and Families in accordance with section 46b-129, either the commissioner, or the attorney who represented such child in a pending or prior proceeding, or an attorney appointed by the Superior Court on its own motion, or an attorney retained by such child after attaining the age of fourteen, may petition the court for the termination of parental rights with reference to such child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">The legislature recently amended \u00a7 17a-112. See Public Acts 1998, No. 98-241, \u00a7 8. The 1998 amendments to \u00a7 17a-112 are not relevant to this appeal.

In her brief, the commissioner acknowledges that, \u201c[although assistant attorneys general often review termination petitions before they are filed, some are not reviewed. Due to time constraints and pressing case loads, assistant attorneys general often are unable to review carefully termination petitions prior to their filing. Neglect petitions and motions for [orders of temporary custody] are rarely reviewed by an assistant attorney general prior to filing.

In support of her contention, the commissioner underscores the fact that the trial court, in its memorandum of decision, characterized the question that it was deciding in broad terms, namely, \u201cwhether social workers should be permitted to continue to file <em>petitions </em>in the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Moreover, the court, in its discussion of the history of the preparation of petitions and pleadings by department personnel not admitted to the practice of law, purported to identify problems with respect to the filing of neglect petitions by such persons. See footnote 10 of this opinion. Furthermore, the court relied on \u00a7 17a-47; see footnote 14 of this opinion; which covers only neglect petitions, in support of its conclusion that the legislature has limited those who may \u201cdo the legal work\u201d associated with termination petitions to attorneys. For the reasons set forth by the commissioner, we agree with her claim regarding the applicability of the trial court\u2019s opinion to neglect petitions. For the same reasons, our determination regarding the authority of the commissioner\u2019s nonlawyer designees to prepare and file termination petitions is equally applicable to neglect petitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b32-9\"> Neither the respondents nor the attorney for Darlene C. filed a brief in support of the trial court\u2019s judgment with respect to the injunction.

January 7, 1991)].\u201d <em>Juan F. </em>involved a class action that sought to address systemic deficiencies within the department of children and youth services, now the department of children of families. A comprehensive consent decree was approved in January, 1991, detailing procedures that the department was required to implement. <em>Juan F. by and through Lynch v. Weicker, </em>37 F.3d 874, 876 (2d Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1142, 115 S. Ct. 2579, 132 L. Ed. 2d 829 (1995). Although the trial court in the present case did not assert that the practices it enjoined violated the terms of the federal consent decree, the amici curiae contend that they did. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">In order to implement the consent decree, the department was required to develop a manual for each section of the consent decree. Id. The manuals were adopted as court orders and incorporated in the consent decree in September, 1992. Id. One of the manuals provides in relevant part: \u201cAt least one . . . [assistant attorney general] shall be available to perform all mandated functions in a timely manner for the Regional Offices [of the department] five . . . days each week. The [assistant attorney general\u2019s] activity shall include but not be limited to the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">\u201ca.

And, although counsel for the amici curiae in the present case also is counsel to the plaintiff class in <em>Juan F., </em>that counsel has identified no such case. Moreover, inasmuch as the federal district court has retained continuing jurisdiction over the consent decree, it is by no means clear that a state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>court would have jurisdiction to adjudicate such a claim. These considerations aside, we also are not persuaded that a requirement that assistant attorneys general provide <em>assistance </em>in the preparation of court documents, or that they review such documents before they are submitted to a court, reasonably may be read as a requirement that the attorneys, themselves, must prepare, sign and file such documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b37-6\"> We also note that the trial court, quoting from <em>In re Cassandra B., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Middlesex, Juvenile Matters, Child Protection Session at Middletown, Docket No. T11-CP96-000141 (November 4, 1997), another termination of parental rights case over which it had presided; see footnote 10 of this opinion; observed that, \u201cprior to 1993, [the department] had, by statute, lawyers assigned to it. . . . It is understandable how [the department] could, at that time, file its own petitions. But, in 1993, by virtue of [Public Acts 1993, No.] 93-21C, the [department\u2019s] lawyers were transferred to the office of the Attorney General, thus placing the Commissioner in the same position as all other department heads, i.e., that of relying on the Attorney General to perform her legal functions.\u201d We do not agree that P.A. 93-216 sheds any light on the question of whether our statutes authorize nonlawyers to file neglect and termination petitions on behalf of tire department.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Public Act 93-216, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Technical and Minor Changes to DCYS Statutes,\u201d merely transferred, for administrative purposes, attorneys from the department to the office of the attorney general, primarily for the purpose of complying with the provisions of the consent decree. See 36 S. Proc., Pl. 10, 1993 Sess., p. 3424. The technical nature of the legislation belies any claim that it was intended to make any substantive change in the law. Accordingly, we reject the conclusion of the trial court that P.A. 93-216 has any bearing on the question of whether nonlawyer representatives of the commissioner may execute neglect and termination petitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b37-8\"> See footnotes 5 and 17 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b38-7\"> In other circumstances, the judiciary, by contrast, has developed forms that specifically require execution by an attorney.

See Special Acts 1998, No. 98-6. Although it is anticipated that the attorneys will assist in the review of neglect and termination petitions, the appropriation was not, in any respect, conditioned on the performance of such tasks.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b39-8\">BORDEN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AkU\">concurring. I fully agree with and join the majority opinion. I write separately only to address briefly the underlying question of whether the preparation and filing of petitions by social workers employed by and acting on behalf of the department of children and families (department) constitutes the practice of law. In my Anew, it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">In deciding whether certain conduct constitutes the practice of law, \u201cthe decisive question is whether the acts performed [are] such as are commonly understood to be the practice of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>239 Conn. 251, 254, 683 A.2d 1359 (1996). As judges, we are entrusted with the obligation of articulating that common understanding on a case-by-case basis. Because the language of the definition offers little guidance as applied to any particular set of facts, we are required to give content to the definition in each case based on our knowledge of the history, tradition and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>experience of the practice of law \u2014 and what has commonly been considered not to be the practice of law\u2014 in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Of course, lawyers routinely prepare and file petitions in court \u2014 in both routine and, as in this type of case, very significant matters. That does not mean, however, that whenever someone files such a petition on someone else\u2019s behalf<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 whether routine or significant \u2014 that conduct invariably constitutes the practice of law. A distinction may be drawn between actions taken on behalf and at the behest of a public agency in furtherance of its statutory mandate, as in the present case, and comparable conduct undertaken by a private individual acting in a representative capacity. This distinction embodies a policy determination that is grounded in the principle of necessity: public agencies, and the individuals who serve as their chiefs, are compelled by statute to carry out certain tasks and fulfill certain statutory responsibilities that often have significant legal consequences, and that often involve interaction with the judicial system; in order to satisfy these statutory mandates, they must, of necessity, act through human agents, and those agents, of necessity, cannot all be attorneys. For me, this distinction and its underlying policy considerations, require the conclusion that the preparation and filing of a petition in the juvenile division of the Superior Court by a department social worker does not constitute the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">First, as the commissioner of the department informs us, \u201c[b]etween September 1, 1994, [and] August 31, 1995, the commissioner or her designees executed and filed 5337 petitions for neglect, revocation or extension of commitments, and for termination of parental rights . . . .Although assistant attorneys general often review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>termination petitions before they are filed, some are not reviewed. Due to time constraints and pressing case loads, assistant attorneys general often are unable to review carefully termination petitions prior to their filing. Neglect petitions and motions for [orders of temporary custody] are rarely reviewed by an assistant attorney general prior to filing. However, subsequent to their filing, assistant attorneys general file appearances in the cases and, if necessary, file amended petitions. In this case, in fact, an assistant attorney general did precisely that.\u201d This history is persuasive evidence that the preparation and filing of such petitions without the intervention of an assistant attorney general has not been commonly understood to constitute the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Second, our history, tradition and experience indicate that similar conduct by public officials acting pursuant to their statutory responsibilities does not constitute the practice of law. Probation officers have long and often prepared and filed petitions for violation of probation in criminal matters; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>and for delinquency in juvenile matters.

Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982); <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 513, 613 A.2d 748 (1992). This right \u201cencompasses the reciprocal rights of both parent and children.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pamela B. </em>v. <em>Ment, </em>244 Conn. 296, 310, 709 A.2d 1089 (1998). When the state decides to initiate a termination proceeding, \u201cit seeks not merely to infringe that fundamental liberty interest, but to end it.\u201d <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>supra, 759. \u201c[F]ew consequences of judicial action are so grave as the severance of natural family ties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>M. L. B. </em>v. <em>S. L. J., </em>519 U.S. 102, 119, 117 S. Ct. 555, 136 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1996). Therefore, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>child\u2019s interest in termination proceedings being conducted in a legal and timely manner, and in a manner that is error-reducing is a \u201ccommanding one.\u201d <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>supra, 759. Unfortunately, by allowing department social workers, untrained in the law, to initiate termination proceedings before our juvenile courts, when it should be done by attorneys,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> could and has resulted in delays that may seriously harm the children \u2014 children who already have been victimized. It has also resulted in the bringing of petitions that patently have no legal basis. Indeed, Judge Foley, in his trial court memorandum of decision, identified examples of the serious problems caused by the filing of improper termination petitions by department social workers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state should and must address these concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The second matter that I am concerned about is that the state\u2019s practice of allowing social workers to file petitions violates, at least, the spirit of the consent decree entered into by the department as a result of a class action suit brought in 1989 in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut in order to remedy systemic deficiencies in the department. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number><em>Juan F. </em>v. <em>O'Neill, </em>United States District Court, Docket No. H-89-859 (D. Conn. January 7, 1991). The <em>Juan F. </em>consent decree required the state to develop department policy manuals that would ensure a reduction in operational errors in filing and processing petitions that could rise to the level of the deprivation of a party\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights. One such manual provides in relevant part: \u201cAt least one (1) [assistant attorney general] shall be available to perform all mandated functions in a timely manner for the Regional Offices five (5) days each week. The [assistant attorney general\u2019s] activity shall include but not be limited to the following: a. Assist workers in the preparation of court documents, and review documents prior to submission to achieve maximum effectiveness in court . . . .\u201d Regional Resource Group/Community Consultant Manual (State of Connecticut 1992) p. 7. That obviously has not been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Third, \u201c[t]he current caseload of the Attorney General\u2019s Office does not allow for sufficient time [for attorneys to meet with caseworkers] to process child protective cases\u201d; State of Connecticut Court Improvement Project Report (Edmund S. Muskie Institute, University of Southern Maine, 1996) p. 72;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, according to Kristine Ragaglia, commissioner of the department, in a letter dated March 10, 1998, addressed to Senator Toni N. Harp and Representative John W. Thompson, \u201cthe number of Termination of Parental Rights . . . petitions filed in court are anticipated to increase from the current level of about 770 to 1000 in [fiscal year 1999].\u201d If the state fails to address these problems, it is not unreasonable to predict that the state\u2019s practice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>allowing' department social workers to file termination petitions may reach a point when it becomes error-ridden instead of error-reducing and, therefore, violates the constitutional rights of the children and their natural parents. At that point, the issue of whether the filing of a petition is permitted by statute or by rules of this court, and whether it constitutes the practice of law will be irrelevant; the federal and state constitutions would trump any state authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">With some hesitation and with great concern, I concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-9\"> See footnotes 1, 3 and 5 of the majority opinion for the relevant text of these provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b46-7\"> In his memorandum of decision, Judge Foley concluded that a \u201cperson drafting the petition to terminate parental rights\u201d must \u201cexercise [a] high degree of legal skill and great capacity for adaptation to difficult and complex situations.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b46-8\"> Judge Foley found that the filing of mistake filled and improper petitions by department social workers \u201care regularly occurring with great frequency in juvenile court proceedings throughout the state.
