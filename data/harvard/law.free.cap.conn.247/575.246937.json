The plaintiff, Linden Condominium Association, Inc., a condominium owners\u2019 association, brought this action against the defendant, R. Richard McKenna, the owner of twelve condominium units, in order to collect unpaid condominium common charges, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs based on the defendant\u2019s personal liability. Following the judgment of the trial court limiting the plaintiffs right to damages, the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court. We transferred this appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The parties have stipulated to the following facts. Prior to bringing the present action, pursuant to the Common Interest Ownership Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 47-200 et seq., specifically \u00a7 47-258, the plaintiff brought a foreclosure action against the defendant to foreclose its statutory lien for unpaid common charges. The trial court rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure, determined that the defendant\u2019s total debt secured by the lien was $74,596.01, awarded $1500 in attorney\u2019s fees and $1653.60 in costs, and set law days.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On its law day, Shawmut Bank Connecticut, N.A. (Shawmut), the holder of the first mortgage on the condominiums in question, redeemed the units by paying the plaintiff the six month superpriority lien plus attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Specifically, Shawmut paid the plaintiff $15,000 for six months of common charges, plus $1500 in attorney\u2019s fees and $1653.60 in costs. Consequently, $59,596.01 remained as an unpaid debt for common charges. Seven days later, the plaintiff moved for a deficiency judgment pursuant to \u00a7 49-14, but the court denied the motion as untimely.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>On November 16, 1995, the plaintiff filed the present action for breach of contract and failure to comply with General Statutes \u00a7 47-257, which sets forth the law regarding assessments for common charges.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff seeks: (1) the remaining common charges of $59,596.01 not recovered in the prior foreclosure action; (2) $11,556 plus 18 percent interest per annum for the common charges and late fees that had accrued in May and June of 1995, the months between the date of judgment and the date of redemption; and (3) costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in connection with the collection of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The defendant responded by filing a motion for summary judgment, claiming that the present action was barred by res judicata because the plaintiff unsuccessfully had sought a deficiency judgment in the prior foreclosure action. The defendant claimed that, even if the plaintiff had not been required to seek a deficiency judgment pursuant to \u00a7 49-14, it chose to do so, and therefore, the trial court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs deficiency judgment motion precluded any further litigation to collect the same debt. The defendant further argued that the debt itself no longer existed because it had merged into the foreclosure judgment. In a pretrial memorandum of decision dated November 1,1996, <em>Hon. Jerry Wagner, </em>judge trial referee, denied the motion for summary judgment, concluding that the present action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>was not barred because the plaintiff could not have maintained a deficiency judgment claim pursuant to \u00a7 49-14. The trial court added that \u00a7 47-258 (f) does not prohibit a postforeclosure action on the debt against a unit owner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, the case was tried to the court, <em>Freed, J.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In his posttrial memorandum of decision, however, Judge Freed concluded otherwise. Specifically, the court held that, in the foreclosure action, after the trial court had established the amount due the plaintiff, and after Shawmut had redeemed the condominium units, the plaintiff had a choice either to pursue a deficiency judgment pursuant to \u00a7 49-14 or to bring a separate action to collect the remaining debt. The court further reasoned, however, that because the plaintiff by motion had pursued a deficiency judgment, which was denied as untimely, the doctrine of res judicata barred the plaintiff from subsequently bringing an action to collect the unrecovered sum from the prior foreclosure action. Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff for only $19,070.06, which sum consisted of $11,556 that the parties had stipulated represented the common charges for May and June of 1995, plus $5026.66 in interest and $2487.40 in attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs principal claim is that, pursuant to \u00a7 47-258, a condominium association can bring an action for unpaid common charges following a foreclosure action for whatever debt remained unsatisfied after judgment in the foreclosure action. Additionally, as part of this action, the plaintiff seeks common charges that accrued between the dates of judgment and redemption, and costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in connection with the collection of the debt.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>of its claim, the plaintiff argues that \u00a7 49-14 does not permit a deficiency judgment when the foreclosing party does not obtain title to the property, and that neither General Statutes \u00a7 49-1<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> nor the doctrine of res judicata bars further action on a debt after a judgment of foreclosure has been rendered.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Conversely, the defendant maintains that the plaintiff had the legal right to pursue a deficiency judgment in the foreclosure action and that \u00a7 49-1 is a bar against further actions on the debt, such as the present one. The defendant further asserts that even if \u00a7 49-1 were not a bar, the doctrine of res judicata bars the plaintiff from bringing this claim because the plaintiff unsuccessfully had pursued a deficiency judgment as a part of the prior foreclosure action. Finally, the defendant contends that collateral estoppel prevents the plaintiff from requesting the attorney\u2019s fees and costs that had accrued in connection with the foreclosure action, and which had been requested, but denied, in that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">We agree with the plaintiff that \u00a7 49-14 did not provide a remedy available to the plaintiff and we reverse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>judgment of the trial court. We also conclude, however, that the doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes the plaintiff from recovering the attorney\u2019s fees and costs that had been denied in the foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">We first address the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly determined that the plaintiff could have obtained a deficiency judgment pursuant to \u00a7 49-14 in an action to foreclose a common charges lien created by \u00a7 47-258 in which a first mortgagee had redeemed by paying the plaintiffs statutory superpriority. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Whether the plaintiff, under the circumstances of this case, could seek a deficiency judgment is a matter of statutory interpretation and is an issue of first impression for this court. Statutoiy interpretation is a matter of law, and, therefore, the trial court\u2019s judgment is subject to plenary review. See <em>Shawmut Mortgage Co. </em>v. <em>Wheat, </em>245 Conn. 744, 748, 717 A.2d 664 (1998). Well settled principles govern such a review. When we construe a statute, \u201c [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Furthermore, [w]e presume that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes . . . because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 663-64, 680 A.2d 242 (1996). We construe each sentence, clause or phrase to have a purpose behind it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>222 Conn. 331, 346, 610 A.2d 1162 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>(1992). In addition, we presume that the legislature intends sensible results from the statutes it enacts. <em>State v. Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158, 165, 496 A.2d 186 (1985). Therefore, we read each statute \u201cin a manner that will not thwart its intended purpose or lead to absurd results.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 311, 319, 702 A.2d 1180 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Regarding the act specifically, we have stated that, \u201c[i]n determining whether [the act] affords the relief that the [plaintiff] seeks, it is axiomatic that we strive to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . In addition, we consider the statute as a whole with a view toward reconciling its parts in order to obtain a sensible and rational overall interpretation.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nicotra Wieler Investment Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>Grower, </em>207 Conn. 441, 451, 541 A.2d 1226 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The act, which is largely modeled after the Uniform Common Interest Ownership Act, was created in order to provide unit owners and their associations with consumer protection rights, as well as to afford developers, lenders and title insurers with flexibility and certainty in establishing common interest communities. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 6, 1983 Sess., pp. 1821-24, remarks of William Breetz;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> see also <em>Willow Springs Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Seventh BRT Development Corp., </em>245 Conn. 1, 30, 717 A.2d 77 (1998). Section 47-258, which is a part of the act, establishes a lien with a split priority. Additionally, it authorizes and describes appropriate foreclosure mechanisms. In derogation of the common-law rule that first in time is first in right, \u00a7 47-258 (b) establishes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>priority for common charges and a superpriority for \u201c \u2018the common expense assessments . . . which would have become due in the absence of acceleration during the six months immediately preceding institution of an action to enforce . . . the association\u2019s lien ....\u2019\u201d <em>Hudson House Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>223 Conn. 610, 614, 611 A.2d 862 (1992), quoting General Statutes \u00a7 47-258 (b). The split priority establishes a superpriority for up to six months of common charges and attorney\u2019s fees and costs prior to first and second mortgages and taxes, and establishes a recording lien for the remainder of the common charges that is prior to many other liens. Thus, the statute provides an owners\u2019 association with a speedy mechanism by which it can secure up to six months of unpaid common charges, as well as attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in such a pursuit. The creation of a lien with such a superpriority protects consumers, because unit owners depend on their association for vital maintenance services.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Section 47-258 also expressly permits actions based on personal liability for unpaid common charges. Section 47-258 (f) provides: \u201cThis section does not prohibit actions to recover sums for which subsection (a) of this section creates a lien or prohibit an association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure.\u201d Hence, contrary to the defendant\u2019s arguments, \u00a7 47-258 (f) allows an association to sue a unit owner based on the owner\u2019s personal liability, in addition to the association\u2019s statutory right to foreclose on its lien. The final phrase, \u201cin lieu of foreclosure,\u201d merely modifies \u201ctaking a deed,\u201d thereby leaving intact the express statement that there is no bar to such a course of action. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s argument that subsections (f) and (j), read together, limit an association\u2019s choices to either an action on the debt or a foreclosure action, is without merit. Section 47-258 (j) provides that \u201c[t]he [condominium] association\u2019s lien may be foreclosed in like manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>as a mortgage on real property,\u201d and merely relates to the procedures to be used in common charges lien foreclosures. There is no language in either subsection that indicates that the plaintiff must choose one action or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">We turn our attention next to \u00a7 49-14, which permits a party in a mortgage foreclosure to file a motion for a deficiency judgment to recover postredemption unpaid debt in certain situations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although \u00a7 49-14 (a) explicitly applies only to mortgage foreclosures, we recently concluded in <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Pleating Supply </em>Corp. v. <em>Kosa, </em>220 Conn. 643, 649, 600 A.2d 1 (1991), that the deficiency judgment provisions of \u00a7 49-14 (a) apply as well to judgment liens on real property. In that case, our reading of the language of the statute was based on General Statutes \u00a7 52-380a (c),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> a provision parallel to \u00a7 47-258 (j), and on our public policy to promote efficiency. Id., 649-50. We also noted in <em>Fair-field Plumbing &amp; Pleating Supply Corp. </em>that other jurisdictions do not appear to distinguish between mortgages and liens with respect to deficiency judgments. Id., 651-52 n.12, citing <em>Ringle </em>v. <em>Wallis Iron Works, </em>93 N.Y. Sup. Ct. (86 Hun.) 153, 155-56, 33 N.Y.S. 398 (1895) (\u201c[t]here is nothing . . . which prevents one establishing a lien from obtaining his full relief, which includes his right to enforce it, not only out of the property against which the [mechanic\u2019s] lien is filed, but for any deficiency against the person who for the amount thereof is indebted to the claimant\u201d), aff'd, 155 N.Y. 674, 49 N.E. 1103 (1898).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The history of mortgage foreclosures and the development of deficiency judgments help to explain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>scope and function of these laws today. \u201cAt common law, a mortgagee was required to elect between a foreclosure action or an action on the underlying debt.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In <em>Derby Bank </em>v. <em>Landon, </em>3 Conn. 62, 63 (1819), this court held that \u2018a foreclosure and consequent possession . . . is in the nature of satisfaction of a debt secured by mortgage. It is deemed an appropriation of the thing pledged, in payment of the demand, for which it was security. \u2019 \u201d <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Fieating Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosa, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 647. Thus, even if the value of the property that the mortgagee gained was less than the debt owed to her, the entry of judgment precluded any further common-law proceedings on the note. Id. Consequently, in 1833, the legislature created the remedy of the deficiency judgment<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in order to make the plaintiff whole when the value of the security did not cover the amount of the debt owed to the plaintiff. Id.; see also D. Caron, Connecticut Foreclosures (3d Ed. 1997) \u00a7 9.05A, p. 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Today deficiency judgments are calculated pursuant to \u00a7 49-14 (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cAt any time within thirty days after the time limited for redemption has expired, any party to a mortgage foreclosure may file a motion seeking a deficiency judgment. Such motion shall be placed on the short calendar for an evidentiary hearing. ... At such hearing the court shall hear the evidence, <em>establish a valuation for the mortgaged property and shall render judgment for the plaintiff for the difference, if any, between such valuation and the plaintiffs claim. </em>The plaintiff in any further action upon the debt, note or obligation, shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>recover only the amount of such judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">As previously stated, we have read \u00a7 49-14 to apply to statutorily created judgment lien foreclosures pursuant to a provision similar to \u00a7 47-258 (j). <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosa, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 651. It follows, therefore, that \u00a7 49-14 <em>should </em>also apply to statutorily created liens for common charges. In <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corp., </em>however, title vested in the party foreclosing the judgment hen. There is no analogous legal precedent for applying \u00a7 49-14 to the present situation, in which title did not vest in the foreclosing party who brought the claim for a deficiency judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">On its face, \u00a7 49-14 (a) applies only where there has been no redemption and title has vested in the foreclosing plaintiff. Although \u00a7 49-14 provides that <em>\u201cany party </em>to a mortgage foreclosure may file a motion seeking a deficiency judgment\u201d; (emphasis added); these words do not change our analysis, because the moving party must still have possession of the property in question in order for there to be a valuation and a corresponding calculation of a deficiency. In the present case, a deficiency cannot be calculated under \u00a7 49-14 (a) because the plaintiffs claimed deficiency is not created by inadequate value in the premises being foreclosed; rather, it arises as a result of the split priority.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The plaintiff did not acquire possession of the property, and therefore, the trial court cannot possibly make a finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>value of the property is insufficient to satisfy fully the plaintiffs debt. The necessary calculation, which entails the \u201cdifference, if any, between such valuation and the plaintiffs claim\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 49-14 (a); requires a valuation of the property by the court. Such a valuation necessitates that the foreclosure action resulted in title to the property having vested in the plaintiff. Consequently, while \u00a7 49-14 (a) does not require explicitly that title vest in the plaintiff, it is impossible to apply the statute if, as in the present case, title vests in a mortgagee who redeems on its law day. In such a case, the value of the property is irrelevant to the debt still due the association after the foreclosure action. D. Caron, supra, \u00a7 12.07, p. 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Our conclusion is further supported by the fact that, although this case creates an issue of first impression, our reading of \u00a7 49-14 (a) is consistent with our prior cases involving \u00a7 49-14 (a). For example, we have made it clear-that \u201cstrict compliance with [\u00a7 49-14 (a)\u2019s] provisions [is] a condition precedent to the entry of a deficiency judgment. . . . The necessity of a definite rule of general application and, as well, an unvarying adherence to it, is manifest. Departures from it, if permitted, might lead to grave abuse.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Simsbury Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Ray Carlson Lumber Co., </em>154 Conn. 216, 218, 224 A.2d 544 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">More specifically, we have explained that it is a mandatory statutory requirement that a hearing be held at which the court \u201c \u2018shall hear the evidence, establish a valuation for the mortgaged property and shall render judgment for the plaintiff for the difference, if any, between such valuation and the plaintiffs claim. \u2019 \u201d <em>First Bank </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>199 Conn. 368, 371, 507 A.2d 997 (1986), quoting Practice Book \u00a7 528, now \u00a7 23-19. In our discussion of the proper method of calculating a deficiency in <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosa, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 647, we specified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\u201c[b]efore rendering a deficiency judgment, the court must have a mechanism for establishing the value of the subject property to determine whether and to what extent a deficiency exists.\u201d When analyzing another aspect of \u00a7 49-14 (a), we stated that it is a necessary element that a plaintiff prove that the property was worth less than the amount of the debt on the date of the vesting of title. <em>Eichman v. J &amp; J Building </em>Co., 216 Conn. 443, 451, 582 A.2d 182 (1990). Lastly, in <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>227 Conn. 270, 278-79 n.10, 630 A.2d 1010 (1993), we concluded that \u201cwithout such a determination [of fair market value of property] there would be no way to determine whether the mortgagee was entitled to such a judgment and, if so, the amount thereof.\u201d Thus, it is clear that \u00a7 49-14 (a) should not be read to allow a deficiency judgment when a deficiency cannot be calculated based on the value of the property in accordance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The defendant asserts that the relevant language of \u00a7 49-14 \u2014 \u201cestablish a valuation for the mortgaged property\u201d \u2014 refers to the amount of money Shawmut paid the plaintiff when it redeemed on its law day. This argument has no merit. Although such a reading creates a mathematical equation upon which the remaining debt could be calculated, there is no basis in the statutory language, its legislative history, or in any of our prior readings of \u00a7 49-14 for the defendant\u2019s claim that \u201cvaluation\u201d is not linked to the value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In summary, we conclude that the plaintiff was not able to bring a deficiency judgment claim in the former action pursuant to \u00a7 49-14 because the first mortgagee redeemed by paying the plaintiffs statutory superpriority.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">We next address whether \u00a7 49-1 or the doctrine of res judicata bars the plaintiff from bringing the present action. We find no bar to the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The defendant contends that, in the context of common charges liens, as well as mortgage foreclosures, \u00a7 49-1 mandates that the plaintiff must choose between bringing a foreclosure action or an action on the debt. Hence, according to the defendant, \u00a7 49-1 bars the present action because the plaintiff chose to bring the foreclosure action under \u00a7 47-258. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The application of \u00a7 49-1 is also an issue of statutory interpretation to which we will give plenary review. Necessarily, it will be governed by the aforementioned principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">We begin with the language of the relevant statutes. Section 49-1 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe foreclosure of a mortgage is a bar to any further action upon the mortgage debt, note or obligation against the person or persons who are liable for the payment thereof who are made parties to the foreclosure and also against any person or persons upon whom service of process to constitute an action in personam could have been made within this state at the commencement of the foreclosure . . . .\u201d Accordingly, on its face, \u00a7 49-1 applies only to mortgage foreclosures. Furthermore, there is no explicit statutory bar to further actions after the common charges lien foreclosure action. On the contrary, subsection (f) of \u00a7 47-258<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> specifically provides that the foreclosure provisions of the statute do not prohibit any action to recover debts upon which the statutory lien is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 49-1 is consistent with our reading of \u00a7 49-14, and the historical developments of the act and mortgage foreclosure law. Having rejected an interpretation of \u00a7 49-14 allowing for a deficiency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>judgment claim in a case like the present one, the application of \u00a7 49-1 to a common charges lien that creates a split priority would deny many owners\u2019 associations full relief. Typically, at least part of the debt will be unsatisfied after a common charges lien foreclosure in which the first or second mortgagee redeems. If \u00a7 49-1 were to bar a separate, second action on the debt, condominium associations that did not gain possession of the unit(s) at issue would have no mechanism through which to satisfy any debt based on charges that accrued outside the six months preceding the foreclosure action. For example, in the present case, the plaintiff was incapable of obtaining satisfaction for the entire lien because it was unable to seek a deficiency judgment in the initial foreclosure action. To bar the plaintiff, and others like it, from bringing this type of action on a debt would create absurd results that would thwart the intended purpose of the act. See <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 319; <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>supra, 197 Conn. 165 (refusing to read statute in manner that would lead to bizarre results). The split priority was created in order to provide the owners\u2019 associations with a quick, efficient mechanism through which to obtain payment for unremitted common charges, not to deprive them of complete satisfaction of unit owners\u2019 debts. More generally, the remedy of deficiency judgment itself was created in order to provide the foreclosing party a mechanism through which to recover unsatisfied debt. <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosa, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 647; see also part I of this opinion. Consequently, because a deficiency judgment is not available to the plaintiff, it would contravene legislative intent to prevent the plaintiff from bringing a subsequent separate action to recover any unsatisfied debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Our conclusion is further supported by the act\u2019s mandate of liberal construction. Generally, the act must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>afforded liberal construction in favor of the intended beneficiaries because it is a remedial statute. See <em>Concept Associates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>229 Conn. 618, 623, 642 A.2d 1186 (1994). More specifically, General Statutes \u00a7 47-212 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe remedies provided by [the act] shall be liberally administered to the end that the aggrieved party is put in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed . . . .\u201d Consequently, even though it requires no liberal construction in order to reach our conclusion, to reach any other resolution would violate \u00a7 47-212. As stated previously, to allow \u00a7 49-1 to bar the present action when the plaintiff was not able to pursue a deficiency judgment under \u00a7 49-14, would prevent the plaintiff from being put in as good a position as if the defendant had paid the requisite common charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Finally, our holding that \u00a7 49-1 does not apply to liens for common charges is also consistent with our analogous decision in <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosa, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 649. In that case, we explained that, unlike a mortgage foreclosure judgment, a judgment of foreclosure on a judgment lien does not extinguish the original judgment, which remains valid as to any uncollected portion. Id. It was implicit in our holding that \u00a7 49-1 did not apply to judgment lien foreclosures. Similarly, the original common charges debt is not extinguished by a foreclosure action based on a statutorily created lien, hence \u00a7 49-1 does not bar further actions on the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In contrast, the defendant claims that the statement in \u00a7 47-258 (j) that an association lien \u201cmay be foreclosed in like manner as a mortgage on real property\u201d invokes the bar contained in \u00a7 49-1. We are not persuaded. Subsection (j) of \u00a7 47-258 governs only the procedures for foreclosing mortgages on real property. Section 49-1, in contrast, does not relate to the manner in which a mortgage is foreclosed, but, rather, serves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>to bar any action on the debt <em>after </em>a foreclosure. In short, the language and legislative history of the relevant statutes, the public policies behind them, and our holding in <em>Fairfield, Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corp. </em>contravene the defendant\u2019s proposed reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The defendant also argues that the present action is barred by the doctrine of res judicata because of the plaintiffs previous unsuccessful pursuit of a deficiency judgment. Although the plaintiff moved for a deficiency judgment pursuant to \u00a7 49-14, which motion was denied as untimely, the plaintiff counters that res judicata does not apply to the present action because it was not legally able to seek a deficiency judgment in the prior foreclosure action. As we have previously stated, we agree with the plaintiff that a deficiency judgment was not available under the circumstances of this case and, therefore, the doctrine of res judicata does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The applicability of res judicata also raises a question of law, and is, therefore, subject to our plenary review. See <em>Tirozzi </em>v. <em>Shelby Ins. Co., </em>50 Conn. App. 680, 684, 719 A.2d 62 (1998). \u201c[U]nder the doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, a former judgment on a claim, <em>if rendered on the merits, </em>is an absolute bar to a subsequent action on the same claim ... [or any claim based on the same operative facts that] might have been made. . . . [T]he appropriate inquiry with respect to [claim] preclusion is whether the party had an adequate opportunity to litigate the matter in the earlier proceeding . . . .\u201d (Emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Rytman, </em>241 Conn. 24, 43-44, 694 A.2d 1246 (1997). We have further stated that \u201ca decision whether to apply the doctrine of res judicata to claims that have not actually been litigated should be made based upon a consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>of the doctrine\u2019s underlying policies, namely, the interests of the defendant and of the courts in bringing litigation to a close . . . .\u201d <em>Delahunty v. Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 582, 591, 674 A.2d 1290 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">We conclude that the doctrine of res judicata does not bar- the present action for two reasons. First, its application would have to be predicated on the fact that the plaintiff already had brought a deficiency judgment action on the outstanding debt. We have determined, however, that the plaintiff was not able to bring such a claim in its foreclosure action. Thus, res judicata cannot bar the plaintiff because it brought an action it was not entitled to bring. See <em>Swift </em>v. <em>McPherson, </em>232 U.S. 51, 56, 34 S. Ct. 239, 58 L. Ed. 499 (1914) (dismissal is not on merits if dismissed for want of jurisdiction); see also <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>317 A.2d 114, 119 (Del. 1974) (judgment based on defective pleadings or lack of jurisdiction in prior action will not serve as bar to second action), aff'd, 336 A.2d 572, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 841, 96 S. Ct. 72, 46 L. Ed. 2d 61 (1975). Although the doctrine of res judicata may bar an action that a party did bring or <em>could have brought, Delahunty </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 589; the fact that the plaintiff could not legally have obtained a deficiency judgment in the prior action, as we have concluded, precludes the application of that strand of the res judicata doctrine. Second, even if the plaintiffs deficiency judgment claim could be challenged under the doctrine of res judicata, the doctrine would not apply in the present action because the trial court\u2019s dismissal was based on untimeliness and not on the merits of the claim. See <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Rytman, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 43. In summary, we conclude that the trial court improperly determined that the doctrine of res judicata bars the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The final issue on appeal is whether collateral estoppel bars the plaintiff from requesting the attorney\u2019s fees and costs that had accrued, had been requested, but had been denied by the trial court in the prior foreclosure action.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The issue of collateral estoppel was raised in the trial court proceedings, but was never addressed by the trial court in light of its disposition of the case. Because this is an issue of law on which the record is complete, we resolve the claim in the interest of judicial economy, and conclude that the plaintiff cannot now seek those fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Collateral estoppel, like its cousin res judicata, presents a question of law that we review de novo. See <em>Tirozzi </em>v. <em>Shelby Ins. Co., </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 684. \u201cCollateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, prohibits the relitigation of an issue when that issue was actually litigated and necessarily determined in a prior action. . . . For an issue to be subject to collateral estoppel, it must have been fully and fairly litigated in the first action. It also must have been actually decided and the decision must have been necessary to the judgment.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>220 Conn. 285, 296, 596 A.2d 414 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">In the prior foreclosure action, the trial court made a factual determination in the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 47-258 (g).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The plaintiff sought $8470.60 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs, but was awarded only $3153.60.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Pursuant to \u00a7 47-258 (g), the trial court necessarily and reasonably determined the amount of costs and attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Shawmut paid the plaintiff $3153.60 when it redeemed on its law day. Consequently, the plaintiff is collaterally estopped from seeking the additional $5317 in the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In conclusion, we hold that the plaintiff did not have available the remedy of a deficiency judgment in the prior foreclosure action. In addition, we conclude that neither \u00a7 49-1 nor the doctrine of res judicata bars the present action. We do, however, limit the plaintiffs claim to: (1) the unrecovered common charges debt ($59,596.01); (2) the common charges that accrued between the dates of the foreclosure judgment and redemption ($11,556) plus 18 percent interest per annum; and (3) the costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred solely in connection with the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the plaintiff for its debt, common charges, costs, and its reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-14 provides: \u201c(a) At any time within thirty days after tire time limited for redemption has expired, any party to a mortgage foreclosure may file a motion seeking a deficiency judgment.
