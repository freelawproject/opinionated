Haymond, an attorney, appeals from the judgment of the trial court dismissing his appeal from a reprimand issued to him by the defendant, the statewide grievance committee. See <em>Haymond </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>45 Conn. Sup. 481, 723 A.2d 821 (1998). The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we granted the plaintiffs motion to transfer the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-2 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The facts giving rise to this appeal are set forth in detail in the trial court\u2019s opinion; <em>Haymond </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>supra, 45 Conn. Sup. 481; and may be summarized as follows. In 1994 and 1995, the plaintiff placed advertisements for his law firm, the Law Offices of John Haymond, in the Springfield, Massachusetts NYNEX Yellow Pages Telephone Directory. A picture of the plaintiff appeared in both advertisements. The text of the 1994 advertisements included a reference to \u201c12 personal injury attorneys.\u201d The text of the 1995 advertisements stated: \u201cWe are a team of fourteen lawyers with nearly 200 years combined experience,\u201d and \u201cLicensed in Massachusetts and Connecticut.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">During the same period, the plaintiff also placed television advertisements that featured the plaintiff and contained the following statements: \u201cAt the law offices of John Haymond, we protect the rights of accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>victims and their loved ones\u201d; \u201cFor accident claims call the Law Office of John Haymond\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m Attorney John Haymond. . . \u201cThe Law Offices of John Haymond works for you and keeps on working\u201d; and \u201cI\u2019m John Haymond and that\u2019s my promise.\u201d The television advertisements were broadcast on WGGB, a station located in Springfield, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The plaintiff is a member of the bar of the states of Connecticut and Pennsylvania, but he is not a member of the Massachusetts bar. At the time he placed the advertisements, only four attorneys in his firm were admitted to the Massachusetts bar. The plaintiffs professional and support staff worked in offices located in Hartford and Bridgeport. A Springfield, Massachusetts, office was used for meetings with clients as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">On March 29, 1995, Alan Goodman, a Massachusetts attorney, filed a complaint with the defendant regarding the plaintiffs advertising. After a hearing, the defendant concluded that the plaintiff had used false and misleading telephone directory advertisements and television commercials in violation of rules 7.1 (1) and 8.4 (3)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Consequently, on February 21,1997, the defendant issued a reprimand to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed from the defendant\u2019s reprimand to the Superior Court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 2-38, formerly \u00a7 27N. On appeal, the plaintiff challenged both the defendant\u2019s jurisdiction over out-of-state advertising and the defendant\u2019s application of Connecticut law, rather than Massachusetts law, to the advertisements he had placed. The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">After considering the briefs and arguments of the parties and examining the record on appeal, we conclude that the judgment of the trial court is correct and must be affirmed. The issues presented were resolved properly in the trial court\u2019s opinion. It would serve no useful purpose for this court to repeat the discussion contained therein. See <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Burger King Corp., </em>244 Conn. 204, 206, 707 A.2d 30 (1998); <em>Lizotte v. Welker, </em>244 Conn. 156, 158, 709 A.2d 1 (1998); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Buonato, </em>241 Conn. 319, 321-22, 696 A.2d 320 (1997); <em>Gajewski </em>v. <em>Pavelo, </em>236 Conn. 27, 30, 670 A.2d 318 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\"> The trial court\u2019s opinion referred to rules 7.1 (a) and 8.4 (c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The 1998 revision of the Practice Book, however, delineates subsections of the Rules of Professional Conduct by number, rather than by letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Rule 7.1 of the Rules of Professional Conduct provides in relevant part: \u201cA lawyer shall not make a false or misleading communication about the lawyer or the lawyer\u2019s services. A communication is false or misleading if it:</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">\u201c(1) Contains a material misrepresentation of fact or law, or omits a fact necessary to make the statement considered as a whole not materially misleading . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Rule 8.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct provides in relevant part: \u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">\u201c(3) Engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
