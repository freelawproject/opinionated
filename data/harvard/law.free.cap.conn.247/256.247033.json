We subsequently transferred the reserved question to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). The issue framed by the parties and reserved by the trial court for advice is: \u201cWhen the [s]tate is sued pursuant to its waiver of sovereign immunity in [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-556,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is it immune from a reallocation of damages pursuant to the provisions of [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-572h (g)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>that it is a liable defendant and the plaintiff is unable to recover the damages awarded against another liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>defendant?\u201d We conclude that the state is not immune from reallocation of damages pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h (g) and answer the reserved question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The following facts and procedural history are undisputed. On March 7,1995, the plaintiffs decedent, Cheryl Babes, was driving her automobile westbound on Route 202 in New Hartford. Mark Brodeur, an employee of the defendant state of Connecticut (state), was driving a van westbound on Route 202 directly behind Babes\u2019 car. The vehicle being driven by Brodeur was owned and insured by the state. The named defendant, Steven Bennett, was traveling eastbound on Route 202, driving a pickup truck that was towing a flatbed trailer. The flatbed trailer became detached from Bennett\u2019s truck, crossed the center line of the road, entered the westbound lanes of Route 202 and collided with Babes\u2019 vehicle. Babes\u2019 car came to rest in the westbound lanes of Route 202. The van driven by Brodeur collided with Babes\u2019 vehicle, and Babes died as a result of the injuries she sustained in the two collisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The plaintiff, as administratrix of Babes\u2019 estate, subsequently filed the present wrongful death action, naming both Bennett and the state as defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> *3 Although the state generally is immune from suit, \u00a7 52-556 provides a cause of action against the state when any person is injured through the negligence of any state employee while operating a motor vehicle owned and insured by the state. See <em>White </em>v. Burns, 213 Conn. 307, 312, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990) (statutory waiver of sovereign immunity). The parties have stipulated that a jury probably would return a verdict in favor of the plaintiff against Bennett. Bennett has a $20,000 liability insurance policy. The parties have agreed that Bennett has no other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>assets that could be used to satisfy a judgment against him and that a jury probably would award the plaintiff damages that greatly exceed the $20,000 limit of Bennett\u2019s insurance policy. The parties also have agreed that, if the case were to go to trial, and the state were to be found liable, the plaintiff would seek reallocation to the state of any damages she is unable to collect from Bennett.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The parties, however, do not intend to go to trial. They have agreed to settle the matter. The amount the state is willing to pay the plaintiff depends upon whether the plaintiff is entitled to reallocate to the state any damages that cannot be collected from Bennett. The trial court deemed the resolution of this question sufficiently important to invoke the reservation procedures of Practice Book \u00a7 73-1 (e), which allow this court or the Appellate Court to answer specific reserved questions that are \u201creasonably certain to enter into the decision of the case, [if] it appears that their present determination would be in the interest of simplicity, directness and economy of judicial action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Section 52-572h (g) provides that, in the event a plaintiff is unable to recover damages awarded against a particular defendant, damages are to be reallocated among other defendant tortfeasors that were found liable. At issue, therefore, is the applicability of \u00a7 52-572h (g) to an action brought against the state pursuant, to \u00a7 52-556. The resolution of this issue is guided by well established principles of statutory construction. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative histoiy and circumstances surrounding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bhinder </em>v. <em>Sun Co., </em>246 Conn. 223, 230-31, 717 A.2d 202 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Our analysis is more specifically illuminated by the well settled principle that when the state waives sovereign immunity by statute \u201ca party attempting to sue under the legislative exception must come clearly within its provisions, because [statutes in derogation of sovereignty should be strictly construed in favor of the state, so that its sovereignty may be upheld and not narrowed or destroyed .... <em>Berger, Lehman Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>178 Conn. 352, 356, 422 A.2d 268 (1979). Where there is any doubt about [the] meaning or intent [of a statute in derogation of sovereign immunity, it is] given the effect which makes the least rather than the most change in sovereign immunity. <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 312.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Peabody, N.E., Inc., </em>239 Conn. 93, 101-102, 680 A.2d 1321 (1996). \u201cThe state\u2019s sovereign right not to be sued may be waived by the legislature, provided clear intention to that effect is disclosed by the use of express terms or by force of a necessary implication.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>205 Conn. 542, 558, 534 A.2d 888 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The parties do not dispute that the negligence of Bennett and Brodeur proximately caused Babes\u2019 injuries. Nor do they dispute that the state may be liable pursuant to \u00a7 52-556. The plaintiff contends, moreover, that the state\u2019s liability pursuant to \u00a7 52-556 for damages for those injuries is governed by the provisions of \u00a7 52-572h, particularly the reallocation provisions of \u00a7 52-572h (g). The state maintains, in contrast, that \u00a7 52-572h (g) does not apply to actions brought against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>state pursuant to \u00a7 52-556 and, therefore, does not govern the award of damages in such actions. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Before addressing the effect that \u00a7 52-572h (g) has in an action brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-556, we first must determine the nature of the cause of action that may be brought against the state pursuant to \u00a7 52-556. Our inquiry begins with the language of \u00a7 52-556, which has remained substantially unchanged since the statute first was enacted in 1927. See Public Acts 1927, c. 209. Section 52-556 provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny person injured . . . through the <em>negligence </em>of any state official or employee when operating a motor vehicle owned and insured by the state . . . shall have a right of action against the state . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) With the enactment of \u00a7 52-556, therefore, the state expressly waived sovereign immunity in motor vehicle <em>negligence </em>actions; <em>Capers </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>239 Conn. 265, 273, 684 A.2d 696 (1996); and specifically consented to suits based on \u201cnegligence.\u201d The legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cnegligence\u201d in \u00a7 52-556 manifests the obvious intention of the legislature to consent to suit against the state based on the breach of a common-law duty of care in the operation of state owned and insured vehicles by state employees and officials. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>St,ate, </em>189 Conn. 550, 555 n.7, 457 A.2d 304 (1983) (\u00a7 52-556 permits recovery against state on theory of vicarious liability for certain negligent acts by its agents, \u201ca common-law liability borne by private employers\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>the language of \u00a7 52-556 expressly waives the state\u2019s immunity from suit based on common-law negligence, it appears that the legislature intended \u00a7 52-556 to incorporate the principles governing existing common-law negligence actions, and that the statute was not intended to create a separate statutory action to which different principles of liability and damages would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">We previously have distinguished between a waiver of immunity from suit and a waiver of immunity from liability for certain elements of damages. Specifically, we have concluded that the state\u2019s waiver of immunity from suit in General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144; see footnote 4 of this opinion; the defective highway statute, is not an implicit waiver of the state\u2019s immunity from liability for prejudgment interest;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ***5 <em>Struckman </em>v. Burns, supra, 205 Conn. 559-60; or taxation of costs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>176 Conn. 362, 366, 407 A.2d 987 (1978); <em>State ex rel. Foote </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, </em>111 Conn. 427, 432, 150 A. 308 (1930); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>82 Conn. 392, 394, 73 A. 751 (1909).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Those conclusions, however, are based on the understanding that, if the legislature waives sovereign immunity by creating a separate statutory cause of action against the state, the parameters of that cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>must be strictly construed. Moreover, the statute should not be read so as to have implicitly waived the state\u2019s immunity from the imposition, pursuant to separate and distinct statutes, of damages or costs in excess of those damages expressly authorized in the statute creating the cause of action. Compensatory damages recovered pursuant to \u00a7 52-556, however, may be recovered by virtue of a common-law negligence cause of action with respect to which the state\u2019s immunity has been waived, not by a statutorily created cause of action that must be closely circumscribed. In other words, \u00a7 52-556 does not create a heretofore unrecognized cause of action, but instead is a waiver that permits an already established common-law negligence action to be brought against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">We turn our attention, therefore, to the rules that governed negligence actions when the legislature enacted \u00a7 52-556. Section 52-556 initially was enacted in 1927; see Public Acts 1927, c. 209; and has remained substantially unchanged since that time. \u201cPrior to October 1, 1986, this state adhered to the mies of joint and several liability with no contribution among joint tortfeasors. This doctrine can be stated succinctly. \u2018If the illegal conduct of each of the defendants was a proximate cause of the collision, they would be liable jointly and severally, the plaintiff would have a right to recover the entire amount of damages awarded from either, and, if he did so, the defendant paying them would have no right of contribution against the other; or the plaintiff might have sued either alone, and of course in the event of a recovery, that one would have been compelled to pay the entire amount of damages.\u2019 <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Heisler, </em>118 Conn. 632, 633, 174 A. 66 (1934).\u201d <em>Donner </em>v. <em>Kearse, </em>234 Conn. 660, 666, 662 A.2d 1269 (1995). Thus, because joint and several liability was the mle governing damages in negligence actions generally at the time of the enactment of \u00a7 52-556, the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>subjected the state to joint and several liability. In fact, in <em>Fairbanks </em>v. <em>State, </em>143 Conn. 653, 124 A.2d 893 (1956), a wrongful death action in which the state was named a defendant pursuant to a waiver of immunity under \u00a7 52-556, we affirmed a jury verdict for $75,000 against multiple defendants, including the state. A state employee, driving a car owned and insured by the state, negligently collided with the car of the plaintiffs decedent, resulting in the death of the plaintiffs decedent. Id., 654. A jury determined that the state and two other defendants were jointly and severally hable for payment of damages of $75,000. Id., 655. On appeal, ah three defendants claimed the jury award was excessive. Id. We concluded that the trial court did not improperly refuse to set aside the verdict. Id., 658-61. By implication, we previously have recognized, therefore, that the state may be held jointly and severally liable for damages in an action brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-556. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">To summarize, we conclude that, when the legislature enacted \u00a7 52-556, it intended that the substantive rules governing negligence actions generally would apply to actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-556. Because, at that time, the rules of joint and several liability governed negligence actions, the state, in an action brought against it pursuant to \u00a7 52-556, could be held responsible for the entire amount of damages awarded, rather than simply its proportionate share of such damages, even if there were solvent codefendants who were also hable.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In 1986, however, with the enactment of tort reform legislation, the legislature adopted comparative negligence principles, and, consequently, the rules of joint and several liability no longer govern common-law negligence actions in Connecticut.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are required, therefore, to consider the effect that the comparative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>negligence statute, \u00a7 52-572h, has on negligence actions brought against the state pursuant to \u00a7 52-556.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The state argues that it is immune from the reallocation provisions of \u00a7 52-572h (g). Specifically, the state maintains that the proportionate share of damages caused by a third party tortfeasor, Bennett, operating a vehicle not owned or insured by the state, should not be allocated to the state pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h (g) in the absence of an express statutory waiver of sovereign immunity for that specific purpose. The plaintiff, however, argues that, because the state has waived its immunity from suit for common-law negligence pursuant to \u00a7 52-556, the state is subject to the provisions of \u00a7 52-572h (g) of the comparative negligence statute concerning reallocation of uncollectible damages. The plaintiff contends that it would be illogical to allow the state to benefit from the apportionment provisions of \u00a7 52-572h (c) when there are multiple liable defendants, but not to subject the state to the reallocation provisions of \u00a7 52-572h (g) when a liable codefendant is insolvent. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Our analysis begins with the language of the operative statutory provisions. Section 52-572h (c) provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]n a <em>negligence action </em>to recover damages resulting from . . . wrongful death ... if the damages are determined to be proximately caused by the <em>negligence </em>of more than one party, each party against whom recovery is allowed shall be liable to the claimant only for his proportionate share of the recoverable economic damages and the recoverable noneconomic damages <em>except as provided in subsection (g) of this section.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Section 52-572h applies specifically to <em>negligence </em>actions. Consequently, because \u00a7 52-556 permits a cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>against the state based on negligence, an action brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-556 is a \u201cnegligence action\u201d to which the comparative negligence principles of \u00a7 52-572h apply. Therefore, in such actions, unless \u00a7 52-572h (g) provides otherwise, \u00a7 52-572h (c) provides that a defendant whose conduct proximately caused the injury is liable solely for his proportionate share of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">We next consider the effect that the reallocation provisions of \u00a7 52-572h (g) have on actions brought against the state pursuant to \u00a7 52-556. Section 52-572h (g) (1) provides in relevant part that \u201cthe court shall determine whether all or part of a defendant\u2019s proportionate share of the recoverable economic damages and recoverable noneconomic damages is -uncollectible from that party, and shall reallocate such uncollectible amount among the other defendants in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. ...\u201d Thus, not only does \u00a7 52-572h (c) directly refer to \u00a7 52-572h (g), but both \u00a7 52-572h (c) and (g) address a party\u2019s liability for a \u201cproportionate share of the recoverable economic damages and [the] recoverable noneconomic damages . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The state argues that although the reference in \u00a7 52-572h (c) to the \u201cproportionate share of the recoverable economic damages and recoverable noneconomic damages\u201d applies to <em>all </em>liable defendants, the same language in \u00a7 52-572h (g) applies to all hable defendants <em>except the state. </em>Although it is not completely implausible that, in order to preserve the state\u2019s fisc, the legislature intended that the state be permitted to apportion damages to other hable codefendants pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h (c), and to avoid reallocation of damages under \u00a7 52-572h (g) if a liable codefendant is insolvent, we \u201cmust interpret a statute as written . . . and it is to be considered as a whole, with a view toward reconciling its separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hall Manor Owner\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>212 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>147, 154, 561 A.2d 1373 (1989). There is nothing in the language of \u00a7 52-572h (c) and (g) to indicate that the legislature intended that the phrase \u201cproportionate share of the recoverable economic damages and [the] recoverable noneconomic damages\u201d apply to all defendants in \u00a7 52-572h (c), but apply to all defendants <em>except the state </em>in \u00a7 52-572h (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Furthermore, the legislative history and genealogy of \u00a7 52-572h (c) and (g) indicate that \u00a7 52-572h (g) was intended to apply to the state as well as to all other liable defendants. Section 52-572h (c) was enacted as part of the Tort Reform Act of 1986 (Tort Reform I); Public Acts 1986, No. 86-338, \u00a7 3; partially in response to concerns that, under the common-law rule of joint and several liability, a defendant who was only slightly at fault \u201ccould be held responsible for the entire amount of damages, as long as his negligence was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries.\u201d <em>Donner </em>v. <em>Kearse, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 667; see <em>Biro </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>214 Conn. 1, 6, 570 A.2d 182 (1990). Public Acts 1986, No. 86-338, \u00a7 3 (c), which was codified as General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 52-572h (c), provides in relevant part that \u201cin a negligence action ... if the damages are determined to be proximately caused by the negligence of more than one <em>person, </em>each <em>person </em>against whom recovery is allowed shall be liable to the claimant only for his proportionate share of the recoverable economic damages and the recoverable noneconomic damages . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, under Tort Reform I, in determining the percentage of damages attributable to a particular defendant, the trier of fact was able to take into account the percentage of damages attributable to any other person, even if that person was not a party to the suit. A plaintiff was unable, however, to recover complete compensation for his injuries unless every person whose negligence proximately caused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>injuries was a party to the suit. The share of damages attributable to nonparties was not recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The legislature amended \u00a7 52-572h (c) just one year later when it enacted Public Acts 1987, No. 87-227, \u00a7 3 (P.A. 87-227). Commonly referred to as Tort Reform II, P.A. 87-227, \u00a7 3 (c), provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]n a negligence action ... if the damages are determined to be proximately caused by the negligence of more than one <em>party, </em>each <em>party </em>against whom recovery is allowed shall be liable to the claimant only for his proportionate share of the recoverable economic damages and the recoverable noneconomic damages except as provided in subsection (g) of this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the intent of P.A. 87-227 was to limit the universe of negligent persons that a finder of fact may consider in apportioning damages to only those entities that are either <em>parties </em>to the suit or <em>parties </em>who have reached a settlement agreement with the plaintiff<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 a clear indication that the legislature intended that \u00a7 52-572h (c) permit the plaintiff to obtain, to the maximum extent possible, complete compensation for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The legislative history of P.A. 87-227 also indicates that the legislature intended to maximize the plaintiffs ability to recover damages from the parties whose negligence caused his injuries. Section 3 (g) (1) of P.A. 87-227 which was codified as \u00a7 52-572h (g), provides in relevant part that \u201cafter good faith efforts by the claimant to collect from a hable defendant . . . the court shah determine whether all or part of a defendant\u2019s proportionate share of the recoverable economic damages and recoverable noneconomic damages is uncollectible from that party, and shall reallocate such uncollectible amount among the other defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>During the discussion on the floor of the Senate on Substitute Senate Bill No. 1015, which eventually was enacted as P.A. 87-227, \u00a7 3, and codified as \u00a7 52-572h, Senator Anthony V. Avaflone remarked that under the bill, \u201cso long as there is a solvent party who participated in a negligent act which resulted in damages,\u201d the plaintiff would be entitled to a reallocation of economic damages. 30 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1987 Sess., pp. 1936-37. Similarly, during the debate on the floor of the House of Representatives on Substitute Senate Bill No. 1015, Representative Richard D. Tulisano remarked that Tort Reform II \u201cmakes it clear that ... a victim in our society [will] be able to collect all of their out-of-pocket costs [from] people who committed torts against them. . . . [T]hose that are at fault, will be responsible . . . .\u201d 30 H.R. Proc., Pt. 16, 1987 Sess., pp. 5649-50. Thus, the legislative histoiy of \u00a7 52-572h (g) manifests the legislature\u2019s intention that a plaintiff in a negligence action be able to reallocate damages awarded against an insolvent defendant to other parties to the action whose negligence caused the plaintiffs injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The legislature has made clear that, as between a victim and the negligent defendants, it is the defendants who should bear the risk that a tortfeasor is insolvent. The state has not pointed to any provision of the language or legislative history of \u00a7 52-572h (g) that suggests that the legislature intended to exempt the state from reallocation of damages pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h (g), nor has our independent research uncovered any such authority. On the basis of the language, legislative history and lineage of \u00a7 52-572h, we conclude, therefore, that the reallocation provisions of \u00a7 52-572h (g) were intended to apply to the state in the same manner that they apply to every other defendant. Consequently, in an action brought against the state pursuant to \u00a7 52-556, the state is subject to the comparative negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>rales of \u00a7 52-572h, including the reallocation provisions of \u00a7 52-572h (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In conclusion, we note that, in situations in which the plaintiffs injuries were caused by the negligence of more than one party, the comparative negligence rales of \u00a7 52-572h benefit the defendants, as well as the plaintiff. Prior to 1986, under the rales of joint and several liability, when multiple defendants caused the plaintiffs injuries, the state could have been the \u201cdeep pocket\u201d defendant in an action brought against it pursuant to \u00a7 52-556. <em>See Fairbanks v. State, </em>supra, 143 Conn. 653. Under the comparative negligence statute, however, liability is apportioned among the tortfeasors, and each defendant is responsible to the plaintiff only for its proportionate share of recoverable damages. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (c). Although the state is subject to reallocation of damages pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h (g) when a codefendant is insolvent, its liability after reallocation often will be less, and never will exceed, its liability under the rales of joint and several liability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> *****9</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The reserved question is answered \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">No costs will be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-556 provides: \u201cAny person injured in person or property through the negligence of any state official or employee when operating a motor vehicle owned and insured by the state against personal injuries or property damage shall have a right of action against the state to recover damages for such injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h provides: \u201c(a) For the purposes of this section: (1) \u2018Economic damages\u2019 means compensation determined by the trier of fact for pecuniary losses including, but not limited to, the cost of reasonable and necessary medical care, rehabilitative services, custodial care and loss of earnings or earning capacity excluding any noneconomic damages; (2) \u2018noneconomic damages\u2019 means compensation determined by the trier of fact for all nonpecuniary losses including, but not limited to, physical pain and suffering and mental and emotional suffering; (3) \u2018recoverable economic damages\u2019 means the economic damages reduced by any applicable findings including but not limited to set-offs, credits, comparative negligence, additur and remittitur, and any reduction provided by section 52-225a; (4) \u2018recoverable noneconomic damages\u2019 means the noneconomic damages reduced by any applicable findings including but not limited to set-offs, credits, comparative negligence, additur and remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">\u201c(b) In causes of action based on negligence, contributory negligence shall not bar recovery in an action by any person or his legal representative to recover damages resulting from personal injury, wrongful death or damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>to property if the negligence was not greater than the combined negligence of the person or persons against whom recovery is sought including settled or released persons under subsection (n) of this section.
