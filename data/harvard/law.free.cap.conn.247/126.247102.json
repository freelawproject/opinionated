We conclude that it did and thus affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The relevant facts and procedural history are not disputed. The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the first district (commissioner) found that the plaintiff, Daniel Luce, suffered a compensable back injury on September 6,1991, while working for the named defendant, United Technologies Corporation/Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Division.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The commissioner also found that, as a result of the injury, the plaintiff had suffered a 20 percent permanent partial disability of his back. The plaintiff requested that the commissioner, in determining the plaintiffs average weekly wage under \u00a7 31-310, include the value of certain benefits, namely, medical insurance, dental insurance, life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, disability insurance, pension contributions, and vacation and sick pay.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commissioner denied the plaintiffs request and awarded compensation based solely on his weekly salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>The plaintiff thereafter filed a motion for articulation seeking a finding by the commissioner confirming the value of each of the fringe benefits that the plaintiff had maintained should be included in the determination of his average weekly wage under \u00a7 31-310.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff also filed a motion to correct the commissioner\u2019s decision, claiming that the award should have included the value of the fringe benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The commissioner denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The plaintiff appealed the commissioner\u2019s decision to the board on the ground that the commissioner improperly had failed to include the value of the fringe benefits in the calculation of the plaintiffs average weekly wage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The board affirmed the decision of the commissioner. <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>3080 CRB 1-95-6 (December 16, 1996). In rejecting the plaintiffs argument that the value of his insurance benefits and pension plan contributions should be included in his wage determination under \u00a7 31-310, the board relied on its decision in <em>Pascarelli </em>v. <em>Moliterno Stone Sales, Inc., </em>14 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 328, 332 (1995), aff'd, 44 Conn. App. 397, 689 A.2d 1132, cert. denied, 240 Conn. 926, 692 A.2d 1282 (1997), in which the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>had determined that because the term \u201cwage\u201d is not as broad as the term \u201cincome,\u201d the compensation wage rate does not include fringe benefits. Thereafter, the Appellate Court subsequently agreed with the board and held that because the definition of the term \u201cincome\u201d for purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act); General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq.; expressly included all forms of remuneration, including wages, accident and health insurance coverage, life insurance coverage and employee welfare plan contributions, the legislature, in using the term \u201cwages\u201d in General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-310 instead of the broader, more encompassing term \u201cincome,\u201d must have intended that insurance benefits and pension plan payments not be included in the calculation of an employee\u2019s wages under \u00a7 31-310.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Pascarelli </em>v. <em>Moliterno Stone Sales, Inc., </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 400. The board in the present case also reasoned that any requirement that the value of insurance benefits be included in the calculation of the plaintiffs average weekly wage would be inconsistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Greater Washington Board of Trade, </em>506 U.S. 125, 127, 113 S. Ct. 580, 121 L. Ed. 2d 513 (1992) (federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act [ERISA] preempts states from requiring private employers to provide health insurance benefits for injured employees eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Luis </em>v. <em>Frito-Lay, Inc., </em>Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Court, Docket No. SC 14536 (order, April 27, 1993) (in light of holding of <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Greater Washington Board of Trade, </em>supra, 125, requirement of General Statutes \u00a7 31-284b [a] that \u201cany employer who provides accident and health insurance or life insurance coverage for any employee or makes payments . . . for full-time employees to an employee welfare plan, shall provide to the employee equivalent insurance coverage or . . . contributions while the employee is . . . receiving compensation pursuant to this chapter\u201d is unenforceable against private employers); <em>Civardi </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>231 Conn. 287, 298-99 n.14, 649 A.2d 523 (1994) (same).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">As for vacation and sick pay, the board adopted the approach that it previously had employed in <em>Graziano </em>v. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, </em>11 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 10 (1993). In <em>Graziano, </em>the board held that vacation and sick pay <em>could </em>be included in an employee\u2019s average weekly wage calculation under \u00a7 31-310 if they were proven to be \u201cpayments dependent on hours worked or payments by way of compensation for hours worked or sums paid due to contractual or quasi-contractual obligations.\u201d Id., 13.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The board in the present case concluded, however, that because the commissioner had made no findings regarding the existence of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>one of these three prerequisites, the plaintiff was not entitled to the inclusion of either vacation or sick pay in the calculation of his average weekly wage under \u00a7 31-310.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The plaintiff here appealed from the decision of the board to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the board\u2019s decision in a per curiam opinion, stating that \u201c[t]his case is controlled by <em>Pascarelli </em>v. <em>Moliterno Stone Sales, Inc., </em>[supra, 44 Conn. App. 397].\u201d <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>47 Conn. App. 909, 701 A.2d 351 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification limited to the following question: \u201cWhether, under the circumstances of this case, the Appellate Court properly excluded from the calculation of the workers\u2019 compensation weekly benefit rate the value of the following forms of remuneration: medical, dental, life, accident/ death and dismemberment and disability insurances; pension benefits; vacation and sick pay?\u201d <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>243 Conn. 958, 704 A.2d 804 (1997). The plaintiff contends that he is entitled to the inclusion of these fringe benefits in the calculation of his average weekly wage because the term \u201cwages\u201d as used in \u00a7 31-310 includes such benefits. He also claims that the failure to do so violates his rights under the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. We disagree and affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">We first consider whether, as a matter of statutory construction, the term \u201cwages\u201d in \u00a7 31-310 includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>fringe benefits. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case .... In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carriero </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>243 Conn. 747, 753, 707 A.2d 706 (1998). \u201cIt is the duty of the court to interpret statutes as they are written; <em>Muha </em>v. <em>United Oil Co., </em>180 Conn. 720, 730, 433 A.2d 1009 (1980); and not by construction read into statutes provisions which are not clearly stated. <em>Glastonbury Co. </em>v. <em>Gillies, </em>209 Conn. 175, 179, 550 A.2d 8 (1988).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>227 Conn. 534, 542, 630 A.2d 1059 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">We address first the question of whether the legislature intended to include insurance and pension benefits in the calculation of an employee\u2019s wages for purposes of \u00a7 31-310. The term \u201cwages\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 31-310 or anywhere else in the act. The term \u201cincome\u201d is defined, however, under \u00a7 31-284b (a)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to include <em>all </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>forms of remuneration to an individual from his employment, <em>including wages </em>and other benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In <em>Pascarelli </em>v. <em>Moliterno Stone Sales, Inc., </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 397, the Appellate Court considered whether the employer\u2019s contributions to the employee\u2019s pension, health and welfare fund, and his annuity, properly should be included in the calculation of his average weekly wage under General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-310. The court concluded that \u201c[a]t the time of the [employee\u2019s] injury [in 1989], income was defined in \u00a7 31-275 (14)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to include wages, accident and health insurance coverage, life insurance coverage and employee welfare plan contributions. Section 31-310, however, provided that in order to calculate the claimant\u2019s average weekly wage and base compensation rate, wages received by an employee during the twenty-six weeks prior to the date of injury are to be used. . . . From the use of the term wages instead of income in \u00a7 31-310, it is clear that the legislature intended that fringe benefits remuneration, such as health coverage and employee welfare plan contributions, were not to be included in calculating the [employee\u2019s] base compensation rate.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pascarelli </em>v. <em>Moliterno Stone Sales, Inc., </em>supra, 399-400. Accordingly, the Appellate Court affirmed the decision of the board that the employee\u2019s base wage should not be expanded to include the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>employer\u2019s pension, health and welfare fund, and annuity contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The plaintiff does not seriously dispute either the logic or the holding of the Appellate Court in <em>Pascarelli </em>v. <em>Moliterno Stone Sales, Inc., </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 397. He maintains, instead, that <em>Pascarelli </em>is inapposite to the present case because the definition of the term \u201cincome\u201d that was dispositive of the issue in that case is not applicable here in view of the fact that, in 1991, the legislature amended \u00a7 31-275 by removing the definition of \u201cincome\u201d from that statutory section and placing it in \u00a7 31-284b.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that, because the definitional provision of \u00a7 31-284b (a) includes the prefatory language \u201c[a]s used in this section\u201d; see footnote 12 of this opinion; the definition of income contained therein is applicable only to <em>that </em>statutory section, and not to the act generally or to \u00a7 31-310 specifically. Consequently, the plaintiff asserts, the definition of \u201cincome\u201d under \u00a7 31-284b (a) is not determinative of the meaning of \u201cwages\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 31-310.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">This argument might be persuasive were it not for the fact that an examination of the legislative history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>of Public Acts 1991, No. 91-32, leads convincingly to a contrary conclusion. \u201cThis court has previously examined the legislative history of No. 91-32 of the 1991 Public Acts and determined that it was intended to be a technical amendment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 393-94, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993). \u201cIn commenting on the bill on the floor of the Senate, Senator James H. Maloney, senate chairman of the joint standing committee on labor and public employees, described the bill as \u2018the bill that makes technical recodification of the Workers\u2019 Compensation statute\u2019 and that \u2018cleans up the statute in regard to Workers\u2019 Compensation.\u2019 34 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1991 Sess., p. 836. Similarly, in presiding over a hearing of the joint standing committee, Maloney described the bill as \u2018a technical revision in [e]ffect to the existing statute.\u2019 Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Public Employees, 1991 Sess., p. 16. He went on to state: \u2018So we\u2019re not really dealing with changes in the substantive legislation today. If there are substantive changes that are made because of the draft, we do want to hear about that because that\u2019s not what\u2019s supposed to have occurred with this instrument.\u2019 Id. Commissioner John Arcudi of the compensation review division, who participated in formulating the proposed revisions, also testified at the hearing that \u2018the puipose of the bill [was] not to change substance, but to try to simplify language and eliminate archaic language, reduce language if possible . . . .\u2019 Id., p. 17. Finally, in commenting on the bill on the House floor, Representative Joseph A. Adamo, house chairman of the joint standing committee on labor and public employees, stated that the bill \u2018brings into focus a new section of describing all the definitions that were utilized and sprinkled throughout the entire chapter.\u2019 34 H.R. Proc., Pt. 5, 1991 Sess., pp. 1959-60.\u201d <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>223 Conn. 336, 346-47, 612 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>1203 (1992). Consistent with these observations regarding the purely technical nature of Public Act 91-32, there is nothing in the legislative history of that public act to indicate that the legislature, in moving the definition of \u201cincome\u201d from one statutory section to another without any material modification, intended any change in its import or effect.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Moreover, \u201c[i]n construing the act . . . this court makes every part operative and harmonious with every other part insofar as is possible. ... In addition, the statute must be considered as a whole, with a view toward reconciling its separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation. . . . <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Best Cleaners, Inc., </em>237 Conn. 490, 499, 677 A.2d 1356 (1996).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Innocent </em>v. <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Medical Center, </em>243 Conn. 513, 518, 705 A.2d 200 (1998). Therefore, the meaning of a term, \u201cwhere practical, should be applied consistently throughout the act.\u201d Id. The legislature, in defining the term \u201cincome\u201d under \u00a7 31-284b, evinced an intent to distinguish between wages and income. We see no cogent reason why that distinction is not equally applicable for purposes of \u00a7 31-310.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In addition, although the interpretation of statutes is ultimately a question of law subject to our plenary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>review, we are obliged to give consideration to the board\u2019s construction of \u00a7 31-310, especially in view of the fact that the issue before us previously has been subject to scrutiny by the Appellate Court in <em>Pascarelli </em>v. <em>Moliterno Stone Sales, Inc., </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 397. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>232 Conn. 311, 317, 654 A.2d 1221 (1995) (board\u2019s construction of statute not entitled to special deference unless its determination of question of law previously has been subject of judicial review). The board, which obviously has special expertise in workers\u2019 compensation matters, consistently has rejected claims that insurance and pension benefits are included in the calculation of an employee\u2019s average weekly wage under \u00a7 31-310. See, e.g., <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Devcon Enterprises, Inc., </em>15 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 362 (1996) (medical insurance not included in determining average weekly wage); <em>Pascarelli </em>v. <em>Moliterno Stone Sales, Inc., </em>supra, 14 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 328 (employer contributions to employee\u2019s pension, health and welfare fund, and annuity not included in calculation of average weekly wage).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Furthermore, we agree with the board that to allow insurance benefits to be included in the calculation of wages would run afoul of the holding of <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Greater Washington Board of Trade, </em>supra, 506 U.S. 129-30, that \u201cERISA preempts any state law that refers to or has a connection with covered benefit plans (and that does not fall within [an] exception) even if the law is not specifically designed to affect such plans, or the effect is only indirect . . . and even if the law is consistent with ERISA\u2019s substantive requirements . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) As the board recently has stated, \u201cwe would be disregarding the spirit of . . . the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Greater Washington Board of Trade, </em>[supra, 125], if we were to hold that the claimant should be provided with compensation equivalent to the value of the insurance coverage that \u00a7 31-284b provides. This would allow the claimant to circumvent the fact that \u00a7 31-284b can not constitutionally be applied to him by effectively requiring the employer to pay the premium directly to the claimant instead, whereupon he could pass it on to the health insurer to maintain his coverage. [We] cannot sanction that result.\u201d <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Devcon Enterprises, Inc., </em>supra, 15 Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Our conclusion, moreover, is reinforced by relevant scholarly commentary. For example, Professor Arthur Larson, in his treatise on workers\u2019 compensation law, states: \u201cWorkers\u2019 compensation has been in force in the United States for over seventy years, and fringe benefits have been a common feature of American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>industrial life for most of that period. Millions of compensation benefits have been paid during this time. Whether paid voluntarily or in contested and adjudicated cases, they have always begun with a wage basis calculation that made \u2018wage\u2019 mean the \u2018wages\u2019 that the worker lives on and not miscellaneous \u2018values\u2019 that may or may not someday have a value to [him or her] depending on a number of uncontrollable contingencies. Before a single court takes it on itself to say, \u2018We now tell you that, although you didn\u2019t know it, you have all been wrongly calculating wage basis in these millions of cases, and so now, after seventy years, we are pleased to announce that we have discovered the true meaning of wage that somehow eluded the rest of you for seven decades,\u2019 that court would do well to undertake a much more penetrating analysis ... of why this revelation was denied to everyone else for so long.\u201d 5 A. Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1997) \u00a7 60.12 (b), pp. 10-664 through 10-665.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Finally, our determination that \u201cwages\u201d under \u00a7 31-310 does not include insurance and pension benefits is consistent with the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Morrison-Knudsen Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>461 U.S. 624, 630, 103 S. Ct. 2045, 76 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1983), in which the court held that employer contributions to a union trust fund are not considered \u201cwages\u201d as defined in \u00a7 2 (13) of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (compensation act), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court in <em>Morrison-Knudsen Construction Co. </em>concluded that the contributions did not constitute \u201cmoney . . . recompensed\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>\u201cgratuities received . . . from others,\u201d nor were they a \u201csimilar advantage\u201d to \u201cboard, rent, housing, [or] lodging,\u201d because board, rent, housing and lodging are present benefits whose cash value can be ascertained readily, whereas the present value of the trust funds cannot be converted easily into a cash equivalent. Id. The court rejected the claimant\u2019s argument that the market value of the benefits could be calculated either by the employer\u2019s cost to maintain them or by the employee\u2019s expectation interests in them. Id., 630-31. Instead, the court concluded that the employer\u2019s cost was irrelevant because it failed to measure the employee\u2019s benefit, inasmuch as the employee could not spend the amount his employer paid for his benefits on the open market to obtain benefits similar to the group policies he received at work. Id., 630.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Supreme Court concluded that the legislative history of the compensation act, its structure, and the consistent policies of the agency responsible for its enforcement supported its conclusion that the term \u201cwages\u201d did not include fringe benefits. Id., 632.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> For similar reasons of statutory construction, we reject the plaintiffs contention that he is entitled to the inclusion of his insurance and pension benefits in the calculation of his wage under \u00a7 31-310.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">We turn briefly to the plaintiffs assertion that vacation and sick pay also should be included in the calculation of an employee\u2019s average weekly wage. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>plaintiff, in maintaining that all of his fringe benefits are includable under \u00a7 31-310, has failed to explain why vacation and sick pay should be distinguished from other forms of remuneration, such as insurance and pension benefits, which we have determined do not constitute wages for purposes of \u00a7 31-310.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In light of the plaintiffs failure to analyze vacation and sick pay separately, we are not required to review the issue. See, e.g., <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. Giacomi, 242 Conn. 17, 44-45, 699 A.2d 101 (1997) (appellate court not required to review claim that has not been sufficiently developed). Accordingly, we leave that question for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The plaintiff also maintains, in the alternative, that excluding his fringe benefits from the calculation of his average weekly wage violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Specifically, he contends that: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>no rational basis exists for denying injured employees the cash equivalent of such benefits because employees who are not injured continue to receive those benefits; and (2) even if the exclusion of the benefits is rationally based, the statutory scheme cannot be justified because it discriminates on the basis of marital status, which, the plaintiff contends, is a suspect classification that gives rise to strict scrutiny of the scheme, a standard that the plaintiff asserts cannot be met. We reject both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u201cIn order to analyze the constitutionality of [the challenged statutory scheme], we must first detail the principles applicable to equal protection analysis. When a statute is challenged on equal protection grounds, whether under the United States constitution or the Connecticut constitution, the reviewing court must first determine the standard by which the challenged statute\u2019s constitutional validity will be determined. If, in distinguishing between classes, the statute either intrudes on the exercise of a fundamental right or burdens a suspect class of persons, the court will apply a strict scrutiny standard wherein the state must demonstrate that the challenged statute is necessary to the achievement of a compelling state interest. ... If the statute does not touch upon either a fundamental right or a suspect class, its classification need only be rationally related to some legitimate government purpose in order to withstand an equal protection challenge. . . . <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>234 Conn. 455, 477, 662 A.2d 1226 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Florestal </em>v. <em>Government Employees Ins.

In general, the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification, see <em>United States Railroad Retirement [Board] </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>449 U.S. 166, 174, 179 [101 S. Ct. 453, 66 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1980), reh. denied, 450 U.S. 960, 101 S. Ct. 1421, 67 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1981)], the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the government decisionmaker, see <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </em>449 U.S. 456, 464 [101 S. Ct. 715, 66 L. Ed. 2d 659, reh. denied, 450 U.S. 1027, 101 S. Ct. 1735, 68 L. Ed. 2d 222] (1981), and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational, see <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em>[473 U.S. 432, 446, 105 S.

Thus, \u201c \u2018equal protection is not a license for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choices. In areas of social and economic policy, a statutory classification that neither proceeds along suspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitutional rights must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\u2019 \u201d <em>D.A.

In part I A of this opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>we already have enumerated a number of the legitimate reasons for doing so that were set forth in <em>Morrison-Knudsen Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>supra, 461 U.S. 624, including the efficient administration of the workers\u2019 compensation system.

In the absence of anything in the record to support that assertion, we need not analyze the plaintiffs argument further to reject his claim that the legislative determination to exclude certain benefits from the calculation of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>employee\u2019s average weekly wage impermissibly discriminates on the basis of marital status.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C.

Although we agree with the plaintiff that the act must be construed liberally to effectuate its beneficent purpose; see, e.g., <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Sherwood Industries, Inc., </em>244 Conn. 502, 511, 710 A.2d 1138 (1998); <em>Muldoon </em>v. <em>Homestead Insulation Co., </em>231 Conn. 469, 483, 650 A.2d 1240 (1994); we are not free to accomplish a result that is contrary to the intent of the legislature as expressed in the act\u2019s plain language.

See General Statutes \u00a7 31-310 (b). If we were to accept the plaintiffs argument that fringe benefits are included in the average weekly wage, the chairperson of the commission would be required to evaluate the benefit provisions for all employees in the state. It is highly unlikely that the legislature intended to place an administrative burden of this nature on the commission chairperson. Moreover, if the legislature had intended to do so, it surely would have done so more explicitly.

I agree with Justice Berdon that the value of fringe benefits are, by today\u2019s common understanding, really part of employee compensation. I also agree that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act looks overall to protect the injured worker\u2019s real compensation. It is not our province, however, under the guise of statutory interpretation, to legislate a broader definition of \u201cwages\u201d than has the legislature. We were not appointed to be social engineers, and should leave policy decisions to the legislature. <em>Claremont School District </em>v. <em>Governor, </em>142 N.H. 462, 477-78, 703 A.2d 1353 (1997) (Horton, J., dissenting).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b170-8\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A4p\">dissenting. The failure to include the value of medical insurance, dental insurance, life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, disability insurance, pension contribution, and vacation and sick pay \u2014 in this case, valued at $170.12 per week\u2014 in calculating the plaintiffs average weekly wage for workers\u2019 compensation benefits does not make sense. Simply put, the value of the fringe benefits is just as much a part of an employee\u2019s wages as the cash the employee receives at the end of the week. For example, there is no practical difference between an employee who is paid $670.12 per week, but is not provided with any of the former fringe benefits, and a second employee who is paid $500 per week, but receives all of the foregoing fringe benefits valued at $170.12 per week. In both cases, the employee\u2019s actual weekly earnings is $670.12. Any employer who provides fringe benefits will verify this. According to the majority, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the compensation rate for the first employee is more than the compensation rate of the second employee. With all due respect to Professor Larson, mistakes and illogic perpetuated for seventy years, do not justify its continuance. 5 A.

Our precedent clearly provides that these fringe benefits should be included as part of an employee\u2019s compensation. See <em>Thibeault </em>v. <em>General Outdoor Advertising Co., </em>114 Conn. 410, 414, 158 A. 912 (1932) (allowances made to employee for board and lodging while away from home may, under certain circumstances, be considered earnings in determining compensation under Workers\u2019 Compensation Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Furthermore, the majority\u2019s conclusion runs contrary to the liberal construction we must give to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. \u201cIt is well established that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is remedial in nature and that it should be broadly construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose. . . . Construing the statute liberally advances its underlying purpose of providing financial protection for injured workers and their dependents.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Crook </em>v. <em>Academy Drywall Co., </em>219 Conn. 28, 32, 591 A.2d 429 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Finally, contrary to the majority opinion, including the value of these fringe benefits in the calculation of the plaintiffs average wages would not be inconsistent with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Greater Washington Board of Trade, </em>506 U.S. 125, 129-31, 113 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Ct. 580, 121 L.

In <em>Greater Washington Board of Trade, </em>the United States Supreme Court ruled that the District of Columbia\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law requiring employers who provide health insurance coverage to provide equivalent coverage to employees who are receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits was preempted by ERISA.
