Specifically, the parties disagree as to whether (1) a pretrial conference in judicial chambers, or (2) a subsequent hearing in open court on a motion to <em>enforce </em>a settlement agreement, constitutes such a hearing. We conclude that neither meets the requirements of the hearing mandated by \u00a7 8-8 (n). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court enforcing the settlement agreement in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The plaintiff, Willimantic Car Wash, Inc., contests the decision of the zoning board of appeals of the town of Windham (board), one of two defendants in the present case, in which the board reversed a determination by the town\u2019s zoning officer and granted T &amp; G Realty, Inc. (T &amp; G), the other defendant, a certificate of zoning compliance (zoning certificate). The zoning certificate would permit T &amp; G\u2019s lessee, Putnam Car Wash, Inc., to operate a car wash on T &amp; G\u2019s property located in Windham. The plaintiff and Putnam Car Wash are business competitors. As required by law,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>held a public hearing before rendering its decision granting a zoning certificate to T &amp; G.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court from the board\u2019s decision, asserting, among other things, claims of unfair competition, lack of due process and environmental harm. The trial court, <em>Hon. Joseph F. Dannehy, </em>judge trial referee, held pretrial settlement discussions with representatives of the plaintiff, T &amp; G and Putnam Car Wash. The board was represented at the first of those conferences, but did not participate thereafter. The representatives of the plaintiff, T &amp; G and Putnam Car Wash subsequently met with and reported to the court, <em>Dannehy, J., </em>that they had reached a settlement agreement privately, pursuant to which the owner of Putnam Car Wash agreed to pay $50,000 to the plaintiff and the plaintiff agreed to withdraw its zoning appeal. Judge Dannehy canvassed everyone present.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although all agreed that a settlement had been reached on stipulated terms, the agreement was not placed on the record because no court reporter was then available. Approximately one month later, the owner of Putnam Car Wash attempted to withdraw from the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The plaintiff moved to enforce the settlement and, after a hearing on the motion, the trial court, <em>Martin, J., </em>decided that the settlement was enforceable, granted the plaintiffs motion and rendered judgment accordingly. T &amp; G appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>On appeal, T &amp; G raises four challenges to the decision of the trial court, <em>Martin, J. </em>T &amp; G claims that the trial court, <em>Martin, J., </em>improperly held the settlement to be enforceable because: (1) the trial court, <em>Dannehy, J., </em>never held a hearing on the settlement, as required by \u00a7 8-8 (n); (2) the court, <em>Dannehy, J., </em>did not have authority under \u00a7 8-8 <em>(J) </em>to approve a zoning appeal settlement involving monetary consideration;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ****6 (3) T &amp; G never agreed to the settlement; and (4) the settlement was not clear and unambiguous owing to its omission of significant terms and conditions. Because we agree with T &amp; G\u2019s contention that the failure to hold a hearing on the settlement, as required by \u00a7 8-8 (n), left the settlement unenforceable, we do not reach the other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court from the board\u2019s decision pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 8-8 (n) requires that no such appeal \u201cshall be withdrawn and no settlement between the parties to any such appeal shall be effective unless and until a hearing has been held before the Superior Court and such court has approved such proposed withdrawal or settlement.\u201d T &amp; G contends that the alleged settlement agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>was not enforceable because the trial court did not hold the hearing on the settlement that the statute requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The parties do not dispute the finding of the trial court, <em>Martin, J., </em>that the trial court, <em>Dannehy, J., </em>never held the required hearing before approving the settlement agreement. The plaintiff asserts, however, that the hearing requirement was fulfilled because either of two proceedings can be considered the functional equivalent of the required hearing. The plaintiff maintains that the pretrial conference before Judge Dannehy served as the requisite hearing because the plaintiff and one of the defendants, T &amp; G, were present and consented to the agreement, and the other defendant, the board, had chosen not to take part in pretrial conferences subsequent to the initial meeting. Alternatively, the plaintiff contends that the hearing before the trial court, <em>Martin, J., </em>on the present motion to <em>enforce </em>the settlement was the functional equivalent of the required hearing, because all the parties were then present and the settlement agreement was analyzed thoroughly. We disagree with both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">STATUTORY POLICY</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Section 8-8 (n) does not specify the nature of the hearing that it requires. We begin, therefore, by considering the term \u201chearing\u201d according to its common, generally understood meaning. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We consistently have acknowledged the definition of a hearing provided in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, as \u201c[a] proceeding of relative formality . . . generally public, with definite issues of fact or of law to be tried, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>which witnesses are heard and evidence presented,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and in which parties to a dispute have a right to be heard. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990); see <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Division of Special Revenue, </em>193 Conn. 379, 383, 477 A.2d 119 (1984); <em>Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>173 Conn. 462, 469-70, 378 A.2d 547 (1977); see also <em>Trost </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>242 Conn. 335, 336, 340, 698 A.2d 832 (1997) (construing same language of \u00a7 8-8 [n] in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43 [c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">At the same time, the term \u201chearing\u201d leaves room for flexibility in responding to variations in the required due process. Not all situations call for the same level of procedural safeguards. <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Krause, </em>209 Conn. 352, 376, 551 A.2d 710 (1988), quoting H. Friendly, \u201cSome Kind of Hearing,\u201d 123 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1267, 1270 (1975), observing that the term \u201chearing,\u201d is \u201ca verbal coat of many colors.\u201d The role of the hearing required in the present circumstances is to respect and enforce the overall statutory scheme governing the zoning and planning process.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Hearings feature prominently in the zoning process because land use decisions are quintessentially decisions impacting the public. See <em>Couch </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>141 Conn. 349, 356-57, 106 A.2d 173 (1954) (observing that \u201cthe alteration of zonal boundaries may seriously affect the property rights of those owning land within or near the area involved\u201d). Zoning regulation represents the common decision of the people \u201cto serve the common social and economic needs . . . for their mutual advantage and welfare . . . .\u201d 1 E. Yokley, Zoning Law and Practice (4th Ed. 1978) \u00a7 2-1, p. 15. The statute authorizing local zoning regulation, the gist of which is that zoning regulations must promote the public welfare and be expressive of a comprehensive plan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>reflects this community of purpose.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Couch </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 353-54; <em>Fairlawns Cemetery Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>138 Conn. 434, 439, 86 A.2d 74 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Because of the public impact of land use decisions, Connecticut\u2019s governing statutory scheme promotes public participation in such decision making, and particularly provides for public hearings with substantial procedural safeguards. We have recognized that, \u201c[h]earings play an essential role in the scheme of zoning and in its development. 1 Yokley, Zoning Law &amp; Practice (2d Ed.) p. 267. They furnish a method of showing to the commission the real effect of the proposed change upon the social and economic life of the community. Id., p. 268. Hearings likewise provide the necessary forum for those whose properties will be affected by a change to register their approval or disapproval and to state the reasons therefor.\u201d <em>Couch </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 141 Conn. 357. Thus, a municipality must hold a public hearing with specified procedural protections before establishing zoning regulations authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 8-2;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 11 and a local zoning board of appeals reviewing the decision of a municipal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>zoning officer must hold an open hearing, in order to \u201cafford an opportunity to interested parties to make known their views and to enable the board to be guided by them.\u201d <em>Kleinsmith </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>157 Conn. 303, 311, 254 A.2d 486 (1968); see General Statutes \u00a7 8-7.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The statutory scheme provides for substantial procedural protections at the latter hearing, including notice requirements,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> time limits for commencing the hearing and for rendering all decisions, and requirements that a record be made.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Zoning decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>made by local entities without holding a required hearing have been held to be void. See <em>Vose </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>171 Conn. 480, 486, 370 A.2d 1026 (1976) (plan of resubdivision); <em>State ex rel. Brodie </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>168 Conn. 512, 514, 362 A.2d 884 (1975) (amendment of zoning regulations).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The Appellate Court has recognized the policy of protecting the public interest by holding open hearings prior to Superior Court approval of a settlement of a land use appeal. <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>25 Conn. App. 199, 203, 594 A.2d 9 (1991); <em>Sendak </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>7 Conn. App. 238, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>243 &amp; n. 1, 508 A.2d 781 (1986). The court has explained: \u201cThe purpose of the statute is to ensure that zoning matters can be scrutinized by the public by means of a public record. \u201d <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 203. The requirements of a hearing and of court approval serve to protect the integrity of the land use planning process by prohibiting side or secret settlements by parties once there has been an appeal to the Superior Court. Id.; <em>Sendak </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 243 and n.1.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> If, after appealing to the Superior Court, the parties could settle their dispute without the participation of the board and without a public hearing with formal procedural protections, the underlying statutory policy of protecting the public interest would be at risk.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">PRETRIAL CONFERENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">In the present case, the plaintiff argues that the pretrial conference, at which T &amp; G, the plaintiff and Putnam Car Wash reported their settlement and its terms to Judge Dannehy, could constitute the hearing mandated by \u00a7 8-8 (n). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">The trial court, <em>Martin, J., </em>found the settlement agreement enforceable, despite the failure to hold an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>antecedent hearing, because all the participants in the pretrial meeting, including T &amp; G\u2019s duly authorized representatives, had agreed to the settlement. The court reasoned that a court may enforce an oral agreement made by the parties or their duly authorized representatives. Because this case is a zoning appeal, however, courts have the additional mandate to ensure that the public interest is protected. Thus, despite any congruence of minds among the litigants, we cannot ignore the statutory directive that the trial court must hold a healing before the settlement becomes effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The pretrial conference, itself, did not constitute the hearing mandated by \u00a7 8-8 (n). As a matter of fact, one of the defendants, the board, was not present at the hearing. Although on appeal to this court, the board subsequently supported the view that the pretrial conference was a hearing, it is possible both here and in other cases that a board may well decline to participate in pretrial conference discussions, expecting, with good reason, that if a settlement were reached, a public hearing on the settlement would follow. It is undisputed that the conference was not open to the public. Under these circumstances, as a matter of law, the pretrial conference failed to protect the public interest that the statutory scheme is designed to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Furthermore, there is no indication that the pretrial conference had the basic procedural protections of the hearing that \u00a7 8-8 (n) requires. No record was made of the pretrial meeting. Indeed, the present dispute over the existence of an agreement arose at least partly because of the lack of such a record. Moreover, there is no indication of other formal protections, such as the parties\u2019 right to present evidence or to confront and cross-examine witnesses. In light of the underlying goal of protecting the public interest, we conclude that the pretrial conference was not the hearing required by \u00a7 8-8 (n).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">ENFORCEMENT HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The plaintiff asserts alternatively that the trial court hearing before Judge Martin, on the present motion to enforce the alleged agreement, fulfilled the hearing requirement. This argument also fails. An enforcement hearing subsequent to a settlement complies neither with the text of \u00a7 8-8 (n) nor with the public policy reflected by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Section 8-8 (n) mandates that \u201cno settlement between the parties . . . shall be effective unless and until a hearing has been held before the Superior Court.\u201d Although the hearing on the enforcement motion may have afforded formal procedural protections, the issues before the trial court on the motion to enforce a previous settlement were not the same as those involved in evaluating whether to approve a proposed settlement implicating the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">The plaintiff argues that the hearing was functionally equivalent to a hearing on whether to approve the settlement, because the settlement was thoroughly analyzed and the hearing provided ample opportunity for anyone whose interests might be affected to be heard. The subject matter of the enforcement motion, however, limited the scope of the parties\u2019 arguments and the trial court\u2019s adjudication. In deciding whether to <em>enforce </em>the settlement, the court was required to consider only T &amp; G\u2019s arguments that the settlement sought to bind nonparties, that the parties had not reached a definitive agreement, and that the required antecedent hearing had not been held. In approving a settlement affecting the public interest, in contrast, a trial court \u201cmust be satisfied of the fairness of the settlement.\u201d <em>Janus Films, Inc. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>801 F.2d 578, 582 (2d Cir. 1986).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>The difference between the issues of law and fact tried at the enforcement hearing and those pertinent to a hearing on whether to approve the settlement is so significant that one hearing may not be substituted for another. We need not articulate the full range of issues relevant to considering the fairness of a land use settlement. Even if they were in some way addressed at the enforcement hearing, an after-the-fact review is an inadequate substitute for a plenary hear ing. Potential representatives of the public interest might well have failed to recognize the importance of contesting a motion to enforce the settlement. Because the statute serves to protect the public in the land use process, it requires a hearing antecedent to judicial approval of a settlement of a zoning appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">We conclude that the trial court, <em>Martin, J., </em>improperly determined that the settlement agreement was enforceable. A contrary holding would circumvent the legislative policy, contained in \u00a7 8-8 (n), that a hearing and court approval, antecedent to a settlement becoming effective, provide the best way to preserve the integrity and openness of land use proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, BERDON and NORCOTT, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201c[A]ny person aggrieved by any decision of a board may take an appeal to the superior court for the judicial district in which the municipality is located. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b758-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (n) provides: \u201cNo appeal taken under subsection (b) of this section shall be withdrawn and no settlement between the parties to any such appeal shall be effective unless and until a hearing has been held before the Superior Court and such court has approved such proposed withdrawal or settlement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b758-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-7 provides in relevant part: \u201cAn appeal may be taken to the zoning board of appeals by any person aggrieved or by any officer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>department, board or bureau of any municipality aggrieved ....

I agree with the result reached by, and with most of the reasoning of, the majority opinion. I part company with the majority, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>however, on one subsidiary point: the majority\u2019s assertion that \u201c[i]n approving a settlement affecting the public interest ... a trial court \u2018must be satisfied of the fairness of the settlement.\u2019 <em>Janus Films, Inc. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>801 F.2d 578, 582 (2d Cir. 1986).\u201d In my view, it is not necessary on this record to elaborate on the substance of what a trial court must find in order to approve a settlement under General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (n). Furthermore, I am not persuaded either (1) that the principle articulated in the case relied upon by the majority for its assertion applies to the statute at issue in the present case, or (2) that the legislative history cited by the majority necessarily supports the assertion. I decline, therefore, to join that part of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">First, it is not necessary to decide in this case what a court must determine <em>substantively </em>in order to approve a settlement of a zoning appeal pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (n). It is clear that the settlement conference held by Judge Dannehy was not a \u201chearing\u201d required by the statute. It was not a public proceeding and there was no official record of it available to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">It is equally clear that the subsequent hearing before Judge Martin could not serve as \u00e1 surrogate for the hearing required by \u00a7 8-8 (n). The hearing before Judge Martin rested on the premise, asserted by the plaintiff who moved for its enforcement, that there had been a \u201csettlement\u201d and, therefore, that the questions before the court were whether: (1) the defendant was correct in its assertion that it never had agreed to the settlement; (2) the settlement was too vague to be enforceable; and (3) the settlement went beyond the jurisdiction of the court in a zoning appeal by awarding damages. Thus, this hearing at its inception rested on the premise of an antecedent settlement. The primary purpose of \u00a7 8-8 (n), however, is to require a hearing <em>before </em>any settlement is approved by the court. The parties may not collapse the requirement of a hearing under \u00a7 8-8 (n) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>into a subsequent hearing on the enforcement of a settlement that never was approved in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">This is as far as it is necessary and appropriate to go, in my view, in order to decide this case. This record simply does not present the question of whether, if a proper hearing <em>is </em>convened pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (n) to review a proposed settlement, the court must delve into the substance of the settlement in order affirmatively to decide that it is \u201cfair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Second, the case cited by the majority, <em>Janus Films, Inc. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 801 F.2d 578, does not support the proposition that, in reviewing a settlement under \u00a7 8-8 (n), a court must determine that the settlement is fair. As an initial matter, that case does not involve a zoning appeal, and certainly, therefore, does not purport to construe our Connecticut zoning settlement statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, the entire passage from which the language relied on by the majority \u2014 \u201ca trial court \u2018must be satisfied of the fairness of the settlement\u2019 \u201d \u2014 concerns those situations in which the court is deciding \u201cto approve agreements calling for entry of either <em>a consent judgment or a settlement judgment . . . </em>.\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) <em>Janus Films, Inc. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 582. Those are cases in which the court actually renders a judgment in accordance with the consent or settlement of the parties. This is not such a case, and \u00a7 8-8 (n) does not necessarily require similar judicial oversight. Indeed, as the court in <em>Janus Films, Inc., </em>noted, under federal judicial rules a \u201csettlement judgment\u201d is not really what we would under our rules regard as a settlement; it involves, by contrast, a situation in which \u201cthe parties have agreed only upon the basic aspect of relief, [and] the judge is obliged to determine the detailed terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>the relief and the wording of the judgment.\u201d Id. As far as I know, we have no comparable procedure under our rules of practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The cases on which <em>Janus Films, Inc., </em>relied for its proposition have no bearing on the scope of inquiry that a Connecticut court must undertake when approving a settlement pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (n). Without belaboring the point, it suffices to say that they all involve cases in which there is either some federal statute, rule or other specific authority requiring the court to adjudicate the fairness of a consent judgment or settlement agreement. See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>711 F.2d 161, 163 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (settlement agreement embodied in consent judgment under Title VII of federal Civil Rights Act); <em>High </em>v. <em>Braniff Airways, Inc., </em>592 F.2d 1330, 1332 (5th Cir. 1979) (consent decree in class action for employment discrimination under Title VII of federal Civil Rights Act); <em>Pettway </em>v. <em>American Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>576 F.2d 1157, 1165 (5th Cir. 1978) (settlement agreement in class action for employment discrimination under Title VII of federal Civil Rights Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The Appellate Court has stated that the \u201cpurpose of [\u00a7 8-8 (n)] is to ensure that zoning matters can be scrutinized by the public by means of a public record.\u201d <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>25 Conn. App. 199, 203, 594 A.2d 9 (1991); see also <em>Sendak </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>7 Conn. App. 238, 243 n.1, 508 A.2d 781 (1986) (purpose of statute is to recognize competing interests, \u201clegitimacy of settlement of zoning cases and the need for judicial scrutiny in order to avoid abuse of the [zoning] process\u201d). Neither of these statements of statutory purpose necessarily suggests an additional obligation on the reviewing court to rule on the substantive fairness of a zoning settlement. So long as the court is satisfied, on the basis of a public hearing on the public record, that the settlement was entered into fairly \u2014 a different question from whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>it is substantively fair to all parties<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 ordinarily the court\u2019s task under \u00a7 8-8 (n) would be at an end.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In zoning cases, generally all parties are represented by counsel, and the parties and their counsel are best situated to decide the merits of their settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Third, I am not persuaded that the scant legislative history<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of \u00a7 8-8 (n) supports the majority\u2019s assertion. See footnote 4 of this opinion for the entirety of the relevant portion of that history. It is true that Representative Richard D. Tulisano used language suggestive of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>an inquiry into the substantive fairness of the proposed settlement. 27 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1984 Sess., p. 3781 (\u201cto make sure any settlements are fair, and [havejn\u2019t been . . . unfair to either party involved\u201d). The context of those remarks, however, renders them also consistent with an inquiry solely into the procedural fairness of the settlement. That context is as follows: \u201cThe purpose for the language in this bill is to assure that there is no surreptitious dealing, either between some members of boards of zoning, zoning boards and applicants, or that some people will take in effect the frivolous appeal, as a title to use . . . their leverage .... [T]his is to make sure any settlements are fair, and [have] n\u2019t been used as leverage, and unfair to either party involved.\u201d Id., p. 3781, remarks of Representative Tulisano. In my view, this legislative history is at best ambiguous regarding whether the trial court must consider the substantive fairness of a settlement under the statute, because the \u201cunfairness\u201d to which Representative Tulisano referred could well have been procedural unfairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">I readily admit that usually I am quite willing to draw inferences of legislative purpose from legislative history. See, <em>e.g., Frillici v. Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 429, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). That willingness, however, is tempered by the understanding that the legislative history must be viewed with circumspection. Otherwise, we will give validity to the witticism of Judge Harold Leventhal that \u201cthe use of legislative history [is] the equivalent of entering a crowded cocktail party and looking over the heads of the guests for one\u2019s friends.\u201d <em>Conroy </em>v. <em>Aniskoff, </em>507 U.S. 511, 519, 113 S. Ct. 1562, 123 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring). Although I do not regard the majority\u2019s use of this legislative history as falling within that category, I also do not regard the history as particularly illuminating on the question of the substantive scope of the court\u2019s inquiry under \u00a7 8-8 (n).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\"> <em>Janus Films, Inc. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 801 F.2d 578, involved an attempt to set aside a \u201csettlement judgment\u201d under the federal rules involving the copyright laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b773-6\"> Presumably, an inquiry into the substantive fairness of the settlement would require some sort of determination of the strength of the various claims asserted by all of the parties to the zoning appeal. We need not decide in this case whether the legislature had such a searching inquiry in mind when it enacted \u00a7 8-8 (n). I would await a case that presents that question, which this case does not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\"> I would not, preclude the possibility of a court declining to approve a settlement thatit was convinced was grossly unfair to the public. Itis hard to imagine such a scenario accompanied by the concomitant determination that the settlement was entered into fairly, however, because presumably the zoning agency, which ordinarily represents the public, also would have been represented by its counsel, whose job it is to protect the client\u2019s interests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\"> The relevant legislative history provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">\u201c[Representative Alice V.] Meyer: Mr. Speaker, through you a question to the proponent of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">\u201cSpeaker [Irving X] Stolberg: Please frame your question, madam.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">\u201c[Representative] Meyer: I would be interested in knowing what the rationale was behind the refusal to allow a repeal of the suit, without having it go to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">\u201cSpeaker Stolberg: [Representative] Tulisano, did you get the question, sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">\u201c[Representative Richard D.] Tulisano: Through you, Mr. Speaker.
