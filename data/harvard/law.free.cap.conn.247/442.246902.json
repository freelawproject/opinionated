On or about June 13, 1989, during the course of his employment, the plaintiff, Gerald Doucette, Jr., was a passenger in a truck operated by Frank Palmer when the truck was involved in an accident with a motor vehicle operated by the named defendant, Tamara J. Pomes, and owned by the defendant Askel Jensen, Pomes\u2019 father. As a result of the accident, Doucette sustained personal injuries and thereafter instituted an action, against Pomes and Jensen, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-293,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which authorizes an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>injured employee to seek recovery from a third party, other than the employer, for work-related injuries caused by that third party. Pomes admitted liability in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the amount of $15,000. At the time of the accident, Doucette carried at least $20,000<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of uninsured motorist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>coverage under his parents\u2019 automobile insurance policy with Shelby Insurance Group (Shelby). He brought a claim under the policy that resulted in Shelby paying him $13,000 in uninsured motorist benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Doucette also notified his employer, Metropolitan, of the accident. Because Doucette was injured during the course of his employment, Metropolitan, which had chosen to meet its statutory workers\u2019 compensation coverage obligation through self-insurance,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> paid Doucette\u2019s medical expenses in the amount of $3802.72 and compensation benefits in the amount of $8995.45, for a total payment of $12,798.17. Further, Metropolitan has stipulated that Doucette\u2019s future medical and compensation payments that may be awarded by the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner total $2201.83.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">At the time of the accident, Pomes and Jensen carried liability insurance coverage through American Universal Insurance Company (American), which subsequently was determined to be insolvent. Consequently, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-841<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the guaranty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>act, the association became liable for covered claims<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> arising under American\u2019s policies.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Metropolitan intervened as a plaintiff in Doucette\u2019s action, seeking a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>$15,000 judgment against Pomes and Jensen to recover for the payments already made and the future anticipated payments that might be awarded to Doucette. On December 10, 1992, having received $13,000 from Shelby and $12,798.17 from Metropolitan, Doucette withdrew his complaint against Pomes and Jensen.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Pomes and Jensen responded to Metropolitan\u2019s intervening complaint by asserting as a special defense that Metropolitan is an insurer within the meaning of the guaranty act and is therefore precluded from recovering from the association because \u00a7 38a-838 (6) excludes from \u201ccovered claims\u201d \u201cany amount due any reinsurer, <em>insurer, </em>insurance pool, or underwriting association, as subrogation recoveries or otherwise . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Metropolitan replied to the special defense by denying every allegation contained therein. On August 9, 1996, Metropolitan moved for summary judgment. It amended its motion on September 9, 1996, asserting that it was not an insurer under \u00a7 38a-838 (6). On October 11, 1996, Pomes and Jensen filed a cross motion for summary judgment based upon the claim that Metropolitan is an insurer. Thereafter, the trial court concluded that Metropolitan is not an insurer and denied the cross motion. The trial court\u2019s reasoning is fully set forth in its July 24, 1997 memorandum of decision on the defendants\u2019 motion to reconsider, in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the court again concluded that Metropolitan, as a self-insurer, was not an insurer for purposes of the guaranty act. Additionally, the court rejected the claim that Metropolitan is barred from recovering because Doucette had failed to exhaust the policy limits of his uninsured motorist policy. Consequently, on September 26, 1997, the court rendered judgment in favor of Metropolitan in the amount of $15,000. On October 15, 1997, the defendants appealed from the judgment to the Appellate Court. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1, formerly \u00a7 4023, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c), we transferred the appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The defendants raise several issues on appeal. First, they claim that Metropolitan, as a self-insurer, is an insurer for purposes of the guaranty act and, therefore, is precluded from recovering from the association pursuant to \u00a7 38a-838 (6). Second, the defendants contend that, even if Metropolitan is not an insurer under the guaranty act, any recovery it obtains from the defendants should be reduced by the limits of Doucette\u2019s uninsured motorist policy because Doucette failed to exhaust the policy limits, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 38a-845. Third, the defendants claim that any recovery by Metropolitan should be reduced by the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits received by Doucette or the amount of uninsured motorist benefits he received from his insurance company. Finally, Pomes and Jensen claim that any recovery Metropolitan obtains must be reduced by any amounts Shelby paid to Doucette. We disagree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Before turning to the merits of the case, we set forth the well established standard of review for a denial of summary judgment. \u201cSummary judgment \u2018shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>235 Conn. 185, 202, 663 A.2d 1001 (1996), quoting Practice Book \u00a7 384, what is now \u00a7 17-49. The trial court was presented with cross motions for summary judgment based on stipulated facts. Therefore, our review is plenary and we must determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law \u201care legally and logically correct\u201d and find support in the stipulated facts. <em>SLI International Corp. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>236 Conn. 156, 163, 671 A.2d 813 (1996), citing Practice Book \u00a7 4061, what is now \u00a7 60-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The defendants\u2019 first claim, that Metropolitan\u2019s status as self-insurer of its employees\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation claims renders it an insurer for purposes of the guaranty act, raises an issue of first impression for this court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At the time of the accident in 1989, as it does today, \u00a7 31-284b (b) authorized an employer to meet its workers\u2019 compensation obligations under chapter 568 by one of three enumerated methods, or any combination of those methods, one of which was self-insurance.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To become a self-insured employer, an employer must provide to the chairman of the workers\u2019 compensation commission \u201csatisfactory proof of his solvency and financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>ability to pay directly to injured employees\u201d compensation provided for in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (b). As noted, Metropolitan chose to self-insure its risk rather than contract for coverage with a workers\u2019 compensation insurance provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The defendants argue that, as a self-insurer, Metropolitan is barred from recovering from the association. Before addressing the merits of this claim, we discuss briefly the association itself. \u201cThe association was established for the purpose of providing a limited form of protection for policyholders and claimants in the event of insurer insolvency. The protection it provides is limited based upon its status as a nonprofit entity and the method by which it is funded. Specifically, the association is a nonprofit legal entity created by statute to which all persons licensed to transact insurance in the state must belong. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38a-838 (8) and 38a-839. When an insurer is determined to be insolvent under \u00a7 38a-838 (7), the association becomes obligated pursuant to \u00a7 38a-841, to the extent of covered claims within certain limits.\u201d <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>243 Conn. 438, 451, 705 A.2d 1012 (1997). The amounts paid to claimants are funded by assessments made on \u201cmember insurers\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 38a-841;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> who are obligated to be members of the association as a requirement of transacting insurance business in the state. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (8).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\u201cPursuant to ... \u00a7 38a-841, the association is authorized to pay only covered claims, and must deny all other claims. In order to be reimbursable by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>association, a claim against the association must be encompassed within the definition of a covered claim contained in \u00a7 38a-838 (6).\u201d <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 449-50. Section 38a-838 (6), which defines terms in the guaranty act, excludes from the definition of a covered claim \u201cany amount due any reinsurer, <em>insurer, </em>insurance pool, or underwriting association, as subrogation recoveries or otherwise . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) We must determine, therefore, whether Metropolitan, as a self-insurer, is an insurer for purposes of the guaranty act and, consequently, is precluded by \u00a7 38a-838 (6) from recovering from the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Our method of statutory interpretation is well established. \u201c[0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Furthermore, [w]e presume that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes . . . and that [statutes are to be interpreted with regard to other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 663-64, 680 A.2d 242 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">We begin our analysis, therefore, with an examination of the words of the statute itself. The guaranty act does not define the term \u201cinsurer.\u201d It merely defines \u201c[insolvent insurer,\u201d which provides for the circumstances in which an insurer is to be considered insolvent so that its obligations will be met by the association; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (7); and \u201cmember insurer,\u201d which defines the type of insurer that is required to be a member of the association and to be subject to the association\u2019s assessments. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (8). Neither definition is instructive on the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Section 38a-838 (6) bars recovery by any \u201creinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association . . . .\u201d The legislature did not expressly preclude self-insurers from recovering. The defendants argue, however, that a self-insurer <em>is </em>an insurer, so explicit mention of self-insurers in the section would be redundant. We disagree with the defendants for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">First, General Statutes \u00a7 38a-l provides that, for purposes of title 38a, entitled \u201cInsurance,\u201d the terms defined in the section \u201cunless it appears from the context to the contrary, shall have a scope and meaning as set forth in [the] section.\u201d Section 38a-l (10) defines insurance as \u201cany agreement to pay a sum of money, provide services or any other thing of value on the happening of a particular event <em>or </em>contingency or to provide indemnity for loss in respect to a specified subject by specified perils <em>in return for a consideration. </em>In any contract of insurance, an insured shall have an interest which is subject to arisk of loss through destruction or impairment of that interest, which risk is assumed by the insurer and such assumption shall be part of a general scheme to distribute losses among a large group of persons bearing similar risks in return for a ratable contribution or other consideration.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the legislature defines insurance as the assumption of another\u2019s risk for profit. An employer that self-insures for workers\u2019 compensation purposes retains its own risk; it does not assume the risk of another. Moreover, it does not receive consideration. It is merely fulfilling its obligations under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to ensure that its workers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>will receive compensation under the appropriate circumstances. Therefore, according to the language of \u00a7 38a-l (10), the definition of insurance does not include self-insurance for purposes of the guaranty act.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Additionally, \u00a7 38a-l (11) defines an \u201cinsurer\u201d as including \u201cany corporation, association, partnership or combination of persons doing any kind or form of insurance business other than a fraternal benefit society, and shall include a receiver of any insurer when the context reasonably permits. ...\u201d The fact that a self-insuring employer has chosen to retain its own workers\u2019 compensation risk rather than purchase insurance does not transform a company\u2019s business to that of insurance, that is, the employer is not \u201cdoing any kind or form of insurance business\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 38a-1 (11). Moreover, the subsection goes on to define \u201calien insurer,\u201d \u201cdomestic insurer,\u201d \u201cforeign insurer,\u201d \u201cmutual insurer\u201d and \u201cunauthorized insurer.\u201d As in \u00a7 38a-838 (6), the legislature made no mention of self-insurers. We have stated that \u201c[u]nless there is evidence to the contrary, statutory itemization indicates that the legislature intended [a] list to be exclusive.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 766, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982). We do not find sufficient evidence to the contrary in this case. Therefore, according to the plain language of the statute, a self-insurer is not an insurer under title 38a.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Additionally, we recognize the substantial authority for the position that self-insurance is not insurance at all. See 12 J. Appleman &amp; J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice (1981) \u00a7 7002, p. 22 (\u201c[a] certificate of self-insurance can in nowise be equated with an insurance contract or policy\u201d). Scholars have discussed self-insurance as follows: \u201cRisk transference or risk distribution may be accomplished without using insurance. . . . For example, entities that provide goods or services to many individuals . . . could choose to handle the risk of personal injury claims by \u2018setting aside\u2019 assets \u2014either by accounting entries or by actually establishing a special fund \u2014 from which it will pay such claims, <em>rather than by purchasing insurance. . . . </em>Although an entity that handles the risk of tort claims in this manner is sometimes referred to as a \u2018self-insurer,\u2019 this approach involves no insurance as the term is ordinarily used in regulatory statutes or in other legal contexts.\u201d R. Keeton &amp; A. Widiss, Insurance Law: A Guide to Fundamental Principles, Legal Doctrines and Commercial Practices (1988) \u00a7 1.3 (c), pp. 13-14. \u201c \u2018Self-insurance as a technique for treating risk has long been surrounded with confusion and controversy. . . . For those who believe that transfer of risk is a requisite for insurance, the term self-insurance is a misnomer since it permits no transfer.\u2019 \u201d Id., p. 14 n.14, quoting H. Denenberg, R. Eilers, G. Hoffman, C. Kline, J. Melone &amp; H. Snider, Risk and Insurance (1964) p. 79. Even the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>language of \u00a7 31-284 (b) supports this view of self-insurance. It provides that unless an employer can prove its solvency and financial ability \u201cto pay [compensation] directly to injured employees,\u201d it must \u201cinsure [its] full liability\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (b). Thus, the section distinguishes between insurance and an employer\u2019s retention of its own risk to pay compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">According to one scholar, \u201c[a]ll insurance contracts concern risk transference, but not all contracts involving risk transference are insurance.\u201d R. Keeton &amp; A. Widiss, supra, p. 12. In the appeal before us, Metropolitan did not purchase insurance to cover its risk. Rather, it complied with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act by retaining its own risk. It did not thereby become transformed into an insurer. Rather, it retained its character as an employer that simply elected to pay the expenses associated with its employees\u2019 work-related accidents. Although this is commonly referred to as self-insuring,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> there was no transfer of risk, which is generally considered to be an essential element of an insurance relationship. Therefore, the writings of insurance scholars, in addition to the plain language of \u00a7 38a-838 (6), support the definition of insurer as exclusive of self-insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">We now turn our attention to the relevant legislative history of the guaranty act, which, unfortunately, is devoid of any discussion of the definition of \u201cinsurer.\u201d As we declared in <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 452, \u201c[t]he legislative history [of the guaranty act] confirms that the association was established for the benefit of consumers.\u201d We noted that \u201c[a]t the public hearing held prior to passage of the bill proposing the creation of the association, Peter Kelly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>a member of the state insurance department stated: \u2018[T]his bill provides the means to avoid financial loss to Connecticut residents because of the insolvency of [insurance companies].\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Insurance and Real Estate, 1971 Sess., p. 55. We concluded that the purpose of the act is to protect policyholders and claimants. <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 452. The defendants point out that Metropolitan fits into neither category. On this issue, we find helpful the words of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, interpreting that state\u2019s version of its guaranty act, which is similar to our own. In <em>Ulwick </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>418 Mass. 486, 490-91, 637 N.E.2d 209 (1994), the court stated that \u201c[t]he obvious legislative purpose in establishing the [guaranty fund], which is funded by the insurance industry, is to benefit members of the public, individuals and entities . . . which are outside the insurance industry, from losses due to the insolvency of a member of that industry.\u201d Although Metropolitan is neither a policyholder nor a claimant, neither is it a member of the insurance industry. For purposes of the guaranty act, Metropolitan may be categorized more accurately as a resident company that has sustained losses due to the insolvency of a member of the insurance industry, rather than as a member itself of that industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Although the legislative history of the guaranty act does not contain any discussion of the definition of \u201cinsurer,\u201d there is ample evidence that the guaranty act was \u201csubstantially the same as a model bill adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners [NAIC], which is an organization of the insurance commissioners of the fifty [s]tates.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, p. 55, remarks of Peter Kelly; see also 14 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1971 Sess., p. 2613, remarks of Senator Joseph Dinielli; 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>8, 1971 Sess., p. 3624, remarks of Michael Colucci. We have recognized the propriety of examining the history of a model act upon which our own statutes or acts are based. See, e.g., <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 676. Such an idea applies a fortiori in a case, such as the present one, in which our own legislative history is silent on the precise issue in question. In the past, we have even turned to the model regulations of the NAIC, the same body that drafted the model act upon which our guaranty act was based, for that body\u2019s interpretation of one of its model acts. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>199 Conn. 651, 660, 509 A.2d 11 (1986) (discussing model insurance trade practices act that was basis for state\u2019s enactment of Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act). Accordingly, in the absence of any evidence as to the legislature\u2019s intent with regard to the definition of \u201cinsurer,\u201d we believe it is appropriate to examine the NAIC\u2019s interpretation of \u201cself-insurers\u201d with regard to the states\u2019 guaranty acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">In 1983, an NAIC study committee submitted a report to the NAIC concerning self-insured workers\u2019 compensation groups. 2 NAIC Proceedings (1983) p. 742. While such groups are not identical to an individual employer like Metropolitan, they do self-insure, as a group. We therefore find the report instructive.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The report states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>in two different places that if a self-insured workers\u2019 compensation group\u2019s excess insurance carrier becomes insolvent, the group should be able to turn to the state\u2019s insurance guaranty association fund for protection. See 2 NAIC Proceedings, supra, p. 770 (\u201c[i]f the excess insurance company is not able to deliver on its contractual promises, the insurance guaranty fund can be called upon if the excess company is a licensed company\u201d); id., p. 783 (\u201c[licensed excess insurance companies not only are subject to closer regulatory supervision than unlicensed companies, but also provide workers\u2019 compensation groups with the additional protection afforded by state insolvency funds\u201d). Therefore, the NAIC report demonstrates the intent of the NAIC that self-insurers are not insurers for purposes of state guaranty acts. See also <em>Iowa Contractors Workers\u2019 Compensation Group </em>v. <em>Iowa Ins. Guaranty Assn., </em>437 N.W.2d 909, 916 (Iowa 1989) (stating that NAIC report \u201cunequivocally noted the availability of insurance guaranty association fund protection if a [self-insured] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>group\u2019s excess carrier were to become insolvent\u201d); <em>Stamp </em>v. <em>Dept. of Labor &amp; Industries, </em>122 Wash. 2d 536, 543, 859 P.2d 597 (1993) (stating that NAIC \u201chas indicated that self-insurers should be able to recover from insurance guaranty funds\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In the final step of our interpretation of \u00a7 38a-838 (6), we consider the statute in question with regard to other relevant statutes, under the assumption that the legislature has enacted a consistent body of law. <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 664. Therefore, we consider it noteworthy that in other contexts, the legislature has chosen to define \u201cinsurer\u201d so as to include self-insurers. See General Statutes \u00a7 38a-363 (b) (no-fault motor vehicle insurance). For example, in <em>Conzo </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>243 Conn. 677, 686, 705 A.2d 1020 (1998), we held that a self-insured employer was required to provide uninsured motorist benefits to an employee who was injured while occupying an automobile during the course of his employment. In so doing, we concluded that the self-insured employer was an insurer within the meaning of \u00a7 38a-363, which defines terms used in our no-fault motor vehicle insurance statutes. Id., 683. Section 38a-363 (b) provides that the definition of insurer \u201cincludes a self-insurer and a person having the rights and obligations of an insurer . . . .\u201d The fact that the legislature expressly defined \u201cinsurer\u201d so as to include self-insurers in the no-fault motor vehicle insurance context but not in the workers\u2019 compensation context does not lead ineluctably to the conclusion that it intended to exclude self-insurers in the latter area. Although such a fact is certainly not dispositive in the present appeal, it is an additional factor militating in favor of excluding self-insurers from the definition of insurers for purposes of \u00a7 38a-838 (6). It is reasonable to assume that the legislature, having explicitly demonstrated its intention that the definition of \u201cinsurer\u201d includes self-insurers for puiposes of our no-fault motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>vehicle statutes, would have been equally clear with respect to the guaranty act if its intention had been the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The defendants rely on case law from other jurisdictions to support their contention that a self-insurer is an insurer under the guaranty act. Although only a handful of jurisdictions have considered the precise issue before us, the majority of those with guaranty acts similar to \u00a7 38a-836 et seq. hold that a self-insurer is not an insurer. <em>See Zinke-Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>Florida Ins. Guaranty Assn., Inc., </em>304 So. 2d 507, 509-10 (Fla. App. 1974), cert. denied, 315 So. 2d 469 (Fla. 1975) (self-insuring employer not insurer such as would prevent its claim from qualifying as \u201ccovered claim\u201d under Florida\u2019s guaranty act); <em>Iowa Contractors Workers\u2019 Compensation Group </em>v. <em>Iowa Ins. Guaranty Assn., </em>supra, 437 N.W.2d 917 (self-insured workers\u2019 compensation group not insurer for purposes of Iowa\u2019s guaranty act); <em>Ulwick </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>supra, 418 Mass. 489 (self-insuring municipal employer not insurer within language or intent of Massachusetts\u2019 guaranty act); <em>In re Mission Ins. Co., </em>112 N.M. 433, 435, 816 P.2d 502 (1991) (stating that, for purposes of New Mexico\u2019s guaranty fund, self-insurer was not insurer); <em>Stamp </em>v. <em>Dept. of Labor &amp; Industries, </em>supra, 122 Wash. 2d 543-44 (holding that self-insured employers not reinsurers, insurers, insurance pools or underwriting associations for purposes of Washington\u2019s guaranty act).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The courts of only two jurisdictions have held that a self-insurer is an insurer for purposes of their guaranty acts. The defendants urge us to follow them. The relevant cases are easily distinguishable, however, and we therefore find them unpersuasive. First, in <em>Ventulett </em>v. <em>Maine Ins. Guaranty Assn., </em>583 A.2d 1022 (Me. 1990), a Massachusetts resident was injured in a work-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>accident in Connecticut. His employer was self-insured up to $150,000. Id., 1023. The tortfeasors\u2019 liability insurance carrier had become insolvent. Id. In the portion of the opinion in which the court concluded that the self-insured employer was an insurer, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine relied on the fact that Massachusetts\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation law defines a self-insuring employer as an \u201cinsurer.\u201d Id., 1024. The court stated that \u201c[bjecause the Massachusetts workers\u2019 compensation law defines a self-insured employer entitled to assert a subrogation claim as an \u2018insurer,\u2019 the Maine Guaranty Act likewise should treat a self-insured employer paying Massachusetts workers\u2019 compensation as an insurer that is barred from recovering on a subrogation claim against [the Maine Insurance Guaranty Association].\u201d Id., 1025. Unlike Massachusetts, however, Connecticut does not, in its Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, define self-insured employers as insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The defendants rely also on <em>Kachanis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>844 F. Sup. 877, 889 (D.R.I. 1994), in which the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island held that the United States, which self-insures its workers\u2019 compensation liabilities pursuant to the statutory scheme of the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq. (1988); was an insurer for purposes of the Rhode Island Insolvency Fund Act, that state\u2019s equivalent of Connecticut\u2019s guaranty act. Most of the <em>Kachanis </em>opinion is devoted to an analysis of federal preemption involving insurance law and application of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012 (b) (1988), which limits federal preemption in the area of insurance. <em>Kachinis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 880. When it turned to the issues that are relevant to the facts of the appeal before this court, the <em>Kachanis </em>court first concluded that the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act did not relate to the business of insurance. Id., 883. The court later recognized that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>argument that the United States is an insurer \u2014 even though the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act does not relate to the business of insurance \u2014 -is \u201cblatantly contradictory\u201d; id., 885; and \u201cglaringly inconsistent.\u201d Id., 889. Nevertheless, the court held that the federal government was an insurer, deeming itself bound by precedent that \u201cimplicitly\u201d ruled that the United States is an entity within the insurance business. Id. The court advanced no persuasive analysis of its own as to a self-insurer\u2019s status as an insurer and, moreover, relied on a Massachusetts case that is not dispositive of the issue.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Consequently, we are not persuaded by either the result or the reasoning of <em>Kachanis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We join, therefore, the majority of courts that have decided the status of self-insured employers under an insurance guaranty act, and we hold that self-insured employers are not insurers for purposes of Connecticut\u2019s guaranty act. The defendants have advanced no other persuasive reason for holding that Metropolitan\u2019s claim should not be considered a covered claim under \u00a7 38a-838 (6). Therefore, we conclude that Metropolitan\u2019s claim was a covered claim as defined in that subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">The defendants\u2019 second claim is that even if we hold that Metropolitan is not an insurer under the guaranty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>act, any recovery obtained by Metropolitan from the defendants should be reduced by the limits of Doucette\u2019s uninsured motorist policy because Doucette failed to exhaust the policy limits, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 38a-845. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Section 38a-845 (1) provides: \u201cAny person having a claim against an insurer under any provision in an insurance policy, other than a policy of an insolvent insurer, which is also a covered claim under [the guaranty act], shall exhaust first his rights under such policy. Any amount payable on a covered claim under [the guaranty act] shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery under the claimant\u2019s insurance policy or chapter 568.\u201d Because Doucette failed to exhaust the limits of his uninsured motorist policy with Shelby, he would be barred from recovering from the association. Pursuant to \u00a7 31-293,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Metropolitan intervened as a plaintiff in Doucette\u2019s action against Pomes and Jensen. The defendants argue that Metropolitan\u2019s claim for reimbursement is essentially Doucette\u2019s claim, with Metropolitan merely substituted as plaintiff after it intervened and Doucette withdrew his complaint. The defendants characterize Metropolitan\u2019s claim as a subrogation claim. Pomes and Jensen, who state repeatedly that Metropolitan is \u201cstanding in Doucette\u2019s shoes,\u201d contend that Metropolitan \u201cis asserting Doucette\u2019s claim against [them] for causing Doucette\u2019s injuries,\u201d and that Metropolitan\u2019s \u201crights derive from and are no greater than Doucette\u2019s.\u201d According to the defendants, Metropolitan, standing in Doucette\u2019s shoes, cannot recover what Doucette himself would not be able to recover. Whether the defendants are correct that, under \u00a7 38a-845, Doucette\u2019s failure to exhaust his policy limits bars Metropolitan from recovering, turns on the proper interpretation of \u00a7 31-293 (a). We conclude that although the defendants are correct that Metropolitan\u2019s rights are derivative of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Doucette\u2019s; see, e.g., <em>Olszewski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement </em>Commission, 144 Conn. 322, 325, 130 A.2d 801 (1957); the defendants misapprehend the nature of a claim brought by an employer pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 when they characterize Metropolitan\u2019s claim as Doucette\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In addition to allowing an employee to bring a claim against a tortfeasor, \u00a7 31-293 (a) allows an employer that has paid or become obligated to pay compensation to the injured employee under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cto take action against a \u2018third person\u2019 who is legally liable to pay \u2018damages\u2019 for an injury to an employee.\u201d <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>242 Conn. 375, 380, 698 A.2d 859 (1997). We have stated that the employer\u2019s right of action under \u00a7 31-293 is separate and distinct from the employee\u2019s right, noting that \u201cit is a right vested in the employer exclusively; it is not the right of the employee.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Faulkner, </em>163 Conn. 365, 377-78, 306 A.2d857 (1972). Additionally, the statute provides that: \u201cNo compromise with the [tortfeasor] by either the employer or the employee shall be binding upon or affect the rights of the other, unless assented to by him. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a). Such language makes clear that the employer and employee have separate rights under the statute. Moreover, we have noted that the statute \u201calso provides that, if either the employer or the employee fails to join in an action instituted by the other against a tort feasor within thirty days after notification by that other, his cause of action is barred. These provisions clearly indicate that under the statute the employer and the employee each has a right of action which is separate from that of the other.\u201d <em>Stavola </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>136 Conn. 670, 678, 73 A.2d 831 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The legislative history of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides additional support for this interpretation. In <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>242 Conn. 381-82, we examined the relevant legislative history, noting that \u201c[cjhapter 138, part B, \u00a7 6, of the 1913 Public Acts provided in relevant part: \u2018When any injury for which compensation is payable under this act shall have been sustained under circumstances creating in some other person than the employer a legal liability to pay damages in respect thereto . . . any employer having paid the compensation shall be subrogated to the rights of the injured employee to recover against that person . . . .\u2019 That provision was subsequently amended, removing the reference to subrogation and substituting language allowing an employer either to intervene in an action brought by an employee <em>or to bring its own direct action against a, third party. </em>See Public Acts 1917, c. 368, \u00a7 1. The language of the 1917 act is virtually identical to that of the current \u00a7 31-293 (a) . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This legislative history, in addition to the plain language of the statute, makes clear that, under \u00a7 31-293 (a), an employer has a cause of action that is separate and distinct from that of its injured employee. Metropolitan\u2019s cause of action, therefore, although derivative of Doucette\u2019s, belongs exclusively to Metropolitan, and Metropolitan has an independent statutory right to assert a claim for reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">We return now to the defendants\u2019 argument that \u00a7 38a-845 bars Metropolitan from recovering because Doucette failed to exhaust his policy limits. With respect to the prerequisite of exhaustion, \u00a7 38a-845 (1) provides: \u201cAny person having a claim against an insurer under any provision in an insurance policy, other than a policy of an insolvent insurer, which is also a covered claim under [the guaranty act], shall exhaust first his rights under such policy. . . .\u201d Metropolitan does not have, however, \u201ca claim against an insurer under any provision in an insurance policy . . . .\u201d Rather, its claim is against a negligent driver and the owner of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>vehicle negligently driven. It has no insurance policy to which it can turn for recovery. There are no limits for it to exhaust. It has no claim under Doucette\u2019s uninsured motorist policy, which is a contractual remedy available to Doucette. As we recently concluded in <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 242 Conn. 377, an employer has no right to recover from any amounts an employee may receive from his or her uninsured motorist coverage. Therefore, \u00a7 38a-845, which would have applied with full force to Doucette, is simply inapplicable to Metropolitan, under the plain language of the statute.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The defendants\u2019 remaining arguments also rely on the applicability of \u00a7 38a-845 to Metropolitan\u2019s claim. Specifically, in addition to their exhaustion argument, the defendants claim that \u00a7 38a-845 requires that Metropolitan\u2019s claim be reduced by the total amount of Doucette\u2019s recovery under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The association argues further that the statute requires that Metropolitan\u2019s claim be reduced by the amount of uninsured motorist benefits received by Doucette from his insurance company.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth in part II of this opinion, \u00a7 38a-845 simply does not apply to Metropolitan\u2019s claim, and, therefore, the defendants\u2019 arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Finally, Pomes and Jensen assert an additional reason, separate and distinct from \u00a7 38a-845, to reduce any recovery obtained by Metropolitan.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> These defendants assert that because Metropolitan paid compensation to Doucette without first applying for a statutory hen or an offset for the amounts that Shelby had paid to Doucette, Metropolitan cannot obtain reimbursement from the defendants. This argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">In support of their argument, Pomes and Jensen cite <em>Pokorny </em>v. <em>Getta\u2019s Garage, </em>219 Conn. 439, 594 A.2d 446 (1991), in which this court held that an employer is not required to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits in a case in which an employee obtained recovery from another insurer and the other insurer did not assert a hen or offset pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-174n, now \u00a7 38a-470. Pomes and Jensen claim that, in the present appeal, \u201cas in <em>Pokorny, </em>[Metropolitan] was not required to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Doucette where Doucette obtained recovery from Shelby and where Shelby apparently never asserted a statutory hen or offset against Doucette\u2019s recovery of workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d Any reliance on <em>Pokomy </em>is misplaced, however, because that case is simply inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">In <em>Pokorny, </em>we held that an employer was not required to pay its injured employee the value of the employee\u2019s medical expenses that had been paid previously by the employee\u2019s medical insurance carrier, which had not filed a hen pursuant to statute. Id., 440. It does not follow from this holding, however, that, in the present appeal, Metropolitan was required to apply an offset for Shelby\u2019s payment to Doucette. <em>Pokorny </em>\u201cinvolve[d] only the rights and obligations between the [injured employee], on the one hand, and [the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>employer and its workers\u2019 compensation insurer], on the other. It [did] not involve the rights and obligations, if any, between the medical insurance carrier . . . and [the defendants] . . . .\u201d Id., 441-42 n.2. Similarly, the present appeal involves the rights and obligations between Metropolitan, a party that suffered a loss, and the defendant tortfeasors. It does not involve the rights and obligations between Doucette and his employer. Moreover, in <em>Pokomy, </em>the plaintiff sought to recover twice for his medical expenses, once from the defendant employer\u2019s medical insurance carrier and once from the employer. Whether Doucette has received a multiple recovery, however, is not at issue here.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In the present appeal, Metropolitan, which paid compensation to Doucette, seeks to recover for that payment. It does not seek a double recovery. Metropolitan was obligated under our workers\u2019 compensation laws to provide compensation to Doucette. It met this obligation and later asserted its statutory right to seek reimbursement. It does not make sound policy to compel an employer, prior to paying benefits to an employee, to determine its rights and obligations in light of other potential sources of recovery by the employee. In <em>Pokomy, </em>we noted that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201ccompromise[s] an employee\u2019s right to a common law tort action for work related injuries in return for <em>relatively quick and certain </em>compensation.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 454; <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 242 Conn. 381. Holding as Pomes and Jensen request would defeat that purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Therefore, we find no support in <em>Pokomy </em>for the argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>by Pomes and Jensen and, consequently, we are left unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In conclusion, we hold that a self-insured employer is not an insurer for purposes of the guaranty act and, therefore, is not precluded from asserting an otherwise valid claim under \u00a7 38a-838 (6). Additionally, we hold that because an employer\u2019s right to assert a claim pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a) is separate and distinct from its employee\u2019s right, \u00a7 38a-845 is inapplicable to Metropolitan in the present appeal and Metropolitan need not satisfy the exhaustion prerequisite of \u00a7 38a-845, nor that statute\u2019s requirement that amounts payable on covered claims be reduced by any recovery under a claimant\u2019s insurance policy or the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (6) provides: \u201c \u2018Covered claim\u2019 means an unpaid claim, including, but not limited to, one for unearned premiums, which arises out of and is within the coverage and subject to the applicable limits of an insurance policy to which sections 38a-836 to 38a-853, inclusive, apply issued by an insurer, if such insurer becomes an insolvent insurer after October 1, 1971, and (a) the claimant is a resident of this state at the time of the insured event; or (b) the claimant is not a resident of this state, but only under all of the following conditions: (i) The insured is a resident of this state at the time of the insured event; (il) the insolvent insurer is licensed to do business in this state at the time of the insured event; (iii) the state of the claimant\u2019s residence has an association similar to the association created by said sections; and (iv) such claimant is refused coverage by such association because the insolvent insurer is not licensed to do business in the state of the claimant\u2019s residence at the time of the insured event; or (c) the property from which the claim arises is permanently located in this state, provided <em>the term \u2018covered, claim\u2019 shall not include any amount </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>due any </em>reinsurer, <em>insurer, </em>insurance pool, or underwriting association, as subrogation recoveries or otherwise; provided that a claim for any such amount, asserted against a person insured under a policy issued by an insurer which has become an insolvent insurer, which, if it were not a claim by or for the benefit of a reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool or underwriting association, would be a \u2018covered claim\u2019 may be filed directly with the receiver of the insolvent insurer but in no event shall any such claim be asserted against the insured of such insolvent insurer.

(1) Said association shall: (a) Be obligated to the extent of the covered claims existing prior to the determination of insolvency and arising within thirty days after the determination of insolvency, or before the policy expiration date if less than thirty days after the determination, or before the insured replaces the policy or causes its cancellation, if he does so within thirty days of such determination, provided such obligation shall be limited as follows: (i) With respect to covered claims for unearned premiums, to one-half of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>unearned premium on any policy, subject to a maximum of two thousand dollars per policy; (ii) with respect to covered claims other than for unearned premiums, such obligation shall include only that amount of each such claim which is in excess of one hundred dollars and is less than three hundred thousand dollars, except that said association shall pay the full amount of any such claim arising out of a workers\u2019 compensation policy, provided in no event shall (A) said association be obligated to any claimant in an amount in excess of the obligation of the insolvent insurer under the policy form or coverage from which the claim arises, or (B) said association be obligated for any claim filed with the association after the expiration of two years from the date of the declaration of insolvency; (b) be deemed the insurer to the extent of its obligations on the covered claims and to such extent shall have all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent; (c) allocate claims paid and expenses incurred among the three accounts, created by section 38a-839, separately, and assess member insurers separately (i) in respect of each such account for such amounts as shall be necessary to pay the obligations of said association under subdivision (a) of subsection (1) of this section subsequent to an insolvency; (ii) the expenses of handling covered claims subsequent to an insolvency; (iii) the cost of examinations under section 38a-846 and (iv) such other expenses as are authorized by sections 38a-836 to 38a-853, inclusive. The assessments of each member insurer shall be in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of such member insurer for the calendar year preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in such account bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the calendar year preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in such account. Each member insurer shall be notified of its assessment not later than thirty days before it is due. No member insurer may be assessed in any year on any account an amount greater than two per cent of that member insurer\u2019s net direct written premiums for the calendar year preceding the assessment, on the kinds of insurance in said account, provided if, at the time an assessment is levied on the \u2018all other insurance\u2019 account, as defined in subdivision (c) of section 38a-839, the board of directors finds that at least fifty per cent of the total net direct written premiums of a member insurer and all its affiliates, for the year on which such assessment is based, were from policies issued or delivered in Connecticut, on risks located in this state, such member insurer shall be assessed only on such member insurer\u2019s net direct written premium that is attributable to the kind of insurance that gives rise to each covered claim. If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of said association in any account, does not provide in any one year in any account an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments from that account, the funds available may be prorated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as funds become available. Said association may defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any member insurer, if the assessment would cause the member insurer\u2019s financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus less than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance provided that during the period of deferment, no dividends shall be paid to shareholders or policyholders. Deferred assessments shall be paid when such payment will not reduce capital or surplus below the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority. Such payments shall be refunded to those insurers receiving greater assessments because of such deferment or, at the election of the insurer, be credited against future assessments. Each member insurer serving as a servicing facility may set off against any assessment, authorized payments made on covered claims and expenses incurred in the payment of such claims by such member insurer if they are chargeable to the account in respect of which the assessment is made; (d) investigate claims brought against said association and acjjust, compromise, settle, and pay covered claims to the extent of said association\u2019s obligations, and deny all other claims. The association shall pay claims in any order it deems reasonable, including but not limited to, payment in the order of receipt or by classification.

We also concluded that the self-insured employer was an insurer within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-363, which defines terms used in our no-fault motor vehicle insurance statutes. Id., 683. It is noteworthy, however, that \u00a7 38a-363 expressly includes a self-insurer within the definition of \u201cinsurer.\u201d As we note in part IA of this opinion, the statutes at issue in the present appeal do not expressly define an insurer as encompassing self-insurers. Therefore, the conclusion that the self-insured employer in <em>Conzo </em>was an insurer does not inform our decision as to the status of the employer in the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b477-9\"> See footnote 6 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b478-9\"> See footnote 7 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b478-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (8) provides: \u201c \u2018Member insurer\u2019 means any person who (a) writes any kind of insurance to which sections 38a-836 to 38a-853, inclusive, apply under section 38a-837, including but not limited to the exchange of reciprocal or interinsurance contracts, and (b) is licensed to transact insurance in this state . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\"> The defendants claim that it <em>does </em>appear from the context that the legislature intended to include self-insurers in \u00a7 38a-1 (11). They assert that, because the purpose of the guaranty act is to protect insureds and injured claimants, and Metropolitan fits into neither category, a determination that Metropolitan is not an insurer would be contrary to the act\u2019s purpose. Pomes and Jensen claim that if the association is required to pay Metropolitan, \u201cthe ultimate beneficiary would be an insurer [Metropolitan] and not the injured claimant, Doucette.\u201d This tautological argument presupposes, however, that Metropolitan is an insurer. This argument fails because, as we conclude, Metropolitan is <em>not </em>an insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The association also claims that a reading of \u00a7 38a-845, which provides that the association\u2019s obligations shall be reduced by any recoveries made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>pursuant to chapter 568 (the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act), suggests that the legislature intended self-insurers to be considered insurers. The association argues that because these amounts are paid either by an employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer or by the employer itself as a self-insurer, the legislature intended that the workers\u2019 compensation system bear the loss rather than the association or an insured of an insolvent insurer. We do not agree that this argument, standing alone, provides a sufficiently clear indication that the legislature intended that self-insurers be considered insurers, such as would compel us to disregard the plain language of the statute, especially in light of the other persuasive reasons, discussed throughout this opinion, for concluding otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\"> At least one state has avoided the confusion surrounding the term self-insurer by labeling an employer that has retained its own workers\u2019 compensation risk an \u201cown risk employer.\u201d See <em>Cities Service Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Witt, </em>500 P.2d 288 (Okla. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\"> The NAIC report notes that there are differences between a self-insurer, which \u201cretains and is responsible for its own workers\u2019 compensation risk,\u201d and a self-insured workers\u2019 compensation group, which is a \u201cseparate entity formed by many employers to assume their workers\u2019 compensation risks.\u201d <em>2 </em>NAIC Proceedings, supra, p. 748. A reading of the NAIC report, however, leads us to the conclusion that the report\u2019s reasoning applies to a self-insurer with the same force as to a self-insured workers\u2019 compensation group.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">We note that General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (6) excludes from the definition of a covered claim \u201cany amount due any reinsurer, insurer, <em>insurance pool, </em>or underwriting association, as subrogation recoveries or otherwise . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) We recognize that a self-insured workers\u2019 compensation group might be considered similar to an insurance pool, which is not defined in the General Statutes. Initially, however, we note that, as there is a distinction between a self-insurer and an insurer, it is reasonable to conclude that there is a similar difference between a self-insured insurance pool or group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>and an insurance pool. An \u201cinsurance pool\u201d is the \u201c[combining together of several <em>insurers </em>to share premiums and losses so as to spread risks.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). According to the NAIC, a \u201cworkers\u2019 compensation group self-insurance pool\u201d is a combining of \u201csmaller employers\u201d who \u201cpool their risks . ...\u201d 2 NAIC Proceedings, supra, p. 742. Therefore, we believe that a self-insured workers\u2019 compensation group is more like a self-insurer than an insurer. While we need not decide the issue today, however, for purposes of this discussion, we will assume that although \u00a7 38a-838 (6) precludes an insurance pool from recovering from the association, it does not necessarily preclude a self-insured workers\u2019 compensation group orpool from recovering. Moreover, this notion derives support from case law from our sister state of Iowa, the only state to our knowledge to have considered the issue. Iowa\u2019s definition of a covered claim under its guaranty act is very similar to Connecticut\u2019s; see Iowa Code \u00a7 515B.2 (4) (1) (excluding from definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d any amount \u201cdue any reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, underwriting association\u201d); and its highest court considers a self-insured workers\u2019 compensation group to be legally capable of asserting a covered claim under the relevant section of its guaranty act analogous to \u00a7 38a-838 (6). See <em>Iowa Contractors Workers\u2019 Compensation Group </em>v. <em>Iowa Ins. Guaranty Assn., </em>437 N.W.2d 909, 917 (Iowa 1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b490-9\"> In reaching its conclusion that the United States is an insurer, the <em>Kachanis </em>court relied heavily on <em>Ferrari </em>v. <em>Toto, </em>9 Mass. App. 483, 402 N.E.2d 107 (1980), aff'd, 383 Mass. 36, 417 N.E.2d 427 (1981), an appellate court opinion that held that Massachusetts\u2019 guaranty fund \u201cis excused from paying claims <em>if the ultimate beneficiary is an insurance company.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 486. In other words, <em>Ferrari </em>held that Massachusetts\u2019 guaranty act precludes all members of the insurance industry from recovery, not merely member insurers. Id., 486-87. It is noteworthy, however, that when the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts considered the precise issue with which we are faced, months after <em>Kachanis </em>was decided, that court held that a self-insurer is <em>not </em>an insurer for purposes of the state\u2019s guaranty act. <em>Ulwick </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>supra, 418 Mass. 489.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b491-7\"> See footnote 4 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b494-6\"> Pomes and Jensen argue that because Metropolitan\u2019s claim is derivative of Doucette\u2019s claim, Metropolitan\u2019s rights are no greater than Doucette\u2019s. Therefore, according to these defendants, any defense available to the defendants against Doucette may also be used against Metropolitan. For support, Pomes and Jensen cite <em>Packtor </em>v. <em>Seppala &amp; AHO Construction Co., </em>33 Conn. App. 422, 431, 636 A.2d 383, appeal dismissed, 231 Conn. 367, 650 A.2d 534 (1994), in which the Appellate Court denied an employer\u2019s right of action in a case in which the employee\u2019s right of action was barred by the statute of limitations, stating that \u201cit would be illogical to grant greater rights to an employer whose rights are derivative, than to the employee from whom those derivative rights flow.\u201d Pomes and Jensen fail to recognize, however, that the Appellate Court did not bar the employer\u2019s action based on any failure on the employee\u2019s part. Indeed, the court stated: \u201cWe agree with [the employer] that it would be inequitable to bar an intervention action by an employer <em>for no other reason </em>than that the <em>employee </em>failed to file his or her action within the applicable period of limitation. . . . The action is not barred, however, by the employee\u2019s procedural failure but by the failure of the employer to bring suit in a timely manner.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 430-31. Likewise, in the present appeal, it would be inequitable to penalize Metropolitan for Doucette\u2019s failure to exhaust the limits of his insurance policy. Metropolitan had no control over Doucette\u2019s actions. It could not compel Doucette to exhaust the limits of his policy. For these reasons, the argument of Pomes and Jensen fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">In an effort to support their argument, Pomes and Jensen also cite a case from the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, <em>Harbor Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn., </em>711 F. Sup. 70, 72 (D. Conn. 1989), in which the court held that a claimant\u2019s failure to exhaust his rights under available coverage under an uninsured motorist policy prevented any subsequent recovery against the association by the claimant <em>or the excess insurance earner. </em>Although the fact that the plaintiff in <em>Harbor Ins. Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>was an insurer would preclude recovery under our holding on the first issue of the present appeal, the <em>Harbor Ins. Co. </em>court assumed that the insurer\u2019s claim was a \u201ccovered claim\u201d because it deemed the exhaustion argument to be dispositive. Id. Therefore, the court addressed the exhaustion argument, deciding against the insurer because neither the employee nor the insurer had pursued the insured\u2019s rights under the relevant uninsured motorist policy. Id. Much of the court\u2019s holding relies on the fact that the plaintiff excess insurer had settled with the insured. It was this settlement that precluded the plaintiffs recovery. The plaintiffs counsel conceded that it had \u201csought a prompt settlement ... to avoid substantially greater exposure . . . .\u201d Id., 74. The court in <em>Harbor Ins. Co. </em>noted that the plaintiff had \u201cadmittedly benefited from the decision not to proceed against [the uninsured motorist insurance carrier] nor to add this party to the settlement negotiations.\u201d Id. The court noted that \u201c[h]ad it not been for the settlement with [the plaintiff], [the insured] would have been able to raise a claim against the [association subject to the exhaustion of her rights under the [relevant insurance] policy.\u201d Id. In the present appeal, Metropolitan did not settle with Doucette. Doucette settled with Shelby, its uninsured motorist insurance carrier. Metropolitan\u2019s actions did not trigger the preclusive effect of \u00a7 38a-845, as did those of the plaintiff in <em>Harbor Ins. Co. </em>Therefore, Pomes\u2019 and Jensen\u2019s reliance on <em>Harbor Ins.
