We answer this question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. The plaintiff, Timothy Mellon, owns two houses situated on approximately 291 acres of land located at the confluence of the Eight Mile River and the Connecticut River, approximately five miles north of Long Island Sound. Southern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>New England Telephone Company (SNET) maintained utility poles and a pole line (pole line) on this property at the time that Mellon acquired it. These poles \u2014 which were installed at various times between 1931 and 1989\u2014 carry cable that supplies Mellon\u2019s telephone service; they also carry cable that supplies Mellon\u2019s power, which is provided by the Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&amp;P). Approximately twenty years ago, Mellon granted a scenic easement to the state of Connecticut over 281 acres of his land. At the time of trial, the state was negotiating with Mellon for a scenic easement over the remaining ten acres. In 1993, Mellon requested that the defendant, Century Cable Management Corporation (Century), supply cable television service to his two houses. In order to provide this service, Century installed cable on Mellon\u2019s land. Although 4500 feet of this cable was installed overhead on the pole line, Mellon arranged for 1700 feet of cable to be installed in an underground trench, for reasons both aesthetic and functional.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Without authorization from Mellon, Century installed an additional 300 feet of cable on the pole line (disputed cable) in order to provide service to other customers. This latter length of cable \u2014 which provides no service to Mellon \u2014 is clearly visible from at least 100 feet away. Century claims that the disputed cable is authorized by a license it purchased from SNET. When Mellon discovered the disputed cable, he demanded that Century either remove it or negotiate with him to purchase an easement. Century refused these requests, and Mellon commenced the present litigation, seeking both monetary and injunctive relief. Specifically, Mellon sought an order compelling Century to remove the disputed cable and restraining Century from committing any further trespasses on his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The case was tried before an attorney trial referee (referee). The parties entered into a stipulation providing, inter alia, as follows: (1) \u201c[n]either Mellon nor his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>predecessors in title has [granted] . . . any written easement, license or agreement in favor of SNET or CL&amp;P\u201d; (2) \u201c[n] either Mellon nor his predecessors in title has [granted] . . . any written easement, license or agreement in favor of Century calling for the use of the pole line to provide service to third parties\u201d; (3) \u201c[when] Mellon acquired [his land], the pole line existed and has been openly, visibly, continuously and uninterruptedly used by SNET under a claim of right ever since\u201d;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (4) \u201c[t]he deed from [Mellon\u2019s predecessor] contains the following [sentence]: \u2018[t]he premises are subject to certain pole line rights of [SNET].\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The referee recommended that judgment enter in favor of Centuiy on the ground that SNET possessed a right \u201cakin to a prescriptive easement.\u201d The trial court summarily accepted the referee\u2019s recommendation. Mellon appealed from this judgment to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). Shortly after filing his appeal, Mellon requested that the trial court articulate the basis on which it overruled his objections to the recommendation. In its articulation, the trial court recited the reasoning of the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The central question in this case is whether SNET had the authority to grant a license to Century. In the absence of such authority, Century concedes that the license is a nullity. Century claims, however, that SNET does possess the requisite authority under either Connecticut law or federal law. We are not persuaded on either count. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">We begin our analysis with SNET\u2019s authority to grant the license to Century under the law of Connecticut. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>a threshold matter, Century has stipulated that neither Mellon nor any of his predecessors in interest granted a written easement to SNET. In addition, Century concedes that SNET does not possess an easement by prescription.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, Century claims that SNET has what Century now styles an \u201ceasement by estoppel.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In support of this claim, Century has called to our attention the only reported case in which any court in the state of Connecticut has ever considered an easement by estoppel, <em>Foldeak </em>v. <em>Incerto, </em>6 Conn. Cir. Ct. 416, 274 A.2d 724, cert. denied, 160 Conn. 567, 269 A.2d 293 (1970). Even if <em>Foldeak' </em>were binding authority upon this court \u2014 which it is not \u2014 it would not avail Century. In <em>Foldeak, </em>the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court explained an easement by estoppel as follows: \u201cAn easement by estoppel arises when a grantor voluntarily imposes an apparent servitude on his property and another person, acting reasonably, believes that such servitude is permanent and in reliance upon that belief either does something he would not otherwise have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>done or refrains from doing something that he would otherwise have done.\u201d Id., 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">This passage alludes to the three essential elements of estoppel, translated into the context of easements: (1) the party against whom estoppel is asserted must induce a belief in another person that certain facts exist; (2) the other party must change its position in reliance on that belief; and (3) that party must suffer some injury as a result of such reliance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Chotkowski </em>v. <em>State, </em>240 Conn. 246, 268, 690 A.2d 368 (1997); <em>Boyce </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 375, 385, 673 A.2d 77 (1996); <em>Herbert, S. Newman &amp; Partners, P.C. </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 768, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996); <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Waste Management of Connecticut, Inc., </em>234 Conn. 221, 246, 662 A.2d 1179 (1995). In addition, it is well settled that a party who has not engaged in \u201cmisleading conduct\u201d cannot be estopped. See, e.g., <em>Boyce </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 383-84 (\u201cestoppel stems from the voluntary conduct of a party whereby he is absolutely precluded . . . from asserting rights . . . against another person, who has in good faith relied upon such conduct, and has been led thereby to change his position for the worse\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Novella </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>163 Conn. 552, 564, 316 A.2d 394 (1972) (\u201c[t]here must generally be some intended deception in the conduct or declarations of the party to be estopped, or such gross negligence on his part as amounts to constructive fraud\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Spear-Newman, Inc. </em>v. <em>Modern Floors </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number><em>Corp., </em>149 Conn. 88, 91, 175 A.2d 565 (1961) (\u201c[e]stoppel rests on the misleading conduct of one party to the prejudice of the other\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Relying on <em>Foldeak, </em>Century argues that Mellon should be estopped from asserting that SNET possessed no authority to grant the license to Century, for the following reason: \u201cSNET must reasonably have inferred from its long and unchallenged use of the pole line that it had an easement. SNET entered into the license agreement with Century relying on that belief. Century then strung cable on the pole line and has provided service to customers by the use of the pole line. By his conduct in acquiescing to the appearance upon which SNET and then Century relied, Mellon is estopped to challenge the existence [or the license] of the easement.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Century has presented no evidence in support of its argument, notwithstanding the fact that it bears the burden of proof.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *5 See, e.g., <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners, P. C. </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 768; <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>218 Conn. 681, 699, 590 A.2d 957 (1991). In fact, Century adduced no evidence that tends to support <em>any </em>element of estoppel, let alone all three of them. More specifically, the record before this court is devoid of any evidence that: (1) either Mellon or any of his predecessors in interest somehow misled SNET into believing that it could license the pole line \u2014 which is situated on Mellon\u2019s property \u2014 to third parties;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) SNET changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>its position in reliance upon a misleading representation made by Mellon or his predecessors;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> *****7 or (3) SNET suffered any injury as a result of such reliance. For this reason, the present appeal is readily distinguishable from Foldeak,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the only case upon which Century relies. In short, the facts contained in the record have nothing to do with either the elements of estoppel or the concerns of \u201cequity and good conscience\u201d that support its invocation. <em>Boyce </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. </em>Co., supra, 236 Conn. 384. Accordingly, Century\u2019s claims under Connecticut law must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">We turn now to Century\u2019s claim that federal law authorizes SNET to grant the license. Century has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>advanced two separate arguments, each of which relies upon a different section of the Federal Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 521 et seq. We consider each argument below.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Although Century has argued before this court that 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 224 (f) authorizes SNET to license use of the pole line, it neglected to either (1) raise this statute before the trial court<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or (2) preserve its claim under this statute for our review as an alternative ground for affirmance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>Century may not try its case on one theory and appeal on another. See, e.g., <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>174 Conn. 234, 236, 386 A.2d 216 (1978); <em>Holley </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>154 Conn. 228, 235, 224 A.2d 727 (1966); <em>Fischer Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>137 Conn. 399, 404, 78 A.2d 242 (1951). More than twenty years ago, we stated that \u201c[i]t is this court\u2019s well-established general rule that \u2018[o]nly in the most exceptional circumstances can and will this court consider a claim . . . that has not been raised and decided in the trial court. \u2019 \u201d <em>Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>173 Conn. 462, 466, 378 A.2d 547 (1977); accord <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>227 Conn. 829, 845, 633 A.2d 296 (1993); <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Loiseau, </em>223 Conn. 786, 828, 614 A.2d 414 (1992); <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>206 Conn. 267, 276, 537 A.2d 1004 (1988); see Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 (\u201c[t]he court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial\u201d). We will not review unpreserved claims unless \u201cthe existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>198 Conn. 77, 87-88, 502 A.2d 388 (1985). <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>199 Conn. 481, 489 n.10, 508 A.2d 22 (1986). <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>212 Conn. 217, 222, 561 A.2d 941 (1989).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>A-G Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pepperidge Farm, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 200, 211, 579 A.2d 69 (1990). Under certain circumstances, this \u201cfundamental [of] appellate procedure\u201d; <em>Basset </em>v. <em>Mechanics Bank, </em>116 Conn. 730, 731, 166 A. 385 (1933); may even bar litigants from asserting new claims that implicate rights under the constitution. See, e.g., <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>supra, 846; <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Loiseau, </em>supra, 828; <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>186 Conn. 654, 658, 443 A.2d 906 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">In the present appeal, Century has not attempted to identify any \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d and our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>independent review of the record discloses nothing about its claim under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 224 (f) that warrants our review.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deem this argument waived. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>193 Conn. 238, 259, 476 A.2d 550 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>188 Conn. 406, 413, 450 A.2d 356 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 65-66, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). For these reasons, Century\u2019s claim under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 224 (f) is not properly before us, and we decline to \u201cresurrect it on appeal.\u201d <em>Larsen Chelsey Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Larsen, </em>232 Conn. 480, 526, 656 A.2d 1009 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Although both the referee and the trial court decided this case on the basis of Connecticut law,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Century preserved its claim under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 541 (a) (2) in both the brief that it submitted to the referee<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the appendix to the brief that it submitted to the trial court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>Section 541 (a) (2) provides that \u2014 with certain exceptions not relevant to the present appeal \u2014 \u201c[a]ny franchise shall be construed to authorize the construction of a cable system over public rights-of-way, and through easements.\u201d Century does not claim that Mellon\u2019s land is a \u201cpublic right-of-way\u201d within the meaning of this statute, and we have previously concluded that SNET does not possess an easement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 541 (a) (2) has nothing to do with the present appeal, and Century\u2019s argument to the contrary is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the plaintiff and for further proceedings to determine the amount of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-9\"> The stipulation also provides that \u201c[when] Mellon acquired [his land], the pole line existed and has been openly, visibly, continuously and uninterruptedly used by CL&amp;P under a claim of right ever since . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b818-5\"> This concession comports with General Statutes \u00a7 16-237, entitled \u201cNo prescriptive right,\u201d which provides: <em>\u201cNo person or corporation building and maintaining telegraph, telephone or electric light or power wires or fixtures, or electrical wires, conductors or fixtures of any kind shall, by reason of any occupation or use of any buildings or lands for the support of the wires of such person or corporation, or by reason of such wires passing over or through any buildings or lands, acquire by the continuance of such use or occupation any prescriptive right to so occupy or use the same. </em>No length of possession, user or occupancy of any buildings or land, or adverse to any easement therein or right thereto belonging to a telegraph, telephone or electric light or power corporation, and used or acquired for use for its corporate purposes, shall create or continue any right in or to such land, or adverse to any such easement.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b818-6\"> The referee held, and the trial court agreed, that SNET possessed a right that was \u201cakin to a prescriptive easement . . . .\u201d The trial court, in its articulation, held that \u201c[s]ince [Mellon] is not seeking to terminate SNET\u2019s use of the pole line, he has waived his right, or <em>is estopped to object to the use by [Century], </em>which is indistinguishable from SNET\u2019s.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

Although the trial court did mention two federal cases in its articulation, the first was cited for the proposition that \u201cthe state law in Connecticut is consistent with the federal law and, therefore . . . preemption does not apply,\u201d while the second was cited in support of the argument that \u2014 pursuant to <em>state </em>law (specifically, General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>\u00a7 16-237) \u2014 Mellon either \u201cwaived his right, or is estopped . . . .\u201d Neither of these references supports Century\u2019s belated invocation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 224 (f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b824-7\"> Furthermore, Mellon has alerted this court to the fact that the only reported decision that has considered 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 224 (f) found that it violated the United States constitution, for the following reason: Pursuant to \u00a7 224 (f), \u201c[a] utility ... is required to provide any cable television system . . . with nondiscriminatory access to its poles and conduits. . . . Such access is a permanent physical occupation of property, effectively divesting a utility of its right to exclude. . . . [This] permanent occupation of a utility\u2019s poles and conduits amounts to a per se taking of property under <em>Loretto </em>[v. <em>Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </em>458 U.S. 419, 102 S.
