We conclude that the Probate Court was so authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The following relevant facts were set forth in affidavits submitted by both parties in support of their competing motions for summary judgment. In 1983, the defendant, Edith A. Saunders, was appointed conservatrix of the person and estate of her son, James A. Saunders III (Jamie), by the Probate Court for the district of Newtown. The appointment was made as a result of a motor vehicle accident that caused Jamie to suffer impairment of his mental and intellectual functions, as well as neurological deficits affecting his speech, hearing, balance and gait. Since 1983, due to his permanent and total disability, Jamie has been the recipient of benefits under the Title XIX Medicaid Program (medicaid), which is administered in Connecticut by the state department of social services (department), and has resided in long-term care facilities and rehabilitation centers with his care funded by medicaid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In 1989, Jamie was a resident patient at the New Medico/High Watch Rehabilitation Center in New Hampshire, undergoing rehabilitation for the injuries suffered in the motor vehicle accident, when he fell down a flight of stairs at a residential unit on the premises. Immediately thereafter, Jamie was taken to Huggins Hospital in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, which, despite Jamie\u2019s temporary loss of consciousness and temporary paralysis, neglected to take cervical X rays. Following his release from Huggins Hospital, Jamie\u2019s condition deteriorated, resulting in his being transported by ambulance to the Memorial Hospital in North <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Conway, New Hampshire, where X rays revealed fractures to his cervical spine. He was then transferred to the Maine Medical Center, where he underwent a surgical procedure known as cervical fusion. As a consequence of these events, Jamie, who was rendered a quadriplegic for an extended period of time, has a substantial and permanent impairment to his upper and lower extremities, leaving him unable to walk without assistance or to perform the functions normally associated with healthy arms, shoulders and hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Saunders thereafter commenced an action in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire against Huggins Hospital, the physician who had examined Jamie, and Medico/High Watch Rehabilitation Center alleging, inter alia, medical negligence and negligent care and supervision. In 1994, a settlement agreement was reached that provided for those named defendants to pay Saunders, as Jamie\u2019s conservatrix, $1,800,000. The enforceability of the settlement was conditioned upon the approval of the Probate Court for the district of Newtown. Saunders applied to the Probate Court to compromise the claim for an aggregate gross settlement of that amount with the following proposed distribution: $600,000 for attorney\u2019s fees; $40,351.95 for the costs of bringing the action; and $579,824.03 for reimbursement to the state of Connecticut in discharge of its lien on the settlement proceeds acquired pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17b-94.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This left $579,824.02 as net settlement proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>As part of her amended application to compromise and settle Jamie\u2019s claim, Saunders requested that the net settlement amount be placed in an irrevocable supplemental needs trust (trust) for Jamie\u2019s benefit. According to the applications, the proposed trust would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>provide for Jamie\u2019s supplemental needs during his lifetime. The department was named the remainderman of the trust estate upon Jamie\u2019s death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> *3 The terms of the proposed trust were drafted in conformity with the specifications of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p (d) (4) (A)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in an attempt to ensure that the value of the trust would not be considered an available resource for the purpose of determining ongoing medicaid eligibility and, therefore, would not adversely affect Jamie\u2019s eligibility to continue receiving medicaid benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Following a hearing in February, 1994, the Probate Court approved the settlement, conditioned upon Saunders placing the net settlement proceeds in a restricted account pending a hearing at which the approval for the establishment of a trust would be determined. The department stipulated that it would not consider the amount held in the restricted account in determining Jamie\u2019s continued eligibility for Title XIX medical assistance benefits until such time as the Probate Court ruled on Saunders\u2019 request to create the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In April, 1994, a hearing was held in the Probate Court to address that part of Saunders\u2019 amended application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>seeking authorization to establish the trust as part of the settlement of the estate\u2019s negligence claim. The department objected to the creation of the trust, claiming that: (1) Saunders is not authorized to establish the trust and the Probate Court is not authorized to approve the funding of the trust with the net settlement proceeds of the negligence claim; and (2) the department had not consented, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17b-85, formerly \u00a7 17-82j,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to the proposed disposition of Jamie\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Citing to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-655 (e),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p (d) (4) (A), the Probate Court approved Saunders\u2019 application to create an irrevocable supplemental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>needs trust for Jamie\u2019s benefit and to fund the trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>with the net settlement proceeds. The Probate Court concluded that federal legislation permits the creation of the trust for the benefit of a medicaid recipient without disqualifying him from eligibility to continue to receive services under Title XIX and that such trust is not prohibited by Connecticut law.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Thereafter, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-186,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> *****7 claiming that the Probate Court improperly had authorized the trust, the department appealed to the trial court to vacate and set aside the Probate Court decree permitting Saunders to establish an irrevocable inter vivos <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>trust funded with the net proceeds recovered in settlement of the negligence action filed on Jamie\u2019s behalf. Saunders moved for summary judgment, claiming that there were no material facts in dispute and that she was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Making the same assertions, the department filed a cross motion for summary judgment. The trial court concluded that the Probate Court was not empowered to authorize or approve the creation of the trust. Specifically, the trial court held that the Probate Court was without statutory authority to enter the decree permitting Saunders to establish the irrevocable inter vivos trust and, further, that it could not authorize the trust pursuant to its equitable powers because the equitable powers of a probate court can be exercised only <em>when necessary </em>to carry out prescribed statutory duties. Finally, following a motion for articulation as to whether the doctrine of substituted judgment is recognized in Connecticut and whether Saunders\u2019 creation of the trust fell within that doctrine, the trial court concluded that the doctrine was not an independent ground upon which the Probate Court could have authorized the creation of the trust because the doctrine had been codified in \u00a7 45a-655 (e), which the trial court had already concluded was inapplicable. Accordingly, the trial court granted the department\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Saunders appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court and, pursuant to Practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Book \u00a7 65-1, formerly \u00a7 4023, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c), this court transferred the appeal to itself. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In furtherance of her argument that the trial court improperly held that the Probate Court was not authorized to permit the establishment of the trust in question, Saunders advances three claims. First, she claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the broad power statutorily granted to her, as conservatrix, and to the Probate Court to \u201cmanage\u201d award\u2019s estate, under \u00a7 45a-655 (a), did not include the power of the Probate Court to authorize establishment of the trust. Second, Saunders asserts that the trial court improperly concluded that the authorization of the establishment of the trust was not within the Probate Court\u2019s equitable or implied powers. Finally, Saunders claims that the trial court improperly concluded that she and the Probate Court were not empowered to establish the trust under the doctrine of substituted judgment. We agree with Saunders\u2019 first claim, which is dispositive of this appeal, and, therefore, we need not consider her remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Before addressing the parties\u2019 arguments, we set forth the applicable standard of review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on motions for summary judgment. \u201cSummary judgment \u2018shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>235 Conn. 185, 202, 663 A.2d 1001 (1995), quoting Practice Book \u00a7 384, now \u00a7 17-49. \u201cThe scope of our appellate review depends upon the proper characterization of the rulings made by the trial court. . . . When . . . the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>SLI International Corp. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>236 Conn. 156, 163, 671 A.2d 813 (1996). The trial court was presented with cross motions for summary judgment based on undisputed facts. Therefore, our review is plenary and we must determine whether the court\u2019s conclusions are \u201clegally and logically correct\u201d and are supported by the record. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Saunders first claims that at the time of the establishment of the trust, the authority to permit the creation of such a trust was conferred upon the Probate Court by \u00a7 45a-655 (a), which defines, inter alia, the duties of conservators, and provides in part that \u201c[t]he conservator <em>shall manage </em>all the estate and apply so much of the net income thereof, and, if necessary, any part of the principal of the property, which is required to support the ward . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Saunders argues that, because the Probate Court, through a conservatrix, also has the duty to manage an estate, the Probate Court possessed the authority to authorize her creation of the trust. The department contends that the authority to manage Jamie\u2019s estate did not include the authority to divest the estate of its assets by transferring them to an inter vivos trustee. Although a recent amendment to \u00a7 45a-655 expressly authorizes probate courts to create the specific type of trust at issue in this appeal; see Public Acts 1998, No. 98-232, \u00a7 2; the relevant inquiry is whether, at the time of the establishment of the trust in April, 1994, the Probate Court was vested with such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">When interpreting a statute, we are guided by well established tenets of statutory construction. \u201c[0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Furthermore, [w]e presume that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes . . . and that [sjtatutes are to be interpreted with regard to other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 663-64, 680 A.2d 242 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">We examine first the words of the statute itself. Section 45a-655 (a) provides in part that \u201c[t]he conservator <em>shall manage </em>all the estate and apply so much of the net income thereof, and, if necessary, any part of the principal of the property, which is required to support the ward . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The word \u201cmanage\u201d is not defined in the General Statutes relating to conservatorships. Moreover, the legislative history provides no guidance as to the meaning to be ascribed to the word \u201cmanage.\u201d We have declared that \u201c \u2018[i]f a statute or regulation does not sufficiently define a term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>240 Conn. 766, 771, 695 A.2d 525 (1997), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 809, 640 A.2d 986 (1994); see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) defines \u201cmanage\u201d as follows: \u201cTo control and direct, to administer, to take charge of. To conduct; to carry on the concerns of a business or establishment. Generally applied to affairs that are somewhat complicated and that involve skill and judgment.\u201d Although it would be infeasible to enumerate statutorily every permissible action a conservator might take in the management of a ward\u2019s estate, application of the above definition to the word \u201cmanage\u201d in \u00a7 45a-655 (a) results in a statutory grant of wide-scale authority to the conservator that is, we believe, broad enough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>to encompass the creation of the trust at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">We consider next the legislative history of \u00a7 45a-655. Although at the time of the creation of the trust there was nothing in that history to assist us in defining the parameters of a conservator\u2019s authority and power to manage a ward\u2019s estate, legislative activity regarding the creation of inter vivos trusts that took place subsequent to the circumstances giving rise to this appeal, is instructive on the issue before us. First, we consider No. 98-232 of the 1998 Public Acts (P.A. 98-232), which amended General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45a-151<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 45a-655,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>effective October 1, 1998, to authorize probate courts to permit the creation of trusts. Although the passage of the amendment demonstrates clearly the legislature\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>intent that probate courts be vested with the authority to permit the creation of trusts, the question remains whether the legislature had such an intent when it enacted \u00a7 45a-655.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Both parties rely on the 1998 amendment to \u00a7 45a-655 (amendment) to support their respective positions. The department claims that by amending the statute, the legislature demonstrated its intent to change existing law. Therefore, according to the department, prior to the passage of the amendment, probate courts did not possess the authority to authorize the establishment of trusts. In contrast, Saunders argues that the legislature was merely restoring to the probate courts a power they possessed until they were stripped of it by the trial court in the present case. Based upon express statements contained in the legislative history of the amendment, we agree with Saunders.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">We have recognized a \u201cpresumption that, in enacting a statute, the legislature intended to effect a change in existing law.\u201d <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>193 Conn. 506, 513, 479 A.2d 208 (1984). Moreover, it should not be presumed that \u201cthe legislature has enacted futile or meaningless legislation or that a change in a law was made without a reason.\u201d <em>City Council </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>180 Conn. 243, 251, 429 A.2d 481 (1980). The presumption that the enactment of a statute demonstrates a legislative intent to change existing law, however, \u201cmay be rebutted by contrary evidence of the legislative intent in the particular case.\u201d <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 513-14. The present discussion involves an amendment, rather than the enactment, of a statute. Although we have stated that subsequent amendments are <em>generally </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>irrelevant when determining legislative intent at the time of the enactment of the underlying bill; <em>State </em>v. McVeigh, 224 Conn. 593, 619-21, 620 A.2d 133 (1993); we have noted that \u201c[a]n amendment which in effect construes and clarifies a prior statute must be accepted as the legislative declaration of the meaning of the original act.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 514. Therefore, whether the legislature intended to change or merely clarify existing law is critical to our decision on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">\u201cIn order to determine whether an act should be characterized as clarifying legislation [with attendant retroactive effect], we look to the legislative history to determine the legislative intent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>204 Conn. 259, 278, 528 A.2d 760 (1987). The legislative history of the amendment supports the conclusion that the amendment was meant to clarify rather than to change the original meaning of \u00a7 45a-655. One factor we have deemed to be significant in determining the clarifying character of legislation is that the legislation was enacted in direct response to a judicial decision that the legislature deemed incorrect. See, e.g., State v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 557-58, 522 A.2d 753 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">On the floor of the House of Representatives, Representative Michael P. Lawlor, in explaining the purpose of the amendment, stated: \u201cThis bill is intended to once again <em>restore </em>to the probate court, jurisdiction that traditionally our courts have always had until a recent decision of our State [Superior] Court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In cases involving claims in tort where a beneficiary has a claim against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>another person, the probate court always exercises jurisdiction over the trusts which were created on behalf of a person who may be incompetent. The court case which was relatively recent took that jurisdiction away from the probate court. This bill <em>restores </em>it. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 41 H.R. Proc., Pt. 13, 1998 Sess., p. 4406. Furthermore, Deborah Tedford, an attorney testifying in favor of the bill before the House of Representatives judiciary committee, stated: \u201cWe\u2019re also concerned that trusts for other legitimate purposes such as estate planning are also being circumscribed by this court ruling. It is for that reason that <em>we want this statute to clarify what we believe is a statement of existing law that Connecticut probate courts do have the authority and jurisdiction to establish trusts in appropriate </em>situations.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 4, 1998 Sess., p. 1065.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 11 The foregoing demonstrates clearly that the proponents of the bill believed that, prior to the trial court\u2019s decision in this case, probate courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>were vested with the authority to permit the creation of trusts. Once the trial court divested probate courts of this authority, however, the legislature sought to restore it.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Finally, we note that the final sentence of the amendment provides that \u201c[t]he provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to validate or invalidate any gifts made by a conservator or the estate prior to October 1, 1998.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> P.A. 98-232, \u00a7 2. The department argues that this language demonstrates the legislature\u2019s intent that the amendment not apply retroactively.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Initially, we reiterate \u201c[t]he general rule . . . that when a legislative act is intended to clarify existing law it necessarily has retroactive effect.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Green </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>245 Conn. 66, 78, 712 A.2d 938 (1998). Furthermore, although the language of the amendment states that the provisions of subsection (e) of \u00a7 45a-655 shall not be construed to validate gifts made prior to October 1, 1998, we note that we do not rely on the new provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>themselves to support our conclusion that the Probate Court possessed the authority, in 1994, to permit the creation of the trust. Rather, we rely on the legislative history of the amendment, which clearly demonstrates that the courts already possessed such authority. The distinction, though subtle, is crucial.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Additionally, we note that the final sentence of the amendment refers to <em>gifts </em>made by a conservator. In addition to providing for gifts, however, the amendment provides for the transfer of assets into trusts, including the kind at issue in this appeal, that is, one created for the sole benefit of the ward. A transfer of assets into such a trust is not a gift. Because the amendment recognizes the distinction between gifts and such transfers, and the limitation contained in the final sentence relates only to gifts, it is clear that the restriction does not pertain to a transfer of assets into a trust made for the ward\u2019s own benefit and is inapplicable under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">We next consider a bill that was raised but not enacted into law. Raised House Bill No. 6673, \u00a7 5 (January Session 1995) (H.B. 6673), if passed, would have amended \u00a7 45a-655 to provide a new subsection (f), which would have provided in pertinent part: \u201cThe probate court, in carrying out its obligation to preserve and protect the assets of the ward, may, through the conservator of the estate, after notice and hearing, establish, create or fund one or more trusts to be administered under the supervision of the probate court for the purpose of better management of the assets of the ward if the court determines that the creation of such trust is in the best interest of the ward. . . .\u201d This bill was raised in January, 1995, approximately nine months after the trust at issue in this case was proposed. The department implies that the failure of the bill to be enacted supports its argument that probate courts did not have the authority to permit the creation of inter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>vivos trusts prior to October 1,1998. By contrast, Saunders argues that such a contention is pure conjecture and is not reliable evidence. We agree with Saunders.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">House Bill 6673 was never subjected to a vote on the floor of the legislature. As Saunders notes, there is no definitive record as to the reasons for this. As we noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>245 Conn. 209, 230-31 n.24, 715 A.2d 680 (1998): \u201c[Rjeliance on legislative silence is misplaced. It is a basic tenet of statutory construction that we rely on the intent of the legislature as that intent has been <em>expressed. Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>134 Conn. 295, 301, 57 A.2d 128 (1948) .... Ordinarily, we are reluctant to draw inferences regarding legislative intent from the failure of a legislative committee to report a bill to the floor, because in most cases the reasons for that lack of action remain unexpressed and thus obscured in the mist of committee inactivity. <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 518 n.19, 613 A.2d 748 (1992).\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Accordingly, the failure of the bill to pass does not necessarily support the department\u2019s argument, especially when an equally plausible alternative argument exists. Saunders asserts that- the legislature may have determined that probate courts already possessed such authority and, therefore, no amendment to the statute was necessary until the trial court divested the courts of such authority. This assertion finds strong support in the comments of Representative Lawlor, as quoted previously, and Representative Richard D. Tulisano. See footnote 13 of this opinion. Echoing our words in <em>Miranda, </em>we note that the existence of more than one plausible explanation for the failure of H.B. 6673 \u201cbest illustrates that one guess is as good as the other, and is the epitome of why we cannot engage in this kind of speculation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>supra, 230-31 n.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>In summary, the legislative history leaves little doubt that the legislature believed that, at the time of the creation of the trust, probate courts possessed the authority to authorize the establishment of such trusts. Although the failure of H.B. 6673 to be enacted into law is not reliable evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent pertaining to this issue, the legislative history of the amendment provides sufficient evidence to support Saunders\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 45a-655. We conclude, therefore, that at the time of the trust\u2019s creation, the Probate Court was vested with the authority to approve Saunders\u2019 establishment of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Our conclusion is fully supported by this court\u2019s precedent regarding conservators. In <em>Marcus\u2019 Appeal from Probate, </em>199 Conn. 524, 528, 509 A.2d 1 (1986), we discussed the role of conservators as follows: \u201cA conservator has only such powers as are expressly or impliedly given to him by statute. ... A conservator of the estate, under our law, is a person appointed by the court of probate under the provisions of [General Statutes c. 779, now c. 802h] to supervise the financial affairs of a person found to be incapable of managing his or her own affairs .... General Statutes \u00a7 45-70a (a) [now \u00a7 45a-644 (a)].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) \u201cA conservator of an estate owes a duty of loyalty to a ward.\u201d <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Kleinman, </em>186 Conn. 63, 65, 438 A.2d 1196 (1982). As discussed previously, we believe that the authority to create a trust is within the broad authority to manage a ward\u2019s estate conferred upon conservators by \u00a7 45a-655 (a). It may be fairly stated that the power is \u201cimpliedly given to [a conservator] by statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Marcus\u2019 Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 528; <em>Stempel </em>v. <em>Middletown Trust Co., </em>127 Conn. 206, 221, 222, 15 A.2d 305 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>In <em>Marcus\u2019 Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 528-29, we also discussed the relationship between conservators and probate courts, noting that, \u201c[i]n exercising [its statutory] powers, [a conservator] is under the supervision and control of the Probate Court. <em>Elmendorf v. Poprocki, </em>155 Conn. 115, 118, 230 A.2d 1 (1967). . . . The probate court is a court of limited jurisdiction and has only such powers as are given it by statute or are reasonably to be implied in order to carry out its statutory powers. <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Sheffield, </em>158 Conn. 286, 293-94, 259 A.2d 621 (1969); <em>Palmer v. Reeves, </em>120 Conn. 405, 408, 182 A. 138 (1935). . . . The Probate Court is under an affirmative duty to protect the assets of an incompetent\u2019s estate. <em>Marshall v. Kleinman, </em>[supra, 186 Conn. 69].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Finally, we stated that \u201c[t]he court, and <em>not the conservator, </em>is primarily entrusted with the care and management of the ward\u2019s estate, and, in many respects, the conservator is but the agent of the court.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Marcus\u2019 Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">\u201c [I]t is clear that the conservator acts under the supervision and control of the Probate Court in the care and management of the ward\u2019s estate.\u201d Id. Under our law, the Probate Court in the present case was under a duty to protect Jamie\u2019s assets, and Saunders, the conservatrix, as an arm of the Probate Court, was under the same obligation. By establishing the medicaid-exempt supplemental needs trust in conformance with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p (d) (4) (A) with the assets recovered in a third party tort claim, Saunders, and the Probate Court, through Saunders, were managing and protecting Jamie\u2019s finances in his best interests, consistent with their duties as defined by statute and in our case law. If the trust had not been established, the settlement from the tort action would be available to Jamie, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>would then be ineligible for medicaid assistance. Saunders would be forced to exhaust the settlement to meet Jamie\u2019s medical needs before reapplying for medicaid assistance. Without medicaid providing the ward\u2019s basic medical needs, the tort settlement would be depleted much more quickly than if it were used merely to supplement medicaid assistance. Once he became eligible again for medicaid, Jamie would receive medicaid assistance but would have no assets remaining with which to provide for his supplemental needs. By contrast, with the creation of the trust, Jamie will retain his medicaid eligibility and Saunders can provide for his supplemental needs from the trust assets, while medicaid provides for his basic medical care. Therefore, not only is the latter course of action clearly the better one for Jamie, it may be fairly stated that by failing to follow it, the Probate Court and Saunders potentially could have been deemed to be in dereliction of their duties to Jamie.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The department argues that the authority to manage Jamie\u2019s estate does not include the authority to divest the estate by transferring its assets to an inter vivos trustee. Specifically, the department claims that the duty to manage the estate imposes upon Saunders, as conservatrix, a duty to \u201cmarshall [Jamie\u2019s] assets, to assume possession and assume control of [his] property.\u201d According to the department, the duty does not confer upon Saunders the authority to \u201celiminate [Jamie\u2019s] estate in its entirety and transfer it to a trustee.\u201d The department contends that the duty of management does not imply the authority to create the trust in question. For the reasons discussed earlier in this opinion, we disagree. Moreover, the department\u2019s concern that Jamie retain title to the assets that were used to fund the trust elevates form over substance. Although transferring a ward\u2019s assets into a trust does indeed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>divest the ward of legal title to the assets,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the ward remains the sole person who can benefit from the trust.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Jamie is, therefore, the equitable owner of the assets. As noted above, creation of the trust permits Jamie to benefit from the tort settlement for a much longer period of time than he would if the trust were not allowed. Legal title to the assets would be a meaningless possession if purchased at the cost of years worth of additional supplemental needs. We therefore see no reason to hold that legal title to Jamie\u2019s assets must remain with him when his best interests clearly militate in favor of the creation of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The department also claims that the proposed transfer of Jamie\u2019s assets to the trust would constitute an improper delegation of the Probate Court\u2019s responsibility, acting through the conservator, to manage his estate. Specifically, the department argues that the Probate Court\u2019s authority to review actions of a trustee of an inter vivos trust is not comparable to its plenary authority to manage a ward\u2019s estate. The department states that the trustee\u2019s use of trust funds for Jamie\u2019s benefit is defined in the trust agreement, not in state law, and the authority of the reviewing probate court is essentially limited to determining whether the trustee has acted consistently with the terms of the trust. We note, however, that creation of the trust requires probate court approval. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-655 (e); P.A. 98-232, \u00a7 2. Therefore, the court may exert considerable influence over the terms of the trust, thus ensuring that the trust would be managed to the court\u2019s satisfaction. Moreover, the Probate Court will have jurisdiction over Saunders\u2019 accounts in her capacity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>as conservatrix, under \u00a7 45a-655 (c).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The statutorily granted power to demand periodic accounting of a conservatrix further demonstrates the court\u2019s continuing supervision of Saunders and her use of the trust assets. Finally, under General Statutes \u00a7 45a-175 (c) (l),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>which provides that \u201c[a]ny beneficiary of an inter vivos trust may petition a court of probate having jurisdiction under [\u00a7 45a-175] for an accounting by the trustee,\u201d the department, as remainderman of the trust, will have standing to petition for an accounting should it question the trustee\u2019s use of the trust assets. Therefore, although the form of ownership of Jamie\u2019s estate will change, Saunders\u2019 responsibilities will remain the same and the Probate Court will continue to have jurisdiction over her as both conservatrix and trustee. Accordingly, the creation of the trust is not an impermissible delegation of a conservator\u2019s duty over a ward\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Finally, the department relies on two statutory provisions to support its contention that, in 1994, probate courts lacked the authority to permit the establishment of trusts. First, the department cites \u00a7 45a-655 (d), which provides in pertinent part: \u201cIn the case of any person receiving public or medical assistance . . . the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>conservator of the estate shall apply toward the cost of care of such person any assets exceeding limits on assets set by statute or regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Social Services. . . .\u201d Essentially, the department claims that this provision requires Saunders as conservatrix to apply all assets toward the cost of Jamie\u2019s medical care rather than allowing her to place the assets in trust for Jamie\u2019s supplemental needs. Second, the department cites \u00a7 17b-85, which provides in relevant part that no person supported in whole or in part by state financial assistance \u201cshall sell, assign, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any property without the consent of the commissioner [of social services], . . .\u201d The department argues that the transfer of Jamie\u2019s assets into an irrevocable trust, which transfers title to Saunders as conservatrix without the department\u2019s approval, is a statutorily impermissible transfer.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In response, Saunders claims that the supremacy clause of the United States constitution and the doctrine of federal preemption bar the invocation of these two statutory provisions to block the transfer of the settlement proceeds into the trust in question. Although we arrive at the same result as Saunders, we reach that destination by a different route.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">As we have previously noted, the legislature recently amended \u00a7 45a-655 to restore to the probate courts the authority to approve the creation of trusts. Because \u201c[w]e presume that laws are enacted in view of existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>relevant statutes . . . and that [statutes are to be interpreted with regard to other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law\u201d; (citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 664; we presume that the legislature passed the amendment with full knowledge of the existence and intended applications of \u00a7\u00a7 45a-655 (d) and 17b-85. Clearly, the legislature does not believe that these provisions could be employed to bar the creation of trusts.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Rather, the passage of the amendment demonstrates the legislature\u2019s intent that \u00a7\u00a7 45a-655 (d) and 17b-85 coexist with the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">We also noted previously herein that the legislative history makes clear that probate courts were already vested with the authority to approve the creation of trusts until the trial court stripped them of that authority. Therefore, what is permissible today was permissible when the trust was created in 1994. Consequently, because \u00a7\u00a7 45a-655 (d) and 17b-85 willnotbar the establishment of a trust today, likewise, they could not do so when the trust was proposed in 1994. Because we conclude that the legislature did not intend for these provisions to be used as the department proposes, we need not address Saunders\u2019 supremacy clause or preemption arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>In summary, we hold that the Probate Court possessed the statutory authority, pursuant to \u00a7 45a-655 (a), to authorize Saunders, as an agent of the Probate Court, to establish the trust in question. Having so concluded, and having deemed inapplicable the statutes that the department asserts operated, in 1994, as a bar to the trust\u2019s creation, we next briefly turn our attention to the department\u2019s opposition to Saunders\u2019 motion for summary judgment. We note that the department asserted no other basis upon which to deny Saunders\u2019 motion. Additionally, as evidenced by the parties\u2019 filing of cross motions for summary judgment, we note that there are no material facts in dispute. Therefore, we conclude that judgment should be rendered in favor of Saunders.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment for Saunders.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\"> The federal statutes relating to medicaid are codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a et seq. Authorization to the commissioner of social services to participate in the medicaid program is found at General Statutes \u00a7 17b-260 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">At the time of the settlement agreement and the proposed establishment of the trust in this case, the 1993 revision of the General Statutes governed. Since that time, only minor technical changes were made in addition to certain sections being transferred and renumbered. No substantive changes have been made to the relevant statutes. For purposes of clarity, therefore, references throughout this opinion are to the current (1997) revision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17b-94 (formerly \u00a7 17-83f) provides: \u201cState\u2019s claim against proceeds of cause of action.

(Emphasis added.) 41 H.R. Proc., Pt. 13, 1998 Sess., p. 4406. The legislative history makes clear, however, that Representative Lawlor was actually referring to an opinion from the Superior Court rather than from the Supreme Court. Speaking before the judiciary committee, Deborah Tedford, an attorney, stated that \u201c[i]n December of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>1997 a Superior Court judge taking the most narrow possible interpretation of probate court power ruled that our courts do not have [the power to establish trusts] although other judges at other times have taken a contrary position. . . . This is particularly awkward as a number of probate courts over the years have, in fact, authorized the establishment of trusts on behalf of many who came before their courts.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 4, 1998 Sess., p. 1064.

Such an interpretation essentially would allow the commissioner of social services to veto arbitrarily any transaction it chooses to veto. With regard to the present case, this reading of the statute would render virtually meaningless the authority to manage a ward\u2019s estate expressly granted to the Probate Court in \u00a7 45a-655 (a). We do not believe that the legislature intended to create such an inconsistency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b738-6\"> Although we conclude that these provisions are not intended to bar the creation of trusts such as the one at issue in this appeal, we presume that they do serve legislative ends. For example, we have held that \u00a7 17-82j, now \u00a7 1-7b-85, precludes a conservator from disclaiming his ward\u2019s right to receive any portion of her interest as remainderman in a testamentary trust. <em>Dept. of Income Maintenance v.

Although \u00a7 45a-655 (d) has yet to be interpreted by an appellate court in this state, we presume that it likewise furthers a legislative purpose. We need not decide today, however, the precise applications of these statutes. It is enough that we conclude, on the basis of the aforementioned reasons, that they do <em>not </em>serve to bar the creation of trusts as the department suggests.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
