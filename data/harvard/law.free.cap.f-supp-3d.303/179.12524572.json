Knox, injured his hand when his foot inadvertently activated a switch on an allegedly defective metal folding machine. The machine was manufactured by the defendant, Schechtl Maschinenbau GmbH, and distributed by co-defendant MetalForming, Inc. Knox and his wife Jean assert claims against both defendants for negligence, breach of warranty, loss of consortium, and violation of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93A. MetalForming filed crossclaims against Schechtl for indemnification, contribution, and breach of contract. Pending before the Court is Schechtl's motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) to dismiss the claims against it for lack of personal jurisdiction. Both Knox and MetalForming have opposed Schechtl's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that a court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mass.

(Mem. of Law in Supp. of Def. Schechtl Maschinenbau GMBH's Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. A \u00b6 5 (dkt. no. 22-1);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219321\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/26/#p34\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1 [hereinafter \"Distrib. Agreement\"] (dkt. no. 22-2).) Schechtl manufactures heavy industrial equipment for folding and cutting metal parts used in construction projects. The Agreement granted MetalForming the right to function as the exclusive independent distributor of Schechtl's products in the territory comprising Canada, the United States, and Mexico (designated the \"Contract Territory\"). (Distrib. Agreement at 2.) The Agreement stipulated that MetalForming would \"distribute the Products as an independent distributor in its own name and on its own account.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) During the term of the Agreement, Schechtl was excluded from directly selling its products within the Contract Territory without MetalForming's consent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The procedure the parties followed with respect to the sale of any machinery was outlined in the Agreement. After locating a prospective purchaser of a Schechtl product, MetalForming would send a purchase order to Schechtl in Germany. If Schechtl accepted the order, it would issue a written order confirmation. Under the Agreement, MetalForming would take ownership of the machine in Germany. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) MetalForming was responsible for the installation of the machine at the purchaser's site, as well as the training of the purchaser's personnel in the proper use of the machine. MetalForming also agreed to maintain \"a spare part service\" for the machine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) MetalForming further undertook \"to provide any and all warranty services for the Products at its expense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   MetalForming was responsible for marketing and promoting the sale of Schechtl products in the Contract Territory, and to facilitate those activities it received ongoing information \"concerning products, markets, competition, [and] prices\" from Schechtl. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Some sample marketing materials submitted by MetalForming appear to have been prepared by Schechtl. In the sample provided both companies' logos are displayed on various pages, but the contact information provided is for MetalForming. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n of Def. MetalForming, Inc. to Co-Def. Schechtl Maschinenbau GMBH's Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. 8 at 1-61 (dkt. no. 30-3).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Between 2000 and September 2017, MetalForming sold 2,639 Schechtl sheet metal machines throughout the United States at a value of just over $97 million. In Massachusetts specifically, MetalForming sold 45 Schechtl machines and 234 Schechtl parts at a value of nearly $1.5 million between July 2001 and September 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 6 \u00b6\u00b6 16-17 (dkt. no. 30-1).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Schechtl sold the particular machine at issue to MetalForming pursuant to a purchase order dated April 20, 2001. In August 2001, MetalForming sold and delivered the machine to Cape Cod Copper, Knox's employer in Massachusetts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) The respective purchase orders are in the record. They indicate that MetalForming purchased the machine from Schechtl for $25,830, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 9 (dkt. no. 30-3) ), and sold it to Cape Cod Copper for $38,950, (Opp'n of Pls., Stephen D. Knox\n   and Jean Knox, to Def., Schechtl Maschinenbau GMBH's Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. 4 (dkt. no. 29-1) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Schechtl has never owned or leased real or personal property in the Commonwealth. As noted above, Schechtl does not itself directly solicit business from customers in Massachusetts. It has never employed any agents or representatives in Massachusetts, and has never maintained offices, telephone listings, or bank accounts in Massachusetts.

The facts in\n   <em>\n    J. McIntyre\n   </em>\n   pertinent to the question of personal jurisdiction are very similar to the facts of this case.\n   <em>\n    J. McIntyre\n   </em>\n   Machinery, Ltd., a manufacturer in England, sold a machine to an Ohio-based company that served as the exclusive, independent distributor of the manufacturer's products in the United States. The distributor sold one of the manufacturer's machines to a company in New Jersey. The plaintiff in the case, an employee of the New Jersey company, was injured using the machine. Apart from its relationship with the distributor, the English manufacturer had few contacts with the United States, and, crucially, none with New Jersey except for the presence of a small number of its machines in that State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the present case, the pattern of relationships is the same; a European manufacturer sold a machine to an exclusive, independent distributor in the United States, which in turn sold it to an end user, an employee of which was injured using the machine. The only potentially significant factual difference between the two cases is that whereas in\n   <em>\n    J. McIntyre\n   </em>\n   the distributor had sold very few machines in New Jersey, in this case the distributor has sold many Schechtl machines over the years to customers in Massachusetts, and the revenue \"derived\" by Schechtl from those sales was \"substantial\" for state law purposes. If that factual difference between the two cases is significant for the constitutional analysis, then\n   <em>\n    J. McIntyre\n   </em>\n   may be distinguishable. On the other hand, if the factual difference is not significant for the constitutional analysis, then the outcome in\n   <em>\n    J. McIntyre\n   </em>\n   controls the outcome here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The volume of MetalForming's sales of Schechtl machines in Massachusetts and the indirect revenue to Schechtl from those sales are not significant factors in\n   assessing \"purposeful availment\" because those sales were solicited not by the nonresident manufacturer but by the independent U.S. distributor. In this case as in\n   <em>\n    J. McIntyre\n   </em>\n   , under the parties' Agreement it was the distributor, and not the manufacturer, that controlled where machines would be sold in the United States and thus made the important decision whether to avail itself of the opportunity to do business in any particular State. There is no question that Schechtl intended to sell its machines through MetalForming to ultimate buyers located in the United States generally. But, as Justice Breyer pointed out in his concurrence in\n   <em>\n    J.

Where such factors are present, the manufacturer could be found to have signaled to the distributor an intention that the distributor should target a particular State. In such circumstances, the nonresident could be understood to have itself directed its business to the targeted State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   No Massachusetts-specific \"plus\" factor has been identified in this case. Under the parties' Agreement, MetalForming promised generally \"to exert its best efforts to build brand recognition in the Contract Territory for the Company's products and to distribute the Company's products within the Contract Territory and to further the sale of the Company's Products [sic].\" (Distrib. Agreement 2.) The Contract Territory was North America. There was no subordinate territory designated for special attention, and certainly not Massachusetts. As noted above, the Agreement provided that MetalForming would \"distribute the Products as an independent distributor in its own name and on its own account.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) By that provision, the parties essentially agreed that Schechtl would not direct MetalForming's activities. There is no evidence in the record that it did direct those activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Purposeful availment is not simply transitive. That is, while Schechtl may be subject to personal jurisdiction in Georgia because of its contractual relationship with MetalForming,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   it does not automatically become subject to a Massachusetts forum simply because MetalForming may lawfully be sued here. There may be circumstances where one defendant's contacts with Massachusetts might be imputed to a different defendant for jurisdictional purposes, such as when the two are joint venturers or one is an agent for the other.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daynard v. Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson &amp; Poole, P.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9432363\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/290/42/#p62\">\n    290 F.3d 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 62 (1st Cir. 2002). No such relationship is inferable on the relevant factual circumstances in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   It may be tempting to think that because Schechtl has derived, albeit indirectly, \"substantial revenue\" from MetalForming's sales of Schechtl equipment to Massachusetts customers, that benefit itself establishes a sufficient relationship with Massachusetts to warrant subjecting\n   Schechtl to the jurisdiction of Massachusetts courts. It is true that derived revenues may be an appropriate factor in resolving the constitutional question if the\n   <em>\n    manner\n   </em>\n   of derivation itself supports a conclusion of purposeful availment, which is not the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The guiding precedents are quite clear about this: For there to have been \"minimum contacts\" with the forum sufficient to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident of the forum State, there must have been (a) contacts (b) as a result of the nonresident's purposeful availment of contact with the forum. From its origin, the test for \"minimum contacts\" sufficient to justify the exercise of jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant has always been a relational one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Int'l Shoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    326 U.S. at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    66 S.Ct. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the Due Process Clause \"does not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment in personam against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts, ties, or relations.\" (citations omitted) ). Tracing back a nonresident defendant's indirect economic benefits to the forum may in some circumstances have relevance to other aspects of the constitutional analysis. For example, it may bear on the reasonableness of the exercise of jurisdiction through consideration of the so-called \"Gestalt factors.\" But it cannot be substituted for the analysis of purposeful availment, which is necessarily relational.\n   <em>\n    J. McIntyre\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   have made that clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    C.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that Schechtl maintained the required \"minimum contacts\" with Massachusetts to justify subjecting it to personal jurisdiction in this forum. Although \u00a7 3(d) of the Massachusetts long-arm statute would authorize it, the exercise of jurisdiction would not comport with due process. Schechtl's products entered the stream of commerce and found their way into Massachusetts via MetalForming's transaction of business here, but the record fails to establish that Schechtl purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jurisdictional Discovery\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The plaintiffs and MetalForming have both requested the opportunity to conduct jurisdictional discovery.
