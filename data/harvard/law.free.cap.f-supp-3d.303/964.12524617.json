Hovland, District Judge\n   Before the Court are three separate motions for preliminary injunctive relief filed by Kodiak Oil &amp; Gas (USA), Inc., now known as Whiting Resources Corporation, HRC Operating, LLC, and EOG Resources, Inc.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 29, 58, (Case No. 4:14-cv-085) and 26 (Case No. 4:14-cv-087).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motions have been fully briefed by the parties and a hearing on the motions was held on March 13, 2018, in Bismarck, North Dakota.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 67. Also before the Court are several motions to dismiss the complaints of Kodiak Oil, HRC Operating, and EOG Resources (\"Plaintiffs\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 44, 52 (Case No. 4:14-cv-085) and 31 (Case No. 4:14-cv-087). For the reasons set forth below, the Plaintiffs' motions for preliminary injunction (Docket Nos. 29 &amp; 58 (Case No. 4:14-cv-085) and 26 (Case No. 4:14-cv-087) ) are granted and the motions to dismiss the Plaintiffs' complaints (Docket Nos. 44, 52 (Case No. 4:14-cv-085) and 31 (Case No. 4:14-cv-087) ) are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 29, 2014, Kodiak Oil &amp; Gas (USA), Inc., now known as Whiting Resources Corporation (\"Kodiak Oil\"), filed a complaint against Defendants Jolene Burr, Ted Lone Fight, Georgianna Danks, Edward S. Danks, and Judge Diane Johnson, in her capacity as the Chief Judge of the Fort Berthold District Court, seeking a declaration that the Fort Berthold Tribal Court (\"Tribal Court\") lacks jurisdiction over a suit filed by Defendants Jolene Burr, Ted Lone Fight, as well as Georgianna Danks and Edward S. Danks\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in Tribal Court against Kodiak Oil and others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the underlying Tribal Court action, the Tribal Court Plaintiffs seek to recover royalties pursuant to an Oil &amp; Gas Mining Lease for Kodiak and others' improper flaring of natural gas associated with oil wells. Specifically, the Tribal Court Plaintiffs allege they are enrolled members of the Three Affiliated Tribe, owning mineral interests \"within the exterior boundaries\" of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 27-1 (Case No. 4:14-cv-087). In their second amended complaint, the Tribal Court Plaintiffs allege they entered into a mineral lease-\"OIL AND GAS MINING LEASE-ALLOTTED INDIAN LANDS\"-with Kodiak Oil and others, and Kodiak and other oil and gas producers breached paragraph 3(f) of the mineral lease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . On May 4, 2015, Magistrate Judge Charles S. Miller, Jr. ordered the federal court action brought by Kodiak Oil stayed upon agreement of\n   the parties, \"pending further action by the tribal court.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   EOG Resources, Inc. (\"EOG Resources\") also filed a complaint in this Court against Jolene Burr, Ted Lone Fight, Georgianna Danks, Edward S. Danks, and Judge Diane Johnson, in her capacity as the Chief Judge of the Fort Berthold District Court, as well as Yvette Falcon,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in her capacity as the Court Clerk/Consultant of the Three Affiliated Tribes District Court of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, on August 29, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 6 (Case No. 4:14-cv-087). As a named defendant in the same tribal court action brought against Kodiak Oil, EOG Resources similarly seeks a declaration the Tribal Court lacks jurisdiction over the suit filed by the Tribal Court Plaintiffs in Tribal Court. On May 1, 2015, EOG Resources requested a stay of the federal court action due to its pending motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in the tribal court matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 18. Consequently, this Court ordered the federal action stayed \"pending a ruling from the Three Affiliated Tribes District Court and a possible appeal from the tribal court decision.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While both federal court actions were stayed, the matter proceeded in the Tribal Court, with Kodiak Oil and others filing motions to dismiss the tribal court action for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 17-3. A hearing on the motions to dismiss was held in Tribal Court on November 18, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 29-1, p. 2. On May 12, 2016, the Tribal Court issued a \"Memorandum Opinion\" in which the Tribal Court denied the motions to dismiss, concluding the Tribal Court has jurisdiction over the \"straight-forward contract action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 27-2, p. 17 (Case No. 4:14-cv-087). Kodiak Oil and others then appealed the decision of the Fort Berthold District Court to the MHA Nation Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 27-3(Case No. 4:14-cr-087).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the MHA Nation Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part the order of the Fort Berthold District Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 27-3 (Case No. 4:14-cv-087). The MHA Nation Supreme Court ultimately determined Kodiak Oil, EOG Resources, HRC Operating and other defendants are subject to MHA Nation's \"legislative, executive and judicial jurisdiction\" because they operate businesses and conduct business activities within the Fort Berthold Reservation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 27-3, p. 2 (Case No. 4:14-cv-087). The MHA Nation Supreme Court first decided \"\n   <em>\n    Montana's\n   </em>\n   rule and exceptions do not apply here, where the challenged non-Indian Petitioner's activities were all taken on Indian allotments held in trust.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Essentially, the MHA Nation Supreme Court construed\n   <em>\n    Montana v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/\">\n    450 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/\">\n    67 L.Ed.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981) narrowly to apply to lands within a reservation not owned by the Tribe or its members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5. However, the MHA Nation Supreme Court continued, and determined if\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   applies, the Tribal Court has jurisdiction over the matter based upon the 'consensual relationship' exception to the\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   rule, evinced \"by the oil and gas leases executed by and between oil and\n   gas companies and the individual Indian allotees.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 27-3, p. 6. The MHA Nation Supreme Court also concluded the federal regulatory scheme of oil and gas leases for allotted lands does not preclude the Fort Berthold District Court from exercising its jurisdiction over the matter. Nonetheless, the MHA National Supreme Court ultimately determined \"judicial review is premature at this juncture because [the Tribal Court Plaintiffs] have not exhausted their administrative remedies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. After the MHA Nation Supreme Court issued its order, the Tribal Court Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 29-10 (Case No. 4:14-cv-085).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Shortly after the MHA Nation Supreme Court issued its order finding the Fort Berthold District Court has jurisdiction over the matter, Kodiak and EOG Resources filed motions for a preliminary injunction with this Court. In their motions, Kodiak and EOG request the Court issue a preliminary injunction preventing the Defendants from proceeding further with the underlying Tribal Court action. Defendants Mary Seaworth, in her capacity as Acting Chief Judge of the Fort Berthold District Court, and Yvette Falcon, in her capacity as Court Clerk/Consultant of the Three Affiliated Tribes District Court of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation (\"Tribal Court Defendants\"), then filed motions to dismiss Kodiak Oil and EOG Resources' complaints.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 44 (Case No. 4:14-cv-085) and 31 (Case No. 4:14-cv-087). In their motions to dismiss, the Tribal Court Defendant contend the actions filed in this Court should be dismissed because the Court lacks jurisdiction over them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the time period to brief the motions for preliminary injunction and motions to dismiss, HRC Operating, LLC (\"HRC Operating\") filed a motion to intervene in the matter because of its status as a defendant in the Tribal Court action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 36 (Case No. 4:14-cv-085). On February 26, 2018, the Court granted HRC Operating's motion to intervene.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 56. That same day, HRC Operating filed its complaint against Defendants Jolene Burr, Ted Lone Fight, Georgianna Danks, Edward S. Danks, and Judge Mary Seaworth, in her capacity as Acting Chief Judge of the Fort Berthold District Court, as well as a motion for preliminary injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 57 and 58. On February 27, 2018, the Court consolidated\n   <em>\n    Kodiak Oil &amp; Gas (USA), Inc., et al. v. Burr, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 4:14-cv-085, with\n   <em>\n    EOG Resources Inc. v. Seaworth, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 4:14-cv-087.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before the Court may grant a preliminary injunction, the Court must be satisfied it has jurisdiction over the matter.

Notably, as to allotted Indian lands, tribes as sovereignties have no role in the approval of mineral leases, the determination of whether royalties are due for flaring under those leases, or the collection or payment of any royalties due to individual allottees. Consequently, the determination of whether the Plaintiffs breached the mineral leases by failing to pay royalties for flared natural gas is entirely controlled by federal laws and regulations, with the federal government, through its agencies, determining if royalties are due, recovering any royalties that may be due, and distributing\n    any royalties to individual allottees. With such federal government regulation and enforcement, although the alleged flaring unquestionably occurs on allotted lands within the Fort Berthold Reservation, the activity which the Tribal Court Plaintiffs seek a determination does not implicate tribal governance or internal relations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Plains Commerce Bank\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677340\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/316/#p324\">\n     554 U.S. at 335\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677340,7346294\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/128/2709/\">\n     128 S.Ct. 2709\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Unlike those cases cited in\n    <em>\n     Montana\n    </em>\n    in support of the 'consensual relationship' exception, the issue of flaring regulation here is subject entirely to regulation and enforcement by the federal government, not the tribal government.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The Court recognizes that while commercial activities on a reservation may certainly affect a tribe's self-governance and even intrude on the internal relations of the tribe, the specific activity from which the Tribal Court Plaintiffs seek relief in their breach of contract action is wholly regulated, determined, and enforced by the federal government. This characteristic of flaring clearly distinguishes it from other commercial activities that occur on a reservation which are subject to regulation by the tribe. There is no immediate control of flaring by the tribe and whether the mineral lease was breached is, without question, a determination left to the federal government.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The Court recognizes the flaring of natural gas occurs on allotted lands within the reservation, but the status of the land as allotted does not prevent the Court from concluding the regulation of flaring occurring on such land does not implicate the tribe's sovereign.

Here, adjudicative authority over the determination of whether an oil and gas company is to pay royalties for flaring natural gas in this context does not support tribes' right to make their own laws and be governed by them. As discussed previously, the extensive federal regulatory scheme applicable to the flaring of natural gas on Indian lands demonstrates the regulation of such flaring and enforcement of regulations solely lies with the federal government, through its various agencies, and outside the control of tribes. Specifically, the determination of whether the Plaintiffs breached the mineral leases by failing to pay royalties for flared natural gas is controlled by federal laws and regulations, with the federal government, through its agencies, determining whether royalties are due, recovering any royalties that may be due, and distributing any royalties to individual allottees. Under such circumstances, when a federal agency has the sole discretion to decide the pivotal issue of a matter, neither tribal regulatory nor adjudicative authority over\n    such is needed to preserve \"the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.\"\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3650026\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/358/217/#p220\">\n     358 U.S. at 220\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3650026\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/358/217/#p220\">\n     79 S.Ct. 269\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

However, if the Court issues a preliminary injunction, the Tribal Court Plaintiffs may no longer proceed with their Tribal Court action and must pursue their claims in a different forum. However, they are not left without a remedy. Although the Tribal Court venue would be foreclosed, nothing prevents them from bringing their claims in federal district court pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

However, the Court is also mindful that it is in the public interest to preserve tribal court adjudicative authority over issues affecting a tribe's internal relations and protecting tribal self-governance. Therefore, the Court finds this factor is neutral. Nonetheless, after a careful review of the entire record and the\n    <em>\n     Dataphase\n    </em>\n    factors, the Court finds the Plaintiffs have met their burden under Rule 65(b) of establishing the necessity of a preliminary injunction order.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    <strong>\n     III.\n     <em>\n      CONCLUSION\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    After a careful review of the entire record, and a careful consideration of all of the\n    <em>\n     Dataphase\n    </em>\n    factors, the Court finds the\n    <em>\n     Dataphase\n    </em>\n    factors, when viewed in their totality, clearly weigh in favor of the issuance of a preliminary injunction. The Plaintiffs have met their burden of establishing the necessity of a preliminary injunction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The Court\n    <strong>\n     GRANTS\n    </strong>\n    Kodiak Oil, EOG Resources, and HRC Operating's motions for preliminary injunction (Docket Nos. 29, 58 (Case No. 4:14-cv-085) and 26 (Case No. 4:14-cv-087) ), and\n    <strong>\n     ORDERS\n    </strong>\n    Defendants Jolene Burr, Ted Lone Fight, Georgianna Danks and Edward S. Danks enjoined from further prosecuting the underlying action in Tribal Court and Defendants Judge Mary Seaworth, in her capacity as Acting Chief Judge of the Fort Berthold District Court, and Yvette Falcon, in her capacity as the Court Clerk/Consultant of the Three Affiliated Tribes District Court of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, enjoined from exercising jurisdiction over the underlying Tribal Court action until a final determination of the Plaintiffs' claims in federal court. Further, the Court\n    <strong>\n     DENIES\n    </strong>\n    the Tribal Court Defendants' motions to dismiss (Docket Nos. 44, 52 (Case No. 4:14-cv-085) and 31 (Case No. 4:14-cv-087) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    <strong>\n     IT IS SO ORDERED.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-103\">\n     In their motions to dismiss, the Tribal Court Defendants also contend this matter must be dismissed because the Three Affiliated Tribes is a necessary and indispensable party to the action, but cannot be joined. See Docket No. 45, p. 19 (Case No. 4:14-cv-085). Whether a party is required to be joined pursuant to Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not present a threshold jurisdictional question. Consequently, at this juncture, the Court declines to pass on the merits of whether the Three Affiliated Tribes should be joined as a party.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-104\">\n     In its order, the MHA Nation Supreme Court also acknowledged the extensive federal regulatory scheme over flaring of natural gas.
