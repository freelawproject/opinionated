The instant motions present a veritable Augean Stables of issues to be resolved, a cavalcade of sharp disputes that have been distilled down by the parties and their skilled counsel to four principal issues. Put simply, these issues are: (1) whether the Times incurred liability by partially withdrawing from the Fund for plan years ending May 31, 2012, and May 31, 2013; (2) whether the discount rate used by the Fund when assessing the Times' withdrawal liability was appropriate; (3) whether the Fund applied the proper statutory procedure to calculate liability for the second partial withdrawal; and (4) whether and to what extent the Times is entitled to interest on the repayment of overpaid withdrawal liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on the conclusions set forth below, the motions are determined as follows. First, the Times incurred withdrawal liability, and the Arbitrator's finding that the CBA's contribution base unit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201301\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(11) (\"CBU\") was shifts has not been rebutted. Second, the Fund's use of the Segal Blend rate when assessing the Times' withdrawal liability was, in this instance, improper, and the Arbitrator's finding to the contrary is reversed. Third, the Fund's calculation of the Times' second partial liability was improper. Lastly, the Arbitrator correctly determined that the Times was entitled to interest on overpaid withdrawal liability, and his conclusion as to the applicable interest rate has not been rebutted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Statutory Background and Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Statutory Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before delving into the facts, a brief overview of ERISA's statutory framework is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"ERISA is a comprehensive statutory scheme regulating employee retirement plans.\"\n   <em>\n    Trs. of Local 138 Pension Tr.

With regard to the Second Assessment, however, the Arbitrator found that the Fund had improperly calculated the amount of credit to which the Times was owed, terming the Fund's assessment of partial withdrawal liability for the May 2013 plan \"convoluted\" and, accordingly, reduced the partial withdrawal liability for the plan year ending May 31, 2013, from $7,849,772 to $375,100.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201401\">\n    at 59-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Finally, the Times avers that, as a purely legal question, it is improper to consider the subjective understanding of and actions based on the CBU\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   by those at the Fund and at the Times. Times Mem. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In response, the Fund presents two arguments. First, the Fund contends that the CBA's language alone is what determines the Times' contribution obligations, and the CBA's terms unambiguously required that contributions be made \"per shift for each shift worked\" by covered employees. Fund's Mem. of Law in Supp. of Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Fund's Mem.\") 18 (quoting CBA \u00a7 13-I.1), No. 17 Civ. 6178, Dkt. No. 25. The Fund supports this reading by pointing to other CBA provisions that define \"day\" and \"night\" shifts, as well as others which cap the Times' contributions to the Fund at five shifts in any given payroll week.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fund's Mem. 19. As a secondary argument, the Fund contends that, given the Administrator considered extrinsic evidence in making his determination, his interpretation of the CBA is a factual finding entitled to a higher degree of deference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fund's Mem. 22-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Initially, it needs to be determined which standard of review is appropriate when reviewing the Arbitrator's finding of shifts as the CBU.

Reasonable bases exist to believe, from the language of the CBA's provision alone, that the CBU could be either shifts or wages. The Fund's argument that \"shifts\" avoids surplusage because Section 13-I.1 has language requiring payment \"per shift for each shift\" has merit. Also, in the same section, the CBA caps the number of payroll week shifts at five shifts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CBA \u00a7 13-I.1. It is valid to wonder why that language be there if the CBA meant anything other than \"shifts.\" However, the Times' arguments are not without their own weight. Paying \"8% of each employee's pay rate per shift for each shift worked\" could be reasonably read to mean monetary contribution rate of 8% of earnings or, in other words, the total payments over the total shifts. Moreover, as the Times identifies, the CBA requires 8% contributions to the Fund for paid leave, which amounts to employees' unworked time that is quantified in days-to implement a \"shifts worked\" approach requires a leap of interpretative logic that even the Arbitrator recognized.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CBA \u00a7 13-K.3; Interim Op. 34 (emphasis added) (\"\n   <em>\n    Once one\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    incorporates the notion\n   </em>\n   that all time compensated ... is treated as a 'shift worked,' any ambiguity in \u00a7 13-I.1 is resolved.\"). Accordingly, the Arbitrator's consideration of extrinsic evidence to resolve what is an ambiguous contract was proper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aeronautical Indus.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1094369\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/230/569/#p576\">\n    230 F.3d at 576-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e believe that extrinsic factors are relevant to determining the precise nature of the Company's duties ... because the contested contractual language is not unambiguous on its face.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Arbitrator's factual finding that that CBA's CBU are shifts is presumptively correct except by a rebuttal showing of the clear preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201401\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Under such a standard, the Arbitrator's finding must remain undisturbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As the Interim Opinion demonstrates, the Arbitrator considered a wide range of presented extrinsic evidence. He considered the Fund's Pension Plan, which detailed the Fund's operations and described employee compensation from contributing employers in terms of \"credited service shifts.\" Interim Op. 34. After hearing days of witnesses, detailed above, the Arbitrator highlighted the testimony of Egan and Lewis, both of whom testified that \"they always understood the CBU to be shifts,\" as credible. Interim Op. 36;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201401\">\n    37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]heir actions over the years demonstrated the truthfulness of their assertions.\"). The Arbitrator noted that the Welfare Fund's contribution language, which had \"virtually identical language\" to the Fund's CBA and treated the contribution rate as shifts, supported the conclusion that shifts was the CBU. Interim Op. 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In reaching his conclusion, the Arbitrator considered the evidence put forward by the Times, and which are similar to the arguments raised by it on the instant motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Times' Mem. 18-20. Such facts included: that the Times' payroll software was set up to combine different shift-based pays into a single amount, entitled \"Base MTD [Month to Date],\" which was then multiplied by 8% to get the pension contributions; the fact that the Times made pension contributions for the differentials paid for shifts of employees entitled to higher pay, like forklift operators; and that the Times consistently reported to the Segal actuaries that the Times was using wages as its contribution rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Interim Op. 34-35, 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Times' position is not meritless, and evidence adduced supports the contention that many employees at the Times who interacted with the Fund believed that the CBUs were wages. Assuredly, there was confusion between the parties. However, a contract can only mean one thing, and the \"determination as to which of competing inferences to draw\" between compelling evidence \"lies within the province of the trier of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    In Time Prods., Ltd. v.

By statute, that trier was the Arbitrator. Particularly in the face of the weight given by the Arbitrator to the testimonies of Egan and Lewis, the Times' evidentiary showing today has not established by a clear preponderance of the evidence that the Arbitrator was incorrect in concluding that the terms of the CBA set the applicable CBUs as wages.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Faiveley Transp.

Specifically, Egan used a discount rate of 6.5%, known in the industry as the Segal Blend, which was calculated by blending the Fund's investment-return rate of 7.5% with lower, risk-free rates published by the PBGC. Interim Op. 25. This rate was different than what the Fund used when calculating the Times' minimum funding requirements. As such, the parties dispute whether the asymmetrical application of the Segal Blend was legally permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Times contends that the Fund's actuary's use of the Segal Blend violated both ERISA and Supreme Court precedent. First, the Times argues that the rate the Fund used for calculating minimum funding requirements, 7.5%, needed to be the same that was used for any withdrawal liability calculations. In support, the Times identifies identical language in ERISA between the minimum funding rules and withdrawal liability calculations, both of which require an actuary to use rates that are \"reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations)\" and which, \"in combination, offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(A)-(B) (detailing permissible actuarial assumptions for minimum funding for multiemployer plans);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201393\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (detailing permissible actuarial assumptions for withdrawal liability);\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    see\n   </em>\n   Times Mem. 24-25.\n   <footnotemark xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress' use of identical language, the Times contends, meant that the same assumptions-and, therefore, the same rates-were to be used in both cases.

Broadly-speaking, in\n   <em>\n    Concrete Pipe\n   </em>\n   , an arbitrator determined that Concrete Pipe and Products of California had incurred withdrawal liability because it did not pay enough into a CBA-created employee pension plan covered by ERISA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Concrete Pipe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n    508 U.S. at 614-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

One of Concrete Pipe's arguments was that the MPPAA created opportunities for trustee bias to influence the amount employers had to pay in withdrawal liability: because the MPPAA allowed determinations of a plan's trustees to be made without a hearing, and because those conclusions were then insulated by the MPPAA's presumptions of correctness on appeal before an arbitrator, the statute deprived employers the opportunity for a fair adjudication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n    at 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After concluding that the MPPAA needed to be read to permit employers to challenge factual determinations before an arbitrator by a preponderance of the evidence, the Court applied its determined presumption to factual issues raised by Concrete Pipe in its challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n    at 630-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One such issue was the amount of withdrawal liability assessed by the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Court concluded that a fund's calculation of withdrawal liability differed from other facts found by a fund. In part, the Court found this because withdrawal liability is calculated by an actuary, who is \"not ... vulnerable to suggestions of bias or its appearance\" because \"actuaries are trained professionals subject to regulatory standards.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n    at 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition to external professional standards, the Court highlighted common language in ERISA regarding actuarial assumptions between two different contexts: withdrawal liability and minimum funding. Similar language itself created checks on the ability of a plan to be biased because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   The use of the same language to describe the actuarial assumptions and methods to be used in these different contexts ... check[s] the actuary's discretion in each of them. Using different assumptions [for different purposes] could very well be attacked as presumptively unreasonable both in arbitration and on judicial review. ... For example, the use of assumptions (such as low interest rates) that would tend to increase the fund's unfunded vested liability for withdrawal liability purposes would also make it more difficult for the plan to meet the minimum funding requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n    at 632-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover, the Court did not find \"any method or assumption unique to the calculation of withdrawal liability ... so manipulable as to create a significant opportunity for bias to operate, and arguably the most important assumption ... is the critical interest rate assumption\n   that must be used for other purposes as well.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n    at 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Before an arbitrator, an employer would need to rebut an actuary's conclusions by a preponderance that \"the combination of methods and assumptions employed in the calculation would not have been acceptable to a reasonable actuary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n    at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/602/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Fund argues that the statute's language is unambiguous. Under Section 1386, the first element of the equation is \"the amount determined under section 1391 of this title [ERISA Section 4211], and adjusted under section 1389 of this title [ERISA Section 4209] if appropriate, determined as if the employer had withdrawn from the plan in a complete withdrawal.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201386\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). As Sections 1391 and 1389 apply whether there is a full or partial withdrawal, the Fund argues, the only way not to render the \"determined as if the employer had withdrawn from the plan in a complete withdrawal\" directive superfluous requires applying Section 1386(b)(1) as part of Section 1386(a)(1), which requires that any employer \"for a partial or complete withdrawal from that plan in a subsequent plan year ... be reduced by the amount of any partial withdrawal liability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201386\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1386(b)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fund's Mem. 36. Because the ERISA provision is unambiguous, the Fund states, any extrinsic evidence, such as PBGC documents put forward by the Times and described below, are irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fund's Mem. 36-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   By contrast, the Times argues that the partial withdrawal calculation should go as follows. First, the employer's allocable share of the plan's UVBs is calculated as if it had been a complete withdrawal, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201386\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). That figure is then multiplied by the aforementioned partial withdrawal fraction laid out in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201386\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Then, that product is reduced by any partial liability from the previous plan year, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201386\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Times' Mem. 31. The Times supports this computational interpretation in three ways. Similarly pointing to the statute, the Times observes that Section 1386(a) first states how to calculate \"an employer's liability for a partial withdrawal,\" and then, logically,\n   Section 1386(b) states that an employer's \"withdrawal liability for a partial withdrawal\" is reduced by credit for the prior partial withdrawal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Times' Mem. 32. Second, the Times identifies an Opinion Letter by the PBGC which states that the \"plain language [of] Section 4206(a) precludes the prior use of Section 4206(b)(1) in this adjustment process\" in the manner set-out by the Fund and that calculations as argued by the Fund are \"clearly erroneous.\" PBGC Op. Letter 85-4 (Jan. 30, 1985);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Times' Mem. 33. Lastly, the Times contends that the Fund's mathematical proscription causes the Times to incur additional liability on subsequent partial withdrawals, even if nothing changes between the initial and successive partial withdrawals, which defeats the purpose of Congress granting the credit at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Times' Mem. 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Arbitrator concluded, as a matter of law, that the Times' partial withdrawal liability adjustment calculations were correct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Interim Op. 59-60.

In subsection (a), the \"amount\" of an employer's partial withdrawal liability is determined in Section 1386(a), which requires multiplying the UVBs in Section 1386(a)(1) by the contribution-base decline fraction of Section 1386(a)(2). Next, in subsection (b), the liability determined in Section 1386(a) is reduced by the amount of any partial withdrawal liability from the previous plan year. Viewed this way-in other words, in the order the statute was written-the statutory calculations proceed in a logical, linear, and unambiguous fashion. \"To be sure, Congress might have expressed itself more clearly, but ... this is the most natural reading of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Shepherd v.

While perhaps overly cautious of ERISA's drafters, this reading does not necessarily render the clause superfluous. At minimum, the clause's inclusion does not warrant the statutory hop-scotch the Fund would otherwise have actuaries perform.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Krause v.

As such, the Fund needed to repay the Times. Vanquishing the question of repayments, however, created, like the Lernaean Hydra, two new questions to resolve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The first question is whether interest needs to be included when repaying\n   overpaid withdrawal liability. Imperfect overlap between the directives of ERISA's statutory language and PBGC regulations creates this problem.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), ERISA Section 403(c)(1), requires that \"the assets of a plan shall never inure to the benefit of any employer and shall be held for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants in the plan and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses in administering the plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). ERISA's anti-inurement provision has certain exceptions, however, including: \"In the case of a withdrawal liability payment which has been determined to be an overpayment, [the anti-inurement rule] shall not prohibit the return of such payment to the employer within 6 months after the date of such determination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1103(c)(3). \"The purpose of the anti-inurement provision, in common with ERISA's other fiduciary responsibility provisions, is to apply the law of trusts to discourage abuses such as self-dealing, imprudent investment, and misappropriation of plan assets, by employers and others.\"\n   <em>\n    Raymond B.

The Fund notes that nothing in the Fund's Trust Agreement that expressly deals with withdrawal liability proscribes an interest rate, observing that Trust Agreement Section 9.10, which deals with withdrawal liability, does not mention interest rates, but that Section 9.4(a), which deals with \"the failure of any Employer to make Employer contributions to the Trust Fund,\" expressly mentions Section 9.5(b), the provision relied upon by the Times. Trust Agreement art. XI;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fund's Reply 18. Furthermore, the Fund avers, the evidence adduced in the arbitration demonstrated that, rather than a regular practice of requiring 18%, the Fund has used a variety of rates over the years; to the extent an 18% rate was used, it was either in error, such as with the Times, or as a matter of ERISA statutory requirement necessitating 18% for delinquent contributions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fund's Mem. 40; Fund's Reply 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The Arbitrator first determined that the PGBC regulation did not violate ERISA's anti-inurement rule and, therefore, the Fund needed to pay interest on any repayment to the Times for overpaid withdrawal liability at the same rate a charged for late payment of withdrawal liability. Interim Interest Op. 10; Final Interest Op. 17. The Arbitrator's decision was \"assumed\" and principally based on the Third Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Huber\n   </em>\n   , which upheld the PGBC rule regarding interest and whose conclusions regarding the interplay between Section 4129.31(d) and the anti-inurement rule has never been overturned or questioned by any other court. Final Interest Op. 17;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Interim Interest Op. 10. Before deciding the applicable rate, however, the Arbitrator permitted additional discovery on Fund to see if the Fund had established a withdrawal liability interest rate either by policy or practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Interim Interest Op. 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Following discovery, the Arbitrator ultimately concluded that, in the absence of an established rate by the Fund, the set PBGC rate of 3.25% applied. Final Interest Op. 20-21. The Arbitrator did not find that the Fund trustees had unanimously adopted an express interest rate for late withdrawal fees, as the Arbitrator found required under the Fund's Trust Agreement Section 6.4(a), based in part on an affidavit submitted by a co-counsel to the Fund, even while noting that Fund Board meeting minutes had indicated past discussion about, but no actual vote on, such a policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Interim Interest Op. 10/ Final\n   Interest Op. 10, 18. The Arbitrator also rejected the Times' argument that Section 9.5 was relevant to withdrawal liability payments, finding that that provision was part of the Trust Agreement to address employer contributions and, significantly, neither made a specific reference to withdrawal liability nor included a general statement as to \"any payment\" of an employer when discussing interest rates. Interim Interest Op. 10-11. As to any established practice or policy, the Arbitrator reviewed different instances of the Fund seeking interest on late withdrawal liability and found that the Fund had, on differing occasions, used a 0% rate, 3.25% rate, 5% rate, and 18% rate. Final Interest Op. 6-9, 19-20. After reviewing the marshalled evidence, the Arbitrator found that \"the Fund has had a practice of assessing interest on late payments of withdrawal liability and contributions at a rate substantially below 18% and very close to the prevailing PBGC rate if payments were made for the Fund to initiate litigation.\" Final Interest Op. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The first issue-whether interest is to be applied at all-requires resolution of a purely legal question. Namely, what is to be made of the PBGC's promulgated regulation interpreting ERISA in the context of ERISA's anti-inurement provision? While not binding, the Third Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Huber\n   </em>\n   is informative, as the court there faced the same issue as presented here. In\n   <em>\n    Huber\n   </em>\n   , the court determined that Congress had intended to consider overpayment funds part of a plan's assets, and that the absence of discussing interest in Section 1103(c)(1), when Congress had included interest in other ERISA provisions, indicated the statute itself barred interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531073\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/916/85/#p103\">\n    916 F.2d at 101-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, as ERISA also required employers to pay assessed withdrawal liability upfront and only later dispute the payments before a neutral arbitrator to potentially recoup its monies-a \"draconian interim payment procedure\"-not applying the PBGC regulation would permit, \"in effect[,] an interest free loan\" to a fund.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531073\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/916/85/#p103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531073\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/916/85/#p103\">\n    at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Striking down the application of the anti-inurement clause with regard to interest on overpayments of withdrawal liability was, to that court, \"the least intrusive means of adjusting the statute to preserve its constitutionality.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531073\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/916/85/#p103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The analysis in\n   <em>\n    Huber\n   </em>\n   and its outcome is adopted. While philosophically brow-raising to construe an employer's overpayments as part of the plan's assets, the language of Section 1103(c) indicates that Congress intended overpayments to be treated as such.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Had Congress not envisioned overpayments on withdrawal liability to be part of the plan's assets, there would have been no reason to have expressly included a carve-out for such sums.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3). The anti-inurement provision is therefore appropriately applied here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Unlike the\n   <em>\n    Huber\n   </em>\n   court's reading, however, it is not clear that the absence of an\n   explicit provision to provide interest in the withdrawal liability section is so \"telling\" as to itself bar such interest payments.\n   <em>\n    Huber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531073\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/916/85/#p103\">\n    916 F.2d at 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

This principle is as judicially established as it intuitively proper. Given this backdrop, ERISA's statutory language is best read as \"silent\" on the specific issue of interest, at which point the \"question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   , 467 U.S. at 843,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The PBGC regulation, which unobtrusively fills this statutory silence, is certainly such a reasonable construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Whether ERISA is ambiguous, and the PBGC regulation is applied, or is clear, and normally would not, in the present instance, however, is a distinction without a difference. The PBGC regulation must be applied because, were ERISA's statute to be all there is, \"the employer may deprived of (and the trustees allowed) the use of a considerable sum for a substantial period of time.\"\n   <em>\n    Huber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531073\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/916/85/#p103\">\n    916 F.2d at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As discussed above, the\n   <em>\n    Concrete Pipe\n   </em>\n   Court discussed at length the ways in which review by a neutral arbitrator would alleviate due process concerns created by various statutory presumptions favoring a fund's trustees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 39-41. However, sidestepping constitutional concerns with regard to presumptions of correctness does not address, and does not resolve, the risk of statutorily permitting interest-free loans to funds at the expense of employers. Review by a neutral arbitrator is not a panacea: while certainly a check on the risk of potentially abusive trustees, it nevertheless remains true that the \"harm caused by the biased decisionmaker is alleviated\" only when an improperly assessed payment is returned in a form that does not amount to an \"interest-free loan.\"\n   <em>\n    Huber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531073\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/916/85/#p103\">\n    916 F.2d at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
