INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff, Lauren Emmell, brought this employment discrimination action against her former employer, Phoenixville Hospital, where she worked as a nurse. She brings her claims under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA). Defendant Phoenixville Hospital moved for summary judgment. For the reasons that follow, I will grant summary judgment with respect to the plaintiff's\n   FMLA claims (Counts I and II of her amended complaint), and I will deny summary judgment with respect to the plaintiff's ADA and PHRA claims (Counts III and IV).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Lauren Emmell began working as a nurse for Phoenixville Hospital in February 1988. (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2.) In January 2007, after working in other departments, she began working in the short procedure unit (SPU), where her responsibilities included preoperative and postoperative patient care. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff's direct supervisor during the relevant time period was Mary Tannouri, who became the hospital's Perioperative &amp; Endoscopy Clinical Nurse Manager and began overseeing the SPU in February 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8.) The SPU nurse coordinator, Rosie Bucci, oversaw staffing, management of patient flow, and assigning of nurses to various tasks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Plaintiff's May 2010 Performance Evaluation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In Ms. Tannouri's May 18, 2010 evaluation of Ms. Emmell, she noted that the plaintiff needed \"further development\" in the category titled \"[d]evelops and maintains collaborative relationship with others\" because the plaintiff \"was not working up to the same capacity [as others].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10, Ex. D.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Plaintiff's May 2011 Performance Evaluation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the plaintiff's May 17, 2011 performance evaluation, Ms. Tannouri \"noted that the plaintiff did 'not share [patient] load or rotating shifts' \" and observed that she \"was not 'work[ing] up to the same capacity as her colleagues.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) The defendant states that the plaintiff took longer than her colleagues to carry out tasks because she liked to chat with patients, while the plaintiff states that her slow pace stemmed from symptoms of her Lyme disease. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17; Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In this 2011 evaluation, Ms. Tannouri rated Ms. Emmell as \"Needs Improvement\" in the following categories:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 \"Serves as a model for professional behavior\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 \"Facilitates the development of an effective team\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 \"Works as a team player, supporting and assisting team members\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 \"Maintains effective working relationships with physicians, department heads, patient [sic], visitors, and coworkers. Interacts with all customers in a pleasant and respectful manner, displays courtesy at all times\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 \"Has received no [staff] complaints regarding attitude or performance\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 \"Maintains a positive attitude and is willing to go the 'extra' mile\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ms. Tannouri's evaluation concluded that Ms. Emmell \"was not meeting the expectations of a Clinical Level III nurse in the SPU because she lacked 'the ability to see what was going on in the department,' \" and Ms. Tannouri placed her on a performance improvement plan (PIP). (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Plaintiff's 2011 Performance Improvement Plan\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ms. Emmell was placed on the 2011 PIP for 90 days, starting June 17, 2011. (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 23.) This PIP required her to spend less time admitting patients, to become \"more globally aware\" of when her colleagues needed assistance, and to \"participate, equitably, in staff scheduling rotation, as needed.\" (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Plaintiff's 2012 Performance Evaluation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ms. Emmell received her 2012 performance evaluation on June 18, 2012 and then completed a self-evaluation before meeting with Ms. Tannouri later the same day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.) The plaintiff rated herself as \"Needs Improvement\" in the following categories:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 \"Works as a team player, supporting and assisting team members\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 \"Completes duties during the shift with few exceptions. Coordinates work to achieve maximum productivity\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 \"Maintains effective working relationships with physicians, department heads, patient [sic], visitors, and coworkers. Interacts with all customers in a pleasant and respectful manner, displays courtesy at all times\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 \"Has received no [staff] complaints regarding attitude or performance\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At their meeting, Ms. Tannouri shared concerns \"regarding Plaintiff's time management skills, productivity, and her 'global awareness' \"-similar concerns to previous years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Additionally, Ms. Tannouri noted that the plaintiff continued taking too much time to admit patients and that her global awareness had not improved from the previous year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Ms. Tannouri placed Ms. Emmell on a second PIP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     E. Plaintiff's 2012 FMLA Leave\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   During their June 18, 2012 meeting, the plaintiff explained that she had not been feeling well, and Ms. Tannouri recommended that she take a medical leave of absence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) The plaintiff explained that her medical issues may have caused her slowness at work. (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 33.) This was the first time she shared her health concerns with Ms. Tannouri, and she had not yet received a diagnosis. (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6\u00b6 34, 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The plaintiff requested, was granted, and took FMLA leave from June 25, 2012 through August 7, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) Before she returned to work, Ms. Emmell's physicians \"certified that they were familiar with Plaintiff's job duties, that she was fit for duty, and that she could perform her duties without restriction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36; Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 36.) She received her 2012 PIP upon her return. (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     F. Plaintiff's Lyme Disease Diagnosis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On June 28, 2012, Dr. Philip Adelman treated Ms. Emmell for \"diffuse pain.\" (Doc. No. 33a \u00b6 1.) \"Dr. Adelman 'noted that Plaintiff was experiencing 'crushing headaches' and had [a] 'near syncopal episode' at work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The plaintiff received positive test results for Lyme disease on August 14, 2012, about a week after returning to work from FMLA leave. (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 37.) She informed Ms. Tannouri of her diagnosis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) The defendant states that Ms. Tannouri asked, \"[a]re you better,\" and said, \"thanks for telling me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) The plaintiff disputes that Ms. Tannouri thanked her and notes that she considered it inappropriate for Ms. Tannouri to ask, \"[a]re you better?\" (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 39, 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     G. Plaintiff's 2012 Performance Improvement Plan\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff's 2012 PIP required her to complete admissions within 20-25 minutes and, to that end, to multitask and eliminate unnecessary conversation with patients. (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 44.) Similar to her 2011 PIP, the plaintiff was expected to become more globally aware of her surroundings, to help when appropriate without being asked, and to \"take multi-patient assignments, without being asked.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45, 46.) Along with her 2012 PIP, Ms. Emmell received a \"Second Written Warning\" detailing the \"exact same concerns and corrective actions\" contained in the 2011 and 2012 performance evaluations and PIPs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On September 13, 2012, Ms. Tannouri amended the 2012 PIP by adding a \"Daily Tracking Log\" for plaintiff to monitor her progress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) During a meeting on September 21, 2012, Ms. Tannouri explained that Ms. Bucci (who was also present) would delegate some of her patient care to the plaintiff so that Ms. Bucci could spend more time observing, advising, and directing the plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55, 56; Doc. No. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 55, 56.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     H. Plaintiff's Impairment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   During their September 13, 2012 meeting, when Ms. Tannouri amended the 2012 PIP, Ms. Emmell informed Ms. Tannouri that she may have a cognitive impairment due to her Lyme disease. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Ms. Tannouri consulted with human resources, and on September 21, 2012, she explained that Ms. Emmell would need to \"see her treating physician and return a completed fitness for duty certificate\" indicating that she could safely perform her work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.) On September 24, 2012, Ms. Emmell returned a completed certificate from her physician, Dr. Adelman, and returned to work the next day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67; Doc. No. 33a \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Plaintiff's Third Written Warning\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On January 28, 2013, the plaintiff received a \"Third Written Warning\" for substandard work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.) Ms. Tannouri had observed the same ongoing problems, including the plaintiff's \"same poor work performance, including failing to be globally aware of what was going on in the SPU, resulting in her coworkers needing to assume more of the SPU's workload.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) This warning called for \"[i]mmediate and sustained improvement,\" and the plaintiff signed it \"without comment or explanation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70, 71 (alteration in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The parties disagree as to whether Ms. Emmell asked Ms. Tannouri for accommodations as a result of her Lyme disease. The defendant states that the plaintiff \"never asked Ms. Tannouri for any changes to her work environment or the way she was doing her job or anything about her work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) The plaintiff states that she \"was informed by her neurologist that stress could exacerbate her symptoms,\" that she \"told Ms. Tannouri that her work performance would improve if it were not for the stress caused by the terms of the PIP,\" and that she and Ms. Tannouri conversed about her work environment impacting her medical condition. (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     J. Plaintiff Leaves Work for Appointment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On April 17, 2013, the plaintiff left work to attend a doctor's appointment in a building adjacent to the hospital; the appointment related to her Lyme disease. (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 73; Doc No. 33a \u00b6 31.) She had scheduled the appointment for her lunch break, had informed Ms. Bucci earlier that day, was on intermittent FMLA leave at the time, and had another nurse cover her patient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74; Doc. No. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 73, 74; Doc. No. 33a \u00b6\u00b6 21, 30.) She did not clock\n   out when she left; the plaintiff states that lunch breaks were \"automatically deducted from employees' time sheets.\" (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 75; Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Ms. Emmell received a \"Final Written Warning\" on April 18, 2013 for leaving the SPU to attend her appointment. (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 81.) Ms. Emmell noted on the warning that the appointment was related to her \"FMLA leave Lyme disease\" and that she notified Ms. Bucci earlier that day. (Doc. No. 33a \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The hospital has a policy requiring employees to clock out whenever they leave the premises. (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 77.) But the parties disagree as to whether the adjacent medical building, connected to the hospital by a pedestrian bridge, qualifies as off the premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77; Doc. No. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 77, 81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The parties further disagree over hospital policy regarding leaving for appointments. The defendant states that SPU nurses must inform Ms. Tannouri in advance of such an appointment so that she can assign appropriate coverage-and that informing Ms. Bucci was \"insufficient to receive permission to leave the SPU.\" (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6\u00b6 79, 80.) The plaintiff states that according to Ms. Chiolo, the director of nursing, \"nurses were expected to inform 'their manager [Ms. Tannouri] or coordinator [Ms. Bucci].' \" (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     K. Plaintiff Requests Transfer\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On May 17, 2013, Ms. Emmell requested a transfer from the SPU to a position as a \"Clinical Document Specialist,\" where nurses review medical records and do not provide direct patient care. (Doc. No. 33a \u00b6 39.) Ms. Tannouri replied that she was not eligible for transfer because she was on a PIP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     L. Plaintiff's 2013 Performance Evaluation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Ms. Emmell received her 2013 performance evaluation on June 25, 2013. (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 82.) It rated her as \" 'Needs Improvement' (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 2 out of 5) [and] noted the same performance deficiencies Plaintiff had been exhibiting since 2010.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.) In it, Ms. Tannouri noted that Ms. Emmell \"did not begin to perform, at an acceptable level, until she received a Third Written Warning, in January 2013, and was informed her job was in jeopardy, if immediate and sustained improvement did not occur.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The plaintiff states that she \"previously performed at an acceptable level as she successfully completed the terms of her 2011 and 2012 PIPs.\" (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The defendant avers that the plaintiff did not ask for changes to her job duties in June 2013. (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 92.) However, the plaintiff disputes this, noting her meeting with Ms. Strzelecki after her June 2013 evaluation. (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 92; Doc. No. 33a \u00b6 42.) \"Plaintiff met with Sally Strzelecki and complained about how Ms. Tannouri was handling her work performance issues and to discuss whether Ms. Strzelecki thought Ms. Tannouri 'was appropriate and accommodating' to someone who had Lyme disease. Plaintiff also requested that she been [sic] transferred to a different unit within the hospital\" notwithstanding the hospital policy against transferring employees on PIPs. (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 92; Doc. No. 33a \u00b6 45.) In this meeting with Ms. Strzelecki, the plaintiff explained that because of her illness, she was struggling to meet Ms. Tannouri's demands. (Doc. No. 33a \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     M. Plaintiff Applies for Intermittent FMLA Leave\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On June 26, 2013, the day after receiving her 2013 performance evaluation, the plaintiff applied for and was granted intermittent\n   FMLA leave (by FMLASource, the hospital's third party FMLA administrator). (Doc. No 29 \u00b6 94.) The letter that the plaintiff received from FMLA Source is dated July 9, 2013, and it grants intermittent leave from June 25, 2013 through June 24, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. V.) The letter explains that intermittent FMLA leave \"allows eligible employees up to a total of 12 weeks of unpaid leave in a 12-month period for certain qualifying reasons.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     N. Plaintiff's Employment is Terminated\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On July 2, 2013, the plaintiff was working in the post-procedure side of the SPU. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98.) This required her to \"monitor and care for patients as they revive from anesthesia and prepare to return home.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At about 1:45 p.m., the plaintiff \"felt 'punky,' like she had 'low blood sugar,' from not having eaten during her shift.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99.) She felt she \"could not 'do anymore without eating.' \" (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 99.) Her coworker, Julia O'Donnell, relieved her for lunch, and Ms. Emmell gave Ms. O'Donnell a \"disorganized and lengthy (20 minutes) report\" with \"much extraneous information.\" (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 101.) The plaintiff states that the report \"was disorganized because she 'was feeling very poorly' and that she told Ms. O'Donnell that her report was disorganized\" when she gave it to her. (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 101.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   When Ms. O'Donnell reviewed the chart of \"a general surgical outpatient (Patient A),\" she found that the plaintiff had not documented \"vital signs or admissions notes.\" (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 103.) For a post-cardiac catheterization patient (Patient B), Ms. Emmell had told Ms. O'Donnell that the patient (admitted 45 minutes earlier) was awaiting his lunch and had \"stable\" vital signs-but Ms. O'Donnell could not find documented vital signs and could not find entries for Patient B on the \"monitor that takes, records, and maintains patient vital signs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 104, 105.) Additionally, Ms. O'Donnell found that the plaintiff \"had not recorded notes of her interactions with Patient B\" in the chart upon the patient's admission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \"Upon returning from lunch, Plaintiff wrote several timed notes on Patients A and B as if she had completed them in real time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107.) The plaintiff states that it was her practice when she had multiple patients to take contemporaneous notes of patients' vitals on a piece of paper, then record them later. (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 107.) Ms. O'Donnell was concerned that Patient B's vitals were never recorded by Ms. Emmell, and when she returned to work at 6 a.m. the next morning, she asked Ms. Bucci to assist her in reviewing the patient's chart. (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6\u00b6 108, 109.) Ms. O'Donnell and Ms. Bucci found that the vital signs for the time Ms. Emmell cared for the patient remained missing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   According to the defendant, when Ms. Emmell arrived at work on July 3, 2013, after Ms. O'Donnell and Ms. Bucci examined the chart of Patient B, \"[Ms. Emmell] documented notes on patient care as though they had been made the day before, not as late entries or addendums.\" (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 111.) The plaintiff stated that she cannot recall the specifics of that day but that she would often take contemporaneous notes and properly record them later. (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 111.)

(Doc. No. 23, at 25-26.) After her negative June 2013 evaluation by Ms. Tannouri, the plaintiff met with Ms. Strzelecki. (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 92, Ex. A 211:8-23; Doc. No. 33a \u00b6 42.) She discussed \"how Ms. Tannouri was handling her work performance issues and...whether Ms. Strzelecki thought Ms. Tannouri 'was appropriate and accommodating' to someone who had Lyme disease.\" (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 92; Doc. No. 33a \u00b6 45.) She also requested a transfer to a different unit, notwithstanding the hospital's policy against transferring employees on PIPs. (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 92; Doc. No. 33a \u00b6 45.) Additionally, she explained to Ms. Strzelecki that because of her illness she was struggling to meet Ms. Tannouri's demands. (Doc. No. 33a \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Viewing the facts in the plaintiff's favor, a reasonable jury could find that the plaintiff's meeting with Ms. Strzelecki, and potentially other meetings as well, constitute protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Under the ADA, Ms. Emmell does not need to prove that she suffers from a disability for her retaliation claim. For her ADA discrimination claim, a reasonable jury could find that she suffered from a disability.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The defendant argues in its motion for summary judgment that the plaintiff's \"disability discrimination claims stumble at the outset because there is no evidence that she was disabled at the time any of the allegedly discriminatory acts took place.\" (Doc. No. 28, at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   As this argument relates to the plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim, it is clearly established law that a disability is not required for a successful claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shellenberger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9334265\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/183/#p187\">\n    318 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   188 (citing\n   <em>\n    Krouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"943531\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/126/494/#p500\">\n    126 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   498 ). \"By its own terms, the\n   ADA\n   <em>\n    retaliation\n   </em>\n   provision protects 'any individual' who has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by the ADA or who has made a charge under the ADA.\"\n   <em>\n    Krouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"943531\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/126/494/#p500\">\n    126 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   502 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012203\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ). Whereas the ADA\n   <em>\n    discrimination\n   </em>\n   provision protects a \"qualified individual with a disability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012203\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ). Therefore, the status of Ms. Emmell's disability is not dispositive to her ADA retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   For purposes of her discrimination claim, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Ms. Emmell is disabled. Under the ADA, a \"disability\" is a \"physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities,\" \"a record of such impairment,\" or \"being regarded as having such an impairment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(A-C). The ADA provides the following nonexhaustive list of major life activities: \"caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.\" \u00a7 12102(2)(A). Viewing Ms. Emmell's Lyme disease diagnosis and symptoms in light of the ADA's definition of \"disability,\" I must conclude that summary judgment is improper and there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she is disabled under the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The defendant argues that there was no causal link between Ms. Emmell's alleged disability and her employer's actions. (Doc. No. 28, at 17.) Causation is required for both discrimination and retaliation claims under the ADA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9212932\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/380/751/#p761\">\n    380 F.3d at 759, 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \"The element of causation, which necessarily involves an inquiry into the motives of an employer, is highly context-specific.\"\n   <em>\n    Kachmar v.

A causation determination is \"not limited to timing and demonstrative proof, such as actual antagonistic conduct or animus,\" but can depend on inferences based on the record as a whole.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453805\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/206/271/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453805\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/206/271/#p280\">\n    at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The plaintiff's employment was terminated on July 12, 2013. (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 115.) She had met with Ms. Strzelecki sometime after her June 25, 2013 performance evaluation, less than a month before her termination. (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 92.) During this meeting, she complained about Ms. Tannouri's handling of her performance issues and requested a transfer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92; Doc. No. 33a \u00b6 45.) By this time, Ms.Strzelecki and Ms. Tannouri were aware of the plaintiff's Lyme disease diagnosis. During the plaintiff's March 23, 2017 deposition, she described this meeting with Strzelecki, stating that she told Ms. Strzelecki that she \"felt like Mary [Tannouri] should be trying to help me...instead of feeling like she was constantly criticizing me, and that it was very hard to deal with my illness and...jump through all these hoops.\" (Doc. No. 29 Ex. A, 211:12-17.) Because of the close timing between this meeting with Ms. Strezelecki and the plaintiff's firing, along with the plaintiff's ongoing problems and conversations with Ms. Tannouri, it is proper for a jury to determine whether Ms. Emmell has established causation for purposes of her discrimination and retaliation claims under the ADA and PHRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   In conclusion, I will grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment, in part, as to the plaintiff's FMLA claims\n   (Counts I and II), and will deny it as to the plaintiff's ADA claim (Count III) and PHRA claim (Count IV).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   An appropriate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    This statement of facts is ordered chronologically and is condensed from the following sources, except where noted otherwise: the defendant's statement of undisputed material facts (Doc.
