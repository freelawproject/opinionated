City of Dallas\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit upheld a Dallas statute that prohibited civil service employees from engaging in political activity, but allowed for endorsements of candidates to groups of fifteen or fewer people, placing yard signs or bumper stickers on their property, or political activity by spouses of the employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs also note that the City could employ such measures as those utilized by the federal Hatch Act, which allows federal employees to attend rallies, donate money, and express opinions, as long as the employees are not wearing a government uniform or identifying themselves as federal employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, \"because there was 'little tailoring' of Section 1.06,\" Plaintiffs assert they are entitled to summary judgment on the basis that Charter Amendment fails the strict scrutiny analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs argue that the Charter Amendment is unconstitutionally vague, as its prohibitions are not clearly defined and people of common intelligence would differ as to its application and meaning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs aver that the Charter Amendment does not define what the term \"political activity\" covers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, Plaintiffs argue that the Charter Amendment fails to \"clearly define\" its terms \"or explicitly identify what speech or conduct is allegedly included or excluded in its broad ban.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Plaintiffs argue that they \"have sufficiently shown that Section 1.06 risks chilling substantial amounts of their protected speech due to its vagueness.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs assert that the Charter Amendment \"should be declared unconstitutionally vague and enjoined.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs contend that the Charter Amendment is \"overbroad and has no 'legitimate sweep,' as it prohibits a substantial amount of protected expression.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Plaintiffs, the Charter Amendment restricts speech unrelated to both the City's goals and Plaintiffs' employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs aver that the Charter Amendment is subject to various interpretations, \"leading it to exclude even voting or privately expressing an opinion from its overbroad reach.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to summary judgment stating that\n   the Charter Amendment is unconstitutionally overbroad.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Fourth, Plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to declaratory relief because the Court's preliminary injunction is the only reason the Charter Amendment is not currently being enforced against Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs aver that they are entitled to a permanent injunction barring the enforcement of the Charter Amendment because all four requirements for a permanent injunction are met: (1) success on the merits; (2) that a failure to grant the injunction will result in irreparable injury; (3) that said injury outweighs any damage that the injunction will cause the opposing party; and (4) that the injunction will not disserve the public interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that they will suffer irreparable harm if the permanent injunction is not granted, as Plaintiffs aver that the Supreme Court has determined that the loss of their First Amendment freedoms \"for even minimal periods of time\" constitutes irreparable injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs further assert that the potential for injury to Plaintiffs' rights if injunctive relief is not granted \"substantially outweighs\" any harm if a permanent injunction is granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs aver that the City has no interest in enforcing an unconstitutional law that deprives Plaintiffs of their First Amendment rights, whereas Plaintiffs would be deprived of their rights to freedom of expression if a permanent injunction is not granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, Plaintiffs argue that granting a permanent injunction here will serve, rather than hurt, the public interest, as it will protect Louisiana citizens' rights to freedom of speech and provide Plaintiffs with the basic protections of due process before conclusively restricting their rights to engage in political activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Fifth, Plaintiffs contend that they are entitled to at least nominal damages based on the violation of their constitutional rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Plaintiffs assert they are entitled to attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. The City's Arguments in Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In opposition, the City of Kenner argues that Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment should be denied because there are multiple genuine issues of material fact in dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City notes that the Section 8.04(B)(2) of the City Charter defines the term \"political activity,\" as \"an effort to support or oppose the election of a candidate for political office or to support a particular political party in an election.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the City argues that the public records Plaintiffs cite to support the unconstitutionality of the Charter Amendment are inapposite because Opinion 11-0256 from the State of Louisiana Department of Justice does not consider the constitutionality of the 2011 amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Furthermore, the City contends that the Fifth Circuit has rejected Plaintiffs' argument that only classified employees may be subject to political restrictions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The City contends that the Charter Amendment survives strict scrutiny because it has fulfilled its burden of showing that less restrictive means are inadequate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City contends that \"Plaintiffs' proposed less restrictive alternatives, such as only restricting political activities during work hours, are far less effective\" than the Charter Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City argues that such a restriction \"would allow for after work hours' political performance to affect employment and advancement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City asserts that \"[t]he Supreme Court has held that a statute that limits a public employee's right to undertake any political activity other than exercising his right as a citizen to privately express his opinion and cast his vote is constitutional and is not impermissibly vague or overbroad.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the City argues that Plaintiffs have no basis in law or fact to contend that the Charter Amendment is unconstitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Next, the City argues that the Charter Amendment is narrowly tailored to fulfill the compelling interest of avoiding the politicization of its public employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City avers that the Charter Amendment conforms to the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Broadrick v.

Whether the Charter Amendment can Survive Strict Scrutiny\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The First Amendment, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the enactment of laws \"abridging the freedom of speech.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    137\n   </footnotemark>\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that the parties do not dispute that the Charter Amendment is subject to strict scrutiny as a content-based regulation on Plaintiff's political speech.\n   <footnotemark>\n    138\n   </footnotemark>\n   To survive strict scrutiny, the City bears the burden of proving that the Charter Amendment is \"narrowly tailored\" to serve a \"compelling interest.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    139\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the instant motion, Plaintiffs do not contest that the City has a compelling governmental interest in ensuring a nonpartisan employee workforce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    140\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the only issue before the Court is whether the Charter Amendment is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. \"In considering this question, a court assumes that certain protected speech may be regulated, and then asks what is the least restrictive alternative that can be used to achieve that goal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    141\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court must consider \"whether the challenged regulation is the least restrictive means among available, effective alternatives.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    142\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In their motion, Plaintiffs argue that the Charter Amendment is expansive, as it restricts \"any political activity\" without defining the term \"political activity\" or providing a clear list of easily identifiable political activities that are and are not prohibited.\n   <footnotemark>\n    143\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs also assert that there are a number of less restrictive alternative measures that the City could adopt to accomplish its compelling interests,\n   such as a law similar to the Federal Hatch Act or the Dallas Charter approved by the Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Wachsman v. City of Dallas\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    144\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In opposition, the City contends that the Charter Amendment survives strict scrutiny because it has fulfilled its burden of showing that less restrictive means are inadequate since the alternatives proposed by Plaintiffs, such as only restricting political activities during working hours, are less effective.\n   <footnotemark>\n    145\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds this argument unavailing. Although Plaintiffs do argue that one available alternative would be enforcement of Kenner Code of Ordinances Section 2-90, which restricts political activity during working hours, Plaintiffs also argue that other available alternatives exist. For example, Plaintiffs note that the Dallas Charter approved by the Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Wachsman\n   </em>\n   allowed for endorsement to groups of less than 15, yard signs, bumper stickers, and allowed spouses of city employees to publically endorse candidates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    146\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs also note that the Federal Hatch Act allows federal employees to attend rallies, donate money, and express opinions, as long as they are not wearing a government uniform or identifying themselves as federal employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    147\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City presents no argument as to how these less restrictive means are inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Next, the City asserts that the Charter Amendment is narrowly tailored because it conforms to the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Broadrick v. Oklahoma\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Broadrick\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court upheld an Oklahoma statute that restricted \"the political activities of the State's classified civil servants in much the same manner that the Hatch Act.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Oklahoma statute prohibited classified civil service employees from participating in \"a broad range of political activities and conduct,\" including soliciting campaign donations, becoming \"a member of any national, state or local committee of a political party,\" or participating \"in any political campaign, except to exercise his right as a citizen privately to express his opinion and to cast his vote.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    150\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Charter Amendment at issue here provides that nonelected City employees such as Plaintiffs are prohibited from participating in \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   political activity on behalf of any city candidate in the City of Kenner elections.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    151\n   </footnotemark>\n   No definition of \"political activity\" is provided in the Charter Amendment itself that might limit the scope of the restricted conduct. Nor does the Charter Amendment set out a specific list of conduct that is prohibited and not prohibited such that the broad sweep of covered political expression may be narrowed, unlike the provisions restricting public employees' political activity in\n   <em>\n    Broadrick\n   </em>\n   and the other cases cited by the City.\n   <footnotemark>\n    152\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Such a broad, limitless ban appears to extend to a wide range of political conduct that is either unrelated to the City's compelling\n   interests or so attenuated that the City could achieve its compelling interests by adopting less restrictive means. For example, \"any political activity on behalf of any city candidate in the City of Kenner elections\" appears to extend to a private conversation regarding a Plaintiff's support or non-support of a city candidate, regardless of where it occurs or whether it is between a Plaintiff and a single individual, a small group, or a large audience. Likewise, it appears to also prohibit Plaintiffs from attending informational forums or private events involving a city candidate, driving another family member's vehicle with a city candidate's bumper sticker on it, or posting, liking, or sharing social media posts or general news articles on social media related to a city candidate in any undefined way or circumstance. Therefore, the Charter Amendment appears to prohibit employees from privately expressing their opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The City next argues that the Charter Amendment is narrowly tailored because it is limited to City elections involving City candidates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    153\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, according to the City, Plaintiffs are not prohibited from engaging in political activity during parish, state, or federal elections or from becoming involved in other public issues, such as non-partisan charter amendments, bond issues, referendums, or other ballot measures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    154\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City relies on\n   <em>\n    Hickman v. City of Dallas\n   </em>\n   , a case decided by a district court in the Northern District of Texas, to support this assertion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    155\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hickman\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff, an employee of the City of Dallas, challenged a city charter that prohibited him from becoming a candidate for a position on the DeSoto City Council, a city within Dallas County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    156\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court found that the City of Dallas' compelling interest in maintaining the loyalty, efficiency, and nonpartisanship of its employees, was sufficient to restrict the rights of its employees to become candidates for public office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    157\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court found that the charter was unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiff because there was not \"the necessary nexus between Dallas' compelling public objectives and its consequent right to burden First Amendment activities to accomplish such objectives (on the one hand), and Plaintiff's proposed candidacy ... (on the other hand).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    158\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Unlike\n   <em>\n    Hickman\n   </em>\n   , the City argues that the Charter Amendment has a reasonable correlation to the compelling public objectives of the City because \"it restricts a non-elected City of Kenner employee from undertaking political activities in support or opposition of a city candidate exclusively in an election in the City of Kenner.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    159\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds this argument unpersuasive. Whereas\n   <em>\n    Hickman\n   </em>\n   involved only a restriction on the plaintiff's right to run for political office, the Charter Amendment at issue in this case can be interpreted as a complete ban on Plaintiff's participation in elections of city candidates. Although the Charter Amendment does not prohibit City employees from participating in elections other than those involving City candidates, such is not a remedy to the complete ban on Plaintiffs' participation in elections involving the City. This Court knows of no authority, nor has the City pointed to any, which allows a total ban on political speech directed to a particular type of election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, the City contends that the Charter Amendment is narrowly tailored because it only applies to partisan elections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    160\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City attempts to distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    Villejo v. City of San Antonio\n   </em>\n   , where a district court in the Western District of Texas enjoined the City of San Antonio from enforcing a city directive preventing city employees from participating in a bond election.\n   <footnotemark>\n    161\n   </footnotemark>\n   This argument is equally unavailing. The court in\n   <em>\n    Villejo\n   </em>\n   did note that there is a distinction between bond measures and partisan candidate elections, stating that the government's interests in regulating speech related to issues such as bonds are not as compelling as its \"interests in regulating the free speech and associational rights of employees to participate in elections [ ] dealing with their potential supervisors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    162\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, this distinction does not absolve the City of its burden here. Plaintiffs do not dispute that the City has a compelling governmental interest in ensuring a nonpartisan employee workforce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    163\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, the City bears the burden of establishing that the Charter Amendment is narrowly tailored to serve that interest, a burden it has not carried.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   At the preliminary injunction hearing previously held in this matter, the City argued that the Charter Amendment does not prevent voting in City elections, participating in private political conversations with spouses, or informing others who a Plaintiff will be voting for during a City election.\n   <footnotemark>\n    164\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the City's argument is undercut by the text of the Charter Amendment itself, which offers no such limitations on its extensive reach. Instead, the term \"any political activity\" means precisely what it says: all political activity involving City candidates, in any manner or circumstance, is prohibited. By contrast, the City has not adequately explained how the plain text of the Charter Amendment can be interpreted such that it does not include the act of voting or simply stating who one is voting for in a City election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In its statement of contested facts, the City argues that the term \"political activity\" is defined in Section 8.04 of the Kenner City Charter, which states, \"[a]s used in the Part,\" political activity is \"an effort to support or oppose the election of a candidate for political office or to support a particular political party in an election.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    165\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Charter Amendment does not adopt this definition or incorporate it by reference. Furthermore, the Court notes that in its prior opposition to Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, the City argued that at least four additional definitions of the term \"political activity\" could be applicable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    166\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, although the City represents that the Kenner City Charter includes its own definition of \"political activity;\" that definition, contained in Section 8.04(B)(2) of the Kenner City Charter, explicitly states that it only applies to that Part and the restrictions on \"political activity\" in Section 8.04(B),\n   <footnotemark>\n    167\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the City has not presented any evidence\n   demonstrating that it applies to the Charter Amendment in Section 1.06 of the Kenner City Charter. As such, Defendants have not met their burden of establishing that the Charter Amendment is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, the City cites to cases that upheld various restrictions on the political activities of government employees in support of its contention that the Charter Amendment is constitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    168\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the limitations on public employees' political expression imposed in those cases are clearly distinguishable from the Charter Amendment at issue here, as they either: (1) provide a list of specific political activities that are prohibited, such as running for office, actively participating in political campaigns, using official positions to influence an election, or making campaign donations; or (2) include a list of political activity that is explicitly not prohibited, such as voting in elections or engaging in private political discussions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    169\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Wachsman v. City of Dallas\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit upheld certain restrictions on city employees' political activity where the ban left \"unregulated a considerable scope of city employee political activity,\" and \"city employees [were] limited only to an extent that furthers their ability to perform optimally.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    170\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Charter Amendment, by contrast, clearly extends to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   political activity, regardless of its connection to the City's compelling interests or Plaintiffs' employment with the City. Indeed, contrary to the City's assertion that the Charter Amendment is narrowly tailored, it appears that there was little tailoring involved in drafting the Charter Amendment's blanket prohibition on \"any political activity\" with regard to City elections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    171\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The City has not presented any evidence to meet its burden of showing the less restrictive means of achieving the City's compelling government interests are inadequate. Accordingly, because there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment as a matter of law declaring that the Charter Amendment is a violation of Plaintiffs' free speech rights under the First Amendment, and is therefore unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Whether the Charter Amendment is Unconstitutionally Vague\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs assert that the Charter Amendment is unconstitutionally vague under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, as the Charter Amendment's prohibitions are not clearly defined and people of common intelligence would differ as to\n   its application and meaning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    172\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the City asserts that the Charter Amendment is not impermissibly vague, as it clearly restricts political activities on behalf of City candidates in City of Kenner elections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    173\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the City argues that the term \"political activity\" is not vague, as it is defined in the Kenner City Charter and would not include casting votes or privately discussing who one may be voting for.\n   <footnotemark>\n    174\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   A law or policy is void for vagueness if it \"either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that people of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    175\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit has held that, because the First Amendment needs \"breathing space,\" laws regulating speech \"must be drawn with some specificity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    176\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government must ensure prohibitions are \"clearly defined\" and should \"articulate its aims with a reasonable degree of clarity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    177\n   </footnotemark>\n   While a law may be written to be flexible, it must provide \"fair notice\" so that \"its prohibitions may be avoided by those who wish to do so.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    178\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Fifth Circuit, the purpose of the vagueness doctrine is to prevent the government \"from chilling substantial amounts of speech and facilitating discriminatory and arbitrary enforcement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    179\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is, the vagueness doctrine addresses laws where citizens cannot predict which actions are prohibited and where \"discriminatory and arbitrary enforcement\" is possible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    180\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, to succeed on their vagueness challenge, Plaintiffs must show that the Charter Amendment: (1) reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct; and (2) \"fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits\" or \"authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    181\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hobbs v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit held that a provision in a city charter that prohibited fire department employees from taking an active part in any election, contributing money to any candidate, or \"prominently identifying themselves in a political race with or against any candidate for office\" was unconstitutionally vague.\n   <footnotemark>\n    182\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit noted that it was unclear where the regulation stopped or if it prohibited displaying bumper stickers, discussing candidates with friends, or writing\n   letters to newspapers in support of candidates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    183\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit further concluded that it was \"simply inconceivable to us that one acting in good faith under this regulatory scheme would readily know what conduct was prohibited and what conduct was permitted,\" and therefore the provision would likely chill the plaintiffs' speech.\n   <footnotemark>\n    184\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Charter Amendment plainly reaches a \"substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct,\"\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' political speech.\n   <footnotemark>\n    185\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, as explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Charter Amendment fails to define what conduct or speech constitutes \"political activity,\" rendering it both unconstitutionally vague and overly broad. Unlike the regulations on public employees' political activities upheld by the Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit,\n   <footnotemark>\n    186\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Charter Amendment does not \"clearly define\" its terms or explicitly identify what speech or conduct is allegedly included or excluded in its broad ban.\n   <footnotemark>\n    187\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Charter Amendment does not incorporate the definition of \"political activity\" found at Section 8.04(B)(2) of the Kenner City Charter, leaving Plaintiffs to guess as to the definition and creating a serious risk of \"discriminatory and arbitrary enforcement\" depending on the definition adopted by a given enforcer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    188\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the City itself cannot point to a definitive authority to interpret and define the boundaries of the Charter Amendment's intrusions into Plaintiffs' political speech and activity, then it appears to also be true that \"[people] of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    189\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As such, Plaintiffs have shown that the Charter Amendment risks chilling substantial amounts of their protected speech.\n   <footnotemark>\n    190\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, Plaintiffs point out that the Charter Amendment is vague as to whether a City employee can attend her private civic organization's meetings when a mayoral candidate is invited to speak,\n   <footnotemark>\n    191\n   </footnotemark>\n   or how a spouses' private political activity in a shared home can be distinguished from the City employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    192\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the fact that the City argues\n   that the Charter Amendment excludes voting in elections and private political conversations from its prohibitions on\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   political activity, an exclusion that is not found anywhere in the text of the Charter Amendment, exacerbates the ambiguity as to what conduct is now prohibited. The chilling effect of the Charter Amendment and the possibility of arbitrary enforcement of its provisions are further increased by the fact that Plaintiffs are unclassified civil servants who lack the same job protections that classified civil servants receive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    193\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Therefore, based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have shown that the Charter Amendment's wide prohibitions and undefined terms are so vague that people of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    194\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact and Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment as a matter of law that the Charter Amendment is unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Whether the Charter Amendment is Overbroad\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend that the Charter Amendment is overbroad.\n   <footnotemark>\n    195\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs argue that it has no \"legitimate sweep,\" as there is no basis for the City to enforce content-based regulations on all political activity related to City elections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    196\n   </footnotemark>\n   In opposition, the City argues that \"the Fifth Circuit continues to follow the Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Letter Carriers\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Broadrick\n   </em>\n   , limiting political activities of public employees in a manner similar to that provided in Section 1.06 of the City of Kenner's Charter.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    197\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As the Fifth Circuit has noted, for a law to be overbroad, it must \"reach[ ] a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    198\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Fifth Circuit, a government's legitimate purpose to validly control or prevent some expressive conduct cannot be accomplished \"by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    199\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Facial overbreadth scrutiny emphasizes the need to eliminate an overbroad law's deterrent impact\n   on constitutionally protected expressive activity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    200\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hobbs v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit held that a city charter provision prohibiting fire department employees from taking an active part in any election, contributing money to any candidate, or \"prominently identifying themselves in a political race with or against any candidate for office\" was overbroad.\n   <footnotemark>\n    201\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit determined that the city's prohibitions \"sweep too broadly and proscribe a great deal of political activity which is unrelated to the effective workings of the fire department\" or the \"proper performance of its firemen's employment duties.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    202\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit opined that the \"very fact that the scheme has been construed to forbid political bumper stickers-a particularly innocuous form of political activity-points out clearly the broadside nature of the Macon prohibitory regulations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    203\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Hobbs\n   </em>\n   further cited approvingly to the California Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Fort v. Civil Service Commission of Alameda County\n   </em>\n   , where the court invalidated a county charter provision that prohibited public employees from taking part in a political campaign or an election except to vote or privately express an opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    204\n   </footnotemark>\n   The California Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Fort\n   </em>\n   concluded that the First Amendment does not permit \"wholesale restrictions on political activities merely because the persons affected are public employees,\" and because the county charter provision \"encompassed both valid and invalid restrictions on free speech,\" it was overbroad.\n   <footnotemark>\n    205\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Charter Amendment plainly reaches a \"substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct,\"\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' political speech.\n   <footnotemark>\n    206\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the City points out that limited restrictions on public employees' political activities have been upheld in other cases, the Charter Amendment \"sweep[s] too broadly\" by going well beyond targeted restrictions on political activities and including a substantial amount of protected political expression that is either unrelated to or attenuated from the City's goals and the Plaintiffs' employment duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    207\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, unlike the laws challenged in\n   <em>\n    Hobbs\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fort\n   </em>\n   , the Charter Amendment fails to even exclude voting or privately expressing an opinion from its overbroad reach. Accordingly, the Court finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact and Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on their claim that the Charter Amendment is unconstitutionally overbroad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Whether Plaintiffs are Entitled to a Permanent Injunction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction barring the enforcement of the Charter Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    208\n   </footnotemark>\n   In opposition, the City essentially only argues that Plaintiffs are not entitled to a permanent injunction because the Charter Amendment is not unconstitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    209\n   </footnotemark>\n   As noted above, \"[t]he party seeking a permanent injunction must satisfy a four-part test: it must show (1) success on the merits; (2) the failure to grant the injunction will result in irreparable injury; (3) the injury outweighs any damage that the injunction will cause the opposing party; and (4) the injunction will not disserve the public interest.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    210\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons previously discussed, Plaintiffs succeed on the merits of their claims insofar as the Charter Amendment violates the First Amendment because it is not narrowly tailored, and is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and there are no material facts in dispute on these issues. Therefore, Plaintiffs meet the first element necessary to obtain a permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As for the second element, the Supreme Court has opined that \"[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    211\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Opulent Life Church v. City of Holly Springs, Mississippi\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit determined that a church challenging a ban on using a public courthouse square had satisfied the irreparable harm requirement because it had alleged violations of its First Amendment rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    212\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the Charter Amendment precludes the exercise of Plaintiffs First Amendment freedoms and chills their protected speech. Therefore, the failure to grant the injunction will result in irreparable injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As to the third element, in\n   <em>\n    Opulent Life Church\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit noted that, after concluding that the plaintiff's harm to its religious liberties rights under the First Amendment was irreparable, the defendant \"would need to present powerful evidence of harm to its interests to prevent [the plaintiff] from meeting this requirement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    213\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City presents no evidence of a harm to its interests to prevent Plaintiffs from meeting this requirement. Therefore, the Court finds that the injury to Plaintiffs outweighs any damage that the injunction will cause the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, as to the fourth element, in\n   <em>\n    Opulent Life Church\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit held that \"injunctions protecting First Amendment freedoms are always in the public interest.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    214\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court finds that granting a permanent injunction here will not do disservice to the public interest. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have established all four requirements for a permanent injunction banning enforcement of the Charter Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

Accordingly, the Court, in its discretion, finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     V.

Plaintiffs have also carried their burden on all four factors identified by the Fifth Circuit to prevail on a request for a permanent injunction. Therefore, the Court hereby grants Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and enjoins Defendants and their agents from enforcing Kenner City Charter Article I, Section 1.06.
