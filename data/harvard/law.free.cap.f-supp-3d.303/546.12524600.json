The museum displays a collection of lighthouse lenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Two particular lenses previously used by the United States are at issue: one Fresnel lens marked H.L. 331, which was formerly used at the light house at Spring Point Ledge, Maine (the \"Spring Point Ledge lens\") and another Fresnel lens marked B.F. 53, which was formerly used in the Belle Isle Light Station in Detroit, Michigan (the \"Belle Isle lens\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.

Around 1960, the Spring Point Ledge Light Station transitioned to an automatic and unattended operation, necessitating the replacement of the Spring Point Ledge lens. Spring Point Ledge Light Station Change A, Ex. F to Pl. Mot. for Sum. Judg., at 266-267 (Dkt. 26-7). According to a government work order, the lens was to be returned to a Coast Guard base in Portland, Maine; if it was deemed beyond repair, that work order mandated that the lens be discarded overboard in deep waters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 267. There is no written record of the location of the Spring Point Ledge lens after 1960, Def. Mot. for Sum.

Quit Claim Deed, Ex. E to Pl. Mot. for Sum. Judg., at 153 (Dkt. 26-6). In 2003, the Spring Point Ledge lens was put up for auction on eBay by a person named Pat Jones. eBay Listing, Ex. G to Pl. Mot. for Sum. Judg. (Dkt. 26-8). In lieu of bidding on the auction, Gronow contacted the seller and made an offer for the lens, ultimately buying the lens for around $46,000. Gronow Dep., Ex. C to Pl. Mot. for Sum. Judg., at 41 (Dkt. 26-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The other lens at issue was formerly used in the Belle Isle Light Station. In or around 1930, the Coast Guard decommissioned the lighthouse, and the lens was removed and decommissioned later that decade. Def. Mot. for Sum. Judg. \u00b6 8. The Government's last known custody and control of the lens was in 1937.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.

The parties do not dispute that the United States once owned both lenses and that it is no longer in possession of them. The disagreement between the parties at this juncture centers on how current ownership is proven and who must prove it.

ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Both sides agree that the lenses were originally property of the United States. Where they disagree is whether the record of subsequent events, presented at this summary judgment stage, establishes that the United States has lost its ownership interest. The Government contends that only properly authorized acts by Government employees are sufficient to terminate its ownership, and that the record shows no such events. Gronow's response is two-fold: (i) because the Government no longer possesses the property, it bears the burden of establishing that no acts extinguishing its interest took place, and it has not met this burden; and (ii) as a good faith purchaser, Gronow has rights superior to the Government, regardless of whether such acts took place. The Government replies that (i) it has no burden to establish that there were no ownership extinguishing acts, but if so, it has met that burden; and (ii) the good faith purchaser doctrine has no application here. The Court agrees with the Government.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    The Government's property rights are grounded in the Constitution itself, which assigns to Congress the power to establish rules governing the property of the United States.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    U.S. Const. Art. IV, \u00a7 3, Cl. 2 (\"The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States....\"). From this bedrock grant of authority, the Supreme Court has concluded that individual Government officials have no power to dispose of property, except as Congress has authorized.

A review of the summary judgment record for each lens demonstrates no such acts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The history trail of the Spring Pointe Ledge lens reveals only evidence that the Government never gave up its ownership interest. In 1998, the Government deeded the light station where the lens had been located to the Spring Point Ledge Light Trust. But the conveyance expressly reserved all \"right, title and interest in the lenses associated with the property.\" Quit-Claim Deed at 153. Years before, in 1960, a work order for repair of the lens provided that the lens be discarded in deep waters if it was found not to be repairable. But that almost certainly did not happen, as it showed up on an eBay auction in 2003. Thus the only record evidence is that the United States never authorized abandonment, conveyance, or any other extinguishment of its ownership interest in the lens.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    The absence of any record, viewed in light of then applicable law, confirms that no authorized action was taken to extinguish the Government's ownership interest in the lens. When the Spring Point Ledge lens was taken out of commission in 1960, the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Pub. L.

Fed. Reg. at 5515, \u00a7 3, Ex. R to Pl. Mot. for Sum. Judg. (Dkt. 26-19). Neither party has pointed to any evidence of any written findings regarding abandonment or donation of the lens.

This dovetails with the minutes of the Historical Society, which records an announcement by the society's curator of \"an offer received in regard to obtaining the loan of a lighthouse lens....\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Henry County Historical Society Meeting Notes. While the same minutes reflect a hope of \"the loan probably culminating into permanent ownership by the museum,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    , there is no evidence that that hope was ever realized. In fact, \"ownership\" was expressly negated in the Coast Guard's announcement of the program.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    USCG memo (\"Because of legal restrictions the Coast Guard cannot dispose of the lenses as a gift, but can loan them indefinitely to responsible institutions.\"). Undoubtedly, it was the permanent placement of the lens that the curator must have had in mind when he made his prediction that the loan would probably culminate in permanent ownership. In any case, the curator's prediction of ownership has no relevance on whether any government official was authorized to extinguish the Government's ownership interest or performed any such act of extinguishment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Mot. at 12-14, but there is no evidence to support this. The absence of any writing is telling, because applicable law required written recordation of any such donation. When the Belle Isle Lens was loaned to the Henry County Museum in 1946, the Surplus Property Act of 1944, Pub. Law No. 152, Ch. 288,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20Stat.%20765\">\n     58 Stat. 765\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , Ex. N to Pl. Mot. for Sum. Judg. (Dkt. 26-15), the predecessor to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, was in effect. The Act required that any property that a federal agency deemed surplus be reported to the Surplus Property Administration,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    58 Stat. Chap. 769, \u00a7 11(a). It allowed for donation of surplus property if the property had no commercial value, or if the cost of care, handling, and disposition exceeded the estimated sales proceeds.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    58 Stat. Chap. 771 \u00a7 13(b). The Act also allowed the Surplus Property Board to prescribe regulations related to donation of property.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20Stat.%20765\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    An associated federal regulation required that such a finding allowing donation of property be reduced to writing. 10 Fed. Reg. at 14967, \u00a7 8319.3, Ex. P to Pl. Mot. for Sum. Judg. (Dkt. 26-17). The absence of any writing under the Surplus Property Act for donation of the lens is consistent with the conclusion that there was no donation, which in turn is consistent with the Coast Guard memo announcing the transfer of lenses on strictly a loan basis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Gronow argues that the Government has improperly shifted the burden of proof onto him to show that there were authorized acts extinguishing the Government's interest.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def. Resp. to Pl. Mot. for Sum. Judg. at 10 (Dkt. 31). But whether demonstrating the absence of such acts is properly part of the Government's case-in-chief or whether showing the existence of such acts is a necessary part of Gronow's defense is entirely irrelevant. Here, both parties have engaged in extensive discovery, filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and presented the results of their historical research as part of the summary judgment record. The Court can review the record to determine whether any evidence exists showing some triable issue of fact on extinguishment of the Government's interest. There is none.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Gronow misconceives the Government's burden on summary judgment in support of its motion. Even assuming that the absence of authorized extinguishing acts is part of its case in chief, the Government, as moving party in support of its claims,\n    need only show that there is enough evidence to satisfy every element of its claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Vance v.

Kan. 2016), a case far different from ours. There, the Government sought to set aside a forfeiture sale, when it learned that the property it had sold was a bag of moon dust from the Apollo 11 lunar mission, to which NASA claimed title. Under the federal forfeiture statutes, the bag became property of the United States, which title passed to the purchaser, whom the court deemed a good faith purchaser, leading the court to deny the motion to set aside the sale. Our case does not present analogous circumstances. Gronow's seller was not the United States, but some private party. And no one further up the chain of ownership ever received good title from the United States, so as to pass it further down the chain and ultimately to Gronow. The good faith purchaser principles recognized in\n    <em>\n     Ary\n    </em>\n    have no application here.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.
