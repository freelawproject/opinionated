The first sentence of plaintiff's amended complaint could hardly be more clear, and it should not be read in isolation.

Specifically, plaintiff was warned that the Court could treat as conceded any argument defendants raised in their motion if plaintiff failed to respond to it. Plaintiff's opposition does not address defendants' arguments for dismissal of the Hatch Act claim, and instead focuses solely on his ADA claim.
