LAND, CHIEF U.S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case began when two administrators at Chattahoochee County Middle High School (\"CCMHS\") searched a student's cell phone without a warrant during their investigation of alleged threats made against the student. The matter escalated when the student's father, who was upset by the search of his daughter's cell phone, allegedly threatened school officials. Based upon those threats, the school superintendent informed the student's father that his communication with school employees and access to school property would be significantly restricted. And in fact, the father was forcibly removed from school grounds on one occasion. The superintendent also prevented the father from voicing his grievances at a meeting of the school board after the father threatened litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Based on these events, the student's father and mother, individually and on behalf of their daughter, sued the school superintendent in his individual and official capacities, claiming that he violated their First Amendment rights by restricting their communications with school officials. They also assert claims against the school district employees who searched their daughter's cell phone and who removed the father from a school event, alleging that these employees are liable in their individual capacities for violating the father's and his daughter's Fourth Amendment rights. Plaintiffs also allege state-law claims arising from this same conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As explained in the remainder of this Order, all defendants are entitled to qualified immunity for the federal law claims asserted against them in their individual capacities. Furthermore, the Court finds that Defendants are entitled to official immunity under Georgia law as to Plaintiffs' state law claims. Accordingly, Defendants' motions for summary judgment (ECF Nos. 17 &amp; 19) are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Summary judgment may be granted only \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

EDJ was a twelfth grade student at CCMHS during the 2016-17 school year. In August of 2016, rumors circulated around the school that EDJ was bad-talking another student,\n   <em>\n    M.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As is to be expected,\n   those rumors eventually made it back to\n   <em>\n    M\n   </em>\n   , who became upset with EDJ and threatened her. After school that day, EDJ told school officials about\n   <em>\n    M\n   </em>\n   's threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Kemp &amp; Oates Investigate the Situation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The next day, Josh Kemp, an administrative assistant to CCMHS assistant principal Bo Oates and principal Sandi Veliz, was notified that\n   <em>\n    M\n   </em>\n   threatened EDJ. He began gathering information about the incident from\n   <em>\n    M\n   </em>\n   and two other students,\n   <em>\n    B\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    A.\n   </em>\n   Kemp. Dep. 22:15-17, 24:24-25:9, ECF No. 26.\n   <em>\n    M\n   </em>\n   told Kemp that EDJ had been making fun of her for not making the volleyball team.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:12-14.\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   told Kemp that EDJ had been making fun of\n   <em>\n    M\n   </em>\n   as well, and\n   <em>\n    B\n   </em>\n   told Kemp that EDJ had been sending text messages to other students about\n   <em>\n    M. Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:24-26:25. The text messages were reportedly sent from EDJ to\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    B. Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28:2-5, 39:7-11. At some point, Kemp informed Oates of the situation between\n   <em>\n    M\n   </em>\n   and EDJ. Oates Dep. 17:5-10, ECF No. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After completing his interviews of the other students, Kemp called EDJ to his office to get her side of the story. Kemp Dep. 29:11-13. Oates was also present during EDJ's interview. Kemp and Oates questioned EDJ about whether she had been sending messages to students about\n   <em>\n    M\n   </em>\n   as the other students had alleged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:14-18;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   EDJ Dep. 25:15-24, ECF No. 23. EDJ denied talking about\n   <em>\n    M.\n   </em>\n   EDJ claims that Oates then told her to unlock her phone and give it to him so that he could see if EDJ had been sending messages about\n   <em>\n    M.\n   </em>\n   EDJ Dep. 26:6-14, 40:16; EDJ Aff. \u00b6 2, ECF No. 34. She claims that she did not give Oates permission to search her phone. After Oates reviewed her messages with\n   <em>\n    B\n   </em>\n   , Oates continued to review messages from EDJ's family members, best friend, and ex-boyfriend. EDJ Dep. 28:5-10; EDJ Aff. \u00b6 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oates made some remarks about the messages he reviewed, told Kemp that he did not see where EDJ had done anything wrong, and gave the phone back to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Later that evening, EDJ told her father, Richard D. Jackson, about what happened that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Mr. Jackson's Objections &amp; the School's Response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Over the next couple of days, Mr. Jackson repeatedly called David McCurry, the superintendent of the Chattahoochee County School District. McCurry Dep. Ex. 1, Call Receipts (August 17, 18, &amp; 19, 2016), ECF No. 24-1 at 1. In one call, Mr. Jackson threatened to sue the school for violating EDJ's constitutional rights. McCurry Dep. 43:11-23, ECF No. 24. In another, he inquired as to whether he could speak to the school board.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:19-45:2. McCurry told him that he could neither attend nor speak at the school board meeting because he had threatened litigation. R. Jackson Dep. 47:12-48:10, ECF No. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Additionally, Mr. Jackson called principal Veliz and assistant principal Oates about the incident. Veliz Dep. 38:22-39:5, ECF No. 25; Oates Dep. 33:5-8. Mr. Jackson also went to CCMHS during volleyball practice to speak with EDJ's volleyball coaches about the incident. After that meeting, the coaches immediately reported orally to McCurry and Veliz that Mr. Jackson acted aggressively during the meeting\n   with them and that he threatened Oates's safety. McCurry Dep. 36:7-12, 37:16-25. The coaches reduced their statements to writing. Veliz Dep. 49:10-17. Mr. Jackson denies that he acted aggressively or made any threats against Oates, which the Court must accept as true for purposes of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although there is some dispute as to what actually happened during the meeting between Mr. Jackson and the coaches, there is no dispute about what McCurry, based on his conversation with the coaches and the coaches' written statements,\n   <em>\n    believed\n   </em>\n   happened during that meeting. McCurry learned from the coaches that Mr. Jackson inquired about the identity of certain students and that he was aggressive towards the coaches. McCurry also determined that Mr. Jackson told the coaches that he would come to CCMHS to show Oates \"what intimidation was,\" which McCurry interpreted as a threat to Oates. McCurry Dep. 37:9-25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Veliz Dep. Exs. 3 &amp; 4, Written Statements of Volleyball Coaches, ECF No. 25-1 at 3-6 (describing coaches' versions of the meeting).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   McCurry believed Mr. Jackson posed a threat to the safety of his employees and students. McCurry Dep. 58:8-9. Ryan Smith, a deputy sheriff and the school resource officer, reviewed video footage of Mr. Jackson's meeting with the coaches. Smith Dep. 50:14-18, ECF No. 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A couple of days later, Mr. Jackson returned to CCMHS to speak with Veliz. Based on what he heard from the volleyball coaches, McCurry believed that Mr. Jackson intended to confront Oates, so he met Mr. Jackson at the front door of the school and prohibited him from entering. McCurry Dep. 53:17-24. McCurry instructed Mr. Jackson not to have any further communication with school officials or students and told him to direct all future communications to the school board's attorney.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54:4-13. McCurry asked Ryan Smith, the school resource officer and a deputy sheriff, to stand by while he confronted Mr. Jackson. Smith observed the encounter from inside the door. Smith Dep. 29:12-16. When McCurry came back inside the school, McCurry advised Smith that he informed Mr. Jackson that he was not allowed back on school premises. McCurry then directed Smith to remove or arrest Mr. Jackson if Smith saw him on school property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:17-21.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   McCurry also sent Mr. Jackson a letter. The letter recited what McCurry believed happened during Mr. Jackson's meeting with EDJ's volleyball coaches and stated that the school district \"has determined your conduct in this regard is disruptive and contrary to the establishment of a healthy educational environment for the students of our school system.\" McCurry Dep. Ex. 3, Letter from D. McCurry to R. Jackson (Aug. 26, 2016) 1, ECF No. 24-1\n   at 4-5 [hereinafter \"McCurry Letter\"]. The letter further barred Mr. Jackson from making any unauthorized appearance at CCMHS or any extracurricular activity conducted by school officials where students are present. The letter provided two exceptions-he was permitted to pick EDJ up or drop her off at school,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and he could attend EDJ's volleyball games, as long as he stayed in the designated area for parents,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Mr. Jackson's Removal from Senior Night\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   About a month later, Mr. and Mrs. Jackson attended a volleyball game at CCMHS. It was senior night for the girls on the volleyball team, including EDJ. Kemp and Smith were also in attendance. Kemp and Smith noticed that Mr. Jackson was present at the game, and Smith reminded Kemp that Mr. Jackson was not supposed to be on school premises. Kemp Dep. 51:17-25. Kemp then made a telephone call to Veliz concerning Mr. Jackson's presence at the school, and he told Veliz that Mr. Jackson was not supposed to be there. Veliz then called McCurry, who told Veliz that they could remove Mr. Jackson if they felt it was necessary and that he would back-up their decision. Veliz Dep. 58:20-22; McCurry Dep. 63:3-12. Veliz told Kemp to remove Mr. Jackson from the gymnasium after the senior night activities concluded. Veliz Dep. 59:11-13. Veliz did not ask Kemp to involve Smith with Mr. Jackson's removal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68:19-22. As of that time, neither Veliz, nor Kemp, nor Smith had read the letter from McCurry to Mr. Jackson that permitted him to attend his daughter's volleyball games.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   What happened next is in dispute. Smith and Kemp approached the bleachers where Mr. Jackson was sitting and summoned Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson contends that when he approached Smith, Smith firmly grabbed his arm, placed his other hand on his pistol, and walked Mr. Jackson to the concession area. R. Jackson Dep. 54:18-25, 70:22-23, 72:8-12. Though Smith contends that he never touched Mr. Jackson, the Court must accept Plaintiffs' version of the facts for purposes of this Order. Kemp followed Smith and Mr. Jackson. When they reached the concession area, Smith told Mr. Jackson that he needed to leave. Mr. Jackson responded that McCurry had sent him a letter that expressly allowed him to attend his daughter's volleyball games.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73:9-21. Smith asked whether Mr. Jackson had the letter with him, and when Mr. Jackson said he did not, Smith told Mr. Jackson that he needed to leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Smith Dep. 34:17-35:8. Smith confirmed with Kemp that Mr. Jackson should be removed. Smith Dep. 41:13-15. Smith then explained to Mr. Jackson that he could be arrested for criminal trespass if he attempted to stay on the premises after being asked to leave by school officials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:3-18. Smith then grabbed Mr. Jackson's arm again and escorted him outside the gym. R. Jackson Dep. 104:3-5. Afterwards, Veliz instructed Kemp to retrieve from her office a copy of the letter McCurry wrote to Mr. Jackson and to read it to her. They then realized that Mr. Jackson was permitted to attend the games and that his removal was a mistake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs assert the following federal claims pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   based on the alleged violation of their federal constitutional rights: (1) a Fourth Amendment claim against Oates in his individual capacity arising from his search of EDJ's phone; (2) a Fourth Amendment claim against Smith in his individual capacity arising from his removal of Mr. Jackson from school premises during the volleyball game; (3) a Fourth Amendment claim against Veliz in her individual capacity based on her participation in Mr. Jackson's\n   removal from the volleyball game; (4) a Fourth Amendment claim against Kemp in his individual capacity based on his participation in Mr. Jackson's removal from the volleyball game; (5) a First Amendment claim against McCurry in his individual and official capacities for restricting Mr. Jackson's communications with school personnel and access to school property; and (6) a First Amendment claim against McCurry in his individual and official capacities for preventing Mr. Jackson from addressing the school board. Plaintiffs also assert state-law claims against the Defendants. Plaintiffs did not respond to Defendants' summary judgment motion as to their official capacity claims against McCurry, so those claims are deemed abandoned.\n   <em>\n    Resolution Trust Corp. v.

While\n   <em>\n    T.L.O.\n   </em>\n   clearly established the general standard for the search of a student, Plaintiffs pointed the Court to no decision by the Supreme Court, the Eleventh Circuit, or the Georgia Supreme Court addressing\n   the constitutionality of a search of a student's cell phone, much less one with materially similar circumstances as those present here. Moreover, the Court does not find that it would have been clearly obvious to a school official in Oates's circumstances that the Fourth Amendment prevented him from conducting the search of EDJ's phone as he did. Pretermitting whether the search violated the Fourth Amendment, it is clear that Oates is entitled to qualified immunity as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   When viewed in the light most favorable to EDJ, the facts show that Oates searched her phone because he believed she was sending negative messages about\n   <em>\n    M\n   </em>\n   to other students. His belief was based on the information he received from Kemp, who interviewed two students and learned that EDJ had been making fun of\n   <em>\n    M\n   </em>\n   and sending text messages about\n   <em>\n    M\n   </em>\n   to other students.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C.B. ex rel. Breeding v. Driscoll\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641093\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/82/383/#p388\">\n    82 F.3d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 388 (11th Cir. 1996) (explaining that administrators are entitled to rely on direct tips from students because the informing students face disciplinary repercussions if the tip is misleading). Oates testified that this conduct could constitute harassment, which is prohibited by the student code of conduct. Oates Dep. 29:9-10;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   McCurry Dep. Ex. 6, Student Handbook, ECF No. 24-1 at 65 (\"No student shall engage in verbal or written harassment, threat or abuse of, or towards, another student or students.\"). Therefore, Oates and Kemp had reasonable grounds to suspect that a search of the text messages on EDJ's cell phone would reveal evidence that she was violating or had violated the school's rule against harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The next question is whether it would have been clear to a reasonable school official that the search as conducted was unreasonably intrusive given EDJ's age, sex, and the nature of the infraction. EDJ was a senior and therefore presumably among the most mature students in the school based upon her age. Her sex is irrelevant to the search of the cell phone, and the Court cannot conclude that the alleged infraction was insignificant. The only part of the search that was arguably suspect was Oates's alleged viewing of messages to and from family members and other persons not associated with the alleged incident under investigation. But a reasonable school official under these circumstances may have concluded that expanding the search to relatives and others was warranted. EDJ had to identify for Oates the recipients of some of her messages because the recipients were identified with \"emojis\" instead of their names. EDJ Dep. 26:14-17, 31:10-13. Because Oates knew that EDJ could label her contacts in any manner she chose, he could reasonably assume that EDJ could disguise her contacts and any messages from them. Thus, messages that\n   <em>\n    purported to be\n   </em>\n   between EDJ and her family members could\n   <em>\n    actually be\n   </em>\n   between EDJ and other students. Therefore, a review of those messages could still be reasonably related to potentially finding harassing messages sent to other students.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Adjani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046468\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/1140/#p1150\">\n    452 F.3d 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1150 (9th Cir. 2006) (explaining that \"[t]he government should not be required to trust the suspect's self-labeling\" because computer files are easy to disguise or rename). At a minimum, it would not have been clear to a reasonable school official that such a search would violate the student's Fourth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court rejects Plaintiffs' contention that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Riley v. California\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), made it clear to all school officials that they will violate the Fourth Amendment if they search a student's cell phone without a warrant. In\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court recognized the private nature of the data people now store\n   on their cell phones in holding that officers may not categorically conduct warrantless searches of data on arrestees' cell phones.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    at 2490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that many cell phone users keep \"a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives-from the mundane to the intimate\"). But the Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    T.L.O.\n   </em>\n   , that school officials did not need a warrant to search students suspected of violating a school rule or the law, was based, at least in part, on the needs of the\n   <em>\n    environment\n   </em>\n   in which the search is conducted,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the school setting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    T.L.O.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959437\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/325/#p334\">\n    469 U.S. at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959437\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/325/#p334\">\n    105 S.Ct. 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the warrant requirement is unsuited to the school environment). Further,\n   <em>\n    T.L.O.\n   </em>\n   specifically contemplated searches of \"highly personal items [such] as photographs, letters, and diaries\" that students carried to school.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959437\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/325/#p334\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959437\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/325/#p334\">\n    at 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959437\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/325/#p334\">\n    105 S.Ct. 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though technology has changed since\n   <em>\n    T.L.O.\n   </em>\n   was handed down, a school official's search of a student's cell phone on school property and during the school day still fits within the framework announced in\n   <em>\n    T.L.O.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   did not suggest in any way that\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   would apply to searches of students by school officials; nor did the Court in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   overrule\n   <em>\n    T.L.O.\n   </em>\n   , and it is certainly not this Court's prerogative to do so. The Court finds that the holdings of\n   <em>\n    T.L.O.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   are not \"so clear and broad\" that \"every objectively reasonable government official\" facing the circumstances presented here would know that conducting the search as Oates did would be illegal. Accordingly, Oates is entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim arising from the search of EDJ's phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    2. Mr. Jackson's Seizure Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Mr. Jackson contends that Smith, Veliz, and Kemp violated his Fourth Amendment rights when Smith forcibly removed him from the volleyball game at the direction of Kemp and Veliz.

After McCurry finished speaking with Mr. Jackson, McCurry advised Smith that Mr. Jackson was not allowed on school premises and informed Smith that he had warned Mr. Jackson that he was not allowed on school premises. Smith Dep. 29:12-22, 31:2-7. Thus, on the night Mr. Jackson attended the volleyball game, Smith had personal knowledge that Mr. Jackson had previously been warned that he was not permitted on school premises. Further, before Smith initially \"seized\" Mr. Jackson, Kemp, in the presence of Smith, called principal Veliz, who confirmed that Mr. Jackson was not permitted on school premises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kemp then confirmed to Smith that they should remove Mr. Jackson.

It is undisputed in this case that McCurry's stated reason for prohibiting Mr. Jackson from speaking to the school board was because Mr. Jackson threatened to sue the school and school officials. As noted above, a school may restrict access to a limited public forum based on the speaker's identity so long as it is reasonable and viewpoint neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   McCurry's restriction here was arguably reasonable in light of the purpose served by the citizen complaint portion of the school board meeting. The restriction simply prohibited a person who has sued or threatened to sue the school district from raising complaints to the school board that are the subject of that litigation. Such a policy prevents a potentially hostile engagement between potential litigants, and it also eliminates the opportunity for one party in pending or potential litigation to gain an advantage based upon discussion at a school board meeting. That does not mean that Mr. Jackson did not have other avenues to voice his grievances, including communicating with the school board attorney (which McCurry told Mr. Jackson to do), corresponding directly with school board members outside of the public meeting, filing a lawsuit, and using the United States mail, which are likely ample alternative channels for his grievances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189226\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/37/#p49\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189226\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/37/#p49\">\n    at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189226\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/37/#p49\">\n    103 S.Ct. 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that rival union had ample alternative channels to communicate with teachers because it could use bulletin boards, meeting facilities, and the U.S. mail). Given that the citizen complaint portion of the school board meeting is designed to allow the school board an opportunity to resolve issues that administrators have failed to resolve, prohibiting those who have threatened to sue or are suing the school from speaking about the subject of their suits or potential suits is reasonable. Even if such a restriction were not reasonable, however, it was certainly not clearly established at the time McCurry restricted Mr. Jackson's speech that such a restriction was unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   It is also important that the restriction was viewpoint neutral. \"Viewpoint discrimination occurs 'when the specific motivating ideology or opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction.' \"\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267145\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/1209/#p1223\">\n    872 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1225 n.10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rosenberger v.

Although the school district in this case may have disagreed with Mr. Jackson's contention that EDJ's Fourth Amendment rights were violated, there is no evidence in the record from which a reasonable jury could conclude that this was the reason he was not allowed to appear before the Board. Mr. Jackson pointed to no evidence that other speakers had threatened litigation against the school and were nonetheless allowed to speak at the board meetings. Nor did the restriction directly target Mr. Jackson's viewpoint that the school had violated EDJ's Fourth Amendment rights. Regardless of whether the school board agreed with Mr. Jackson that Oates violated EDJ's Fourth Amendment rights by searching her cell phone or not, he was prohibited from speaking on the matter at the school board meeting because he had threatened litigation over the issue. Had he not threatened litigation, then any attempt to prevent him from speaking at the public school board meeting could have been construed to be based upon his specific viewpoint. But the undisputed evidence establishes that he was denied the opportunity to speak because he had threatened litigation. And Plaintiffs have pointed to no cases clearly establishing that a restriction on a person's speech under these circumstances violates a person's First Amendment rights. Under\n   these circumstances, no reasonable school official would have concluded that such a restriction violated the First Amendment.
