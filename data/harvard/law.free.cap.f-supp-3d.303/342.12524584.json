Neff was convicted of conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization (\"RICO\") Act, conspiracy to commit fraud, and mail and wire fraud. The Government now seeks to forfeit Neff's alleged proceeds of the RICO conspiracy and Neff's residence, which contains his home office, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201963\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Neff contests both the Government's proposed forfeiture money judgment amount and the forfeiture of his residence. The Court held a hearing pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.2(b)(1)(B), and is now ready to issue a preliminary order of forfeiture. This memorandum constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of the preliminary order of forfeiture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that the Government is entitled to the forfeiture of (1) $323,856.75 as proceeds of the RICO conspiracy pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201963\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) ; and (2) Defendant Neff's right, title and interest in 12.11% of his Wilmington, Delaware, residence as property that afforded a source of influence over the RICO enterprise pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201963\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Upon this record, as well as credibility findings, the Court makes its findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   1. The Government properly signaled its intent to seek a forfeiture judgment as part of the punishment in this case through its filing of three notices of forfeiture, as well as a Bill of Particulars.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 87 at 47-54; ECF No. 158; ECF No. 202; ECF No. 253.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   2. The evidence at trial proved that Defendant Neff's legal services were instrumental to the success of the RICO\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   enterprises charged in Counts One and Two of the Superseding Indictment. Although Defendant Neff was neither an owner nor a manager of the RICO enterprises, he participated in the conduct of both enterprises by advising Adrian Rubin and Defendant Hallinan regarding how to create the sham partnerships with the tribes, and then preparing fraudulent contracts and other documents to support the RICO enterprises. Defendant Neff also wrote fraudulent contracts and documents for the Hallinan Payday Lending Companies to create the sham ownership of Apex 1 Processing, Inc. by Defendant Ginger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Exs. 1-8, 9-10, 31-50, 61-76, 81-85, 87-93, 99-101, 186, 209-10, 213-16, 219, 220-23, 226-28, 230, 307-09, 317-355, 400, 447-471, 541-582, 668, 671, 721, 750, 889, 892, 893, 899, 927, 931, 933, 936, 943, 948, 951.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   3. Defendant Neff was paid $331,158 from the Hallinan Payday Lending Companies during the course of the RICO conspiracy charged in Count One.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Exs. 307-08, 2167-71, 2180-82, 2214. Some of these payments related to Defendant Neff's participation in the conduct of the RICO conspiracy charged in Count One.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Exs. 307-08, 2167-71, 2180-82, 2214.

Neff (\"Adrienne Neff Decl.\"), ECF No. 330.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   4. Beginning on June 1, 2013, the billing invoices Defendant Neff sent to the Hallinan Payday Lending Companies included separate amounts due for Defendant Neff's legal work performed for the Hallinan Capital Corporation, for \"Business to Business Loan Operations,\" and for \"Payday Loan Operations.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 331 at 6-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   5. The legal work Defendant Neff performed for the Hallinan Payday Lending Companies in the categories of \"Hallinan Capital Corporation\" and \"Payday Loan Operations\" related to the RICO conspiracy charged in Count One.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201343\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the legal work Defendant Neff performed for the Hallinan Payday Lending Companies in the category of \"Business to Business Loan Operations\" did not relate to the RICO conspiracy charged in Count One.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201343\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   6. Defendant Neff's billing invoices establish that $7,301.25 of the amount that the Hallinan Payday Lending Companies paid Defendant Neff for legal work performed during the course of the RICO conspiracy charged in Count One was in the category of Business to Business Loan Operations, and therefore did not relate to the RICO conspiracy charged in Count One.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201343\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These invoices establish that, of the $331,158 that the Hallinan Payday Lending Companies paid Defendant Neff during the course of the RICO conspiracy charged in Count One, $7,301.25 did not relate to the RICO conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201343\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   7. Defendant Neff was paid $32,176 from the Rubin Payday Lending Companies during the course of the RICO conspiracy charged in Count Two.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Exs. 2172-73, 2175-77, 2215. All of these payments related to Defendant Neff's participation in the conduct of the RICO conspiracy charged in Count Two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   8. The Government seeks forfeiture of 118 School Road, Wilmington, Delaware (\"the Wilmington Property\"), which is a real property owned by Defendant Neff and his wife.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   9. Defendant Neff served as the registered agent of several of the Hallinan Payday Lending Companies, and he listed the Wilmington Property as the address for the registered agent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Exs. 210, 213-14, 216, 219-21, 223, 226-27, 228, 230, 2213, 2260.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   10. In addition, while serving as an attorney to the Hallinan Payday Lending Companies, Defendant Neff performed legal work in support of the RICO enterprise charged in Count One from his home office within the Wilmington Property, which was his place of business at the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Ex. 2160. For example, Defendant Neff sent correspondence and emails on behalf of the Hallinan Payday Lending Companies from his home office within the Wilmington Property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Exs. 186, 186, 209, 215, 222, 307-09, 321, 333, 335, 400, 668, 671, 721, 750, 889, 892-93, 898-99, 927, 931, 933, 936, 943, 948, 951, 2213.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   11. Defendant Neff's home office comprises 12.11% of the total square footage of the Wilmington Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   1. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.2(a), a court cannot enter a judgment of forfeiture in a criminal proceeding unless \"the indictment or information contains notice to the defendant that the government will seek the forfeiture of property as part of any sentence in accordance with the applicable statute.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.2(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   2. Here, the Government provided adequate notice to Defendant Neff of the Government's intention to seek forfeiture in this case for the convictions of Counts One and Two, including a money judgment, directly forfeitable property, and substitute assets, through the notices of forfeiture and the forfeiture Bills of Particular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   3. It is the Government's burden to establish that specific property is subject to forfeiture. In the Third Circuit, the Government must prove the relationship between the property interest to be forfeited and the RICO violations beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
