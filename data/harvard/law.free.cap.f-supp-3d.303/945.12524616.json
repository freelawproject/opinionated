Supp. Brief \u00b6 7, ECF No. 56, Page ID 479. He was based out of North Platte, Nebraska, and typically worked on trains routed from North Platte to Council Bluffs, Iowa.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10, Page ID 480.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A Locomotive Engineer is a \"safety sensitive\" position, responsible for regulating the speed of moving trains and ensuring compliance with safety protocols.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. A Locomotive Engineer's mishandling of a train can cause a derailment or collision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.

Higgins suffered a crushed disc in his spine, was hospitalized for three weeks, and eventually had back surgery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.

Union Pacific cancelled the investigation in January of 1999.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. On January 25, 1999, Dr. Brittan wrote a letter stating that \"nothing has changed medically\" as to Higgins's back injury and that his restrictions should be kept the same.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28 (quoting Brittan Ltr., ECF No. 65-10, Page ID 906).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On October 26, 1999, Sullivan wrote a letter (Sullivan Letter) to Union Pacific Superintendent Rich Jensen, memorializing their agreement \"that [Higgins] will not be disciplined as the result of him\n   being absent from service.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29, Page ID 593 (quoting Sullivan Ltr., ECF No. 65-11, Page ID 907).

In this position, Humpherys was eligible for a performance bonus, depending in part on meeting certain performance goals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. One such performance goal was reducing the number of lay-offs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On October 8, 2004, Humpherys reviewed Higgins's attendance record and noted that it was \"[v]ery borderline,\" and that Humpherys would \"[c]ontinue monitoring.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34 (quoting ECF No. 63-14, Page ID 766). In late 2005, Humpherys recommended to Higgins's supervisor that Higgins be given notice for his violation of the attendance policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35, Page ID 594. Shortly after this, Humpherys discussed the Sullivan Letter with Superintendent Cameron Scott, who told Humpherys that the \"[l]etter stands.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36 (quoting ECF No. 63-14, Page ID 766.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On June 17, and September 23, 2008, Humpherys sent letters to Higgins, warning him that continued lay-offs could result in discipline.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40. In November of 2010, Higgins provided a note from his physician, Dr. Jason Citta, at Union Pacific's request. The letter suggested that Higgins should be given three to four trips off per month due to his back.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41, Page ID 595.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Union Pacific alleges that prior to 2011 it \"had limited means to examine data regarding the specific attendance records of the 2,000 employees in the North Platte service unit.\" Supp. Brief \u00b6 32, ECF No. 56, Page ID 484. According to Union Pacific, \"[a]s a result of improved technology that became available in about 2011, Union Pacific began focusing on holding employees accountable for absenteeism as well as other aspects of the business designed to improve efficiency and profitability.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On January 1, 2011, Union Pacific's \"Railroad Train, Engine, and Yard Attendance Policy\" (TEY Policy) went into effect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28, Page ID 483. The TEY Policy states \"[a]s a Union Pacific employee, you ... are expected to protect your job assignment on a fulltime basis. 'Full-time' means being available to work your assignment, whether regular or extra, whenever it is scheduled to work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. The policy further states that \"[s]ubstantiating documentation is expected and may be required. However, notification and documentation alone do not excuse your responsibility to protect your job. You may be considered in violation of this policy regardless of the explanation offered if you are unable to work full time and protect all employment obligations.\" ECF No. 56-9, Page ID 560. The policy warned that, if an employee used lay-offs too frequently, \"an investigation will be held; and, if appropriate, discipline will be issued based on the results of the investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The job description for a Union Pacific Locomotive Engineer listed \"[a]ttendance in compliance with the applicable attendance policy\" as an essential function of the position. Supp. Brief \u00b6 28, ECF No. 56, Page ID 482-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The overall attendance in the North Platte service unit was measured by percentages derived from dividing the number of non-compensated layoffs by the total number of employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34, ECF No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   56, Page ID 484. When Humpherys took over in 2004, this percentage was approximately eight percent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To decrease this percentage, Humpherys first identified the employees with the highest number of non-compensated layoffs, which were individuals on the \"E\" list.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Humpherys began addressing attendance issues in earnest in 2011, Higgins was not identified as an employee on the \"E\" list.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On April 11, 2013 Higgins received a letter from Humpherys notifying him that Union Pacific was monitoring his attendance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. In October 2013, Humpherys sent an email to a colleague in Union Pacific's Labor Relations office, among others, discussing Higgins's 1991 injury, the agreement allowing him to lay off for that injury, and stating that \"Higgins has been a chronic absenteeism problem for years.\" Opp. Brief \u00b6 40, Page ID 62, Page ID 581-82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the spring of 2014, Humpherys's review of Higgins's attendance record showed that in 2012 and 2013, Higgins laid off on approximately 20 and 24 percent of his starts, respectively. Supp. Brief \u00b6 40, ECF No. 56, Page ID 485-86. Humpherys sent Higgins an Attendance Alert and Advisory letter on April 2, 2014, which explained that his attendance was unsatisfactory under the TEY Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Between May 11, 2014, and August 9, 2014, Higgins laid off on 26 percent of his shifts-eight non-compensated lay-offs and 23 starts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.

In response, Higgins provided Union Pacific with a letter dated August 19, 2014, from Dr. Citta, which stated that as a result of his \"intermittent and unpredictable\" back pain, Higgins would be required to miss work \"on an intermittent basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45 (quoting Citta Ltr., ECF No. 52-5, Page ID 326) ).

ANXIETY ATTACK AND FITNESS-FOR-DUTY EVALUATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On September 8, 2014, Higgins filed an occupational injury report, in which he stated that he experienced an anxiety attack while on a locomotive. Higgins claimed the episode was caused by \"stress and depression due to harassment by [Union Pacific] and North Platte manager Michael Hansen\" regarding the investigation into Higgins's attendance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47 (quoting Injury Rep., ECF No. 52-6, Page ID 327-28). This was Higgins's first and only panic attack.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.

Union Pacific contends that this decision was driven solely by safety concerns.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nielson completed a FFD Request Form, in which he stated that the FFD was being requested due to Nielsen's \"Absenteeism,\" \"Deteriorating Performance,\" \"Anxiety Attacks,\" and \"Stress,\" among other issues described\n   in Higgins's injury report. ECF No. 52-25, Page ID 455.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As part of the FFD evaluation, Union Pacific requested that Higgins submit a \"copy of clinic notes (also known as office notes or progress notes) from the provider treating your medical condition(s)\" to the company's Health and Medical Services office.

Even if his assertion were true-a question the Court does not reach-Higgins failed to rebut Union Pacific's evidence demonstrating a legitimate reason for the FFD policy. Specifically, Union Pacific presented evidence that managerial referrals of employees for FFDs is rooted in train safety. Higgins's experience makes this plain: Higgins reported experiencing a debilitating panic attack while responsible for the safety of a traveling locomotive, a situation obviously requiring immediate removal from his job duties, and referral for a medical evaluation. Higgins implies that such referrals should be made by medical professionals. But requiring that managers confer with medical professionals simply to refer an employee\n   <em>\n    to medical professionals\n   </em>\n   would insert a redundancy into a process that could result in catastrophe and loss of life.

Higgins implies that Union Pacific is guilty of \"purposefully lying to a medical provider in order to obtain an employee's entire medical file,\" ECF No. 62, Page ID 636, presumably referring to the letter in which Dr. Citta stated that Union Pacific told Citta's office that \"the wrong date was on the medical records release\" and Union Pacific needed the whole file, ECF No. 65. As stated, the comment attributed to Union Pacific in the letter is hearsay, and Higgins has not brought forth further evidence of this alleged phone call.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gannon Int'l, Ltd. v.

Union Pacific concedes that at some point the date on the release was changed from October 1, 2014, to September 9, 2014,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Supp. Brief n.3, ECF No. 56, Page ID 490, but this is insufficient to establish that Union Pacific acted with the requisite malice or reckless indifference to support a reasonable jury's award of punitive damages. For these reasons, Count II fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Higgins also presents a similar claim for unlawful medical inquiry, pursuant to GINA. Under GINA, it is unlawful for an employer to \"request, require, or purchase\" genetic information from an employee. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000ff-1(b). Requesting genetic information includes \"making requests for information about an individual's current health status in a way that is likely to result in a covered entity obtaining genetic information.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201635.8\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1635.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). \"The term 'genetic information' means, with respect to any individual, information about-(i) such individual's genetic tests, (ii) the genetic tests of family members of such individual, and (iii) the manifestation of a disease or disorder in family members of such individual.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000ff(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   As with Count II, Higgins has not presented evidence to establish an injury-in-fact or to show that Union Pacific's request for medical information was conducted with the requisite state of mind to merit punitive damages.
