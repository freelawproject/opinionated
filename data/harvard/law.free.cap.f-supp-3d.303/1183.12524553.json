The Court, having considered the motion, briefs, and relevant law, and being otherwise fully informed, finds that the Motion is well-taken and will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In December 2013, Plaintiff Lynn Davis received email advertisements from Defendant Groupon Goods, Inc. (\"Groupon\") promoting Garcinia Cambogia, a weight loss product. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 7. On or about December 6, 2013, Plaintiff ordered three bottles, or a three-month supply, of Garcinia Cambogia tablets through Groupon's website. Id. at \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the evidence submitted by Groupon, before placing her order, Plaintiff was required to create an account. Doc. 24-1. To create her account, Plaintiff was required to click a box immediately to the left of the words, \"I agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Statement.\" Doc. 24-2. Further, before finalizing her order, Plaintiff was required to click a button that said \"Complete Order.\" Doc. 43-1 at \u00b6 7. Directly below the \"Complete Order\" button was a sentence stating: \"[b]y clicking 'Complete Order' I accept the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.\" Doc. 24-4. The phrase \"Terms and Conditions\" contained a hyperlink that permitted the customer to access the Terms of Use by clicking on the phrase \"Terms and Conditions.\" Doc. 43-1 at \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The version of Groupon's Terms of Use that was in effect on December 6, 2013, the date of Plaintiff's purchase of the Garcinia Gambogia tablets, was a 22-page document. The First page had a table of contents, with hyperlinks to each numbered-section, preceded by the following introduction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Welcome to the Groupon Site.

If you have any questions about these Terms of Use,\n   <em>\n    contact us here\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Doc. 24-3 at 1. Section 18 of the document was titled, \"Arbitration,\" and provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   We will make every reasonable effort to resolve any disagreements that you have with Groupon. If those efforts fail, by using this Site you agree that any claim, dispute, or controversy you may have against Groupon arising out of, or relating to, or connected in any way with this Agreement this Site or the purchase or sale of any voucher(s), shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA (\"Rules and Procedures\"). You agree further that: (a) the arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and Groupon; (b) the arbitrator shall apply Illinois law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (c) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis; arbitration can decide only your and/or persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (d) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Groupon will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (e) with the exception of subpart (c) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained therein. If, however, subpart (c) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Groupon shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Doc. 24-3 at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff received the tablets that she had ordered, and began taking them in late January or early February 2014. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 11. In March, she began to feel ill and stopped taking the tablets. Id. at \u00b6 12. Thereafter, in May 2014, Plaintiff was hospitalized and found to have nearly no liver function. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. Ultimately, Plaintiff needed a liver transplant, which she received in June 2014, at the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19. The Mayo Clinic Hospital determined that the Garcinia Cambogia tablets were the probable cause of Plaintiff's acute liver failure. Id. at \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a result, Plaintiff commenced the instant action against,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Groupon, alleging claims of strict liability for defective product, strict liability for failure to warn, negligence, and unfair trade practices. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 25-49. Plaintiff also seeks punitive damages based on her claims. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Groupon filed the instant motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings, arguing that Plaintiff agreed to Groupon's terms of service, and that those terms of service require arbitration of the dispute in this action. Plaintiff opposes Groupon's motion, arguing that no valid arbitration agreement exists, and that even if there is a valid arbitration agreement, her claims\n   are outside the scope of any such agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") applies to arbitration provisions in \"a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In support of its motion, Groupon argues that its Terms of Use, to which Plaintiff agreed when completing her purchase of Garcinia Cambogia, contains a valid and binding arbitration provision, and that Plaintiff's claims fall squarely within the scope of that provision. Groupon further requests that the Court stay Plaintiff's claims against it pending resolution of the arbitration, or alternatively, dismiss the instant case in its entirety. Plaintiff opposes Groupon's motion to compel, arguing that no valid agreement to arbitrate exists because: (1) the undisputed evidence does not establish that the parties entered into an arbitration agreement; and (2) the purported arbitration agreement is unconscionable and thus unenforceable under New Mexico law. Plaintiff further argues that her claims do not bear a reasonable relationship to the subject matter of Groupon's Terms of Use, and thus do not fall within the scope of the purported arbitration agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    A Valid Arbitration Agreement Exists Between the Parties.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Parties Entered into an Agreement to Arbitrate.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff's first argument against arbitration is that she never agreed to Groupon's Terms of Use and, consequently, never agreed to the arbitration provision included in those Terms of Use.

The arbitration provision contained in Uber's terms and conditions specifically incorporated the AAA Rules.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270352\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/228/985/#p988\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270352\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/228/985/#p988\">\n    at 991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Citing \"the clear weight of authority ... enforcing arbitrability delegation via incorporation of the AAA rules, ... regardless of the sophistication of the parties,\" the court concluded that Uber's terms and conditions, by incorporating the AAA rules into their arbitration provision, showed \"the parties' clear and unmistakable intent to delegate arbitrability questions to an arbitrator.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270352\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/228/985/#p988\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270352\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/228/985/#p988\">\n    at 991-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the court held that \"[b]ecause the parties agreed to arbitration, and agreed to delegate questions of arbitrability to an arbitrator, the remaining questions of whether the arbitration agreement is valid and whether it encompasses this dispute are delegated to an arbitrator.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270352\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/228/985/#p988\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270352\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/228/985/#p988\">\n    at 992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In a similar fashion, the parties here clearly and unmistakably agreed to arbitrate arbitrability. Accordingly, all questions of arbitrability-including the question Plaintiff raises as to whether her claims reasonably relate to the subject matter of the parties' agreement to arbitrate-must be resolved by an arbitrator. Under\n   <em>\n    Belnap\n   </em>\n   , this Court has no discretion to decide whether Plaintiff's claims are outside the scope of the arbitration provision in Groupon's Terms of Use, but rather must defer that determination to the arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    This Court Must Stay the Instant Proceedings.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \"Regarding a suit brought in federal court 'upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration,' the [FAA] provides the district court 'shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement.' \"\n   <em>\n    Adair Bus Sales v.

In its motion, Groupon moves this Court for a stay pending arbitration. \"The proper course, therefore,\" is for this Court to grant Groupon's motion and stay the action pending arbitration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The undisputed facts demonstrate that the parties entered into an agreement to\n   arbitrate. That agreement is not unconscionable under either New Mexico law or Illinois law. The undisputed facts further demonstrate that the parties agreed that it is for the arbitrator, not this Court, to determine whether Plaintiff's claims fall within the scope of their agreement to arbitrate. Having found that the issues in this case should be referred to arbitration, the proper course is for this Court to stay the action pending arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant Groupon Goods Inc.'s Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings [Doc. 24] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:: (1) Groupon's request for an order compelling arbitration of Plaintiff's claims is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   ; (2) this Court\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff to arbitrate the claims asserted in this action against Groupon in accordance with the terms of the arbitration provision in Groupon's Terms of Use; and (3) Groupon's request for an order to stay this lawsuit pending the completion of arbitration is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Plaintiff relies on New Mexico law in her opposition to Groupon's motion. In its reply, Groupon argues that Illinois law applies, because the arbitration provision in its Terms of Use contains a choice of law provision applying Illinois law. The Court analyzes the relevant issues under both New Mexico and Illinois law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
