The stated purpose of the order is to encourage energy exploration and production of\n   the outer continental shelf. On April 29, 2017, the Secretary of the Interior issued an order implementing the Executive Order, calling for expedited consideration of seismic permitting applications for the Atlantic Ocean.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   There is industry interest in oil and gas activities in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, including industry groups expressing interest in conducting seismic surveys in those oceans. After the President issued the Executive Order, one seismic industry trade group called for seismic surveying in the previously withdrawn areas to proceed \"without delay.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Several seismic operations companies have applied for permits to conduct \"deep-penetration seismic surveys.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Seismic surveys use loud, frequent sound pulses to map the sea floor in order to identify potential oil and gas deposits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs maintain that these pulses are harmful to marine mammals as well as fish and shellfish, causing these animals to suffer loss of hearing and sensory capabilities, which could result in death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2012, the National Marine Fisheries Service estimated that a two-month-long seismic survey would disrupt 60,000 ringed seals and 4,600 beluga whales in the Arctic Ocean.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 3, 2017, Plaintiffs brought this action, which challenges Executive Order 13795. Plaintiffs include the following organizations: League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, Alaska Wilderness League, Defenders of Wildlife, Northern Alaska Environmental Center, Resisting Environmental Destruction on Indigenous Lands, Center for Biological Diversity, Greenpeace, Inc., and The Wilderness Society.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that \"President Trump acted in excess of his authority under Article II of the U.S. Constitution and intruded on Congress's non-delegated exclusive power under the Property Clause, in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs also allege a cause of action for statutory\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   action, alleging that the President \"lacks authority to reverse or undo Section 12(a) withdrawals\" and \"[n]either OCSLA nor any other statute authorizes the President to re-open for disposition areas withdrawn under OCSLA Section 12(a).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs filed suit against President Donald J. Trump, who issued the Executive Order, Ryan Zinke, the Secretary of the Interior, who administers and implements OCSLA, and Wilbur Ross, Secretary of Commerce, who has the responsibility for administering and implementing the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act (collectively the \"Federal Defendants\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Federal Defendants are all sued in their official capacities. American Petroleum Institute (\"API\") intervened as a national trade association of the oil and natural gas industry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State of Alaska also intervened, asserting that some \"State offshore land within the coastal zone of the Beaufort Sea is available for oil and gas leasing[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Federal Defendants and the Intervenors all seek dismissal of Plaintiffs' Complaint under both Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A \"lack of Article III standing requires dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"A Rule 12(b)(1) jurisdictional attack may be facial or factual.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case, Federal Defendants assert a facial challenge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"In a facial attack, the challenger asserts that the allegations contained in a complaint are insufficient on their face to invoke federal jurisdiction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court \"resolves a facial attack as it would a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) : Accepting the plaintiff's allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor, the court determines whether the allegations are sufficient as a legal matter to invoke the court's jurisdiction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, \"[t]his is not to say that plaintiff may rely on a bare legal conclusion to assert injury-in-fact[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff has the burden of establishing the elements of Article III standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)(6)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court considers only the pleadings and documents incorporated into the pleadings by reference, as well as matters on which a court may take judicial notice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   A claim is plausible on its face \"when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, there must be \"more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   A court \"accept[s] factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe[s] the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that this Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1361.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Federal Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint for the following reasons: (1) the Federal Defendants are immune from suit under sovereign immunity; (2) Plaintiffs do not have a private right of action; (3) a court cannot issue declaratory relief against the President of the United States; and (4) Plaintiffs lack Article III standing. API asserts in its motion to dismiss that the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this case under OCSLA. The State of Alaska incorporates the arguments made by both parties in its motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Sovereign Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Federal Defendants first assert that \"the United States is immune from suit except to the extent Congress unequivocally and expressly waives that immunity\" and Plaintiffs have not shown that their action falls within a waiver of sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Generally, when an individual brings a lawsuit against the government, the plaintiff must obtain a waiver of the government's sovereign immunity, which must be expressed in statutory text.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Federal Defendants assert that the sovereign immunity waiver set forth in \u00a7 702 of the Administrative Procedure Act does not apply to this case \"because the President is not an 'agency' and thus his actions are not reviewable under the APA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Federal Defendants are correct in that Plaintiffs are not proceeding under that statute, the United States Supreme Court has held that there are circumstances where the sovereign immunity doctrine does not apply. In\n   <em>\n    Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp.\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that sovereign immunity does not apply where:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   the officer's powers are limited by statute, his actions beyond those limitations are considered individual and not sovereign actions. The officer is not doing the business which the sovereign has empowered him to do or he is doing it in a way which the sovereign has forbidden. His actions are ultra vires his authority and therefore may be made the object of specific relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Larson\n   </em>\n   Court also acknowledged a second exception to the sovereign immunity doctrine: when an officer \"take[s] action in the sovereign's name [and that action] is claimed to be unconstitutional.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In this case, Plaintiffs allege that the President \"acted in excess of his statutory authority\" and \"acted in excess of his authority under Article II of the U.S. Constitution.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Plaintiffs assert that the President acted beyond his delegated powers enumerated in OCSLA and the Constitution, the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not apply, and Plaintiffs are not required to demonstrate a Congressional waiver of sovereign immunity in order to bring this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Private Right of Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Federal Defendants next contend that \"Plaintiffs fail to identify any statute that provides them a right of action to enforce their alleged rights under OCSLA and the Property Clause.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Alexander v. Sandoval\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lonberg v. City of Riverside\n   </em>\n   , Federal Defendants assert that \"private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by Congress\" and \"courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lonberg\n   </em>\n   each involved the courts determining whether the plaintiffs had private causes of action to enforce a federal regulation against a third party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs respond that they are not seeking \"to step into the statute-enforcing shoes of the federal government as to third parties.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Plaintiffs allege that the President exceeded his statutory and constitutional authority and acted\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   in issuing Executive Order 13795 ; therefore, Plaintiffs are not seeking to enforce a federal law. Courts have on occasion adjudicated causes of action alleging that the President has exceeded his constitutional or statutory authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Franklin v. Massachusetts\n   </em>\n   , \"the President's actions may still be reviewed for constitutionality ... [even if] they are not reviewable for abuse of discretion under the APA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Plaintiffs do not need express Congressional authorization to maintain these causes of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Declaratory Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Federal Defendants next argue that \"[c]ourts may not issue declaratory relief against co-equal branches of government.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs respond that they are not seeking an injunction against the President. Rather, they seek only a declaration that he exceeded his authority. They maintain that \"[w]ith such a finding, Plaintiff's harm can be redressed by an injunction against the Defendant Secretaries.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The power of this Court to issue a declaratory judgment against the President is limited at best. In\n   <em>\n    Franklin v. Massachusetts\n   </em>\n   , a plurality of the Supreme Court held that an injunction against the President was improper, but nonetheless the plaintiffs had standing because injunctive relief against a subordinate federal official would likely redress the injury alleged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Federal Defendants cite to\n   <em>\n    Newdow v. Bush\n   </em>\n   to support their argument, a case from the District of Columbia District Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Newdow\n   </em>\n   sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction to prohibit the inclusion of prayers by invited clergy at the Presidential Inauguration.\n   <em>\n    Newdow\n   </em>\n   was not a challenge to an executive order issued by the President. The district court, quoting Justice Scalia's concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Franklin v. Massachusetts\n   </em>\n   , stated that the President is generally immune from declaratory relief as well as injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the district court acknowledged there are exceptions to this immunity and that \"the outer boundaries of the immunity remain unclear.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs in this case are primarily seeking injunctive relief against subordinate officials; they do not seek injunctive relief against the President.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the event that Plaintiffs were to prevail on the merits, Plaintiffs' alleged harms may well be adequately redressed if an injunction against subordinate officials were to issue, in which event the President would be dismissed. But dismissal of the entire action on this basis is not warranted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Article III Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Federal Defendants maintain that Plaintiffs lack Article III standing because Plaintiffs have not alleged an imminent, geographically specific, and particularized harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs respond that \"the complaint [provides that] the President's action has the immediate, purposeful effect of removing an absolute bar to new oil and gas leasing and development in protected areas of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Article III standing requires that a plaintiff must have \"(1) suffered an\n   injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   To establish injury in fact, Plaintiffs must establish that they suffered \"an invasion of a legally protected interest\" that is \"concrete and particularized\" and \"actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    A. Imminent Harm\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Federal Defendants assert that Plaintiffs have not alleged an imminent harm sufficient to confer Article III standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs respond that they have alleged a substantial risk of future harm sufficient to support Article III standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   At the motion to dismiss stage, \"general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant's conduct may suffice, for on a motion to dismiss [the court] presume[s] that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"An allegation of future injury may suffice if the threatened injury is 'certainly impending,' or there is a 'substantial risk that the harm will occur.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Federal Defendants assert that although it is \"certainly conceivable that oil and gas exploration and development will occur somewhere within the [128 million acres Plaintiffs claim are affected by the Executive Order] at some point in time,\" it is unclear \"when or where such oil and gas exploration will occur.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, Federal Defendants argue that because there are multiple steps to obtaining leases and drilling permits in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, there is no risk of imminent harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Ninth Circuit recently considered whether a group of plaintiffs had a sufficient risk of future harm when they had yet to suffer any actual harm in\n   <em>\n    In re Zappos.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Zappos\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs brought a class action against Zappos alleging that hackers had stolen their personal information from Zappos's servers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court dismissed one group of plaintiffs, holding that the group did not have standing because their personal information had not yet been used by hackers and they had not incurred any financial harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Ninth Circuit reversed and held that there was Article III standing as to those plaintiffs. The court discussed the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Clapper v.

Noise from seismic operations harms marine mammals.

The members' use and enjoyment of these areas and wildlife are affected by the condition of the areas and health of individual wildlife and populations and their habitat in the wild. Any activities, such as oil and gas exploration or development, including seismic surveying, that destroy, degrade, or diminish the wild and natural state of these areas, or that kill, injure, harm, harass, or displace wildlife, also interfere with Plaintiffs' members' use and enjoyment of the areas and associated wildlife.
