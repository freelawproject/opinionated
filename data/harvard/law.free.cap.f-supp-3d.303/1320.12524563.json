MARTINEZ, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   THIS CAUSE came before the Court upon Defendants Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, Inc. d/b/a Dollar Rent A Car, Dollar Rent A Car, Inc., and DTG Operations, Inc.'s (collectively \"Dollar\") Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Class Action Complaint for Breach of Contract, Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, and Violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"FDUTPA\") [ECF No. 21]. Dollar, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), seeks dismissal of all Plaintiff Marshall Maor's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Specifically, Dollar presents several arguments in the motion: (1) Maor has not alleged a breach of a contract claim, because the contract terms do not require the toll administrative fee to be related to Dollar's underlying toll administrative costs; (2) the voluntary payment doctrine bars Maor's breach of contract claim; (3) Florida law does not recognize a claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing without a properly pleaded breach of contract claim; (4) Florida law does not recognize a claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if the claimed covenant would vary the express terms of a contract; and (5) the FDUTPA claim fails because the fees were fully disclosed, and thus, neither deceptive nor unfair. [\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons explained below, this Court denies Dollar's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case arises out of Dollar Rent-A-Car's rental contract provision that provides for charging certain customers toll costs and an administrative fee per use of an electronic toll booth. [ECF No. 1].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   2008, Dollar implemented Electronic Toll Collection (\"ETC\") for its rental cars, allowing customers to use cashless toll systems. [\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2]. Dollar's standard rental contract contains an express term requiring customers who decline a toll package to pay for any electronic tolls incurred, plus an administrative fee of $15 per occurrence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3]. The specific provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   All toll fines (including the use of all cashless toll roads without the purchase of the toll By-pass option) are subject to an admin fee of $15 per violation/occurrence. You authorize us to release your billing/rental information to PlatePass, LLC and ATS Processing Services, LLC to process and bill to your credit card or billing account for the above-mentioned charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3]. Dollar collects payment for these charges through a third party, and at the time of collection, the third party provides a Frequently Asked Questions document that describes why the customer was charged an administration fee: \"[p]er your rental agreement, an administration fee was charged to cover the costs of processing your citation on behalf of the Rental Car Company.\" [\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 48]. Dollar's actual costs to process electronic toll collection are only a fraction of the administrative fees charged to customers, and Dollar's fees are three times that of the next most expensive competitor. [\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8, 10, 37-38].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff Marshall Maor is a citizen of New York. While travelling in Florida, Maor contracted with Dollar, declined a toll package, rented a vehicle, and used an electronic toll booth. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45]. Dollar subsequently sent Maor a \"Dollar Rent A Car Toll Charge Notice[,]\" instructing Maor that he was subject to a toll charge of $1.37 and an administrative fee of $15.00. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47]. Maor paid the fee. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Maor brings this class action on behalf of himself and those similarly situated: \"All Dollar customers who rented (or will rent) Dollar vehicles for pick up in Florida and who paid (or will pay) Dollar's $15 or $25 per toll administration fee commencing January 1, 2008.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51]. The Complaint contains three claims, all brought under Florida law. Maor alleges that Dollar breached the express terms of its contract with customers by charging an administrative fee \"to cover the costs of processing\" toll citations, while only using a fraction of the fee to cover such costs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63]. Furthermore, Maor alleges that Dollar breached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing to which the contract was subject, because Dollar charged customers an administrative fee that was not based on covering the costs of processing toll citations. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-72]. Finally, Maor alleges that Dollar misrepresented the nature and purpose of the administrative fee, deceiving customers to their detriment, such that the conduct was unconscionable, deceptive, or unfair and violated the FDUTPA. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-68].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

However, the Court decided that a claim for breach of contract was adequately pled because plaintiffs alleged that the contract identified \"insurance charges as pass-through charges not retained by [Defendant,]\" and \"that Defendant breached those provisions by failing to pass-through the full amount that Plaintiff paid for insurance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   While the existence of a contract is not in dispute, this case appears to turn on what Dollar means by an \"administrative fee\" within its contractual relationship with customers. Dollar argues that it is simply a $15 fee per toll occurrence, as stated by the purportedly unambiguous language of the rental contract, and that the contract does not restrict how Dollar may put that administrative fee to use or specify on what the fee is based. If this encapsulated Maor's allegations, then this case would be like\n   <em>\n    Sallee\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Ramon\n   </em>\n   : there can be no\n   breach where the defendant charged the plaintiff \"the precise amount he agreed to under the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%20604795\">\n    2007 WL 604795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sallee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201281518\">\n    2015 WL 1281518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *6. But Maor goes further, alleging that during their contractual relationship, Dollar, in collecting this administrative fee, sent him a document that describes the administrative fee \"per your rental agreement\" charged to \"cover the costs\" of processing tolls.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 48]. The parties dispute the meaning of the contract terms, specifically whether Dollar had an obligation to pay all toll administrative fees to \"cover the costs\" of toll processing. In fact, Dollar disputes that the additional document referred to by Maor is part of the contract at all. However, to decide whether the additional document is part and parcel of the contract or to decide the meaning of the disputed terms at this preliminary stage would entail a factual inquiry more appropriate at a further stage of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As alleged, the administrative fee appears to be charged to pass through underlying toll administration costs from Dollar to its customers. By collecting more than necessary to pay these costs, and by not passing those amounts on to the toll processing company, Maor alleges that Dollar breached the existing contract.

These terms exist in some tension with one another: does Dollar charge $15 per occurrence, regardless of the underlying toll administration costs, or does Dollar limit its collection of fees to that necessary to \"cover\" its toll administration costs, which would be the reasonable expectation of Dollar's customers?
