The court in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   also reasoned that the record evidence failed to support \"any meaningful difference in the market rate for substantive work as opposed to fees-on-fees,\" and if anything, suggested that \"there [wa]s no [such] difference.\"\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524481\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/213/\">\n    302 F.Supp.3d at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201461899\">\n    2018 WL 1461899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11. The same is true in this case. Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   , the court will not require Plaintiff to \"demonstrate anew\" the reasonableness of the rate she proposes. Instead, the court will apply the same prevailing market rate (75% of the USAO Matrix rate) to calculate Plaintiff's fees-on-fees. \"To hold otherwise would 'increase the burden on the courts and unnecessarily protract the litigation without advancing the goals of IDEA.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 228,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201461899\">\n    2018 WL 1461899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (quoting\n   <em>\n    McNeil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268283\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/233/150/#p153\">\n    233 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   155 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court's holding, however, is subject to one caveat. In her motion, Plaintiff states that \"[t]he Court has already determined the appropriate rate for [her] counsel is 75% of the matrix rates, and [she] does not seek an adjustment from that determination for her fees on fees.\" Pl.'s Mem. at 1-2. A careful examination of Plaintiff's counsel's invoice, however, reveals that her counsel billed at 75% of the\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   USAO Matrix rates for the 2017-2018 year, and not 75% of the USAO Matrix rates that this court applied in its previous decision.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Updated Invoice; Updated USAO Matrix,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524153\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/4/\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 9, 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20400754\">\n    2018 WL 400754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3, *8 (applying rates for the 2015-2016 year). Yet Plaintiff has offered no reason why the court should apply only the current USAO Matrix rates to the entirety of the fees petition work. The court therefore declines to do so here. Instead, the court will only apply the USAO Matrix rates applicable at the time the underlying fees petition work was performed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 3. Because\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of the services were performed between June 1, 2016, and May 31, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Updated Invoice; Updated USAO Matrix (noting that the hourly rates for each year are measured from June 1st to May 31st), the court will apply 75% of the USAO Matrix rates for the 2016-2017 year to calculate the fees award as to those services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, to the extent Defendant argues that the court should apply its proposed 50% of the USAO Matrix rates \"to account for [Plaintiff's] limited success\" in litigating her initial fees petition,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 3 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hensley v.

True, in\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explained that if a prevailing party \"achieve[s] only partial or limited success,\" then the district court has discretion to exercise its equitable judgment to \"identify specific hours that should be eliminated, or ... simply reduce the award to account for limited success.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p436\">\n    461 U.S. at 434, 436-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p436\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The District's proposed award is therefore perplexing, given that the District does not dispute the number of hours spent by Plaintiff's counsel.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Opp'n. Quite simply, the District's math doesn't add up. Thus, the court only addresses the District's principal argument regarding the 50% rates and ignores its proposed calculation, which finds no support in the record evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    The court did not address the billing practices of Moran &amp; Associates with respect to\n    <em>\n     law clerks\n    </em>\n    , or the skill, experience, or reputation of Golinker in its previous decision.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lee\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524153\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/4/\">\n     298 F.Supp.3d at 11-13\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20400754\">\n     2018 WL 400754\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5-6.
