(Docket No. 7.) For the reasons set forth below, the United States' motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 16, 2016, plaintiff Alexander Calder\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez (\"Calder\u00f3n\") commenced a civil action against the United States pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"), 28 U.S.C. sections 1346(b) and 2761\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 1.) The claims set forth in the complaint stem from Calder\u00f3n's 2012 arrest by Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") agents. The Court takes the following facts as true, as pled in Calder\u00f3n's complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Beginning in 2008, Calder\u00f3n worked as a refrigeration technician in the aviation division for the Port Authority of Puerto Rico (\"Port Authority\"). (Docket No. 1 at p. 4.) During this time, the DEA conducted an investigation regarding the transportation of illegal drugs into the United States by Port Authority employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   DEA agents learned that a man known as \"Calderon el de los puertos\" participated in illegal activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 6. The physical description for \"Calderon el de los puertos\" differed from Calder\u00f3n's physical description.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 31, 2012, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico indicted twenty-five individuals for drug trafficking-related offenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4. The indictment charged \"Alexander Calder\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez, a/k/a El De Puertos,\" with two counts of conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute a controlled substance in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. section 1962, (counts one and two), and two counts of possessing with the\n   intent to distribute five kilograms or more of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. section 841(a)(1) and (2) (counts four and ten).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Case No. 12-434 (CCC), Docket No. 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On that same day, the magistrate judge signed a warrant for Calder\u00f3n's arrest. (Case No. 13-434, Docket No. 5 at p. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Federal law enforcement officers arrested Calder\u00f3n on June 6, 2016. (Docket No. 1 at p. 5.) After his initial appearance before the magistrate judge, Calder\u00f3n remained detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center (\"MDC\") in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico for five days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On June 11, 2012, Calder\u00f3n entered a plea of not guilty at his arraignment, and the magistrate judge set bail at $50,000 ($40,000 secured and $10,000 unsecured). (Case No. 12-434, Docket No. 79.) Calder\u00f3n's parents pledged their property to secure his release.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The magistrate judge authorized Calder\u00f3n's release on June 13, 2012, subject to home confinement and electric monitoring. (Case No. 12-434, Docket No. 95.) Before his release, Calder\u00f3n spent a total of seven days at MDC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the indictment, federal agents interviewed Calder\u00f3n's co-defendants. (Docket No. 1 at p. 7.) Several co-defendants informed federal agents that the agents had confused Calder\u00f3n with another individual, because Calder\u00f3n had not participated in the offenses alleged in the indictment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Calder\u00f3n alleges that despite these exculpatory disclosures, the United States proposed a plea agreement in which the parties would recommend to the Court a sentence of ten years' imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 8. Calder\u00f3n rejected the plea offer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Calder\u00f3n nearly went to trial on five separate occasions, the first four of which the court vacated. The Court scheduled the fifth and final trial date for February 3, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Case No. 12-434, Docket Nos. 381, 581, 645 and 679.) Five days before trial, the United States moved to dismiss the indictment against Calder\u00f3n without prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(a), and in the interests of justice. (Case No. 12-434, Docket No. 747.) The court granted the United States' motion to dismiss on March 25, 2014, entering judgment of dismissal the same day. (Case No. 12-434, Docket No. 848.) The prosecution against Calder\u00f3n spanned a total of 20 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Calder\u00f3n filed an administrative claim with the DEA on February 19, 2015, eleven months after the entry of the judgment of dismissal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket No. 9, Ex. 1.) In his administrative claim, Calder\u00f3n maintains that his \"constitutional rights were violated\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   because he \"was unlawfully arrested and charged.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Calder\u00f3n states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The negligent and wrongful acts of the federal agents have caused me very serious mental and emotional damages. My reputation has been adversely affected, I was fired from my job; I lost my marriage; I suffered of [sic] depression; I require psychological treatment; I have trouble sleeping; I was unjustly incarcerated;\n   <em>\n    etc\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Subsequently, Calder\u00f3n commenced this action with the filing of a complaint on January 12, 2016. (Docket No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Calder\u00f3n grounds his complaint on the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the FTCA, and the Puerto Rico General Torts Statute, Articles 1802 and 1803 of the Civil Code. Laws of P.R. Ann. tit. 31 \u00a7\u00a7 5141, 5142.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 1. He concludes the complaint by asserting two counts: a malicious prosecution claim pursuant to Puerto Rico law (count one), and a negligence claim pursuant to the FTCA (count two).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 17. Calder\u00f3n alludes to a myriad of additional claims, however, including: (1) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (2) negligent selection, supervision and retention of agents, employees, and informants, (3) conspiracy to deprive him of his civil rights, and (4) loss of consortium.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The United States moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that Calder\u00f3n's claims are time-barred, and that the constitutional tort claims fall beyond the scope of the FTCA. (Docket No. 8.) The Court agrees that all claims, except the malicious prosecution claim, must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6) Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Rule 12(b)(1) allows a court to dismiss a complaint when the Court's subject-matter jurisdiction is not properly alleged. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). The standard applied to a Rule 12(b)(1) motion is similar to that of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion because the Court accepts the complaint's well-pled facts as true and views them, and the inferences drawn from them, in a light most favorable to the pleader.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Viqueira v.

According to Calder\u00f3n, DEA agents presented \"maliciously and negligently obtained statements\" to the grand jury because the physical description of \"Calder\u00f3n el de los puertos\" differed from Calder\u00f3n's physical description. (Docket No. 1 at p. 6.) Calder\u00f3n also avers that his former co-defendants informed federal agents that Calder\u00f3n \"did not participate in the conspiracy charged and that he was being confused with somebody else.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 7.

Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Braunstein\n   </em>\n   , Calderon's malicious prosecution claim is timely because he filed the administrative claim on February 19, 2015, less than two years after the court's entry of the judgment of dismissal of the criminal action against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court reiterates that the federal prosecutors associated with the now dismissed criminal action in Case No. 12-434 are exempt from liability for the malicious prosecution cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part II(B)(2);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bernard v.
