Brooke Jackson, United States District Judge\n   This matter is before the Court on five pending motions. For the reasons discussed in this order, the Court (1) denies plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and sanctions; (2) denies the Knights of Columbus' motion for a protective order; (3) grants the Knights of Columbus' partial motion to dismiss; (4) grants in part and denies in part plaintiffs' and other counterclaim defendants' motion to dismiss the Knights of Columbus' counterclaims; and (5) denies the Knights of Columbus' motion to dismiss for lack of standing, or alternatively, for partial summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I provided a detailed overview of the facts in an order dated July 28, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The facts remain the same subject to a few developments since that order was issued. Plaintiff List Interactive, Ltd., frequently referred to by its d/b/a UKnight Interactive or just UKnight, is a small company that designs web systems. Plaintiff Leonard Labriola is the manager of UKnight. I will refer to the plaintiffs collectively as \"UKnight.\" UKnight alleges that in September 2011 defendant Knights of Columbus promised to announce to the broader Knights of Columbus fraternity of lodges and agents (\"the Order\") an agreement whereby UKnight would be the designated vendor for the Order's life insurance business. The promised announcement never occurred, and litigation followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   UKnight's core claims, as I see them, are that the Knights of Columbus breached an oral contract when it reneged on its agreement to make UKnight its designated vendor, and that the Knights of Columbus stole trade secrets from UKnight before doing so. UKnight has also asserted two other creative claims that are the subject of one of the pending motions. For its part, the Knights of Columbus has struck back with an assortment of counterclaims, which this order also addresses. I will explain each of the pending motions as I get to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To survive a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the complaint must contain \"enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ridge at Red Hawk, L.L.C. v.

[ECF No. 76].\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff UKnight filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to enjoin the Knights of Columbus from engaging in behavior during discovery that UKnight described as \"witness intimidation.\" ECF No. 76 at 1. The Court heard argument regarding this discovery issue on September 25, 2017, and I issued an Order that same day addressing and effectively granting the requested injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 79. Now five months have passed and no further discovery issues of the sort have arisen. Thus, the Court sees no live issue remaining in this motion, and tellingly UKnight did not argue that this motion is still ripe at the hearing before this Court on February 6, 2018 when asked. Therefore, ECF No. 76 is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Knights of Columbus' Motion for Protective Order\n    </em>\n    .

To the extent the motion seeks protection against any discovery concerning membership information, it is DENIED for reasons discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   in connection with defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of standing, etc. ECF No. 107.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Knights of Columbus' Partial Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n    . [ECF No. 100].\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Knights of Columbus filed a motion to dismiss the First and Second Claims in UKnight's Second Amended Complaint. ECF No. 100. UKnight's First Claim alleges that the Knights of Columbus violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\") and that it continues to violate RICO through an alleged insurance fraud enterprise. ECF No. 98 at 28. UKnight's Second Claim seeks a court order requiring David J. Kautter, the Acting Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, to invalidate the Knights of Columbus' tax-exempt status due to the alleged insurance fraud activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46. For the following reasons, I GRANT the Knights of Columbus' motion to dismiss both claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     UKnight's RICO Claim\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   RICO vests a private citizen with substantive rights to avoid injuries to his business or property caused by a pattern of racketeering activity.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201964\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

With the Knights of Columbus at the helm, the alleged objective of this enterprise is to perpetuate the Knights of Columbus' insurance fraud scheme by allowing the Knights of Columbus to (1) inflate its reported membership numbers without detection, and (2) use these inflated membership numbers to bolster the Knights of Columbus' insurance business reputation to make more money.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276537\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/865/#p882\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to UKnight, this played out in the following ways. First, the Knights of Columbus provided AM Best with false membership numbers and demographic data so that AM Best would, in turn (and unknowingly), generate fraudulent insurance ratings for the Knights of Columbus' insurance products. This bolstered the Knights of Columbus' insurance business reputation and allowed it to attract business under false pretenses, including business relationships like the one between UKnight and the Knights of Columbus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After this scheme was up and running, the Knights of Columbus then used its relationship with IDI, a software company, to ensure its fraudulent scheme went undetected.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. This allegation requires some additional background. According to UKnight, from 2011 until approximately 2013 the Knights of Columbus were gung-ho about working with UKnight to develop a new web platform for the Order's insurance business. ECF No. 54 at 6. All was well until sometime in 2013, when the Knights of Columbus \"realized that broad deployment of the UKnight system would necessarily reveal their fraudulent inflation of membership numbers.\" ECF No. 98 at 40. Wishing to have its cake (the functionality of the UKnight web platform) and eat it too (not have information regarding its fraudulent inflation of membership numbers fall into the wrong hands), the Knights of Columbus allegedly hatched a plan whereby it dispatched the software company IDI to surreptitiously acquire knowledge about UKnight's web platform so that the Knights of Columbus could replicate the UKnight system in-house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based upon these alleged events and the involvement of IDI and AM Best in them, UKnight alleges that the Knights of Columbus\n   therefore \"conduct[ed] the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering\" in violation of RICO.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c-d). Because UKnight's failure to sufficiently plead the third and fourth elements of its RICO claim (a \"pattern of racketeering activity\") is dispositive, I assume without deciding that UKnight has satisfied the first two elements of the RICO cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A \"pattern of racketeering activity\" requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity.\n   <em>\n    Sedima, S.P.R.L. v.

Here, UKnight has pled that the Insurance Fraud Enterprise had a shared purpose \"to artificially inflate the membership ranks and artificially skew the demographic structure of the Knights of Columbus risk-pool, and to wrongfully bring under the control of Defendant the tools developed by UKnight to prevent this system from revealing their fraud and to enhance their ability to effectively continue this fraud.\" ECF No. 98 at 44. UKnight further argues that the predicates have the same participants and victims and that they all serve to \"protect the financial position of and enrich[ ] the [Knights of Columbus].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   I find that even in viewing the record in the light most favorable to UKnight, the alleged relationship between the acts is attenuated, and the predicate acts seem to be \"isolated events\" rather than calculated parts of a racketeering scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1871155\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/972/1545/#p1555\">\n    972 F.2d at 1555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The participants, victims, and methods of commission used by IDI to allegedly steal UKnight's trade secrets are quite different than those allegedly used by the Knights of Columbus to mislead AM Best.

However, courts vary in their views as to the necessary level of participation.\n   <em>\n    At a minimum, personal liability attaches to a defendant who was directly involved in the conduct through conception or authorization\n   </em>\n   . Other direct involvement, such as active participation or cooperation, specific direction, or sanction of the conduct, also may be sufficient. Whether defendant approved of, directed, actively participated in, or cooperated in the negligent conduct is a question of fact for the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Hoang,\n   </em>\n   at 868 (emphasis added). At this stage in the pleading, I find that the Knights of Columbus has sufficiently pled the liability of each named individual counterclaim-defendant. In its counterclaim, the Knights of Columbus allege that each counterclaim-defendant, including the individuals named above, was directly involved in the wrongful conduct that forms the basis of these trademark counterclaims because they created the UKnight webpages and thus authorized the illicit use of the trademarks.

This argument fails because even if UKnight's use of the Knights of Columbus' trademarks was sanctioned by the Knights of Columbus at the beginning of the entities' working relationship, UKnight was put on notice that the continuing use of these trademarks was no longer sanctioned by the Knights of Columbus at the time this lawsuit was filed and certainly at the time the trademark-related counterclaims were filed.

Here, UKnight is allegedly\n   <em>\n    still using\n   </em>\n   the trademarks, and therefore the alleged injury to the Knights of Columbus is still occurring. As such, the Knights of Columbus has not \"inexcusably delayed\" the filing the action. Further, UKnight can point to no \"prejudice\" that has befallen it due to the Knights of Columbus' alleged delay in instituting this action since the bringing of the claim has not deterred UKnight's use of the Mark. As such, the laches argument also fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The foregoing discussion of the trademark claims in general resolves UKnight's motion to dismiss counterclaims 1, 3, 4, and 5 because UKnight makes no other argument as to why these claims should be dismissed.

The first of these is the veil-piercing argument which I addressed\n   above. Second, UKnight asserts this counterclaim must be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ.

Though these allegations were not pled explicitly within the Knights of Columbus' \"False Designation of Origin\" counterclaim on pages 48-49, they were pled at the beginning of the overarching counterclaims section, and the \"False Designation of Origin\" claim indicates that \"[t]he Order incorporates all allegations of this counterclaim as if fully set forth within.\" ECF No. 101 at 48.

My finding is based not only on the weight of precedent on the subject, but also on the spirit and legislative history of the federal wiretap statute. \"Congress' overriding concern was the protection of privacy\" in enacting the federal wiretap statute.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In the 1968 Senate Report that accompanied the Wiretap Act, Congress expressly \"envision[ed] that States would be free to adopt more restrictive legislation, or no legislation at all, but not less restrictive legislation.\"\n   <em>\n    Leong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201463313\">\n    2012 WL 1463313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (quoting S.

Likewise, the 1986 Senate Report that accompanied the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (which amended the Wiretap Act) noted that \"the states must enact statutes which are\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   as restrictive as the provisions\" of federal law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201463313\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting S.

As such, I find that Connecticut's recording law is not preempted by the federal Wiretap Act. Additionally, I find that under the terms of the Connecticut statute, the Knights of Columbus has sufficiently pled UKnight's liability at the motion to dismiss stage.

This claim fails. In order to establish a claim of civil conspiracy, Colorado law requires \"(1) action of two or more persons; (2) common object to be accomplished; (3) meeting of the minds on the object or course of action; (4) one or more unlawful acts; and (5) damages as a proximate result thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Kerstien v.

I find that the Knights of Columbus' claim fails on the third requirement because it failed to plead plausible facts showing that the counterclaim-defendants had a \"meeting of the minds\" to achieve a common and unlawful object in creating List Interactive (and therefore the UKnight product).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Both UKnight and the Knights of Columbus concede that the UKnight platform was developed in large part based on the Knights of Columbus' express specifications. Oftentimes the parties worked together (by phone or in person) to develop the UKnight platform. Indeed, the essential issue in this case is the underlying contract dispute where UKnight alleges that it finalized the UKnight product for\n   the Knights of Columbus\n   <em>\n    in accordance with the Knights of Columbus' specifications\n   </em>\n   and was merely waiting for the Knights of Columbus to announce to its councils that UKnight was the designated vendor for the Order. There is simply nothing that indicates that the counterclaim-defendants created UKnight for the illicit purpose of committing unlawful acts of trademark misuse. Therefore, the Knights of Columbus fails to sufficiently plead a case of civil conspiracy. For this reason, I GRANT counterclaim defendants' motion to dismiss the Sixth Counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     The Knights of Columbus' Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Standing or, in the alternative, Motion for Partial Summary Judgment-Both with regard to Allegations Related to Membership Status\n    </em>\n    .

According to the Knights of Columbus, \"membership information\" includes everything from the names of Order members to data showing the number of members in each local council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Between the two motions the Knights of Columbus assert three arguments as to why this Court should bar discovery regarding membership information: (1) this information is irrelevant; (2) UKnight \"has no standing to complain about\" the Knights of Columbus' membership practices; and (3) the First Amendment protects the Knights of Columbus from such an inquiry into their membership practices. I disagree with all three arguments so long as plaintiffs' discovery is reasonably focused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Relevance of Membership Information to Claims at Issue\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   UKnight has spent a significant amount of time and money investigating what it believes to be a large-scale insurance fraud operation perpetuated by the Knights of Columbus. Specifically, as I have noted before, UKnight believes that the Knights of Columbus artificially inflates the number of members in the Order so that it can bolster its billion-dollar insurance business. As it relates to this suit, UKnight theorizes that the Knights of Columbus was eager to contract with UKnight\n   <em>\n    until\n   </em>\n   the Knights of Columbus realized that the UKnight web platform would expose its fraudulent scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   UKnight argues that it seeks discovery of the Knights of Columbus' membership information because of the information's probative value as it relates to UKnight's breach of contract claim against the Knights of Columbus. UKnight believes that if it can discover the actual number of members per council and compare those numbers to the Knights of Columbus' claimed membership figures, it can corroborate its theory of the Knights of Columbus' motive to breach the contract. The Knights of Columbus argues that the membership information is irrelevant to the breach of contract or other business tort claims that are the heart of this case and fervently pleads for this Court to deny any discovery on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   After reading the parties' briefs and entertaining this issue at oral argument on February 6, 2018, I am persuaded by UKnight's argument that at least a narrow subset (as defined below) of membership information is relevant to UKnight's breach of contract and business tort claims. The Knights of Columbus denies the existence of a contract, denies that it breached any contract, and denies that it misappropriated information from which it\n   would have benefitted had it gone forward with a relationship with UKnight. I find that evidence of a motive to repudiate the alleged contract is probative of the credibility of the Knights' position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   At the February 2018 motions hearing, UKnight specified the parameters of the membership-related discovery it presently seeks. I find that the discovery, as narrowed, is reasonable, and I authorize the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   a. UKnight is entitled to the July 1, 2017 \"Council Statement-Summary and Payment Coupon\" that was issued to each council. Put differently, UKnight is entitled to one July 1, 2017 Coupon\n   <em>\n    per council\n   </em>\n   . This coupon shows the number of members that the Knights of Columbus asserts is in each specific council and thus the number of members for which each council is charged. An example of such a Coupon was provided to the Court at the February 6, 2018 motions hearing as Exhibit 5.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   b. UKnight is also entitled to obtain from each local membership secretary the number of membership cards that the membership secretary has issued. These membership cards are apparently indicative of how many members are indeed active in each council because the cards are only issued if a member pays his dues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   I am not today authorizing discovery of other membership information, especially information regarding specific members' names or other personal identifiers. The Court cautions each side not to try to find loopholes or parse these words in an attempt to expand or narrow the clear dictates of this discovery order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Knights of Columbus' Other Arguments Against Discovery of Membership Information\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   I will quickly note why I am not persuaded by the Knights of Columbus' other arguments to prevent discovery of membership information, namely lack of standing and the First Amendment's protections. First, the Knights of Columbus argue that UKnight does not have standing to \"complain about the Knights of Columbus' membership retention practices.\" ECF No. 107 at 2. I agree but find that, as noted above, UKnight seeks discovery of the membership information to bolster its breach of contract claim, over which UKnight does indeed have standing. Therefore, the standing argument is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Knights of Columbus argues that allowing this discovery would violate several First Amendment protections. Specifically it argues that this Court cannot \"decide whether the Order wrongfully retained certain members without violating the right of association, the right of a religious society, and the Establishment Clause.\" ECF No. 107 at 2. I first note that by allowing limited discovery regarding membership information, the Court is not \"decid[ing]\" anything with regard to whether the Knights of Columbus \"wrongfully retained members.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Fed.%20Appx.%20868\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, as it relates to the right of association, my limitations on\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   is discoverable ensures that nothing is done to \"curtail[ ] the freedom to associate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NAACP v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163673\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/357/449/#p460\">\n    357 U.S. 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 460-61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163673\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/357/449/#p460\">\n    78 S.Ct. 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163673\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/357/449/#p460\">\n    2 L.Ed.2d 1488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1958) (holding that compelled disclosure of membership lists, including the names and addresses of members, would have the effect of suppressing legal association among the group's members.). As noted above, my order expressly disallows the discovery of any membership information that involves personal identifiers and instead only permits the discovery of two datasets involving membership totals rather than specific member details. The scope of this membership-related discovery is well outside of the First Amendment\n   association interests contemplated in\n   <em>\n    NAACP v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   and its progeny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Knights of Columbus also asserts that this Court cannot make a determination concerning the Order's membership practices without violating the Order's freedom as a religious society. ECF No. 111 at 5. To allow any investigation into the Order's membership practices, the Knights of Columbus argues, would impermissibly infringe on \"the Order's decision to retain members in accordance with\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   procedures and\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   values.\" ECF No. 113 at 4. That is not the case. By allowing the discovery described above, this Court is not assessing or making a determination about the Knights of Columbus' religious doctrine, nor is it substituting its judgment for the Knights of Columbus as a religious society.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kedroff v. St. Nicholas Cathedral\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298982\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/344/94/#p116\">\n    344 U.S. 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 116,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298982\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/344/94/#p116\">\n    73 S.Ct. 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20L.%20Ed.%20120\">\n    97 L.Ed. 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1952) (noting that established rights of religious societies exist to protect the \"power [of religious organizations] to decide for themselves ... matters of church government as well as those of faith and doctrine\"). Indeed, the membership data about which I am allowing discovery is already published (albeit allegedly inaccurately) by the Knights of Columbus on its website and in connection with marketing material for its insurance business. As such, I find that the religious freedom doctrine is inapplicable in this circumstance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Finally, the Knights of Columbus argues that this Court's permitting discovery of membership information would violate the Establishment Clause. I disagree. The discovery authorized by this order allows UKnight to ascertain\n   <em>\n    how many members are in the Order\n   </em>\n   . As previously noted, this membership number is already published widely by the Knights of Columbus itself, and UKnight's discovery will presumably show whether that headcount is accurate. The scope of this discovery nowhere near constitutes \"excessive entanglement\" of this Court and religion as prohibited by the Establishment Clause. As such, these First Amendment arguments all fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In sum, I find no merit in the hodge-podge of arguments the Knights of Columbus have put forth in what appears to be an almost desperate attempt to preclude any discovery concerning membership information. For the reasons articulated in two orders I disagree with plaintiffs' effort to turn alleged membership shenanigans into a RICO case, but I do not agree that membership information is irrelevant to plaintiffs' contract and misappropriation of trade secret claims. Unfortunately, the parties seem unable or unwilling to work cooperatively to fashion a reasonable scope of discovery in this area. The Court will, for now, allow only the limited discovery described above and will expect the defendants' full compliance with this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, I therefore:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   a.

In its amended complaint, UKnight asserts a new RICO claim and defines the \"enterprise\" in two ways. First, it again defines the \"enterprise\" as being comprised of the various subparts of the Order. ECF No. 98 at 27. Though UKnight attempts to show the distinct functions and the purported \"legal separateness\" of the Order's subparts from the Knights of Columbus-\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , the Knights of Columbus are the sole issuer of insurance policies while the local councils are mainly volunteer/fundraising entities-this formulation still fails under the dictates of my previous order and the cases cited therein.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 54 at 31 (noting that despite the Knights of Columbus' attempt to distinguish the subparts of the organization, the \"constituent parts of the fraternity-including thousands of local councils, assemblies, field agents, and general agents-merely carry out the Knights of Columbus' business of selling insurance.\").
