INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs Tonya Collier, Donald Lee Alexander, Ginger Lowrey, R.L.P., Brian Burroughs, and Marlo Saunders allege that Alabama Department of Human Resources (\"DHR\") officials deprived them of procedural due process in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and committed several state law torts. Plaintiffs' claims arise out of DHR placing their names on a Central Registry that catalogues the outcome of\n   child abuse allegations, disclosing information from the Central Registry to third parties, and failing to provide Plaintiffs with due process hearings to challenge the information on the Central Registry. Before the court is Defendants' motion to dismiss (Doc. # 31), which is due to be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. INDEX\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This Memorandum Opinion is necessarily lengthy for three reasons: less than stellar pleading, less than stellar briefing by all parties on the motion to dismiss, and unduly complicated applicable law. The last reason is likely a partial cause of the first two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The claims of the six Plaintiffs share some legal and factual issues and concern some of the same Defendants. However, not all Plaintiffs assert claims that arise out of the same transactions and occurrences, and, in many instances, not all Plaintiffs' claims are subject to the same legal standards. Not all of the seven Defendants are implicated in every claim of every Plaintiff. Some defenses apply to multiple counts in the amended complaint; some counts in the amended complaint are the target of multiple defenses; and some defenses are pertinent to only some Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To avoid the impossible exponential burden of considering each defense in the context of each relevant claim by each relevant Plaintiff against each relevant Defendant, the court limited its analysis by first determining which claims survive the most broadly applicable defenses, then considering more narrowly applicable defenses only with respect to claims that survived the broader analysis. Further, the court considered only defenses to claims that had not already been eliminated at an earlier point in the analysis. As a result, many of Defendants' numerous defenses are not discussed in this Memorandum Opinion because they pertain to claims that are due to be dismissed on other grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To aid the reader, the following index is provided:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.

Because of the nature of Plaintiff Collier's employment at the time DHR assigned an \"indicated\" disposition to her case, she is the only Plaintiff who, under existing Alabama law and DHR rules and regulations,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   was entitled to a CA/N investigative administrative hearing to challenge the \"indicated\" disposition before DHR disclosed the \"indicated\" disposition to her employers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   By letter dated April 17, 2012, DHR notified Plaintiff Collier that a report of child abuse had been lodged against her and that, upon investigation, DHR had concluded that the facts indicated child abuse had occurred. (Doc. # 28 \u00b6 1, 21.) Defendants Corrine Matt and Leslie Henderson were the Shelby County DHR workers who made the \"indicated\" determination. (Doc. # 28 \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   On April 24, 2012, in response to DHR's letter, Plaintiff Collier notified Defendants\n   Matt and Henderson of her status as a school teacher and requested a hearing to review the \"indicated\" disposition. (Doc. # 28 \u00b6 2; Doc. # 33-1 at 10.) Plaintiff Collier's hearing request was ignored or denied. (Doc. # 28 \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.) On November 29, 2012, DHR notified Plaintiff Collier that an administrative record review had resulted in an affirmance of the \"indicated\" disposition and that the \"indicated\" status would be placed on the Central Registry. (Doc. # 33-1 at 10; Doc. # 31-4 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \"At the time the 'indicated' disposition was made by Defendants Matt and Henderson,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , sometime in 2012, Plaintiff Collier was terminated from her teaching position after the \"indicated\" disposition was disclosed to her employer. (Doc. # 28 \u00b6 3.) Plaintiff Collier subsequently obtained employment at a day care center, but, in October 2014, she was terminated from that position after DHR notified the day care of the \"indicated\" disposition and warned that the day care's license to operate was in jeopardy because of it. (Doc. # 28 \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Thereafter, Plaintiff Collier retained an attorney, who secured her an administrative hearing approximately one month after she filed this action. (Doc. # 33-1 (May 12, 2015 letter from the Administrative Hearings Office notifying Plaintiff Collier that she would be given a hearing).)

(Doc. # 28 at \u00b6 31.) He submitted his request for a hearing to Defendant Haag, who did not forward the request to DHR's Office of Administrative Hearings. (Doc. # 28 \u00b6 18.)

However, Defendants Haag, Walter, and Dollar are not accused of wrongdoing with respect to any Plaintiffs other than Plaintiffs Alexander and Lowrey. Specifically, Plaintiff Alexander asserts claims against Defendant Haag for failing to notify him of his right to a hearing and failing to forward his hearing request to DHR's Office of Administrative Hearings, and Plaintiff Lowrey asserts claims against Defendants Walter and Dollar for failing to notify her of her right to a hearing and failing to transmit her hearing request to DHR's Office of Administrative Hearings. (Doc. # 28 at \u00b6\u00b6 30-32, 43-48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   As the amended complaint makes clear, Plaintiffs Alexander and Lowrey are already aware of their due process rights. Further, DHR is already aware of the demands of Plaintiffs Alexander and Lowrey for due process hearings to challenge their \"indicated\" statuses. Defendants Haag, Walter, and Dollar are not alleged\n   to have supervisory or policymaking authority that would make them amenable to an order for prospective relief requiring DHR to provide hearings or amend its policies and procedures to comply with due process requirements for \"indicated\" dispositions of non-educators like Plaintiffs Alexander and Lowrey. Therefore, the amended complaint contains no facts that would support a request for prospective relief against Defendants Haag, Walter, and Dollar because there is no reason to conclude that Plaintiffs Alexander and Lowrey personally would obtain meaningful relief from an order requiring those Defendants to notify them of their due process rights or forward the hearing requests to the Office of Administrative Hearings. Put another way, the amended complaint contains no facts from which it could reasonably be inferred that Plaintiffs Alexander and Lowrey are at risk of any\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   injury from the past conduct of Defendants Haag, Walter, or Dollar. Accordingly, the claims of Plaintiffs Alexander and Lowrey against Defendants Haag, Walter, and Dollar for prospective relief from their indicated statuses are due to be dismissed for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Further, because all claims for prospective relief against Defendants Haag, Walter, and Dollar are subject to dismissal for lack of standing, and because (as explained in Section IV.B.2.i.) all claims for monetary relief against Defendants Haag, Walter, and Dollar are also due to be dismissed for lack of standing, all claims against Defendants Haag, Walter, and Dollar, are subject to dismissal, and those Defendants are due to be dismissed from this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <em>\n    iii.

At this point in the analysis, a few observations are necessary to explain the narrowing of the court's consideration of that argument solely to the claims of Plaintiffs Alexander and R.L.P. against Defendants Buckner and Mashego for prospective relief from \"indicated\" statuses. First, as explained Section IV.B.2.iv., all claims for prospective relief against Defendants Haag, Walter, and Dollar are due to be dismissed for lack of standing. Second, Defendants Matt and Henderson are alleged to have engaged in conduct that only affected Plaintiff Collier, and, as explained in Section IV.B.1., Plaintiff Collier's claims for prospective relief against all Defendants are moot. Third, as will be explained in Section IV.C., Plaintiff Lowrey's claims against Defendant Buckner for prospective relief are due to be dismissed on grounds of res judicata.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fourth, Plaintiff Lowrey, who is a Jefferson County resident and was subject to a Jefferson County DHR investigation, has alleged no facts from which it could reasonably be inferred that she has any claim for prospective relief against Defendant Mashego in her official capacity as the Director of the\n   <em>\n    Shelby\n   </em>\n   County DHR. (Doc. # 28 at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 15.) Thus, Plaintiff Lowrey's claims for prospective relief against Defendant Mashego are due to be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Therefore, of the claims for prospective relief from \"indicated\" dispositions, only the claims of Plaintiffs Alexander and R.L.P. against Defendants Buckner and Mashego warrant further discussion. Unlike Defendants Matt, Henderson, Haag, Walter, and Dollar, Defendant Buckner (in her official capacity as Commissioner of Alabama DHR) and Defendant Mashego (in her official capacity as the Director of Shelby County DHR)\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   alleged to have policymaking authority regarding the handling of challenges to \"indicated\" dispositions of non-educators, including Plaintiffs Alexander and R.L.P. Further, Defendants Buckner and Mashego are alleged to be the DHR authorities whose official acts and omissions prevented, and continue to prevent, Plaintiffs Alexander and R.L.P. from challenging their \"indicated\" dispositions in accordance with constitutional due process requirements. Finally, any prospective relief against Alabama and Shelby County DHR would be appropriately entered against Defendants Buckner and Mashego in their respective official capacities as Directors of Alabama DHR and Shelby County DHR.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kentucky v.

Plaintiffs Alexander and R.L.P. contend that, as a result of actions taken under color of state law and tortious conduct by Defendants Buckner and Mashego in their official capacities, they have been and continue to be deprived of an adequate due process hearing to challenge those \"indicated\" dispositions. Aside from the administrative record review process, there are no procedures under Alabama law by which a non-educator like Plaintiffs Alexander and R.L.P. could challenge the validity of an \"indicated\" disposition.

However, Plaintiff Collier does not seek to hold Defendants liable for their conduct in investigating child abuse allegations or in initially determining that child abuse was \"indicated.\" Rather, Plaintiff Collier's \u00a7 1983 claims for monetary relief are based on her claims that Defendants, by various actions and omissions,\n   <em>\n    prevented her from obtaining her constitutional right to a hearing\n   </em>\n   to contest the \"indicated\" disposition\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   DHR workers investigated and assigned the initial \"indicated\" disposition.

In accordance with Section IV.B.2.i., all claims for monetary damages except Plaintiff Collier's are due to be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Therefore, the court will limit its consideration of Count V to whether Plaintiff Collier has stated a claim upon which relief could be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   Because Plaintiff Collier was aware of her right to a hearing and requested one despite DHR's lack of notice of her right to do so, it cannot reasonably be inferred from the amended complaint that she was injured because DHR failed to notify her of her right to a hearing or of her right to request one. Further, Plaintiff Collier has also failed to allege any facts from which it can be inferred that she was injured by any Defendant's failure to automatically, and before receiving a request for a hearing, inform the Office of Administrative Hearings that an \"indicated\" disposition was made at the county level.

However, there are no allegations that any of the named Defendants personally listed Plaintiff Collier's \"indicated\" status on the statewide Central Registry, and there are no supervisory or vicarious liability theories asserted in Count V against any Defendants, including Defendants Buckner or Mashego.

At the administrative hearing, DHR's evidence primarily consisted of some notes that Defendant Matt made about the notes of the investigating social worker, Lori Baxley. Ms. Baxley's notes had been destroyed prior to the hearing. Ms. Baxley was terminated during the pendency of the Collier investigation for mishandling her cases, and she did not testify at the hearing. Defendant Matt was not assigned to the Collier case until three weeks after the children had been removed from Plaintiff Collier's custody. Thus, DHR's evidence of the events leading up to the custody removal consisted of Defendant Matt's secondhand notes about Ms. Baxley's destroyed notes, which Ms. Baxley's supervisor testified were \"not consistent\" with other documents in the record.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-302\">\n    Contrary to Defendant Matt's recorded observations of Ms. Baxley's notes, Plaintiff Collier's signature was on the safety plan. Further, other than Defendant Matt's recorded observations of Ms. Baxley's \"inconsistent\" notes, all documents in the DHR record and all other evidence demonstrated that, as soon as Plaintiff Collier discovered that her husband had a history of child abuse, she required him to move out of the house and did not allow him to be in the presence of the children again, and she complied with all instructions from DHR. According to the evidence presented at the administrative hearing, the only time the children were in the husband's vicinity after Plaintiff Collier learned of her husband's history of child abuse was when Plaintiff Collier was summoned to bring the children from church to her home, where police were present while the husband was removing his belongings, so that DHR could take custody of the children.
