Russell, III, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendant Flagstar Bank, FSB's (\"Flagstar\") Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 11). This case arises out of Plaintiffs Bruce and Anne Barr's (the \"Barrs\") attempts to modify their mortgage loan, which is serviced by Flagstar. The Motion is ripe for disposition, and no hearing is necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 105.6 (D.Md. 2016). For the reasons outlined below, the Court will grant the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Loan and Foreclosure Action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Barrs are the owners of a property located at 416 Chesapeake Avenue, Stevensville, Maryland (the \"Property\"), which they purchased in March 2005. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 29, ECF No. 8). On June 26, 2007, the Barrs refinanced the mortgage (the \"Loan\") on the Property with Residential Mortgage Solutions, Inc. for $413,000.00, at which time Flagstar became the loan's servicer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Barrs fell behind on their mortgage during the economic down turn of 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-33). In April 2009, in an attempt to keep the Property, Mr. Barr filed for bankruptcy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34). A few months later, in June 2009, Flagstar sent the Barrs a letter demanding they vacate the Property by July 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35). The Barrs vacated the Property, moving to Texas to live with family. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Barrs ultimately returned\n   to Maryland in November 2009, although they lived with relatives and not at the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In March 2010, the Barrs received a letter from Flagstar regarding a possible modification for the Loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37). On the advice of a Flagstar representative, the Barrs moved back into the Property in March 2010 and made it their primary residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38). The Barrs then submitted a loan modification application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Nevertheless, in May 2010, the Barrs received a letter from Flagstar notifying them of a scheduled foreclosure sale on the Property on June 15, 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40). The Barrs then learned that Flagstar had denied their requested loan modification because the Property was not the Barrs' primary residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Property was sold, but, in July 2010, the Circuit Court for Queen Anne's County, Maryland vacated the sale. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41). The Circuit Court further ruled that the Barrs should be eligible for a Home Affordable Modification Program (\"HAMP\") loan modification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In October 2010, the Barrs submitted to Flagstar the HAMP loan modification paperwork. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Flagstar denied the Barrs' loan modification in December 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42). The Barrs again went to the Circuit Court, and the court ordered the Barrs and Flagstar to \"resolve the loan modification issue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Trial Period Plans and Loan Modification Agreements\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In order to keep the Property, the Barrs entered into three Trial Period Plan (\"TPP\") agreements with Flagstar, with the first TPP agreement beginning in August 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 47, 56). The terms of the TPP agreements stipulated that the Barrs' loan would be permanently modified if the Barrs made three required monthly payments and complied with all other conditions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 47, 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On or about March 26, 2015, the Barrs entered into their third TPP agreement (the \"Third TPP Agreement\") with Flagstar, under which the Barrs were obligated to make three monthly payments of $2,499.74, with the first payment due on May 1, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56). The Barrs made the required payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 13, 2015, Flagstar sent the Barrs \"a package containing two letters and a Loan Modification Agreement\" (the \"Original LMA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59). The first letter stated that the Barrs' \"Modification Payment Amount\" under the Original LMA was $2,508.73 and explained how to accept the offered loan modification (the \"First How to Accept Letter\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60). The second letter explained that the Modification Payment Amount \"included modified principal and interest payment[s] and escrow payments including taxes and insurance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61). The Barrs rejected the Original LMA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 18, 2015, Flagstar sent the Barrs a Revised Loan Modification Agreement (the \"Revised LMA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64). The cover letter accompanying the Revised LMA stated that the Modification Payment Amount was $2,041.43 and explained how to accept the loan modification offer (the \"Second How to Accept Letter\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65). The Second How to Accept Letter instructed the Barrs to return two signed and notarized copies of the Revised LMA along with $2,041.43 to accept the offer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Second How to Accept Letter also stated that the Revised LMA would not be effective until both the Barrs and Flagstar signed it. (Def.'s Mot. Dismiss [\"Def.'s Mot.\"] Ex. E [\"2d How to Accept Letter\"] at FLAG0057, ECF No. 11-6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 28, 2015, the Barrs\n   returned executed copies of the Revised LMA and the required payment. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 67). On October 7, 2015, a Flagstar representative signed the Revised LMA. (Def.'s Mot. Ex. F [\"Executed LMA\"], ECF No. 11-7). Almost a year later, on August 24, 2016, Flagstar returned a fully executed copy of the Revised LMA to the Barrs. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   From September 2015 through January 2016, the Barrs made monthly payments of $2,041.43. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69, 76). During the same period of time, Flagstar sent the Barrs mortgage statements which stated that the required monthly payment was $2,833.45, that the Barrs' payments of $2,041.43 were only partial payments, and that Flagstar had not applied these payments to the Barrs' account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 17, 2015, Flagstar sent the Barrs a corrected modification agreement (the \"Corrected LMA\"), which provided that the modified monthly payments would be $2,501.43. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-72). The Barrs rejected the Corrected LMA, considering the Revised LMA the binding contract between them and Flagstar. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74). On January 19, 2016, Flagstar sent the Barrs a mortgage statement reflecting that $234,009.39 was past due, the interest rate on the loan was 6.875%, the payment due date was August 1, 2009, and added a $118.31 late fee. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 75). The statement also explained that the Barrs previous payments were partial payments, which were unapplied to their balance, and threatened foreclosure. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .). After receiving this mortgage statement, the Barrs tendered $2,041.43 as payment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76). Flagstar refused the payment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Qualified Written Requests\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 15, 2015, the Barrs sent to Flagstar the first of two letters, which they allege are Qualified Written Requests (\"QWRs\") under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\"RESPA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70). The December 15, 2015 letter (the \"December 2015 Letter\") requested a long list of documents related to the Loan's ownership and requested that their account be \"reconciled\" because \"recent mortgage account statements do not accurately reflect payments [the Barrs] continued to remit pursuant to [their] loan modification agreement.\" (Def.'s Mot. Ex. I [\"Dec. 15, 2015 Letter\"], ECF No. 11-10). Flagstar responded to the Barrs' December 2015 Letter on February 2, 2016. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 77; Def.'s Mot. Ex. K [\"1st Resp.\"], ECF No. 11-12). In its response, Flagstar stated that the Barrs' monthly payment amount was $2,682.61, the unpaid principal balance on the Loan was $413,000.00, and the interest rate was 6.875%. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 77; 1st Resp. at FLAG00172). Flagstar also noted that the Barrs were required to return the executed Corrected LMA and closing funds by November 6, 2015. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 77; First Resp. at FLAG00175).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 1, 2016, the Barrs sent Flagstar a second letter and \"Notice of Error,\" this time through counsel (the \"March 2016 Letter\") (collectively, with the December 2015 Letter, the \"Letters\"). (Am. Compl. \u00b6 79; Def.'s Mot. Ex. L [\"Mar. 1, 2016 Letter\"], ECF No. 11-13). The March 2016 Letter stated that there were errors in a January 19, 2016 account statement and requested several documents. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 79; Mar. 1, 2016 Letter). On April 1, 2016, Flagstar responded to the March 2016 Letter with over 200 pages of documents. (Def.'s Mot. Ex. N [\"2d Resp.\"], ECF No. 11-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     The Barrs Sue Flagstar\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On October 26, 2016, the Barrs commenced suit against Flagstar. (ECF No. 1). On January 20, 2017, Flagstar filed its first Motion to Dismiss. (ECF No. 5). In\n   response, on February 23, 2017, the Barrs filed an Amended Complaint, alleging the following counts: Fraud (Count I); violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act (\"MCPA\"), Md. Code Ann., Com. Law [\"CL\"] \u00a7\u00a7 13-301(1), (3), (4) (West 2018) (Count II); violations of the Maryland Mortgage Fraud Protection Act (\"MMFPA\"), Md. Code Ann., Real Prop.

The Barrs seek compensatory damages, statutory damages, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees and costs. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 109, 117, 128, 135, 142, 152, 159). On March 23, 2017, Flagstar filed its Motion to Dismiss. (ECF No. 11). On April 28, 2017, the Barrs filed a Response. (ECF No. 17). Flagstar filed a Reply on May 13, 2017.

All that remains, then, is for the Court to determine whether\n   they were integral to and explicitly relied on in drafting the Amended Complaint. And, for claims that sound in fraud, whether the Barrs had actual notice of a document's contents. The Court considers the documents in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   First, because the Revised LMA is the contract upon which the Barrs base their breach of contract claim and the Barrs detail several of its terms in the Amended Complaint, the Court concludes that it can consider the Revised LMA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake Bay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190851\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/794/602/#p611\">\n    794 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   611 ;\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2995358\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/517/801/#p806\">\n    517 F.Supp.2d at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, the Barrs' common law fraud claim, and MCPA and MMFPA claims, which are also claims that sound in fraud, are based on a statement contained in the Second How to Accept Letter-the Modification Payment Amount. As a result, it is an integral document.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake Bay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190851\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/794/602/#p611\">\n    794 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   611 ;\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2995358\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/517/801/#p806\">\n    517 F.Supp.2d at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, the Barrs quote from the Second How to Accept Letter in the Amended Complaint. Therefore, they have actual notice of its contents and explicitly relied on it in drafting the Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trigon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9246644\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/367/212/#p234\">\n    367 F.3d at 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec.

Thus, the Court concludes that it can examine the Second How to Accept Letter in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Third, because the Barrs specifically reference the December 2015 Letter and March 2016 Letter in the Amended Complaint and the Letters provide the basis for the Barrs' RESPA claims, the Court concludes that it can consider them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake Bay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190851\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/794/602/#p611\">\n    794 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   611 ;\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2995358\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/517/801/#p806\">\n    517 F.Supp.2d at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, the Amended Complaint does not contain specific details regarding Flagstar's responses or attach Flagstar's responses as exhibits. The Barrs plead, however, that Flagstar violated RESPA because it failed to \"fully respond...or provide the requested documentation.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 132). The Barrs, therefore, relied on Flagstar's responses in drafting their Amended Complaint. The Barrs would not be able to state that Flagstar's responses were insufficient if they had not received them. Further, because Flagstar's allegedly deficient responses provide the basis for the Barrs' RESPA claims, they are integral to the Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2995358\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/517/801/#p806\">\n    517 F.Supp.2d at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Amending Pleadings through Briefs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Barrs attempt to lodge new allegations against Flagstar in their Opposition brief. Because plaintiffs cannot amend their pleadings through briefs, the Court concludes that it will only consider the allegations contained in the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(1)(B) provides that \"[a] party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course within...21 days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b).\" In their Response, the Barrs assert four new allegations. First, as to their breach of contract claim, they allege that Flagstar breached the Revised LMA by \"failing to modify the loan\" and suffered damages in the form of late fees due to Flagstar's failure to apply their monthly payments to the unpaid balance of the Loan. (Pls.' Mem. Opp'n Def.'s Mot. Dismiss [\"Pls.' Opp'n\"] at 25, ECF No. 17). Second, as to their common law fraud claim, the Barrs allege that Flagstar had an affirmative duty to disclose that the Modification Payment Amount did not include escrow payments, and Flagstar fraudulently concealed this fact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19). Third, as to their MCPA claim, the Barrs assert that Flagstar failed to disclose the\n   material fact that the Modification Payment Amount supposedly no longer included escrow payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23). Fourth, as to their RESPA claim, the Barrs complain that Flagstar's investigation of the errors the Barrs identified in their Letters was not reasonable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Barrs, however, did not include these allegations in their Amended Complaint. Instead, the Barrs simply added the new allegations to their Response. The Court may not consider these new allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zachair, Ltd. v.

Compl. \u00b6 145). Flagstar argues that the Barrs' breach of contract claim should be dismissed to the extent that it is premised on Flagstar's failure to apply the Barrs' partial payments because Flagstar had no contractual obligation to accept the $2,041.43 payments as full payments. The Court, therefore, will only assess the Barrs' partial payment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Flagstar contends that the Barrs' partial payment claim is grounded in a misinterpretation of the Revised LMA.

The Barrs submit that the Court should read the Third TPP Agreement and the Second How to Accept Letter as part of the Revised LMA because both documents explicitly reference the Revised LMA. The Barrs argue that when these documents are read together with the Revised LMA, the agreement between the parties reflects that Flagstar agreed to accept $2,043.31 as the Modification Payment Amount, and that this amount included escrow payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The purpose of the Third TTP Agreement was to determine whether the Barrs were qualified for a permanent modification and to provide the Barrs immediate payment relief. (Def.'s Mot. Ex. C [\"Third TPP\"] at FLAG0024, ECF No. 11-4). The Third TPP Agreement expressly provides that if the Barrs \"otherwise perform[ ] under the loan document\" the \"mortgage will be permanently modified\n   <em>\n    in accordance with the terms of your modification agreement.\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at FLAG0023) (emphasis added). This term shows that the parties did not intend for the Third TTP Agreement to govern the permanent loan modification. Rather, they intended for the terms of the modification agreement to govern any permanent modification of the Barrs' Loan. In\n   addition, although the Third TPP Agreement employs the term \"modification agreement,\" it does not incorporate by reference the Revised LMA. Thus, the Court concludes that the Third TPP Agreement should not be read together with the Revised LMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Next, the Court concludes that it will construe the Second How to Accept Letter together with the Revised LMA for two reasons. First, Flagstar sent the Second How to Accept Letter and the Revised LMA to the Barrs at the same time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jaguar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148413\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/738/640/#p648\">\n    738 F.Supp.2d 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 648 (D.Md. 2010),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5748951\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/477/84/\">\n    477 F.App'x 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2012) (construing together three agreements that were sent to defendant at the same time). Second, the Second How to Accept Letter expressly provides the conditions for accepting the Revised LMA-returning two copies of the Revised LMA along with a certified check payable to Flagstar-and provides that the Revised LMA \"will be effective when signed by [the Barrs] and Flagstar.\" (2d How to Accept Letter at FLAG0057). The Second How to Accept Letter shows Flagstar's intent not to be bound by the Revised LMA until these condition precedents were satisfied. The Court will, therefore, only consider the Revised LMA and Second How to Accept Letter in determining the parties' contractual obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Breach of Contract Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Barrs argue that because of Flagstar's prior representations that the Modification Payment Amount included escrow payments, the $2,043.31 Modification Payment Amount under the Revised LMA included escrow payments as well. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The language of the Revised LMA-the operative agreement between the parties-is clear and unambiguous: \"Borrower also will comply with all other covenants...including without limitation, Borrower's covenants and agreements to make all payments of taxes, insurance premiums, assessments, [and]\n   <em>\n    escrow items\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Executed LMA at FLAG00108) (emphasis added). The payment schedule in the Revised LMA also states that $2,041.43 is only the Monthly Principal and Interest Payment Amount. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Revised LMA at FLAG0059). Escrow items are not included in the Modification Payment Amount. Further, neither the Revised LMA nor the Second How to Accept Letter contain any terms obligating Flagstar to accept $2,041.43 as the full monthly payment. While previous communications from Flagstar may have suggested that the escrow payments were included in the Revised LMA's Modification Payment Amount, the fact still remains that the Revised LMA expressly provides that the Barrs would be responsible for making all escrow payments in addition to the principal and interest payments on the mortgage. The Barrs executed the Revised LMA, and, therefore, are bound by its terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koons Ford\n   </em>\n   , 919 A.2d at 727.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Thus, the Court concludes that the Barrs fail to plausibly allege that Flagstar had a contractual duty to accept $2,041.43 as full payment under the Revised LMA. Accordingly, the Court will grant Flagstar's Motion to the extent that the Barrs' breach of contract claim is premised on Flagstar accepting their $2,041.43 payments only as partial payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Common Law Fraud Claims (Count I)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In short, the Court concludes that it will dismiss the Barrs' first fraud claim premised on Flagstar's alleged misrepresentation regarding the Modification Payment Amount.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). As discussed above, the language of the Revised LMA is clear-it required the Barrs to make monthly escrow payments in addition to the $2,041.43 Monthly Principal and Interest Payment. Because, when read together, the Second How to Accept Letter and the Revised LMA conflict with the allegations in the Amended Complaint, these documents prevail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fare Deals\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9449748\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/180/678/#p683\">\n    180 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   683 (citing\n   <em>\n    Fayetteville Inv'rs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535468\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/936/1462/#p1465\">\n    936 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1465 ). Thus, the Barrs fail to plausibly allege that Flagstar made a false representation of material fact related to whether escrow payments were included in the Modification Payment Amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Barrs bring a second fraud claim, however. They allege that Flagstar misrepresented that their \"loan would be modified if they complied with all conditions\" required to accept the Revised LMA. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 105). Because Flagstar does not address it in its Motion or Reply, the Court declines to address it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will only dismiss the Barrs' first fraud claim, which is related to the Modification Payment Amount.

MCPA Claims (Count II)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court concludes that it will dismiss the Barrs' MCPA claim premised on the Modification Payment Amount including escrow. The Court will not, however, dismiss the Barrs' remaining MCPA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The MCPA prohibits unfair or deceptive trade practices in connection with \"the extension of consumer credit\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   or the \"collection of consumer debts,\" CL \u00a7\u00a7 13-303(4), (5), which includes loan modifications,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marchese v.

The language of the Revised LMA is clear-the Barrs were still required to make escrow payments. (Executed LMA at FLAG00108).

Compl. \u00b6 132). The Court addresses each letter in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The December 2015 Letter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Flagstar argues the December 2015 Letter is not a QWR because it: (1) demands information unrelated to the servicing of their loan; and (2) does not specifically identify any errors related to the servicing of the loan. The Barrs counter that they specifically identified the error; the Barrs to do not address Flagstar's first argument. The Court agrees with Flagstar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Here, although the Barrs title the December 2015 Letter a \"QWR Request\" and cite specifically to RESPA, the substance of the letter requests an extensive amount of documents, including the Initial Loan Application and Final Loan Application, a copy of the original promissory note, a copy of the complete loan payment history, all escrow analyses conducted on the account, Truth in Lending Statements and\n   Disclosures, all loan servicing agreements, and appraisals. (Dec. 15, 2015 Letter at FLAG00162-63).

The March 2016 Letter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Flagstar concedes that the March 2016 Letter requested information related to the servicing of their loan. Nevertheless, Flagstar argues that it properly responded to the March 2016 Letter. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Based on the information the Barrs' requested, Flagstar was required to provide the following information from January 1, 2015 to March 1, 2016: (1) the date Flagstar received each payment; (2) the amount of each payment; (3) a breakdown of how each payment was applied to the principal, interest, escrow, fees, and charges and the amount sent to any suspense or unapplied funds account; (4) the date, amount, and destination of payments that were applied from a suspense or unapplied funds account; and (5) documents relating to the rejection of any payment. (Mar. 1, 2016 Letter at FLAG00205). Flagstar was also required to respond to the alleged error with the Barrs' account. On April 1, 2016, Flagstar sent the Barrs its response, which included 233 pages of documents. (2d Resp.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The Court has reviewed Flagstar's response, and the Court concludes that Flagstar fully responded to the Barrs' requests for information and notice of error. Flagstar provided a detailed account history covering January 15, 2015 through the date of the response, as well as an accounting of the escrow account and description of the late fees and suspense account payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at FLAG00379-95).

Flagstar goes on to explain that the Loan was approved for a modification, but that Flagstar had not modified the Loan because Flagstar had not received the Corrected LMA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Flagstar, therefore, satisfied its statutory obligation to respond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202605\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Thus, the Barrs fail to plausibly state a violation of RESPA based on the March 2016 Letter.
