Defendant was sentenced on October 2, 2015 under the 2014 Sentencing Guidelines Manual. His guideline range was 27 to 33 months, and he received a variant 24-month sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant has now filed a motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) seeking a reduction in his sentence based on amendments to the guidelines that went into effect on November 1, 2015. Specifically, defendant argues that Amendments 791, 792, and 794 all require a reduction in his guideline range because these amendments are retroactively applicable in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The problem for defendant is that the guidelines manual designates which amendments are retroactively applicable for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions, and none of the amendments defendant relies on are designated in the guidelines manual as retroactive. Guidelines \u00a7 1B1. 10, which governs sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), provides that where \"the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual\n   <em>\n    listed in subsection (d) below\n   </em>\n   , the court may reduce the defendant's term of imprisonment\" under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).

None of the amendments defendant cites-Amendments 791, 792, and 794-is listed under subsection (d), and as a result defendant is not entitled to claim the benefit of these amendments in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1B1.10(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Contrary to defendant's argument and the government's apparent agreement with defendant, the retroactivity analysis does not hinge on whether any of these amendments are \"clarifying\" amendments, which clarify the Sentencing Commission's intention with regard to a guidelines provision, or \"substantive\" amendments, which operate to change circuit law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And this is so regardless of whether the amendment is substantive or clarifying.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9058280\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/469/#p474\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9058280\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/469/#p474\">\n    at 474, 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that defendants are not \"entitled to the benefit of a substantive amendment\" adopted after defendant's sentencing \"unless the Sentencing Commission has designated the amendment for retroactive application,\" and holding that defendants may rely on clarifying amendments in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions only \"so long as the amendment has been designated for retroactive application\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority\n   of circuits agree with this \"bright-line rule that amendments claimed in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions may be retroactively applied\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   where expressly listed under [ \u00a7 1B1.10(d) ].\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Nothing in \u00a7 1B1.10 distinguishes between substantive and clarifying amendments for the purpose of retroactivity; for both substantive end clarifying amendments, their retroactive effect in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context turns only on whether the amendment is listed in the guidelines manual.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    Defendant argues that Amendment 792 is a \"hybrid\" amendment because part of the amendment is substantive and another part is clarifying.

U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.11(b)(2). That provision, however, refers only to the version of the guidelines manual that must be used at sentencing or on appeal; the provision says nothing about \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Goines\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9058280\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/469/#p474\">\n     357 F.3d at 474\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (stating that \"clarifying amendment[s] must be given effect at sentencing and on appeal,\" citing \u00a7 1B1.11(b)(2) );\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
