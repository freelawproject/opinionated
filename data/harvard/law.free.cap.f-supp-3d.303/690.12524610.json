J. at 1; 16-cv-9964, R. 30, Suppl. Mot. for Summ. J. at 3.) Plaintiff opposes the motion, and moves to strike Defendants' reply brief and sanction Defendants for raising arguments in their reply that were not raised in their motion for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 47, Mot. to Strike.) For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted, and Plaintiff's motion to strike and for sanctions is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    RELEVANT FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This suit implicates facts and numerous discrete incidents that occurred over several years during Plaintiff's employment. The Court, therefore, only summarizes those facts that are material to Plaintiff's claims. The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise stated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Parties and Plaintiff's Supervisors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants are Delaware corporations and pharmaceutical companies. (14-cv-9626, R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Statement of Material Facts [hereinafter \"SOMF\"] \u00b6 1; 16-cv-9964, R. 28, Answer to Am. Compl. at 2.) In June 2005, Keen was hired as a sales specialist by Cephalon, a pharmaceutical company later acquired by Teva. (14-cv-9626, R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOMF \u00b6 3.) As a sales specialist, she was responsible for selling pharmaceuticals in the Chicago area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The physical requirements of her job included daily driving, getting in and out of her car, carrying promotional materials, climbing and descending stairs, and walking to and from physicians' offices. (16-cv-9964, R. 28, Answer to Am. Compl. at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to Teva's acquisition of Cephalon in October 2011, Plaintiff reported to Katherine Stanek. (14-cv-9626, R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOMF \u00b6 3.) Shortly after the acquisition, Plaintiff began reporting to Scott Bischoff, Teva's Chicago regional sales manager. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Sometime in 2013, Mike Rothweiler replaced Bischoff as the regional sales manager, and Plaintiff then began reporting to him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Stanek, Bischoff, and Rothweiler all reported to Matthew Muller, who was a director of sales at Cephalon and later the director of sales for Teva's \"central nervous division\" following Teva's acquisition of Cephalon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Plaintiff's Leaves of Absence in 2010-2012\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In November 2010, Plaintiff was involved in an automobile accident while she was working and injured her neck and shoulder as a result. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-5, Keen Oct. 14 Dep. Tr. at 34, 37.) After the accident, she took a leave of absence for approximately five months and returned to work either \"at the end of April or early May\" in 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-41.) Shortly after the accident, Plaintiff filed a claim with the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission (\"IWCC\") related to the accident. (16-cv-9964, R. 41-2 at 86, Workers' Comp. Claims.) In November 2011, Plaintiff underwent surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff, and she took a one month leave of absence following her surgery. (14-cv-9626, R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOMF \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The following year, Plaintiff underwent spinal surgery to repair injuries she suffered in the November 2010 car accident and took another leave of absence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-5, Keen Oct. 14 Dep. Tr. at 51-53.) Her leave began in June 2012 and lasted for twelve weeks, at which time Plaintiff exhausted her leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52-53.) Just a few months after she returned, Plaintiff discovered that her spinal surgery had failed and that she would need another surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOMF \u00b6 16.) On December 12, 2012, Plaintiff met with Teva's director of human resources, Rob Bobrowski, and explained to him that \"she was going to be off work for an extended period of time because of her disability of degenerative cervical disc disease\" and surgery she had scheduled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 89, Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Statement of Additional Material Facts [hereinafter \"SOAMF\"] \u00b6 22.) Later in December 2012, Plaintiff underwent a second spinal surgery which\n   led to an extended leave of absence from Teva. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 11, 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Plaintiff's Leave and Return to Work in 2013\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   While Plaintiff was still on leave, Plaintiff's physician, Dr. Gary Shapiro, wrote a letter to Defendants on May 8, 2013, informing them that Plaintiff was scheduled for another spinal surgery on May 17, 2013, and that she was to refrain from work until the surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-12 at 16, May 8, 2013, Shapiro Letter.) Dr. Shapiro also informed Defendants that Plaintiff would need two to six weeks to recover. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's surgery, however, was cancelled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 89, Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s SOAMF \u00b6 9.) Soon after, on May 23, 2013, Bobrowski wrote a letter to Plaintiff, which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   As you know, you have been out of the workplace and field since December 21, 2012. In addition, this time has not been approved under Teva's Family Medical Leave Policy and Teva's Short Term/Long Term disability plans. Thus, your time is currently categorized as personal, unpaid, non-FML leave. Also, since that time, Teva has provided you with full benefits and use of a company car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   For approximately five (5) months, the Company has accommodated your requested leave and kept your position vacant pending your return. We ask that you notify us no later than May 31, 2013 as to your work status. Please have your physician review your job description and complete the Physical Capabilities Checklist (attached), confirming if you are fit for duty and identifying any restrictions or accommodations necessary and, indicating if/when you will be able to return to work....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   If you are unable to return to work on or around June 3, 2013, and perform the essential function of your job, with or without accommodation, you will be administratively laid off from your employment. However, if you are laid off, you are invited to contact us when you are able to return to work to discuss any available positions for which you may be qualified[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-12 at 18, May 23, 2013, Bobrowski Letter.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In response, on May 29, 2013, Plaintiff faxed a letter to Teva's nurse care manager, Donna Montagna, representing that her physician had released her to return to work on June 3, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-12 at 20, May 29, 2013, Keen Letter.) Attached to the fax was the Physical Capabilities Checklist (the \"Checklist\") that Teva had enclosed with Bobrowski's May 23 letter, which was completed and signed by Dr. Shapiro. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Checklist detailed Plaintiff's physical capabilities and limitations, indicating that she could: (1) lift, carry, push, and pull up to 10 pounds; (2) sit continuously; (3) stand, walk, and drive frequently; and (4) bend, squat, reach above her shoulder, and kneel occasionally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Despite Plaintiff's letter enclosing the Checklist, Montagna instructed Plaintiff to not return to work on June 3, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 89, Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s SOAMF \u00b6 10.) Montagna told Plaintiff that she was not cleared to return to work because \"someone in HR thinks you need surgery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-5, Keen Oct. 14 Dep. Tr. at 74.) Specifically, Plaintiff understood that someone in Teva's human resources department told Montagna that Plaintiff could not return to work until she underwent the surgery that was previously scheduled for May 17, 2013, but had been cancelled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74-76.) Shortly thereafter, on June 5, Plaintiff called Defendants' compliance hotline and claimed that Defendants discriminated against her on the basis of her disability. (16-cv-9964, R. 28, Answer to Am. Compl. at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants denied Plaintiff's return in early June because they had reviewed the Checklist and concluded that there was a lack of clarity and agreement as to Plaintiff's work-related restrictions and necessary accommodations. (14-cv-9626, R. 86-8, Bobrowski Oct. 19 Dep. Tr. at 103-09.) Plaintiff's surgery that was originally scheduled for May 17, 2013, but later cancelled, eventually took place in July 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 89, Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s SOAMF \u00b6 10.) Following the surgery, on August 22, 2013, Plaintiff faxed another Checklist to Teva. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOMF \u00b6 23.) Teva advised her that, because she had been absent from work for over six months, she needed to complete a \"return-to-work\" examination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-5, Keen Oct. 14 Dep. Tr. at 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On August 27, 2013, Plaintiff completed that examination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78-79, 85.) Following this examination, Montagna called Plaintiff and told her that there was \"a problem\" with the results and therefore she requested that Plaintiff undergo a second examination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86-87.) Specifically, Plaintiff was informed that she had to undergo a second test because the first test found that her neck was normal, but Defendants believed that the test failed to indicate that she had a \"scar or something to that effect\" on her neck. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, Plaintiff refused to complete a second examination and, shortly thereafter, Plaintiff's then-counsel requested information from Teva as to why a second examination was necessary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86-88.) Even though Plaintiff did not retake the examination, on September 11, 2013, Montagna called Plaintiff and informed her that she could return to work the following day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88.) Plaintiff returned to work on September 12, 2013, and her only work restriction was that she could not lift more than twenty pounds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 89, Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s SOAMF \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-5, Keen Oct. 14 Dep. Tr. at 80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Plaintiff's Request to Attend a Training Workshop\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In early 2014, Plaintiff signed up for a training workshop in Pennsylvania scheduled for February 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-6, Keen Oct. 15 Dep. Tr. at 55-56.) Plaintiff, however, was not approved to attend this workshop because Defendants wanted their sales representatives to focus on having a strong start to their year, and Defendants recommended that Plaintiff wait until later in the year to attend a workshop. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-57.) Another woman on Plaintiff's team, Jonnie Blake, was not approved to go to the workshop either, but Plaintiff knew of three men who were approved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-6, Keen Oct. 15 Dep. Tr. at 57-58.) The same number of men and women from Teva, however, attended the Pennsylvania workshop. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-6, Bobrowski Aff. \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    V. The Senior Executive Sales Specialist Position\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   While Plaintiff was on leave in 2013 she was notified that her job title had changed\n   from \"Territory Sales Specialist\" to \"Executive Sales Specialist.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-5, Keen Oct. 14 Dep. Tr. at 89-90.) While at Cephalon, Plaintiff's job title was Territory Sales Specialist, and all sales representatives at Cephalon had that same title. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89.) After Teva acquired Cephalon, Teva undertook a project to rename Cephalon's job titles to those more consistent with job titles used at Teva. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-9, Bobrowski Jan. 28 Dep. Tr. at 14-15.) This process involved a review of each sales representative's experience and performance over time to decide how each sales representative's job title would be renamed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-20.) Plaintiff believes that although she met the qualifications for a \"Senior Executive Sales Specialist\" (\"SESS\"), she was instead designated as an Executive Sales Specialist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-5, Keen Oct. 14 Dep. Tr. at 90-91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As part of its process to re-categorize each sales representative, Teva established a committee (the \"Committee\") that included, among other directors of Teva's sales divisions, Muller, director of the sales division for which plaintiff worked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-10, Muller Dep. Tr. at 58.) Sales directors, like Muller, would have a discussion with lower-level managers to determine the recommended job title for each employee within that sales director's division. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58-59.) Sales directors would then present those recommendations to the Committee for its review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59.) The Committee then considered each employee's sales performance and other factors, and attempted to evaluate each employee in a uniform manner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60-63.) Afterwards, Teva's sales directors voted to approve each employee's job title. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Within Muller's division, Muller reviewed an evaluation generated by each employee's immediate supervisor that described the employee's characteristics outside of his or her sales performance, such as the employee's leadership and mentorship qualities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64.) In Plaintiff's case, her direct supervisor, Bischoff, completed her evaluation that Muller reviewed in order to determine-together with the other sales directors-her job title. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Committee could assign one of five positions to each sales representative: (1) Sales Specialist, (2) Professional Sales Specialist, (3) Senior Sales Specialist, (4) Executive Sales Specialist, and (5) SESS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-12 at 11-14, Promotional Guidelines.) The qualifications for SESS were:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   1. a rating of \"meets\" or better for two of the last three years, which is a rating indicating that the employee met his or her responsibilities in a given year;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   2. a rating of \"exceeds\" or better for at least one of the last two years, which is a rating indicating that the employee \"exceeded\" his or her responsibilities in a given year;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   3. finishing within the top 30% of Teva's sales representatives in one of the last three years and within the top 50% of Teva's sales representatives in the other two years;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   4. working a minimum of three years as a Teva Executive Sales Specialist;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   5. more than eleven years\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   of experience working in pharmaceutical sales; and\n   6. being a \"leader,\" \"mentor,\" and \"role model.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-12 at 11-14, Promotional Guidelines.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff met the objective qualifications for the SESS position such as sales numbers and years of experience. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-1, Pl.'s SOAMF \u00b6 29.) Additionally, Teva's internal evaluation of Plaintiff as part of the Committee's review process shows that she was recommended for the SESS position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-10 at 20, Eligibility Criteria Worksheet;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-10, Muller Dep. Tr. at 53-54.) Despite this recommendation, Plaintiff was ultimately designated as an Executive Sales Specialist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-5, Keen Oct. 14 Dep. Tr. at 90-91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Multiple Teva employees testified that Plaintiff did not receive the SESS position because she was not considered a role model or leader. For example, Plaintiff's supervisor prior to 2011, Stanek, testified that Plaintiff \"always did well on the sales performance,\" but it was \"well-documented\" that \"she was not executing against behaviors that the company held as standards.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-16, Stanek Dep. Tr. at 29-30.) During the employee reclassification process, Muller asked Bischoff about examples of Plaintiff being a leader, mentor, or role model, and Bischoff \"did not have any examples to speak to.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-12, Bischoff Dep. Tr. at 23.) Instead, Bischoff spoke to Plaintiff's \"lack of leadership, her lack of mentorship, her lack of initiative, her lack of role modeling, lack of collaboration, and her lack of followership.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Bischoff also gave Muller examples to support his observations about Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   While largely positive, some of Plaintiff's written reviews included similar criticisms. Plaintiff's 2010 Cephalon review lauded her for her sales numbers, clinical and product knowledge, customer knowledge, and stated that Plaintiff's \"leadership and ability to adapt to a changed environment is appreciated by her manager.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-16 at 53-56, 2010 Performance Summ.) The review, however, also stated that Plaintiff did not meet expectations regarding targeting customers with the greatest sales potential and that her \"failure to show improvement planning and organizing over the past 9 month[s] speaks to an unwillingness to adopt and implement change when she does not agree with corporate goals and strategies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff's 2011 Abbreviated Performance Summary was almost entirely positive, noting that she was on pace to exceed her sales quota, she had earned a \"President's Club rank,\" and her knowledge of the product was \"superior.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-16 at 57-58, Abbreviated Performance Summ.) The review did note that she was on a medical leave for some of 2011, but \"[w]hile in territory she did not meet expressed call expectations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, it stated that Plaintiff \"was consistently behind the Nation, Region and team call averages throughout each evaluation period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Despite this critique, the summary concluded that Plaintiff was \"consistently a top performer[ ] in the organization[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On October 31, 2013, Plaintiff met with Muller and Rothweiler to discuss her 2012 performance review and the reasons why she was not selected for the SESS position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOMF \u00b6 35.) The results of Plaintiff's 2012 Mid-Year Performance Review-which was completed by Rothweiler's predecessor, Bischoff-were distinctly lower than prior years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-7 at 60-65, 2012 Mid-Year Performance Review.) The review had performance categories of: \"Below,\" \"Mostly Meets,\" \"Meets,\" \"Exceeds,\" and \"Exceptional.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff did not receive any \"Exceeds\" or \"Exceptional\" in any individual category and her overall\n   evaluation was \"Mostly Meets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60-64.) In a section assessing Plaintiff's \"Strengths and Needs,\" Bischoff did not list any \"Strengths.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64.) As to Plaintiff's \"Needs,\" Bischoff wrote that Plaintiff: \"needs to improve her time and territory management\" because \"her calls per day are among the lowest in the area;\" \"should increase her overall activity in line with area and regional averages;\" \"should be more proactive in completing administrative requirements\" including \"expense reports;\" and \"could benefit from increased resource utilization.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At the meeting with Muller and Rothweiler on October 31, 2013, Muller informed Plaintiff that although she met all of the objective criteria to qualify for the SESS position, she was not sufficiently a leader, mentor, or role model to merit the SESS position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-10, Muller Dep. Tr. at 109-10.) To refute this, Plaintiff points out that in September 2011, Stanek emailed Muller, Reilly, and Plaintiff comparing her to Lou Holtz, a former coach of the University of Notre Dame's football team, and wrote: \"Over the past several years you've been our Lou Holt[z], an inspiration to so many at Cephalon including myself, and we are so proud of you! Like him, you are in a league of your own!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-16 at 59-62, Stanek Sept. 9, 2011, Email.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that the actual reason behind Teva's decision not to promote her to the SESS position was because of her disability and gender. To support these allegations, Plaintiff points to a number of facts. Plaintiff testified that Muller told her that she had not actively participated in meetings and that she had missed meetings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-5, Keen Oct. 14 Dep. Tr. at 109, 115.) Plaintiff also notes that on November 14, 2012, she emailed Bischoff about her performance reviews, stating that her \"challenge\" at work \"is obvious with [her] medical leave and ... need for accommodations[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-12 at 16, Bischoff Nov. 14, 2012, Email.) In response, Bischoff wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Your medical limitations and leave of absence have had a significant impact on your ability to perform this year at a high level but that shouldn't detract you from returning to President's club in 2013! I think next year you will be in a much better position to succeed while documenting competencies along the way. I am confident you will return to a top performing sales executive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiff also claims that there were \"many men, with no disability, without the qualifications\" that were promoted to the SESS position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 89, Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s SOAMF at 10.) In support, Plaintiff identifies six men who \"did not have all [of] the required qualifications ... but were nonetheless promoted to the position, without any interview.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) No individual directly reporting to Bischoff, however, \"was qualified for the SESS position.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOMF \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Plaintiff's 2013 Bonus and Salary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff's 2013 bonus payments were approximately $12,000 less than what she was expecting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-7, Keen May 24 Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 7-9.) Plaintiff asked Rothweiler why her bonus had been reduced in 2013, and Rothweiler told her that the bonus was reduced because she was out of her territory for most of the year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-6, Keen Oct. 15 Dep. Tr. at 10-11.) Plaintiff, however, also testified that her bonus was reduced because Teva prohibited her from returning to work in June 2013 and did not allow her to return until September 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Bonuses at Teva are calculated \"based on performance measured by sales of the representative's territory\" and are paid every three months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 89, Defs.' Resp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   to Pl.'s SOAMF \u00b6 29.) Teva's 2013 Annual Incentive Plan states in relevant part, \"[l]eaves of absence will impact incentive eligibility in proportion to the length of the leave, with the exception of an approved leave that qualifies under FMLA, the Parental Leave Policy and/or the Military Leave Policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-6 at 10, Annual Incentive Plan.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Plaintiff's Leave in 2014 and Performance Following Her Return to Work\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In January 2014, Plaintiff reinjured her shoulder while attempting to refill her car's windshield wiper fluid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-6, Keen Oct. 15 Dep. Tr. at 12-17.) Following her injury, Plaintiff continued to work from January 29, 2014, until March 12, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOMF \u00b6 44.) Plaintiff filed a workers' compensation claim with the IWCC for this injury. (16-cv-9964, R. 41-2 at 85, Workers' Comp. Claims.) Plaintiff did not go on medical leave immediately following the injury because she \"had not yet qualified for family medical leave,\" and \"needed job-protected leave[.]\" (14-cv-9626, R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOMF \u00b6 44.) Plaintiff eventually went on FMLA leave, and while on leave, Plaintiff had another surgery on her spine in March 2014 and a surgery to repair her rotator cuff on May 15, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.) On June 2, 2014-the day before Plaintiff's FMLA leave was set to expire-Plaintiff sent an email requesting two additional months of leave as an ADA accommodation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-6, Keen Oct. 15 Dep. Tr. at 23-27.) Defendants agreed to the extension, and Plaintiff returned to work on August 7, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOMF \u00b6\u00b6 46-47;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-11 at 54, Bobrowski June 10, 2014, Letter.) Teva's letter extending Plaintiff's leave, however, stated that her territory was \"not being managed by an active sales representative\" because of Plaintiff's \"extended absences,\" and also stated that \"any requests for additional extended leaves will be closely scrutinized as Teva must have an active representative within [Plaintiff's] territory[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-11 at 54, Bobrowski June 10, 2014, Letter.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Upon Plaintiff's return to work in August 2014, Rothweiler remained Plaintiff's supervisor, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-6, Keen Oct. 15 Dep. Tr. at 23), and the two met to discuss her performance expectations for the rest of the year, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-14, Rothweiler Aff. \u00b6 2). As part of these expectations, Plaintiff was provided a \"call list,\" which \"assigned a certain number of [sales] calls over the course of the year[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-6, Keen Oct. 15 Dep. Tr. at 48.) Included in this call list were physicians in Plaintiff's Indiana territory that were identified as \"high decile prescribes,\" or those doctors that could be encouraged to prescribe more Teva products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff claims that the list that Rothweiler created for her was misguided because many of the targets were \"retired\" or not in her territory, and the suggested call volume did not account for the time she was on medical leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-7, Keen May 24 Aff. \u00b6 31.) Following the meeting, Plaintiff also \"repeatedly complained to ... Rothweiler regarding unusual challenges related to [her] leave that affected [her] ability to do [her] job,\" such as the \"inability to access corporate websites,\" \"inconsistencies with data,\" \"problems accessing a case manager,\" issues with her medical care, and \"issues concerning [her] corporate\" credit card. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-7, Keen May 24 Aff. \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In November 2014, Rothweiler accompanied Plaintiff on a two-day field visit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-14, Rothweiler Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.) Per Teva's practices, Rothweiler prepared a field coaching report (\"FCR\") following the field visit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) The FCR provided both positive and negative comments regarding Plaintiff's \"business acumen.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   R. 81-14 at 6, FCR.) For example, the review stated that Plaintiff engaged in \"good discussion\" with physicians and \"did a nice job of gaining commitment with ... physicians to prescribe our products,\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) The FCR, however, discussed the fact that Plaintiff did not make sales calls to Indiana, stating that \"[o]verall 30% of [Plaintiff's] business comes from Indiana, however only 2% of [her] time has been spent there.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) The FCR also concluded that Plaintiff did not exercise a \"sound strategy\" for sales, and was making very few sales calls in the morning hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff's morning absences were due to physical therapy appointments she attended once or twice a week, regular doctor's appointments, and a daily \"morning exercise program.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOMF \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.) These obligations caused Plaintiff to delay the start of her work day or caused her to miss one to two mornings of work every week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-6, Keen Oct. 15 Dep. Tr. at 34, 37.) She testified, however, that Rothweiler approved these accommodations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. The 2014 \"Make It Happen\" Sales Contest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   While Plaintiff was on leave in 2014, a sales contest took place at Teva that it branded as the \"Make It Happen\" sales contest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOMF \u00b6 73.) Initially, Plaintiff was listed as not being eligible to participate in the contest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Jeffery Schurr, a senior manager of incentive compensation at Teva, categorized Plaintiff as ineligible because he was informed by Bobrowski that Plaintiff was \"on a leave that was bonus ineligible.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-15, Schurr Dep. Tr. at 18.) On June 25, 2014, after seeing an email listing her as ineligible to participate, Plaintiff emailed Rothweiler to explain that she was in fact eligible to participate in the contest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-11 at 70, Keen June 25, 2014, Email.) Five days later, on June 30, 2014, Rothweiler notified Plaintiff that she was eligible to participate in the contest and would be receiving credit for it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-11 at 70, Rothweiler June 30, 2014, Email.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff testified that in the days following the error and before Teva corrected the error, she suffered \"great humiliation and embarrassment from the incorrect results from the contest and received calls from many colleagues asking what was wrong with her or if she was on a performance improvement plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-6, Keen Oct. 15 Dep. Tr. at 72-76, 82-83.) Even though Plaintiff was informed that she was in fact eligible to participate in the contest, Teva did not correct the \"humiliating e-mail that was sent out by the vice president\" announcing that Plaintiff was ineligible, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73.) Plaintiff, however, did participate in the contest and was paid as one of the winners of the contest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    IX. Plaintiff's Request for a Sales Territory Accommodation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   After her return in August 2014, Plaintiff made repeated requests to her supervisors and Teva's human resources department to modify her sales territory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOMF \u00b6 55.) In November 2014, Plaintiff requested that Defendants accommodate her medical condition by removing Indiana from her territory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-55;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-11 at 73-74, Keen Nov. 20, 2014, Email.) In response, Rothweiler asked if she made a \"reasonable accommodations request to anyone in the organization\" and, if not, Rothweiler encouraged her to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-11 at 73-74, Keen Nov. 20, 2014, Email.) Plaintiff replied that before she made a reasonable accommodations request, she wanted to specifically know if \"sales management would consider such a request,\" because it would be pointless to\n   request an accommodation if her superiors would not approve it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In December 2014 and January 2015, Plaintiff renewed her territory modification request.

Tr. at 135-36.) Plaintiff had prior confrontational experiences with a Work Care account manager, and Dr. Peter Greaney, Work Care's founder and chief executive officer, was advised that Plaintiff was \"quite argumentative\" and \"had initially refused to sign\" Work Care's standard Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\") release form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-15, Greaney Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4.) Specifically, Plaintiff: had \"blacked out\" portions of Work Care's standard HIPAA form that it used to obtain an employee's medical information; was not willing to release medical information; and took issue with the fact that Work Care would need to talk to her health care providers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) The \"matter was escalated\" to Dr. Greaney, who called Plaintiff in April 2015 to seek more clarity on her requests for accommodations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Plaintiff was \"rude, loud, and argumentative during the course of the call,\" and also told him \"that a clinical clarification was not required.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , April 3, 2015, Email;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.'

Plaintiff testified that after Dr. Greaney \"hung up\" on her, she felt \"helpless\" and humiliated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-6, Keen Oct. 15 Dep. Tr. at 187-88.)

Plaintiff's 2014 Performance Review and Subsequent Rebuttal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff received her 2014 performance review in February 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOMF \u00b6 63.) The ratings categories were \"Below,\" \"Mostly Meets,\" \"Meets,\" \"Exceeds,\" and \"Exceptional.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's overall evaluation was \"Mostly Meets,\" and her overall sales ranking was 233 out of 254. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-11 at 76-79, Performance Mgmt. Full Report.) Her manager's comments in the report, who was Rothweiler, included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \u2022 \"[Plaintiff] did not provide ... any developmental goals in 2014.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \u2022 While Plaintiff requested to attend a \"selling skills class\" in the first quarter of 2014 and that request was denied, Plaintiff \"did not request another class upon her return to the field in August.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \u2022 \"[S]he will need to take a more proactive approach ... to administrative tasks, resource utilization, and communications around business issues in her territory.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \u2022 \"[Plaintiff] has not demonstrated a leadership role on the team in 2014.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \u2022 \"[Plaintiff] has not been able to adequately meet an appropriate level of call activity on the customers that have the greatest impact on her business.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \u2022 \"[Plaintiff] did not submit any expense reports for 2014 until December.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \u2022 Plaintiff \"did not spend time in the Indiana portion of her territory ... that accounts for approximately 30% of her Nuvigil business.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \u2022 \"She did not follow her call plan to effectively reach the most valued customers[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77-79.) Plaintiff disagreed with the majority of these remarks as \"fundamentally flawed\" and responded with a document titled \"2014 Keen Performance Review Rebuttal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-6 at 52-64, Keen Rebuttal.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In her rebuttal, Plaintiff described the comments in her 2014 performance review as \"false and misleading[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-6 at 52, Keen Rebuttal.) She blamed her negative reviews on Teva's failure to follow company policy in their handling of her leave in 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The rebuttal further complained that Rothweiler mistakenly included a particular doctor in her sales quota calculations that adversely affected her sales numbers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53.) Her rebuttal also claimed that her failure to provide Rothweiler with developmental goals in 2014 was because she was on medical leave at the time these goals were developed with management. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff acknowledged that she did not attend the \"setting skills class\" in the first quarter of 2014 because Rothweiler made her cancel her attendance at that class and told her that she could attend another class later in the year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She also claims that Rothweiler did not invite her to a class later on in the year and that he was nonresponsive when she asked him for class recommendations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54.) As to her lack of collaboration with other employees, Plaintiff stated in her rebuttal that her leave from work impacted her ability to collaborate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   With respect to Rothweiler's criticism of Plaintiff's approach towards administrative tasks, \"resource utilization,\" and communicating about business issues, Plaintiff's rebuttal attributed her lackluster performance in these areas to Rothweiler's failure to respond to her concerns about: her inability to access Teva's website and computer applications; issues contacting her managers; problems accessing medical care for work-related injuries; issues related to her corporate credit card; management's expectations\n   of Plaintiff given her medical leave; and pending requests for accommodations that might have improved Plaintiff's performance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55.) Plaintiff acknowledged in her rebuttal, however, that many of these problems were outside of Rothweiler's domain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In response to criticisms pointing out Plaintiff's failure to call doctors in her territory that provided the most sales or sales potential for Teva, Plaintiff claimed that her poor performance was due partly to her medical leave and partly to the strategy that management provided her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55-56.) Plaintiff's rebuttal also criticized negative comments related to her failure to perform well in Indiana, claiming that \"Teva refused to provide or even engage\" her in discussion about modifying her territory to account for her medical condition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57.) Plaintiff concluded her rebuttal stating that Teva failed to accommodate her medical issues and resolve other non-medical problems that affected her performance in 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-64.) Within this narrative, Plaintiff accused Muller of being \"dismissive\" of her \"disability\" during an in-person performance review because it \"seem[ed] to [her]\" that she had to endure a poor performance review from Muller in 2014 because of her request for an accommodation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62.) While the rebuttal claims that Muller \"questioned any legitimate need\" for a workplace accommodation given Plaintiff's \"only restriction is a 20 [pound] lifting restriction,\" the rebuttal does not provide specific examples in which Muller directly referenced her request for an accommodation as problematic or negatively affecting her 2014 performance review. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n    at 61-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   This narrative also accused Muller of making crude, sexual remarks on several occasions to other Teva employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62-64.) Plaintiff's rebuttal claimed that Muller \"degraded the standards of behavior\" within his division, and that his behavior was related to other instances in which Teva employees had mocked the patients of doctors to whom they marketed Teva products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63-64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    XI. Plaintiff's Request for Excess Insurance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In March 2015, Teva began offering certain employees excess insurance in addition to their regular auto insurance coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-18, Rohach Aff. \u00b6 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff called Teva's human resources department to inquire about this benefit, and she spoke with Melissa Slifer, the Teva employee responsible for such inquiries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-6, Keen Oct. 15 Dep. Tr. at 88.) Slifer explained to Plaintiff that she was not offered the excess insurance because that benefit was only offered to employees above a certain income level, and Plaintiff's income was not high enough to qualify. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-18, Rohach Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-6, Keen Oct., 15 Dep. Tr. at 89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiff believes she was denied the insurance because of her gender, disability, and previously-filed discrimination claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-6, Keen Oct. 15 Dep. Tr. at 93-94;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 89, Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s SOAMF \u00b6 38.) Plaintiff testified that during her call with Slifer, in addition to explaining the income level eligibility, Slifer said that she was not offered the umbrella policy because \"[i]t was on the advice of [Defendants'] counsel[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-6, Keen Oct. 15 Dep. Tr. at 89.) Plaintiff\n   believes that she was denied the benefit because of her disability and gender, and, when asked for the basis of her belief, she said \"[b]ecause I should have gotten it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When pushed again, Plaintiff testified, \"I'm a female. I should have been offered that. I wasn't and I was given a reason that I didn't qualify for the benefit that simply was not in line[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93.) Plaintiff also knew other representatives \"who made less money than [she] did [but received] the mailing\" that offered the insurance benefit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    XII. Plaintiff's 2015 Leave and Termination in 2016\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   On March 4, 2015, Plaintiff injured herself when she attempted to move boxes of Teva promotional materials that had been delivered to her home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   R. 86-6, Keen Oct. 15 Dep. Tr. at 105-06; 16-cv-9964, R. 41-2 at 84-86, Workers' Comp. Claims.) Because Plaintiff did not know the extent of her injuries, she did not immediately inform Teva of the injury. (14-cv-9626, R. 86-6, Keen Oct. 15 Dep. Tr. at 109-10.) After she sought medical treatment, Plaintiff went on leave in April 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOMF \u00b6 61.) Plaintiff last performed work for Teva in April 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.) On April 20, 2015, Plaintiff had another surgery to address problems with her shoulder and cervical spine. (16-cv-9964, R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep. Tr. at 358, 369.) Plaintiff also filed a workers' compensation claim with the IWCC for this injury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 41-2 at 84, Workers' Comp. Claims.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Later in April 2015, Teva did not promptly provide Plaintiff with a medical case manager to address medical issues resulting from Plaintiff's surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep. Tr. at 99-100.) Plaintiff did not understand that Teva had any obligation to provide her with a case manager, but instead she believed that the appointment of a case manager was \"the process [she] was supposed to go through as an employee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100.) Plaintiff spoke with Teva vice president Ken Adamson regarding her medical issues in 2015, but Adamson never promised a case manager to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101-02.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In July 2015, Plaintiff's doctor drafted a letter stating that he did not think Plaintiff could be accommodated to return to work unless she would: be restricted to lifting no more than a pound with her right arm;\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   refrain from pushing, pulling, or any repetitive motion; and refrain from typing or driving for any extended period of time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 30-8 at 24, July 9, 2015, Dr. Shi Letter;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 30-8 at 25-26, July 9, 2015, Keen Letter.) As a result of this letter, Teva accommodated Plaintiff's medical condition and extended her leave of absence under the FMLA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 30-8 at 27, Rothweiler July 16, 2015, Email.) This accommodation, however, was not satisfactory to Plaintiff who, at the time, could only lift one sixteen-ounce beverage in a weightless container; needed to refrain from typing for more than two minutes; needed to refrain from driving for more than one hour; and needed to attend physical therapy during the work week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 30-8 at 28, Keen July 20, 2015, Letter.) Therefore, Plaintiff requested that she be granted leave from work until September 1, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, Defendants requested that Plaintiff execute an authorization for Defendants to review Plaintiff's medical records to confirm these representations and ascertain the accommodations Plaintiff required. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 30-8 at 29-30, Bobrowski July 23, 2015, Letter.) Defendants also warned Plaintiff that they had \"issues regarding coverage\" of Plaintiff's sales \"territory since at least 2011,\" and\n   that they could not keep her \"territory open indefinitely[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Plaintiff, however, refused to authorize Defendants' review of her medical records, and, having exhausted all of her FMLA leave, Plaintiff was placed on personal, unpaid leave on July 30, 2015, and given notice that she would need to return her company car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 30-8 at 34-35, Bobrowski July 30, 2015, Letter to Keen.) Shortly thereafter, however, on August 3, 2015, Bobrowski sent a letter to Plaintiff stating that they would extend her leave of absence through September 18, 2015, pursuant to \"the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Illinois Human Rights Act.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 30-9 at 42, Bobrowski Aug. 3, 2015, Letter.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In August 2015, Teva again delivered several boxes containing promotional materials to Plaintiff, which were delivered to her front porch and partially obstructed the entrance to her home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep. Tr. at 81-82.) To avoid lifting the boxes, Plaintiff opened them, removed the promotional materials inside them, and placed the promotional materials in her company car that Teva later came to retrieve on August 13, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Plaintiff was not compensated for her absence from work that she took in April 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113.) During this time, Defendants' disability benefits vendor, the Matrix Company (\"Matrix\"), informed Plaintiff that she would not receive disability benefits because she made a claim for a workplace injury, an injury that was excluded under her disability benefits policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113-15.) Plaintiff believed that her failure to receive disability benefits was retaliatory because she was not paid on her workers' compensation claim, and she believed Teva's policy required her to be paid either the disability benefits or workers' compensation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116-17.) Plaintiff's workers' compensation claim, however, was still pending at the time of her deposition when she testified that she had not yet received any workers' compensation benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121.) Matrix also informed Plaintiff that she could receive disability benefits if she entered into a \"reimbursement agreement\" with Teva that required her to waive certain medical and legal costs she had incurred, but Plaintiff refused to accept this agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 123-24, 129-30.) Plaintiff believes that her failure to receive any disability benefits was due to retaliation, but she could not identify any specific individual at Teva who retaliated against her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126, 135.) Instead, she identified a \"woman\" working at Matrix as the person who retaliated against her, and also attributed retaliation to her human resources and sales managers because she \"worked with them\" and they were \"involved in the decisions not to facilitate [her] claims[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126-28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Also during this timeframe, in response to Plaintiff's workers' compensation claims, Debbie Smith of Scott insurance was investigating the shipments of Teva promotional materials that were sent to Plaintiff's house in 2015, and Defendants represented to Smith that they had sent fewer boxes than were actually received. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep. Tr. at 95-96.) Plaintiff believes that this incomplete information was to retaliate against her for filing complaints with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff speculates that there may have been telephone conversations providing further factual support for her belief that Defendants provided incomplete information to Smith in retaliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Plaintiff attempted to return to work on September 21, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 141.) On that day, she did not call any doctors or pharmacists to sell Teva products, but instead\n   performed administrative and other tasks from her home to prepare herself to perform sales-related work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 141-42, 144, 152.) Plaintiff's superior, Rothweiler, instructed her that she could not return to work until she provided Teva with a medical clearance from her doctor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152-53.) Plaintiff obtained medical clearance from her doctor, but the clearance restricted her to driving only four hours per day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153-54.) Plaintiff's doctor also restricted her to only twenty minutes of typing on her computer at a time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 154.) As for weight-lifting restrictions, Plaintiff was restricted to lifting three pounds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Bobrowski forwarded Plaintiff's doctor's recommendations to Work Care, and Work Care sought further clarification from Plaintiff's doctor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 39, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOMF \u00b6 27.) Teva's policy required this process of clearing Plaintiff's return-to-work request with Work Care. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 30-9, Bobrowski Feb. 28 Dep. Tr. at 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Another requirement in Teva's policy was for Defendants to meet with Plaintiff to help them understand and implement any reasonable accommodations that would allow Plaintiff to return to work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50-52.) Bobrowski contacted Plaintiff to meet with him, Rothweiler, and Muller in Kansas City in early November to ask more questions about Plaintiff's ability to do her job. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep. Tr. at 159.) The meeting was scheduled for November 3, 2015, and Plaintiff did not attend because she had jury duty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 160.) Plaintiff also declined any meeting because she believed that she had already satisfactorily explained to Bobrowski that she could perform her job. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 160-63.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff was then asked to attend a meeting at a hotel conference room in Chicago with Rothweiler, but Plaintiff declined to attend that meeting without her attorney and a court reporter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 196-97, 231, 354;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 30-8 at 50, Rothweiler Nov. 9, 2015, Email.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff ultimately did not meet with Rothweiler and had an exploratory surgery on her spine in November 2011 to determine whether she needed any further surgery on her spine.

SOMF \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Plaintiff could not return to work in 2015, and did not endeavor to return to work until April 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 202-04.) On August 7, 2015, Susan Duff, a Teva benefits analyst, informed Plaintiff that because she had exhausted her FMLA leave and had not been able to return to work, Teva was going to initiate a health insurance plan on her behalf pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (\"COBRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201161\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 30-8 at 36, Duff Aug. 7, 2015, Letter to Keen.) Plaintiff believes she was retaliated against by being placed on COBRA because TEVA \"had never done that before.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 28, Answer to Am. Compl. at 7-8.)

On July 21, 2015, Plaintiff filed more discrimination and retaliation claims against Defendants with the EEOC and IDHR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-57.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 72, Fourth Am. Compl.) On March 31,\n   2016, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81, Mot. for Sum. J. at 1). While that motion was fully briefed and the Court was in the process of resolving it, on October 24, 2016, Plaintiff filed another complaint in this District, which was assigned case number 16-cv-9964. (16-cv-9964, R. 1, Compl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   On March 3, 2017, the Court consolidated case 14-cv-9626 into case 16-cv-9964 and permitted Plaintiff to file an amended complaint that included all of her claims in both actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 25, Min. Entry.) On March 8, 2017, Plaintiff filed her first amended complaint in the later-filed case, which is now the operative complaint governing the two consolidated cases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 26, Am. Compl.) Plaintiff's first amended complaint alleges 37 counts against Defendants: discrimination against Plaintiff based on her disability in violation of the ADA and IHRA (Counts 1, 2, 12, 13, 20, 21, 23, 25, 28, 37); discrimination against Plaintiff on the basis of her gender in violation of Title VII and the IHRA (Counts 12, 14, 21, 22, 24, 26, 29, 36); retaliation against Plaintiff in violation of the ADA, Title VII, and IHRA (Counts 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 32, 35); violation of the IWA (Counts 9, 10, 11, 19, 31, 34); and retaliatory discharge under Illinois law for terminating Plaintiff after she filed claims with the IWCC (Count 33). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-173.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   On May 22, 2017, Defendants filed a \"supplemental\" motion for summary judgment, which renews their motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims that were consolidated from case number 14-cv-9626, and also moves for summary judgment on the additional claims filed in case number 16-cv-9964.

In their motion, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not put forth sufficient evidence of discrimination or retaliation for those claims to survive summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 30-1, Mem. at 1-2.) Defendants assert that they are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's IWA and retaliatory discharge claims because Plaintiff is not a \"whistleblower\" within the meaning of the IWA, and because she produces no evidence connecting her termination and her filing of workers' compensation claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 2-3, 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Finally, Defendants argue that the Court should enter summary judgment on Plaintiff's retaliation claims because Plaintiff provides no connection between any protected activity and an adverse employment action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-15.) In response, Plaintiff argues that numerous issues of fact preclude summary judgment.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 47, Mot. to Strike Reply.) Plaintiff contends that Bobrowski's affidavit filed with Defendants' reply brief includes intentionally false statements and facts not included with Defendants' original Local Rule 56.1 statement of facts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-10.) Plaintiff also argues that Bobrowski's affidavit is \"hearsay\" and contradicts his prior testimony as well as other documents that are part of the record. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-10.) Plaintiff argues that because of the claimed falsehoods and deficiencies with Bobrowski's affidavit, the Court should strike Bobrowski's affidavit and pages 1-15 of Defendants' reply brief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) Plaintiff also submits that the Court should sanction Defendants for allegedly \"attempting to completely alter [their] defense at the last minute\" and for acting in a \"dishonest\" manner before the Court.

The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Plaintiff does not genuinely dispute that one of the criteria for the SESS position was to demonstrate qualities of a \"leader,\" \"mentor,\" and \"role model.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-12 at 11-14, Promotional Guidelines;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203531518\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 89; Defs.'

Plaintiff also fails to provide any evidence that disputes the substantial evidence showing that she was not considered a leader, mentor, or role model by her superiors at the time she was being considered\n   for the SESS position. Stanek and Bischoff both had a strong belief that Plaintiff was not a leader, mentor, or role model, and they expressed these opinions to Muller at the time Plaintiff was being considered for the SESS position.

Plaintiff provides no evidence showing that Bischoff and Stanek were lying about their beliefs, or that their beliefs were pretextual. Instead she argues, without support, the fact that she was not considered a leader, mentor, or role model was an \"after-the fact\" explanation conjured up by Defendants to justify denying her the SESS position.

First, she argues that Bischoff's email stating that her \"medical limitations and leave of absence ... had a significant impact on\" her \"ability to perform this year at a high level\" was an \"admission\" that Defendants denied her the SESS position because of her disability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (14-cv-9626, R. 87, Mem. at 20-21.) This email, however, lacks any connection to Plaintiff's lack of leadership, mentor, or role model qualities, which was the stated reason for her denial of the SESS position. Bischoff's email instead related to Plaintiff's objective sales performance and failure to make the \"President's Club,\" which was not the proffered reason for denying her the SESS position. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351000\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/760/#p765\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-12 at 16, Bischoff Nov. 14, 2012, Email.) Additionally, any decision to designate Plaintiff as an SESS was not Bischoff's alone to make-that decision was made in conjunction with Teva's other sales directors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-10, Muller Dep. Tr. at 58.) There is no evidence indicating that Bischoff's thoughts in his email, even assuming they are evidence of pretext, were ever shared with the other sales directors in the Committee. Therefore, even if the Court accepted Plaintiff's argument that Bischoff's email is evidence of pretext, the Court would have to entertain several layers of speculation to conclude that the Committee denied her the position because of her disability, and speculation is not permitted on a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Springer v.

Bischoff's email, when viewed together with the other evidence, does not provide circumstantial evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that Plaintiff was denied the SESS position because of her disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Plaintiff also claims that she was far more qualified for the SESS position than other non-disabled men promoted to\n   SESS, but she fails to provide evidence that these men were similarly situated to Plaintiff in that they were not considered mentors, role models, or leaders by their superiors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   14-cv-9626, R. 86-2, Pl.'s SOAMF \u00b6\u00b6 24-26.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-16.) This evidence, however, is insufficient to raise a reasonable inference of pretext or create a genuine dispute of fact. Though Plaintiff was praised once for her leadership in a 2010 performance review, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-16, Stanek Dep. Tr. at 89),\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   it is undisputed that when it came time to consider her SESS candidacy, none of her supervisors considered her a leader, mentor, or role model. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-10, Muller Dep. Tr. at 109-10.) Without any evidence to dispute these facts or show that these opinions were pretext for a discriminatory motive, the Court finds that the evidence is not enough to support a reasonable inference of discrimination.

As noted above, Teva's 2013 Annual Incentive Plan states that \"[l]eaves of absence will impact incentive eligibility in proportion to the length of the leave, with the exception of an approved leave that qualifies under FMLA, the Parental Leave Policy and/or\n   the Military Leave Policy,\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 81-6 at 10, Annual Incentive Plan.) Plaintiff's leave in 2013 was not taken under the FMLA, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-5, Keen Oct. 14 Dep. Tr. at 62), and there is nothing to demonstrate that such leave was taken pursuant to Teva's parental or military leave policies. Defendants offer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for her reduced bonus and Plaintiff simply fails to produce any evidence showing that this reason was pretextual.\n   <em>\n    Ennin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265255\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/590/#p596\">\n    878 F.3d at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate as to her disability discrimination claims premised on her 2013 bonus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Denial of Excess Insurance Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   It is undisputed that Plaintiff did not automatically qualify for Defendants' excess insurance benefit. (14-cv-9626, R. 81-18, Rohach Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3, 5.) Thus, her claims fail because \"an adverse employment action, does not include an employer's refusal to grant an employee a discretionary benefit to which she is not automatically entitled[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Hottenroth v.

Instead, her testimony was simply that she \"should have gotten\" that benefit, without any further explanation. (14-cv-9626, R. 86-6, Keen Oct. 15 Dep. Tr. at 89-94.)

The 2014 Performance Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims based on her negative 2014 performance review also fail because she fails to present evidence showing that the negative review would not have happened \"but for\" her disability. The Court's \"concern is not the wisdom or fairness of the rating, but whether it was [the defendant's] honest appraisal of plaintiff's performance, rather than a product of or screen for discriminatory animus.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore-Fotso v.

Plaintiff claimed her poor 2014 performance review was based upon the inclusion of physicians that should have not been included in her sales quota calculation, but there is no evidence that Defendants included these physicians because of her disability. (14-cv-9626, R. 86-6 at 52-53, Keen Rebuttal.) Plaintiff was also criticized for failing to provide Rothweiler her developmental goals, but Plaintiff responded that she failed to do so because she was on medical leave at the time when other sales representatives developed those goals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53.) She does not present any evidence, however, showing that she was prevented from sending Rothweiler her goals after she returned from leave, or that Rothweiler's criticism would not have happened \"but for\" her disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff also complained in her rebuttal about Rothweiler criticizing her for not attending a \"selling skills\" class. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff, however, presents no evidence that her failure to attend the class was causally connected to her disability, as opposed to scheduling issues and miscommunications between Plaintiff and Rothweiler. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53-54.) Plaintiff complained that she also lacked the benefit of an interim review upon her return from leave, but again fails to offer evidence that Defendants would have given her an interim review if not for her disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Plaintiff's rebuttal to her performance review went on to attack Rothweiler's criticisms about her failure to collaborate with other sales representatives. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54, 57-58.) These attacks, however, do not present any evidence connecting Rothweiler's criticisms with her disability.

Rather, her rebuttal stated that \"some of these issues were above\" Rothweiler and \"were not the type of 'business issues' he was accustomed to dealing with[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Plaintiff's rebuttal then took issue with Rothweiler's criticisms regarding her failure to focus on customers that had the greatest impact on her sales numbers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She claimed, however, that this was due to management providing her a bad \"call plan,\" and she presents no evidence that Defendants would have given her a better call plan but for her disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55-57.) Plaintiff also claimed that Rothweiler's criticism relating to her lack of activity in Indiana was unfair because Defendants ignored her request to modify her Indiana territory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57.) This claim, however, is not supported by the record, which shows that Defendants considered her request at length and denied it because she refused to cooperate with Work Care and failed to provide documentation from her doctors stating that such a modification was necessary.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 86-6 at 58, Keen Rebuttal.) She does not point to any evidence, however, showing that Defendants outsourced management of employee medical leave issues because of her disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She claims that Rothweiler failed to provide her guidance on medical issues, but again provides no evidence that this failure was because of her disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59.) Additionally, as noted above, this was outside of Rothweiler's domain and instead Work Care's responsibility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Plaintiff also claimed that Rothweiler's criticisms related to her event programming and late expense reports were unfair because she experienced problems securing funding for events, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-60), but again she offers no evidence showing that Rothweiler's criticisms were based on her disability. Next, her rebuttal claimed that Muller was \"disruptive\" and \"demeaning towards\" her during an in-person discussion of the 2014 performance review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60.) Her rebuttal, however, did nothing more than disagree with Muller's criticisms, and it failed to provide a causal link between Muller's criticisms and her disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60-62.) Plaintiff's rebuttal states that, at the end of the in-person review, Muller brought up one of Plaintiff's requested accommodations, but Plaintiff provides no evidence connecting Muller, her disability, and the poor performance review, other than her opinion that \"[i]t\n   <em>\n    seems to me\n   </em>\n   that because I had requested the disability accommodation, I had to endure a wrongful review for 2014 not from my manager, but from my director.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62 (emphasis added).)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   14-cv-9626, R. 86-6 at 63-64, Keen Rebuttal.)

Plaintiff did not understand that Teva had an obligation to assign her a case manager, but instead she believed that the assignment of a case manager was \"the process [she] was supposed to go through as an employee.\" (16-cv-9964, R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep.

Thus, Plaintiff's claims cannot survive summary judgment because she offers no evidence that she was automatically entitled to a medical case manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Even if Defendants had an obligation to assign Plaintiff a medical case manager, there is no evidence that Defendants would have provided her one but for her disability. It is undisputed that Defendants' failure to assign her a medical case manager was not because of any reason individual to Plaintiff but simply part of Defendants' outsourcing of medical leave issues to Work Care. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 105-10.) Additionally, Plaintiff was ultimately assigned the equivalent of a medical case manager through Work Care.

(16-cv-9964, R. 26, Am. Compl. at 130.) She, however, fails to cite any evidence showing that she would have received such benefits if not for her disability. The record reflects, without any genuine dispute, that Plaintiff was denied these benefits for reasons unrelated to her disability, and that Defendants' third party vendors largely made these decisions instead of Defendants. Defendants' third party vendor that handled Teva's disability benefits program, Matrix, informed Plaintiff that she would not receive disability benefits because she made a claim for a workplace injury-an injury that was excluded under the disability benefits policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep. Tr. at 114-15.) Plaintiff did not receive workers' compensation payments because her workers' compensation claim was still pending. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115, 121.) Plaintiff simply fails to present any evidence that she would have received disability or workers' compensation benefits but for the fact that she was disabled, which is fatal to her claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monroe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264884\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/495/#p503\">\n    871 F.3d at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, she has not come forward with evidence identifying the person that denied her benefits. (16-cv-9964, R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep. Tr. at 126, 135.) She also fails to provide any evidence showing that the proffered reason for denying her disability and workers' compensation benefits was pretextual.\n   <em>\n    Ennin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265255\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/590/#p596\">\n    878 F.3d at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Requesting that Plaintiff Sign a Reimbursement Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Matrix informed Plaintiff that she could receive disability benefits if she entered into a reimbursement agreement with Teva that required her to waive certain legal and medical costs. (16-cv-9964, R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep. Tr. at 123-24, 129-30.) This conduct, however, cannot give rise to a disability discrimination claim. There is no adverse job action where a plaintiff fails to present evidence that her \"benefits would change\" because of the employer's action.\n   <em>\n    Douthit v.

Ind. Apr. 21, 2014). Here, there is no evidence\n   that Defendants' offer adversely changed her benefits. It is undisputed that Plaintiff failed to qualify for disability benefits because she had filed a workers' compensation claim; therefore, the reimbursement agreement would have provided her benefits she never had. (16-cv-9964, R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep. Tr. at 114.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 30-8 at 36, Duff Aug. 7, 2015, Letter to Keen.)

These claims, however, are simply unsupported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The record shows that Bobrowski contacted Plaintiff to meet with him, Rothweiler, and Muller in Kansas City in November 2015-not alone with Muller-to ask her more questions about her ability to work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep. Tr. at 159.) There is no evidence that Defendants planned for Muller be in a closed hotel room alone with Plaintiff. Plaintiff could not attend this November meeting because she had jury duty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 160.) Plaintiff also declined any meeting because she believed that she had already satisfactorily explained to Bobrowski that she could perform her job. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 160-63.) Plaintiff was then asked to attend a meeting at a hotel\n   <em>\n    conference room\n   </em>\n   in Chicago with\n   <em>\n    Rothweiler\n   </em>\n   , not Muller.

Given that there is no basis in the record for her claim that she was forced to meet with Muller alone in a hotel room, or for her claim that she had to \"meet her male supervisor alone in a hotel room at the Chicago O'Hare Hilton,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 26, Am.

Plaintiff, however, fails to put forth enough evidence to survive summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   First, Plaintiff's claim that Defendants refused to allow her to return to work in September 2015 is unsupported by the record, because she did not even seek medical clearance to return to work until October 2015. In September 2015, Plaintiff was attempting to return to work but was not ready to do so. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719179\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/629/#p634\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep. Tr. at 196-97.) On September 21, 2015, Plaintiff sent Rothweiler an email informing him that she performed tasks to prepare to return to work, such as reviewing unread emails, making preparations to retrieve her company car, and preparing her computer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 41-2 at 49, Keen Sept. 21, 2015, Email.) In response, Rothweiler indicated in an email two days later that Plaintiff had not yet returned to work and was \"required to abide by the company's return to work procedures.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 41-2 at 50, Rothweiler Sept. 23, 2015, Email.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   To comply with this directive, Plaintiff obtained a note from her doctor in October 2015 clearing her to return to work, but the doctor's note imposed significant limitations on her physical activity, such as: lifting no more than three pounds; driving no more than a total of four hours a day; \"sessions on the computer\" no longer than 20 minutes; no pushing, pulling, or carrying; and required physical therapy one to two times per week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep. Tr. at 153-54;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719179\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/629/#p634\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   41-2 at 46, Strnad Oct. 8, 2015, Note.) Work Care then sent Defendants its recommendations for Plaintiff's return-to-work accommodations on October 20, 2015, but these accommodations did not match with what Plaintiff's doctor recommended. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 41-2 at 47, Greaney Oct. 20, 2015, Email.) Specifically, Work Care recommended that Defendants not accommodate her to completely refrain from pushing, pulling, or carrying, but that they limit her to pushing, pulling, or carrying three pounds or less. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Work Care then asked Defendants to let it know if they \"are able to accommodate these restrictions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Work Care's recommendation left Defendants with significant questions about how to accommodate Plaintiff. The physical requirements of Plaintiff's job included daily driving, getting in and out of her car, carrying promotional materials, climbing and descending stairs, and walking to and from physicians' offices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 28, Answer to Am. Compl. at 3.) Defendants questioned how they could accommodate \"no lifting, pushing or pulling\" given Plaintiff's job requirements, and they questioned whether Plaintiff could lift a briefcase or computer case out of her car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 41-2 at 47, Greaney Oct. 20, 2015, Email.) Defendants received no response as to whether Plaintiff could lift a briefcase or computer case out of her car, and were informed that Plaintiff could perform the following activities: open a \"standard office or car door,\" lift any object three pounds or less, and that she could \"push or pull her IPAD with a three pound restriction,\" a statement that added little clarity to whether she could perform her essential job functions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants were also unclear as to how much time per day she could spend driving to fulfill her job duties because she stated that on certain days she may have to drive at least 30 minutes to attend physical therapy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, Work Care's recommendations offered no clarity as to the duration of these restrictions, stating that Plaintiff's doctors indicated that she would be \"evaluated monthly as needed if her symptoms should change ... [at which point] her restrictions would again be appropriately medically changed[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   With these significant questions regarding reasonable accommodations lingering, Defendants endeavored, pursuant to Teva's policy, to meet with Plaintiff so that they could understand and implement any reasonable accommodations Plaintiff needed upon her return. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 40-3, Bobrowski Feb. 28 Dep. Tr. at 50-52.) Bobrowski contacted Plaintiff about meeting with him, Rothweiler, and Muller in Kansas City in early November to ask more questions about Plaintiff's ability to do her job. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep. Tr. at 159.) As noted above, however, Plaintiff resisted these meetings and eventually did not meet with Defendants because of another surgery she underwent on November 24, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 198-201;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719179\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/629/#p634\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , R. 39, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.'

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep. Tr. at 204-05.) Plaintiff simply presents no evidence that Defendants refused to let her return to work during September 2015 or thereafter. Rather, the record reflects, without any genuine dispute, that Defendants were actively trying to accommodate Plaintiff but could not obtain the information they needed. Without any evidence of pretext to counter these legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons explaining the events that transpired from September 2015 through her termination, the Court grants summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ennin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265255\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/590/#p596\">\n    878 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   596 ;\n   <em>\n    Teruggi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3547275\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/654/#p660\">\n    709 F.3d at 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Plaintiff's claims also fail because she does not provide any evidence showing that in September 2015, she was \"qualified to perform the essential functions of her\n   job even with a reasonable accommodation,\"\n   <em>\n    Basden v.

There is no dispute that Plaintiff's job required daily driving, getting in and out of her car, carrying promotional materials, climbing and descending stairs, and walking to and from physicians' offices. (16-cv-9964, R. 28, Answer to Am. Compl. at 3.) As of October 2015, Plaintiff could not fulfill these requirements given that her doctor stated that she could not \"push, pull, or carry\" anything, much less carry promotional materials as required by her job. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep.

In 2011, Plaintiff's restrictions were as follows: working no more than 8 hours a day; no sitting, standing, or walking for more than four hours at a time; no lifting in excess of ten pounds with her right arm; and avoiding any pushing and pulling with her right arm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 41-2 at 27, Regan Dec. 22, 2011, Email.) These directives were far less restrictive than the ones Dr. Strnad proposed in 2015, and given the many additional surgeries Plaintiff had undergone since 2011, Defendants were under no obligation to blindly institute the same accommodations they had instituted in 2011.\n   <em>\n    Gratzl v. Office of Chief Judges of 12th, 18th, 19th, &amp; 22nd Judicial Circuits\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225113\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/674/#p681\">\n    601 F.3d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 681 (7th Cir. 2010) (\"An employer is not obligated to provide an employee the accommodation she requests or prefers, the employer need only provide some reasonable accommodation.\" (internal alteration omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Next, Plaintiff contends that Defendants knew she was able to perform her job by virtue of the video surveillance they conducted in September 2015. (16-cv-9964, R. 40, Pl.'s SOAMF \u00b6 10.) Plaintiff cites to no evidence in her statements of fact, however, from which a reasonable jury could infer that this was the case. Specifically, Plaintiff cites no evidence showing that the Teva employees responsible for clearing her return to work saw the surveillance footage before September 2015, nor does she produce any evidence showing that the video surveillance had any connection to the human resources department's decisions affecting her.

Additionally, there is no genuine dispute that the video surveillance occurred on or about September 9 and 10, 2015, and that after this time, Plaintiff had submitted a doctor's note that required Defendants to meet with her to ascertain the accommodations she needed, whether or not she appeared fit in video surveillance.

As noted above, there is no evidence that Defendants ever refused any of her requests for accommodations in 2013, as opposed to merely delaying their approval. Although Plaintiff requested to return to work with reasonable accommodations in June 2013, there is no dispute that Plaintiff's doctor informed Defendants that Plaintiff was scheduled for another surgery that had not yet occurred, and that she was to refrain from work until the surgery. (14-cv-9626, R. 81-12 at 16, May 8, 2013, Shapiro Letter.) When Plaintiff requested that Defendants accommodate her return following the surgery, they ultimately granted her request and allowed her to return to work with weight-lifting restrictions on September 12, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , R. 89, Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s SOAMF \u00b6 11.) Plaintiff complains that they did not allow her to return to work two weeks earlier, on August 29, 2013, (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 16-cv-9964, R. 26, Am.

Plaintiff's complaint here is not that Defendants' failed to accommodate her, but that she was displeased with Defendants' delay, which is insufficient. Accordingly, this claim cannot survive summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morris v.

First, this claim fails because it hinges on Dr. Greaney's purported denial of the sales territory modification. (16-cv-9964, R. 26, Am. Compl. at 111-17.) Dr. Greaney testified, however, that he did not deny Plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation. (14-cv-9626, R. 81-15, Greaney Aff. \u00b6 6.) Plaintiff offers no evidence to dispute this testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Even looking past Dr. Greaney and examining Defendants' conduct, Plaintiff's claim fails. There is no evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff attempted to engage in the requisite \"interactive communication process\" with Defendants or Dr. Greaney \"to determine a reasonable accommodation,\" or that Defendants were \"responsible for any breakdown that occurred in that process.\"\n   <em>\n    Ekstrand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755940\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/583/972/#p975\">\n    583 F.3d at 975-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As a result, her failure to accommodate claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Plaintiff's claim also fails because there is no evidence that any of Plaintiff's doctors, as opposed to Plaintiff herself, communicated with anyone at Teva or Work Care regarding her accommodation of a modified sales territory.

In addition to the several leaves of absence that Defendants approved, Defendants gave Plaintiff an upgraded vehicle, a rolling bag, a change of territory in 2011-2012, and modified work hours so that Plaintiff could visit her doctors and attend physical therapy. (16-cv-9964, R. 40-2, Keen March 29-30 Dep. Tr. at 46-56.) Indeed, the undisputed evidence shows that Plaintiff returned to work in 2013 with medical restrictions, and did not go on leave again until 2015 because of an injury she sustained while lifting a box, not because she had to work with doctors in Indiana. (14-cv-9626, R. 86-1, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOMF \u00b6 61.) Before that 2015 injury, she was able to perform the essential functions of her job with the accommodations Defendants had provided.
