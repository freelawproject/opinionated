Jain brought this case against Butler School District 53 (the \"District\"); the District's Board of Education and its members at the relevant time, Lou Paskalides, Rajiv Advani, Liz Chun, Todd Rusteberg, Hitesh Patel, Alan Hanzlik, and Alan Kumar (collectively, the \"Board\"); District Superintendent Heidi Wennstrom; Kelly Voliva, the former Principal of the District's Brook Forest Elementary School (\"Brook Forest\"); and Brook Forest Assistant Principal Lisa Owen (collectively, the \"District Defendants\"). Plaintiff has also sued Libby Massey and Caroline Roselli, who are attorneys who performed relevant work for the District (collectively, the \"Attorney Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court previously issued an opinion in this case dismissing the Fourth Amended Complaint. (ECF No. 134.) Currently before the Court is the Fifth Amended Complaint. In a nutshell, plaintiff asserts for herself and on behalf of her minor son \"A\" several claims that arise from the District's investigation and conduct stemming from a report that Jain and other District parents had engaged in unethical and deceptive practices in order to provide A and other students with unfair advantages in academic competitions (the National Geographic Bee (the \"GeoBee\") and the WordMasters Challenge (\"WordMasters\") ). At the relevant time, A was nine years old and a fifth-grade student at Brook Forest. Plaintiffs' claims are based on (1) an instance in which A was pulled out of his classroom after competing in the GeoBee and questioned by Wennstrom, Voliva, and Owen, who allegedly \"coerced a false confession\" from A that he had cheated on the GeoBee by receiving and reviewing the questions and answers in advance, (ECF No. 170, 5th Am. Compl. \u00b6 87); (2) emails that Wennstrom sent in February 2016 and June 2016 to District parents and employees about certain (unnamed) families' \"academic dishonesty\" and the District's investigation and findings; (3) the Board's retention of the Attorney Defendants' law firm, Robbins Schwartz, to investigate Jain's subsequent grievance, and the Attorney Defendants' conduct during the investigation; and (4) the sanctions imposed as a result of the investigation, namely, A's prohibition from participating in future academic competitions while a student in the District, and the fact that Jain was \"not permitted to\n   serve in any capacity as a parent volunteer\" for school-related contests, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121). The Court will set out the detailed allegations as necessary in its discussion of each claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Fifth Amended Complaint contains the following claims: a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claim for unlawful seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment, against Wennstrom, Voliva, and Owen (Count I); a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claim for violation of Fourteenth Amendment due process, against Wennstrom, Voliva, and Owen (Count II); unlawful seizure in violation of the Illinois Constitution, against Wennstrom, Voliva, and Owen (Count III); willful and wanton conduct, against all defendants (Count IV); intentional and reckless infliction of emotional distress, against all defendants (Counts V and VI); defamation per se, against Wennstrom (Count VII); and violation of Illinois's anti-bullying statute, 105 ILCS 5/27-23.7, against Wennstrom, Voliva, Owen, and the District (Count VIII). Counts I, II, III, and VIII are brought on behalf of A alone, and the remaining claims are brought by both plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The District Defendants move to dismiss the Fifth Amended Complaint, and the Attorney Defendants have separately moved to dismiss the claims against them. The motions are brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court construes the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, accepts as true all well-pleaded facts therein, and draws all reasonable inferences in plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Life Ins.

They cite no authority that supports this proposition, so it is rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Res Judicata\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The District Defendants assert that plaintiffs' federal claims are barred by res judicata because they could have been brought in a state-court administrative-review action that plaintiffs filed in June 2016, which was later dismissed with prejudice. In that action, plaintiffs sought reversal of the District's decision to bar A from participating in future academic contests, as well as the removal of references to the incident from A's school record. (ECF No. 186-1, Compl. for Admin. Review.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   One of the elements of res judicata that defendants must demonstrate is that there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parungao v.

Health Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276402\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/452/#p457\">\n    858 F.3d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 457 (7th Cir. 2017) (applying Illinois law).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   District Defendants fail to make this showing. Plaintiffs attach to their response a copy of the transcript of the hearing at which the state court explained that it was dismissing the administrative action \"as moot\" because, since the filing of the action, defendants had provided all the relief that was sought. (ECF No. 192-1.) Therefore, while the trial court deemed the dismissal as one \"with prejudice,\" it was decided on mootness grounds. Although the District Defendants attach to their supporting memorandum copies of their motions to dismiss the administrative-review action, which urged dismissal on the ground of mootness, they omit that fact from their discussion and ignore it in their reply. They simply reiterate that the state court's order reflected a dismissal \"with prejudice.\" But under Illinois law, a mootness finding is not a judgment on the merits, and it does not support the application of res judicata in a subsequent case.\n   <em>\n    Gassman v.

Plaintiffs allege that the Administrators unreasonably seized A by pulling him out of class and together questioning him for an hour and half about the alleged academic dishonesty. The District Defendants argue that these claims fail because \"[t]here is nothing unreasonable about summoning a student out of class and into the principal's office so that school officials could question him about possible academic dishonesty, a serious violation of school rules.\" (ECF No. 186, Dist.

As the Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   , because the deprivation of students' liberty is inherent in the educational process, there is an \"awkward fit\" between the Fourth Amendment and actions taken\n   by school officials, particularly when there is a seizure of a person, as opposed to a search and/or seizure of property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1014. The Court described the applicable standard as follows: \"[I]n the context of a public school, a teacher or administrator who seizes a student does so in violation of the Fourth Amendment only when the restriction of liberty is unreasonable under the circumstances then existing and apparent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Significantly, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   characterized a teacher's grabbing of the plaintiff's wrist as a seizure and did not set forth a modified approach to the foundational issue of when a student is \"seized\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.

The Third Circuit has also applied this traditional standard in the public-school context.\n   <em>\n    Shuman ex rel. Shertzer v. Penn Manor Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928306\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/141/#p147\">\n    422 F.3d 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 147 (3d Cir. 2005) (holding that a high school student was \"seized\" when the assistant principal told him to remain in a conference room for several hours and he was not free to leave).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the Court's view, plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to state a claim that the Administrators violated A's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures. Specifically, plaintiffs allege the following: Wennstrom received information from a parent in the District that A's parent had that year's GeoBee questions and was using them to prepare A for the competition. A few days later, on January 19, 2016, A participated in the first day of the GeoBee, but Assistant Principal Owen entered A's classroom later that day and told him that he needed to get up from his desk and come with her to Principal Voliva's office. A had never before been to the principal's office. When they arrived at Voliva's office, Voliva and Superintendent Wennstrom were there. All three administrators proceeded to ask A a series of questions, beginning with, \"Do you know why you're here?\" A replied that he did not. Wennstrom asked A about WordMasters and noted that he had had a perfect score in that competition. Then she asked him about how he had studied for the GeoBee; when he described various study aids that he had used and tried to explain how he had studied, he was told to answer only \"yes\" or \"no\" to the administrators' questions \"as if in a 'court of law.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wennstrom asked A how he had done on that morning's session of the GeoBee, and A said, \"fine,\" but that he had missed a question. Wennstrom then showed A questions from the morning rounds, asked him if his mother had shown him any of those questions, and said \"Do not lie. I know the truth.\" Owen added, \"Don't cry. You can't cry.\" A was nervous, scared, and shaking. None of the administrators acted as A's advocate or tried to protect him. They used \"mean\" and \"raised\" voices to suggest that A had done \"certain things that he did not do.\" They asked him \"dozens and dozens of questions,\" made him sit at a computer screen and review GeoBee questions, and repeatedly humiliated and belittled him. They did not offer A the opportunity to speak with one of his parents, nor were his parents informed of the meeting ahead of time. The Administrators \"intimidated [A]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   until he falsely made admissions.\" The questioning lasted approximately 1.5 hours. \"Effectively, [A] was presented the false choice of telling the truth and not being permitted to end the interrogation, or tell them what they wanted to hear (even when it was not true) in order to get out of their custody.\" (5th Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 47, 52-88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants dispute that A was questioned for 1.5 hours, but on a motion to dismiss, plaintiffs' allegations are taken as true. Defendants lose sight of that standard. The issue is whether the allegations are sufficient to indicate that A's seizure,\n   <em>\n    under the circumstances presented\n   </em>\n   , was objectively unreasonable-or, as stated in\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   , whether it reasonably could be found that the Administrators' actions were \"disproportionate to the interference with the educational process that the situation presented,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415013\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/68/1010/#p1013\">\n    68 F.3d at 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, a nine-year-old student was allegedly pulled from class and aggressively questioned for an hour and a half about academic dishonesty that was allegedly initiated by his parent, and this questioning was conducted simultaneously by\n   <em>\n    three\n   </em>\n   high-ranking administrators, including the District Superintendent. Those administrators allegedly intimidated and belittled A; told him he could only answer \"yes\" or \"no\"; and told him that he could not cry. That alleged conduct is viewed in light of the situation, which did not involve disruptive behavior or the need to restore order among students (such as an imminent fight between students, as in\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   ) or other exigent circumstances (such as the need to administer breath tests to students for blood alcohol concentration prior to entering a school function, as in\n   <em>\n    Ziegler v. Martin County School District\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055806\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/1309/\">\n    831 F.3d 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2016) ). The District Defendants assert that \"[w]ithout questioning plaintiff A, the School District would have been unable to conduct a thorough investigation into the cheating allegations.\" (Dist. Defs.' Mem. Supp. Mot. at 5.) That conclusion is not evident from the alleged facts, and, more importantly, the argument misses the point: it is the\n   <em>\n    manner\n   </em>\n   in which A was allegedly seized and questioned, in the absence of exigent circumstances, that gives rise to plaintiffs' claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Amended Complaint contains sufficient facts to support A's claim that the Administrators violated his Fourth Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jaythan E. v.

Compl. \u00b6 96.) Hanzlik appointed Massey to serve as Complaint Investigator, and Massey told Jain that she would be \"independent in her investigation\" and that Roselli was going to serve as a \"resolution facilitator.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98-100.) Unbeknown to the plaintiffs, Roselli had \"played a key role\" in Wennstrom's initial investigation and in deciding the sanctions against plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102.) Massey later issued a report to the Board concluding that A had \"cheated\" on the GeoBee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109.) The report was incomplete, incorrect, and \"sought to support\" Wennstrom's misconduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112, 114.) The Board voted to affirm Massey's findings as well as the sanctions that were previously issued by Wennstrom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Attorney Defendants contend that they did not owe plaintiffs any duty that they could have breached. The Board hired the Attorney Defendants. Plaintiffs were not their clients, and there are no facts alleged from which the Court can infer that these defendants owed plaintiffs any duty or that they had any special relationship with plaintiffs that gave rise to a duty. Plaintiffs argue that because the Board \"sits in trust for the entire community,\" which includes plaintiffs, the Attorney Defendants, \"as agents of the Board,\" owe plaintiffs the same duty of care that the Board owes them. (ECF No. 192, Pls.' Resp. Defs.' Mots. at 24.) Plaintiffs cite no authority whatsoever for this proposition, so it is rejected.

Intentional and Reckless Infliction of Emotional Distress (Counts V and VI)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In Counts V and VI, plaintiffs allege claims against all defendants for intentional and reckless infliction of emotional distress. Under Illinois law, such claims have three elements: \"First, the conduct involved must be truly extreme and outrageous. Second, the actor must either intend that his conduct inflict severe emotional distress, or know that there is at least a high probability that his conduct will cause severe emotional distress. Third, the conduct must in fact cause severe emotional distress.\"\n   <em>\n    Cairel v.

The Court agrees. For conduct to be \"extreme and outrageous,\" it must \"go beyond all bounds of decency and be considered intolerable in a civilized community.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258389\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/823/#p835\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258389\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/823/#p835\">\n    at 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While some of the conduct alleged in the Fifth Amended Complaint could be described as unreasonable and possibly unconstitutional, it cannot be said to go beyond all bounds of decency as necessary for an infliction of emotional distress claim. Furthermore, the plaintiffs fail to set forth sufficient factual allegations of resulting\n   <em>\n    severe\n   </em>\n   emotional or psychiatric distress.

Defamation Per Se (Count VII)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In Count VII, plaintiffs allege that Wennstrom defamed them by sending emails to District parents and staff on February 8, 2016 and June 15, 2016 that described the District's investigation and stated that \"certain families had engaged in academic dishonesty\" with respect to the GeoBee and WordMasters. (5th Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 91, 124, 195-96.)

Wennstrom disregards this exception and fails to acknowledge the allegations in the remainder of paragraphs 92 and 128.

Bullying-Prevention Statute (Count VIII)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs allege in Count VIII that the conduct of Wennstrom, Voliva, Owen, and the District with regard to A violated 105 ILCS 5/27-23.7, a provision of the School Code titled \"Bullying Prevention.\" The introductory policy statement of the statute provides that \"[n]o student shall be subjected to bullying\" while in school, on school property, or during school-related activities. 105 ILCS 5/27-23.7(a). The statute requires Illinois school districts to create, implement, and communicate anti-bullying policies. 105 ILCS 5/27-23.7(b), (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendants argue that the Court should dismiss Count VIII because the statute does not create a private right of action. It is true that the statute does not contain an express right of action, but, as plaintiffs point out, an implied right of action may exist. The parties did not cite, and the Court's own research did not yield, any Illinois state-court decisions that address this issue. Therefore, the Court believes that it is prudent to adopt the approach set out in\n   <em>\n    Eilenfeldt v. United C.U.S.D. # 304 Board of Education\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:12-CV-04029-SLD-JAG,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2012248080\">\n    2013 WL 12248080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (C.D. Ill. Mar. 25, 2013), in which the court was confronted with the same issue and declined to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over the claim.

Because Illinois law on claims under the bullying-prevention statute is undeveloped, a ruling from this Court on whether the statute implies a private right of action \"would require significant policy determinations as to the legislative intent behind the statute and the inherent role of the statute in remedying bullying in schools.\"\n   <em>\n    Eilenfeldt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2012248080\">\n    2013 WL 12248080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.

The motion is denied as to Counts I and III, plaintiff A's claim against defendants Wennstrom, Voliva, and Owen for unconstitutional seizure, and as to Count IV as asserted against the District Defendants. (Count IV as asserted against the Attorney Defendants, however, is dismissed without prejudice.) The motion is granted as to the remaining counts. Count II is dismissed with prejudice, and Counts V, VI, VII, and VIII are dismissed without prejudice. Defendants Libby Massey and Caroline Roselli's motion to dismiss plaintiff's Fifth Amended Complaint [187] is granted, and those defendants are terminated from this case. A status hearing is set for March 29, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. The Clerk of Court is directed to update the docket to reflect the correct spelling of the last names of defendants Lou Paskalides and Todd Rusteberg.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The Court must apply Illinois's res judicata law to determine the preclusive effect of the state-court proceedings on plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Brown v.
