PALLMEYER, United States District Judge\n   The short-term cash management firm Sentinel Management Group, Inc. collapsed and filed for bankruptcy in August 2007 at the outset of the financial crisis. Required by federal law to segregate its clients' funds and invest in only the highest grade government securities, Sentinel instead pledged the securities in its clients' accounts as collateral for loans from the Bank of New York-which Sentinel then used to buy even more securities on its own \"House\" account for the benefit of corporate insiders. As credit markets tightened in the summer of 2007, Sentinel found itself unable to both repay the Bank's loan and return its clients' money on demand. All told, Sentinel cost its investors more than $600 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Dozens of lawsuits were filed in the wake of Sentinel's failure. Many are ongoing to this day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant UBS Securities, LLC is a former customer of Sentinel. In March 2007, Sentinel transferred $108 million to UBS, which included $14.4 million characterized as \"cumulative interest.\" (UBS Securities, LLC's Memorandum in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment [97] (\"UBS's Opening Br.\"), 1.) The Plaintiff in this case, Frederick J. Grede, is the Liquidation Trustee for the Sentinel Liquidation Trust. The Trustee claims that Sentinel acted with actual \"intent to hinder, delay, and defraud\" its other creditors when making the pre-petition transfer to UBS, and argues that the cumulative interest payment represents \"false profits.\" (Complaint [1] in No. 09-BR-521, 18-19) (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A) ). Accordingly, the Trustee seeks to avoid the transfer and return the $14.4 million to the Liquidation Trust. UBS has moved for summary judgment, arguing that the Trustee has alleged only a \"general scheme to defraud,\" and not fraudulent intent with respect to the specific transfer at issue. (UBS's Opening Br. 2.) UBS asserts that the cumulative interest was \"neither 'false' nor 'profits,' \" but rather the proceeds of Sentinel's legitimate investment activity-which Sentinel properly paid to UBS in fulfillment of its legal and contractual obligations.

Overview of Sentinel's Business and Bankruptcy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sentinel Management Group, Inc. was an Illinois corporation that provided cash-management services for institutional investors, hedge funds, and individuals. (UBS Securities LLC's Local Rule 56.1 Statement of Uncontested Material Facts [98] (\"UBS SoF\"), \u00b6 3.) Its primary business consisted of making safe, short-term investments of the excess cash held by other investment firms called futures commission merchants (\"FCMs\")-brokers that execute trades in the futures and options markets and that are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Although Sentinel did not itself execute futures or options trades,\n   it too was registered as an FCM with the CFTC as a prerequisite for managing the funds of typical FCMs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bloom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124465,12272634\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/243/\">\n    846 F.3d at 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing Sentinel's business model as \"unique\" and operating \"like a mutual fund, pa[ying] a return based on profits and losses.\") Importantly, this meant that Sentinel was governed by the same securities law and regulations as its clients. (UBS's SoF \u00b6 4.) These regulations required Sentinel to maintain its clients' funds in segregated accounts, and limited Sentinel's use of those funds to \"investments [in] certain high-quality government and corporate securities\" such as U.S. Treasury bills. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10) (citing 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6d(b) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.25\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sentinel offered a variety of investment programs to account for different investment objectives and to comply with various regulations, but ultimately pooled all of its clients' assets into one of three distinct groups. (UBS's SoF \u00b6 10) Sentinel called these groups SEG 1, SEG 2, and SEG 3. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When advertising its investment options to potential customers, Sentinel referred to the SEG 1 group as the \"125 Portfolio\" (named after CFTC Rule 1.25) and the SEG 3 group as the \"Prime Portfolio.\"\n   <em>\n    Bloom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124465,12272634\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/243/\">\n    846 F.3d at 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . SEG 1 was more conservative and intended for FCMs investing their own customers' funds, while SEG 3 offered a higher rate of return at slightly greater risk and was open to Sentinel's non-FCM clients: hedge funds, individuals, and FCMs investing their proprietary, non-customer funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124465,12272634\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/243/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Clients who invested money into one or more SEGs were promised \"an undivided, pro-rata beneficial interest in the pool of securities\" purchased using the funds within each SEG. (UBS's SoF \u00b6 12.) This meant that Sentinel's investors did not own specific securities outright, but saw their funds \"exchanged for securities and interest-bearing cash through a process that Sentinel called 'allocation' \" and instead held indirect shares of their respective SEG based on their level of investment.\n   <em>\n    Grede v.

(Trustee's Statement of Additional Material Facts in Opposition to UBS's SoF [112] (\"Trustee's SoAF\"), \u00b6 4.)

As acknowledged by the Seventh Circuit, the original overnight loan arrangement \"did not violate segregation requirements[:] When a customer cashed out, the amount needed in segregation dropped by the amount lent by the Bank via the line of credit.\"\n   <em>\n    BONY I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052307,3697815\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/660/\">\n    728 F.3d at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sentinel maintained two types of accounts with the Bank of New York to facilitate this arrangement: segregated accounts and non-segregated accounts. Nine segregated accounts held different asset classes-cash, government securities, and DTC (corporate) securities\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   -for each of SEGs 1, 2, and 3. (Trustee's SoAF \u00b6 8.) The four non-segregated accounts included Sentinel's House cash account, as well as several clearing accounts through which Sentinel bought, sold, and transferred securities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.) Sentinel also maintained six additional segregated accounts for holding clients' cash at JP Morgan, which will be discussed further below.

These two accounts operated together to clear transactions and to secure the overnight loan from the Bank. (McCloskey Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 64-67.) The SEN account was the clearing account and only held securities or cash during the day. Every evening, Sentinel would zero out the SEN account and transfer securities to the night-time SLM account to secure the overnight loan. At some point, however, Sentinel began securing the overnight loan using the assets in all of the non-segregated accounts, not just the overnight SLM account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    BONY I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052307,3697815\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/660/\">\n    728 F.3d at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Sentinel's actual use of the overnight loan and its customers' funds bore little resemblance to their purported uses.\n   <em>\n    Bloom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124465,12272634\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/243/\">\n    846 F.3d at 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

One of the Trustee's expert witnesses, James Feltman, reviewed selected customer accounts from 2005 to 2007, and concluded that \"Sentinel allocated interest income to customers by groups at a rate of return that they made up, and which they expected would approximate the amount earned by securities reportedly held in each customer's account.\" (2013 Omnibus Feltman Rep. \u00b6 96.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   During the SEC's civil enforcement case against Sentinel and its officers, VP Charles Mosley conceded the same point.\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

Sentinel's high-risk trading in the house account generated higher returns than the more conservative 125 Portfolio. The Prime Portfolio, which was slightly riskier than the 125 Portfolio, likewise generated\n   higher returns. Sentinel redistributed some of these returns from the house account and the Prime Portfolio to the 125 Portfolio, effectively using the riskier accounts to subsidize the more conservative account. With these inflated rates of return in the 125 Portfolio, Sentinel could attract new clients by outperforming its competition. Indeed, it advertised these rates in its marketing material and on its website.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Sentinel employees testified that they doctored the yield rates on a daily basis from 2004 until the company's bankruptcy in 2007. Instead of paying customers the interest they actually earned, Sentinel employees divvied up interest payments according to the instruction of Bloom or Charles Mosley. Bloom in fact created a spreadsheet to help employees calculate how to redistribute funds, which was called the \"Daily Yield/Rate Calculation.\" The spreadsheet listed both the actual interest earned by customers' securities and the rate set by Sentinel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The rate setting often favored the customers in \"Seg 1\" (125 Portfolio). For example, on December 7, 2006, the interest actually earned by Seg 1 was $96,942.63. After the rate manipulation by Sentinel, that portfolio was allocated $103,832.46. On that same day, Seg 3 (Prime Portfolio) actually earned $148,005.09 in interest and the house account earned $17,949.85.

Instead, the Trustee argues that because Sentinel was \"substantially undersegregated\" when it paid the $14.4 million in cumulative interest to UBS on March 30, 2007, it \"did not have sufficient funds to return all of its customers' initial investments, let alone interest on those investments.\" (Trustee's Resp. Br. 21-22.) \"Simply put,\" the Trustee asserts, \"there was no interest to pay UBS,\" and the entire $14.4 million therefore constitutes \"false profits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Complaint 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   UBS challenges this characterization of the interest earned on its SEG 1 account. (UBS's Opening Br. 8.) At the very least, UBS contends that the Trustee cannot possibly prove his blanket denial of the cumulative interest's legitimacy: \"the Trustee has failed to plead or show any facts about the specific amount of alleged 'false profits' transferred to UBS on each of the hundreds of days that UBS invested customer funds in Sentinel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) In a related dispute,\n   <em>\n    Grede v. FCStone,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-CV-136 (the \"\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   test case\"), UBS's expert Frances McCloskey concluded that Sentinel acted appropriately when paying interest to its customers. (McCloskey Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 273-277.) McCloskey's \"analysis of the securities' yields and returns paid to customers revealed that returns from securities on customer statements provided the overwhelming majority of the return paid to customers, but that customer\n   returns in most groups were supplemented in small amounts by Sentinel's House repo portfolio.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 274.) McCloskey found no instance in which Sentinel redirected returns from one SEG to another, rather than from Sentinel's own funds to the customer SEGs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) McCloskey also repeatedly emphasizes that \"Sentinel does not display any of the characteristics that define a Ponzi or Ponzi-like scheme,\" but was \"engaged in a legitimate business [ ] providing investment management to its customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 269-272.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   UBS also argues that the Trustee himself has conceded the legitimacy of the cumulative interest through earlier testimony from its expert James Feltman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-14.) During his deposition in the\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   test case, Feltman testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Question: Was there anything improper with Sentinel accruing interest and allocating it to customers on a daily basis?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   FELTMAN: Not from the standpoint of the process. The actual procedure that Sentinel used or the procedure that Sentinel used incorporated examining the entire portfolio of securities it held including interest on repos and taking into account the daily interest charges on the loan and putting that into the overall calculus on a gross and net basis, but\n   <strong>\n    at the end of the day Sentinel made, in my view, a significant attempt to match the interest accrued and allocated to customer accounts to the actual earnings that the securities would have reflected for those customers.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (Dep. of James Feltman in\n   <em>\n    Grede v. FCStone,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-CV-136 (\"\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   Feltman Dep.\"), at 219:4-20, Ex. 22 to UBS's SoF [98-22].) Feltman stood by that conclusion when he testified at the\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   trial. (UBS's SoF \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Trustee contends that this quotation was taken out of context, and that Feltman's deposition taken as a whole supports the position he took in his reports: that \"interest was fraudulently calculated and paid using the profits on the entire comingled pool, and that the manner in which Sentinel credited interest was designed to avoid suspicions about its illegal activity.\" (Trustee's Resp. Br. 13.) Immediately after making the statement quoted above, Feltman pointed out that \"to the extent that withdrawals included interest earned by a customer, the actual payment of interest was made with comingled funds\" because those funds were repeatedly routed into and through the SEN clearing account. (\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   Feltman Dep. 222:4-10) (discussing proof 14 of the 2013 Omnibus Feltman Report which states: \"Interest income was paid to customers with cash from the comingled [SEN account] or other customers' deposits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55.) The Trustee also notes Feltman's testimony in the\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   bench trial. When asked about the interest payments, Feltman stated: \"I [ ] concluded that that the interest allocations were items that the company ... created and were not derived from the securities that were on that customer statement for the day\"; \"they're estimates[,] ... what Sentinel thought their customers would expect\"; and that Sentinel allocated interest from the whole pool, not the securities identified on customer statements. (\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 581:5-8, 589:10-12, 591:13-19.) The Trustee concludes that the portion of Feltman's deposition testimony offered by UBS merely shows \"that Sentinel tried really hard to appear legitimate\"-not that the alleged profits were not fraudulent.

(UBS's SoF \u00b6 11.) UBS acquired ABN AMRO's interest in Sentinel on September 30, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.) For the duration of its relationship with Sentinel, UBS was assigned to Group 7 of Sentinel's SEG 1 portfolio. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.) Like that of all Sentinel's clients, UBS's position was governed by an Investment Agreement that authorized Sentinel to purchase and sell securities for UBS's account and required Sentinel to hold those assets in segregation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.) Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, UBS was entitled to redeem its investment at any time.

(Ex. 40, E-mail from William Frothingham to Robert Gaffney, et al., of 3/13/07, Ex. 40 to Trustee's SoAF [112-42]; UBS Investment Analyses, Ex. 41 to Trustee's SoAF [112-43].) Two weeks later, on March 28, 2007, UBS employee Gregory Hardiman called Sentinel's Sales Manager, Steven Stitle, to discuss pulling UBS's funds from SEG 1. (Trustee's SoAF \u00b6 31) (citing Administrator_BloomWAV_42A0, Ex. 42 to Trustee's SoAF [112-44]; Transcript of phone call between Gregory Hardiman and Steven Stitle of 3/28/07 (\"Hardiman Call Tr.\"), Ex. 43 to Trustee's SoAF [112-45].) Their conversation was recorded by Sentinel. Hardiman told Stitle that \"[UBS had] made a decision internally to exit the positions\" but that UBS would give Sentinel an opportunity to explain how Sentinel was earning their yields in the SEG 1 fund and consider re-entering the fund in the future. (Hardiman Call Tr. 2:9-12.) Stitle asked Hardiman if UBS had any specific concerns, and Hardiman replied that \"I think it's more of a ... lack of understanding of [the] detailed positions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:5-6.) Hardiman continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   My understanding is [Sentinel's] rates of return are fairly high relative to what anybody out there is getting at the moment[,] ... historically. I'd like to understand how you're [ ] achieving that....

Stitle offered to \"put together a team probably with the CEO and myself and ... just shoot out there and do a little dog and pony show,\" but Hardiman insisted that any future presentation \"has to be specific to the portfolio\" and that he \"would like to see the portfolio manager in there ... explaining what he's doing and how.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:10-21.) Hardiman also provided a list of concerns he had regarding SEG 1:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   What are the risks, what-where are you at within 125 [the 125 Portfolio, a.k.a. SEG 1], where are you getting the pickup and ... how. So are you going out double A, you know, going all ... the way out on the credit spectrum in terms of 125 and all the way out in terms of duration.... You know, what is it. And-and I believe we'd like to understand that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:17-6:2.) Stitle assured Hardiman that \"those are questions we can answer fairly easily\" and that he would contact Hardiman again in a month to set up the presentation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:16-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Immediately after the phone call, Stitle e-mailed Eric Bloom and Charles Mosley stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Just got off the phone with Greg Hardiman @ UBS. They are pulling the $ $ $ because they are not comfortable with how we obtain the yields we post without incurring some \"unknown\" level of risk. Greg agreed to give us a chance to explain how we achieve this but is expecting a Q &amp; A session in Stamford with you, me &amp; Charles. I suspect the bulk of the questions will be directed to Charles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Conversation was slightly more positive than I expected. Bottom line is that they can't stay invested in a vehicle that they don't fully understand &amp; are [sic] comfortable with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   (E-mail from Steven Stitle to Eric Bloom and Charles Mosley of 3/28/07 (\"Stitle E-mail\"), Ex. 44 to Trustee's SoAF [112-46].) The meeting never occurred. On March 30, 2007-two days after the call-UBS withdrew its entire stated account balance from Sentinel: $108,387,950.97. This amount included the $14,401,341.15 worth of cumulative interest credited to UBS's account that the Trustee now seeks to avoid. (Trustee's SoAF \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Later, in August 2007, Hardiman discussed the news of Sentinel's then-recent collapse in an e-mail to a coworker: \"Hope people realize the value added by exiting the Sentinel fund ... Don't think people really appreciate/understand what could have been and the headache, potential issues/losses avoided here. People should be aware that we performed due diligence on the fund and made an informed decision to exit.\" (E-mail from Gregory Hardiman to Kevin Maloney of 8/16/07, Ex. 46 to Trustee's SoAF [112-48].) In another e-mail summarizing UBS's financial position in light of the overall market downturn over the summer of 2007, Hardiman repeated his claim that \"[a]fter due diligence performed, we exited Sentinel in Q107, avoiding a potentially large loss.\" (E-Mail from Gregory Hardiman to James Buckland, et al., of 8/23/07, Ex. 47 to Trustee's SoAF [112-49].) Another employee then talked up Hardiman's work to others, stating: \"We inherited a $100mm placement with Sentinel with the ABN merger that Greg decided to exit in Q1 due to his concerns about the funds.\" (E-mail from John Laub to Daniel Coleman, et al., of 8/23/07, Ex. 48 to Trustee's SoAF [112-50].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The parties dispute the relevance and meaning of this evidence. The Trustee argues that these internal communications reveal Sentinel's fraudulent intent when making the transfer, as the phone calls and emails establish that UBS was \"suspicious\" of the generous returns Sentinel was earning, and created an incentive for Sentinel's managers to cover up their segregation violations and fraudulent interest calculations by paying UBS all of what Sentinel (wrongfully) said UBS was owed. (Trustee's Resp. Br. 14-15.) UBS argues that the communications are irrelevant as they only speak to UBS's intent when\n   <em>\n    requesting\n   </em>\n   the transfer, and that, at best, they merely \"confirm that the reason UBS closed its account with Sentinel was because it was unfamiliar with Sentinel and did not fully understand Sentinel's investment process.\" (UBS's Resp. to Trustee's SoAF \u00b6\u00b6 31-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In addition to providing Sentinel and UBS's internal communications regarding the transfer, the Trustee also supplies evidence regarding the origin of the money Sentinel used to pay UBS. The Trustee, through an expert witness, Anne Rasho\n   Vanderkamp, claims that the money used to pay off UBS's account did not come from an account segregated for SEG 1. (Decl. of Anne Rasho Vanderkamp \u00b6 5 (\"Vanderkamp Decl.\"), Ex. 45 to Trustee's SoAF [112-47].) Rather, the money originated in a SEG 3 cash account-meaning that Sentinel paid UBS with other customers' money. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As mentioned above, Sentinel maintained six segregated cash holding accounts at JP Morgan in addition to its numerous accounts at the Bank of New York. (Trustee's SoAF \u00b6 10; McCloskey Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 53, 58-59.) The parties agree on most characteristics of these accounts. The JP Morgan cash accounts \"were non-transactional, meaning that their sole purpose was to hold customer cash in segregation.\" (Trustee's SoAF \u00b6 10.) Three of them were non-interest bearing; the other three did bear interest and were linked to a corresponding non-interest account. (McCloskey Rep. \u00b6 58.) One of the non-interest bearing, segregated accounts was called the \"Sentinel Management Group, Inc. III-1.2\" account, number 304-653403 (the \"JP Morgan SMG III account\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On March 30, 2007, Sentinel transferred $120 million from the JP Morgan SMG III account to the SEN clearing account at the Bank of New York. (Trustee's SoAF \u00b6 33.) From there, Sentinel transferred $127.6 million from the SEN account to Sentinel's SEG 1 segregated cash account at the same bank. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Sentinel then wired the full $108,387,950.97 redemption payment from that cash account to UBS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The parties' factual agreement ends there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Trustee alleges that the cash in the JP Morgan SMG III account (and its paired interest-bearing account) was supposed to remain segregated for the benefit of Sentinel's SEG 3 customers. (Trial Tr. in\n   <em>\n    Grede v. FCStone,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-CV-136 (\"\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr.\"), 205, 708, Ex. 4 to Trustee's SoAF [112-4]; Deposition of Jeff Logan in\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

UBS was not a SEG 3 customer. The Trustee claims that the other two sets of JP Morgan accounts were segregated for SEGs 1 and 2, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Trustee also claims that the March 30, 2007, cash transfers that facilitated Sentinel's payment to UBS left SEG 3 undersegregated by $386,800,000-with just 45% of the assets allocated to SEG 3 on paper actually being held in segregation for the benefit of SEG 3's investors. (Vanderkamp Decl. \u00b6 9.) After the transfer to UBS, SEG 1 itself was also left undersegregated by 29%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   UBS responds that the Trustee mischaracterizes the nature of the JP Morgan accounts. UBS asserts that, despite the name \"SMG III,\" the JP Morgan SMG III account was open to cash from\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   of SEGs 1 or 3. (UBS's Resp. to Trustee's SoAF \u00b6 8.) \"While Sentinel's internal account naming labeled that account as SEG 3 [or \"III\"], the account was not used that way.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.) Rather, SMG III was the third account opened with JP Morgan, and duplicates the role held by another account-number 323-961355, \"Sentinel Management Group, Inc.-1.20\" (\"SMG 1.20\")-which was already serving both SEG 1 and SEG 3. (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 33; McCloskey Rep. \u00b6 58.) UBS asserts that the Trustee's position represents a continued misunderstanding of the nature of Sentinel's\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   investment scheme: \"the Trustee fails to acknowledge that the key function of the daily allocation of securities [is] that all deposits on account are invested in a pool of securities, the composition of which is flexible from day-to-day in order to free up cash.\" (UBS's Resp. to Trustee's SoAF \u00b6 33) (citing McCloskey Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 100-112, 216-217.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   UBS supports its view of the true nature of the JP Morgan SMG III account with\n   further evidence from its expert report by Frances McCloskey in the\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   test case. According to that report, of the three sets of paired accounts at JP Morgan, only one set was reserved for a single SEG-and that set was titled \"Sentinel Management Group, Inc.-30.7\" and segregated only for SEG 2 funds. (McCloskey Rep. \u00b6 58) (stating that the accounts were so named because they were \"compliant with CFTC Rule 30.7 (i.e. for SEG 2 cash).\") UBS also notes findings from a 2006 National Futures Association (\"NFA\") audit of Sentinel's accounts, in which the auditors acknowledged the pooling of SEG 1 and SEG 3 cash in the SMG 1.20 account but did not cite it as a violation requiring corrective action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (7/24/06 Summary of Audit Findings (\"July 2006 NFA Audit\"), Ex. 11 to UBS's Resp. to Trustee's SoAF [122-1].)

These other transfers were substantially smaller that UBS's, ranging in amount from $1.2 to $11.2 million, but UBS contends they demonstrate that the March 30 UBS transfer was simply business as usual. (UBS's SoF \u00b6 22; UBS Securities, LLC's Reply in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment [120] (\"UBS's Reply Br.\"), 13 n.5.) The early 2007 transactions occurred several months before Sentinel's repo counterparties returned hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of high-risk, illiquid securities and demanded hard cash in return-the event that ultimately brought down the firm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FCStone I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4029296,4240940\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/244/\">\n    746 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   249-49 ;\n   <em>\n    Bloom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124465,12272634\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/243/\">\n    846 F.3d at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(UBS's Reply Br. 23.) As a result, UBS claims, \"there is no evidence that Sentinel did anything unlawful or extraordinary to satisfy UBS's redemption request, or that it had a detrimental impact on Sentinel's other customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Early Bankruptcy Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Sentinel filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy\n   Code on August 17, 2007. After a flurry of early litigation and distributions authorized by the bankruptcy court, the relevant stakeholders approved a plan to liquidate Sentinel's remaining assets on December 11, 2008. (Order Approving Chapter 11 Plan [1257] in\n   <em>\n    In re Sentinel Management\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-BR-14987, 1.) The Liquidation Plan was approved over the objections of numerous SEG 1 investors (the \"SEG 1 Objectors\"), many of whom were later involved in the\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   test litigation to sort out the issues arising under the Plan. Because UBS closed its account ahead of Sentinel's bankruptcy, it never filed claims against the estate and so was not involved with the Plan's approval. (UBS's SoF \u00b6 31.) As a result, most of the provisions in the Liquidation Plan are not relevant to this dispute. UBS highlights one portion, however, as evidence that the Trustee should be judicially and collaterally estopped from challenging the legitimacy of the cumulative interest as \"false profits.\" (UBS's Opening Br. 21-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   At a hearing prior to the Plan's approval, the Trustee argued in favor of \"computing customer claims based on account balances as of the last date customers saw them [August 13, 2007], minus any withdrawals that they had up through the petition date.\" (Transcript of Proceedings on 8/13/08 (\"8/13/08 Hearing Tr.\"), 35:13-16, Ex. 20 to UBS's SoF [98-20].) The Trustee's proposal prevailed: the approved Liquidation Plan stated that \"[f]or the purposes of calculating Adjusted Percentage Recoveries and Percentage Recoveries, and for purposes of making Initial Distributions and establishing reserves, each Class 3 Customer Claim shall equal the amount listed as 'Net Equity' on such Holder's Customer Account Statements dated August 13, 2007.\" (Fourth Amended Plan of Liquidation [1251] in\n   <em>\n    In re Sentinel Management Group,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-BR-14987 (\"Liquidation Plan\"), \u00a7 4.4.) Under this calculation, claims included the interest that appeared on customer accounts. (UBS's Opening Br. 21, 23.) UBS argues that the Trustee is therefore estopped from taking the \"wholly inconsistent position\" that the cumulative interest constituted \"false profits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Trustee responds that UBS selectively misreads his testimony and misstates the actual terms of the Liquidation Plan. (Trustee's Resp. Br. 30.) Neither his hearing testimony nor the Plan, the Trustee states, concede the legitimacy of the cumulative interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Instead, the Trustee insists that his testimony addressed the limited question of whether initial distributions and reserves under the Plan would be calculated using a \"net investment\" methodology (based on the amounts invested and appearing on customer accounts) or a \"net equity\" methodology (based on the hypothetical liquidation value of the securities).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Trustee's Resp. to UBS's SoF [114], \u00b6 26; 8/13/08 Hearing Tr. at 32:17-36:2.) The Trustee claims that he argued for the net investment method because using the net equity alternative \"would have unfairly punished customers to whose accounts illiquid and valueless securities unlawfully had been allotted.\" (Trustee's Resp. Br. 30.) Later at the same hearing cited by UBS, counsel for the Trustee explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   [We] are talking about treating everybody equally, we are talking about the amount that they put into Sentinel. In\n   this case the customer put $18.5 million into Sentinel. We are not talking about respecting the account statements that are completely fraudulent, that everyone in this courtroom knows were completely fraudulent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   On this day, this account statement said there was a bunch of junk in junk trading account. On a different day, it said something different. These are made up. So we are not treating everybody equally based on Eric Bloom's lies to the customers. We are treating everybody based on what they put into the company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   (8/13/08 Hearing Tr. 176:19-177:8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The bankruptcy court ultimately approved the Trustee's preferred net investment-based claim calculation over the objection of the SEG 1 investors. (Trustee's SoAF \u00b6 35.) The Trustee maintains, however, that his decision to support the net investment methodology cannot be interpreted as an admission to the accuracy of Sentinel's customer statements-and therefore the cumulative interest. Rather, he only chose to utilize customer account balances \"because it was the most expedient and cost-effective method to make initial distributions\" given Sentinel's extensive comingling of customer funds.

Br. 31);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sentinel Management Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3987131\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/398/281/#p310\">\n    398 B.R. 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 310-14 (Bankr.

The Trustee claims that this understanding was built into the Liquidation Plan, and cites the mandatory Disclosure Statement referenced in the Plan, which reads in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [A]s tested by the Plan Proponents over the three and a half year period of time preceding the Petition Date, the notional value that Sentinel reported to Sentinel's Customers on its monthly account statements closely approximated Customers' \"net investment\" Claim measured over the same period.... Given the proximity of the amount reported to Customers by Sentinel on their customer statements to their actual \"net investment\" (when provision is made for time value of money), and due to the unreliable and incomplete nature of Sentinel's books and records (which would obfuscate any attempt to arrive at a perfectly accurate measurement of \"net investment\"), the Plan Proponents believe that the amount reported by Sentinel on Customers' account statements is in fact the most efficient, equitable method to calculate Customer Claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (Disclosure Statement [592] in\n   <em>\n    In re Sentinel Management Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-BR-14987, at 31.) UBS responds that whatever the Trustee's reasons may have been, \"the Plan's\n   <em>\n    effect\n   </em>\n   was to legitimize the cumulative interest.\" (UBS's Reply Br. 25) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Present Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   On June 24, 2009, the Trustee filed the present adversary proceeding against UBS in bankruptcy court. (Complaint 22.) On November 4, 2009, Judge Zagel of this court entered an order withdrawing the reference of this dispute from the bankruptcy court. (11/4/09 Order, Ex. 24 to UBS's SoF [98-24].) UBS originally moved for summary judgment [32] in June 2012. Judge Zagel held that motion under advisement for several years as two related cases traveled back and forth on appeal. The case was reassigned to this court on April 25, 2017, after Judge Zagel took senior status. This court then struck UBS's summary judgment motion without prejudice and ordered the parties to re-brief the motion. (5/19/17 Status Hearing [92].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Trustee's complaint against UBS alleged three counts in connection with Sentinel's transfer of $14,401,342.15 in cumulative interest on March 30, 2007. Count I sought to avoid the payment as an actual\n   fraudulent transfer under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A), Count II sought to avoid the same transfer as constructively fraudulent under Section 548(a)(1)(B), and Count III sought the disallowance of any claims that UBS had against Sentinel's estate. (Complaint 18-22.) Based on the Seventh Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    FCStone I\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the lack of any claims by UBS against the bankrupt estate, the Trustee has admitted that the court should dismiss Counts II and III.

Only Count I, alleging an actual fraudulent transfer, remains at issue in UBS's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Count I asserts that Sentinel's managers acted with the \"actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud\" Sentinel's other investors. That claim rests on three core theories: (1) that the entire cumulative interest total consists of \"false profits\"; (2) that Sentinel made the transfer in order to cover up and perpetuate its fraud after UBS \"became suspicious of Sentinel's business\"; and (3) that Sentinel made the transfer using funds belonging to a different class of investors. (Complaint 8-13; Trustee's Resp. Br. 18-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   UBS's motion for summary judgment asserts that the Trustee alleges only a \"general scheme to defraud\" and that the Trustee has not established a genuine dispute of material fact as to Sentinel's intent regarding the specific transfer at issue in this case. (UBS's Opening Br. 2-3.) UBS further argues that the Trustee is estopped from arguing that the interest paid to UBS was anything but genuine based on the results of-and the Trustee's statements during-related litigation. Overall, UBS describes Count I as \"merely a poorly disguised preference claim\" that the Trustee pleaded as a fraudulent transfer in order to avoid the 90-day limitations period applicable to bankruptcy preference actions.

None of UBS's arguments are successful, although some do apply to narrow the scope of the court's inquiry. The court will address all of them in brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Trustee's new theories do not \"effectively amend\" the Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   UBS argues that summary judgment should be granted in its favor on the two new theories of recovery raised by the Trustee for the first time in his brief in opposition to UBS's motion for summary judgment. (UBS's Reply Br. 15.) UBS claims these two \"new theories\" are that \"(1) Sentinel was allegedly 'undersegregated' at the time of the March 30 Transfer; and (2) funds for the March 30 Transfer allegedly came from a 'SEG 3 cash account.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   UBS is correct that a plaintiff is not free to assert wholly new claims in briefs opposing a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Shanahan v.

That is not what the Trustee has done here, however. The Trustee's claim-that the $14.4 million transfer was made with fraudulent intent and must be avoided-remains the same. The Trustee pleaded the core facts of the transfer at issue, its amount, and specifically alleged that \"[s]ecurities were not segregated, and the investment returns were false.\" (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 1, 61.) The Trustee has since discovered evidence of undersegregation and the source of the transferred funds, but this evidence does not contradict his core claim; it supplements his claim.

The Trustee is not estopped from arguing that the cumulative interest was fraudulent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   UBS also argues that the Trustee is estopped from disputing the validity of the cumulative interest based on \"admissions\" by its expert, James Feltman, and by the Liquidation Plan. With respect to each of these issues, UBS has overstated its case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   First, UBS notes that during his deposition in the\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   test case, Feltman acknowledged that Sentinel made \"a significant attempt to match the interest accrued and allocated to customer accounts to the actual earnings that the securities would have reflected for those customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   Feltman Dep. at 219:4-20.) UBS urges that this \"admission\" is binding on the Trustee and defeats his claim that all of the interest earned by UBS's investments and credited to UBS's account over the course of several years constitutes 'false profits.' \" (UBS's Opening Br. 13.) As the Trustee notes, however, UBS is taking this passage out of context. Feltman's testimony as a whole clearly establishes his view that he viewed Sentinel's method of allocating interest to be fraudulent. (\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   Feltman Dep. 222:4-10.) Feltman's two expert reports reinforce this idea at length (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2013 Omnibus Feltman Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 90-96; 2010 BONY Feltman Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 64-68), and, most importantly, several courts have already found that Sentinel's managers did, in fact, regularly falsify the interest they credited to customer account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SEC v. Sentinel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201079961\">\n    2012 WL 1079961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16 ;\n   <em>\n    Bloom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124465,12272634\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/243/\">\n    846 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   250-52 ;\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n    867 F.3d at 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Viewing Feltman's admission in the light most favorable to the Trustee, the court agrees with the Trustee's interpretation of that testimony: \"that Sentinel tried really hard to appear legitimate.\" (Trustee's Resp. Br. 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As will be discussed in detail, the court concludes that Feltman's testimony does not prove exactly what the Trustee wants it to prove. For the purposes of UBS's estoppel argument, however, this cherry-picked portion of Feltman's deposition does not bar the Trustee from arguing that Sentinel fabricated the precise amount of interest credited to customer accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   UBS's second estoppel argument focuses on the Liquidation Plan advanced by the Trustee. The Liquidation Plan fixed customer claims by whatever amount was listed as \"Net Equity\" on their final account statement before Sentinel filed for bankruptcy-i.e., their account balance. (Liquidation Plan \u00a7 4.4.) This amount includes the cumulative interest sum that the Trustee now seeks to avoid. UBS argues that the Trustee may not insist that the interest is legitimate for the purposes of distribution to creditors under the Plan,\n   but not for the pre-petition transfer to UBS. (UBS's Opening Br. 21.) Accordingly, UBS claims that the Trustee should be judicially and collaterally estopped from claiming that the cumulative interest sum constituted \"false profits\" in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Judicial estoppel applies to prevent parties from advancing arguments that contradict arguments they prevailed on in an earlier matter.\n   <em>\n    Wells v. Coker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3537078\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/756/#p760\">\n    707 F.3d 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 760 (7th Cir. 2013). Collateral estoppel applies to bar relitigation of issues that were resolved in a previous lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Adams v. City of Indianapolis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071379\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/720/#p736\">\n    742 F.3d 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 736 (7th Cir. 2014). The Trustee would be judicially estopped if his current position regarding the fraudulent nature of the cumulative interest transfer were \"clearly inconsistent\" with the position he took before the bankruptcy court.\n   <em>\n    Janusz v. City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350937\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/770/#p776\">\n    832 F.3d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 776 (7th Cir. 2016). The Trustee would be collaterally estopped if the question of whether Sentinel allocated fraudulent interest raises the \"same issue\" as the method of determining customer claims for purposes of liquidating the firm.\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071379\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/720/#p736\">\n    742 F.3d at 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither the inconsistency required for judicial estoppel nor the identity of issues required for collateral estoppel is present in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   As with Feltman's testimony, UBS misinterprets the source material. The Liquidation Plan indeed uses customers' account balances, but does so only in three limited contexts: calculating \"Percentage Recoveries,\" making\n   <em>\n    initial\n   </em>\n   distributions, and establishing reserves. (Liquidation Plan \u00a7 4.4.) Claims must also still be \"allowed\" under the Plan in order to be paid. In addition, the Trustee never argued that the interest was legitimate; instead, he took the position that, given the \"extensive commingling,\" the account statements served as \"the most expedient and cost-effective method to make initial distributions.\" (Trustee's Resp. Br. 31.) In the hearing prior to the Plan's approval, counsel for the Trustee nevertheless clarified that the account statements were \"completely fraudulent.\" (8/13/08 Hearing Tr. 176:19-177:8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   It is also clear from that hearing that the focus of the debate was the choice between the Trustee's \"net investment\" methodology and the SEG 1 Objectors' preferred \"net equity\" method of setting claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:17-36:2.) Either one of these methods necessarily relied on Sentinel's account statements for some purpose: for net equity, the specific securities allocated to each account would be relevant; for net investment, only the overall balance matters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sentinel Management Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3987131\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/398/281/#p310\">\n    398 B.R. at 310-314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The bankruptcy court found net investment to be the superior method because it was relatively fairer to the investors at a point when asset tracing was considered impossible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3987131\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/398/281/#p310\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3987131\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/398/281/#p310\">\n    at 313-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The approved Plan's Disclosure Statement states outright that the account balances were an imperfect tool, and merely \"approximated\" a customer's actual net investment as reflected in Sentinel's \"unreliable and incomplete\" records. (Disclosure Statement 31.) Given this evidence, it is entirely consistent for the Trustee to use a figure that included cumulative interest in connection with liquidating Sentinel while recognizing that Sentinel's procedures allocating that interest were fraudulent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Entitlement to be paid is not an absolute defense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   UBS also asserts that it was legally impossible for Sentinel to have acted with fraudulent intent when making the March 30 transfer, \"because it was merely complying with a redemption request that it did not initiate and was legally and contractually required to honor.\" (UBS's\n   Opening Br. 2.) The repayment of an antecedent debt, UBS claims, cannot be a fraudulent transfer as a matter of law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   UBS's position runs contrary to well-established Seventh Circuit case law. The court has long recognized that \"a transfer by a debtor to one creditor, even though for consideration, is still a fraud against other creditors if there is an intent to defraud.\"\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10550865,12258027\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/825/1180/\">\n    825 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1186 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scholes v.

So long as the Trustee can raise a reasonable inference of actual fraudulent intent, the transfer may be avoided. Challenging this principle, UBS cites\n   <em>\n    B.E.L.T., Inc. v. Wachovia Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9019800,9015695\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/403/474/\">\n    403 F.3d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2005), for the proposition that \"where a debtor transfers funds to a non-insider third-party creditor in payment of an antecedent debt in an arm's-length transaction, there can be no claim that the transfer was made with 'actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any [other] creditor of the debtor.' \" (UBS's Reply Br. 3.) The facts in\n   <em>\n    B.E.L.T.\n   </em>\n   share many similarities with the situation here, but its holding did not create a bright line rule. The district court had dismissed the creditor's complaint because it failed to plead fraud with particularity.\n   <em>\n    B.E.L.T.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9019800,9015695\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/403/474/\">\n    403 F.3d at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Broadly speaking, the Trustee has asserted that Sentinel's fraudulent practices consisted of: (1) issuing false customer statements that misrepresented the assets held in segregation; (2) engaging in \"very involved machinations of 'allocating' [ ] its securities\" to create the impression that customer assets were segregated; (3) pledging customer assets as collateral for the overnight loan and using the proceeds for the benefit of its own leveraging trading strategy; and (4) calculating interest based on the total portfolio, rather than a SEG-by-SEG basis, and then manipulating the returns among its customers. (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 42, 43, 55-60; Trustee's Resp. Br. 6-13.) As a function of these practices, the\n   Trustee contends, Sentinel treated all of its customers' assets as a single \"undifferentiated pool belonging to Sentinel itself ... Securities were not segregated, and the investment returns were false.\" (Complaint \u00b6 61.) UBS claims, however, that the Trustee's characterization of Sentinel's business practices is invalid after\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   , which, in UBS's view, \"flatly reject[s] the Trustee's self-serving characterization of Sentinel's alleged fraudulent scheme.\" (UBS's Reply Br. 10.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   UBS urges the court to apply collateral estoppel based on\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   As UBS reads\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   , that case \"flatly rejected\" the Trustee's characterization of Sentinel's fraud on virtually all counts: \"among other things, its leveraged trading strategy, the purchase, sale and allocation of customer securities, the undersegregation of customer assets, the use of customer assets as collateral and Sentinel's books and records.\" (UBS's Resp. to Trustee's SoAF \u00b6 12.) As the court understands that case, however, UBS's reliance on it as a panacea stretches the Seventh Circuit's decision far beyond its intended meaning, and does not comport with the voluminous case law addressing Sentinel's bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Indeed, the Seventh Circuit has already avoided one of Sentinel's transfers as made with the intent to defraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BONY II\n   </em>\n   , 809 F.3d at 964.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trustee's Resp. Br. 23; Trustee's Sur-Reply Br. 5-8.)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 11-80.) Here, however-and like UBS-the Trustee goes too far.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Seventh Circuit explicitly rejected the Trustee's claim of rampant non-segregation in\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   . In fact, the Seventh Circuit questioned the entire basis for the Trustee's argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   [T]he trustee continues to argue that FCStone relied on \"phony\" records and a \"fictional, arbitrary allocation process with no basis in reality.\" The trustee is arguing in essence that because Sentinel unlawfully used customer assets as collateral for its own borrowing, all of its records amount to nothing more than smoke and mirrors. The trustee also contends that Sentinel's customer ledgers are unreliable because they do not show securities owned by the house (which seems unsurprising to us since these are\n   <em>\n    customer\n   </em>\n   ledgers), and because customer statements did not disclose the risk to customers from Sentinel's use of their assets as collateral to support its own leveraged trading strategy. But the trustee cites no legal authority to show that these facts render Sentinel's internal records meaningless, and he cites no record evidence to show that McCloskey's tracing analysis was flawed. In our view, McCloskey's forensic analysis therefore remains unrebutted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   All parties to this case agree that Sentinel broke the law by using client assets as collateral for its Bank of New York loan. (Two of Sentinel's executives are serving prison sentences, after all.) But that fact does not mean that FCStone cannot prove what it owned. Sentinel\n   <em>\n    risked\n   </em>\n   customer assets by pledging them as collateral, but that misconduct did not affect McCloskey's ability to\n   <em>\n    trace\n   </em>\n   those assets. The fact that SEG 3 customers happened to be the last victims of Sentinel's machinations does not confer upon the district court broad equitable discretion to remedy their injury at the SEG 1 customers' expense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n    867 F.3d at 787-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). In ruling against the Trustee, the Seventh Circuit found that the Trustee was wrong to view Sentinel's records as \"a complete fraud.\" That view rested on the Trustee's expert's review of irrelevant evidence: namely, records from the Bank of New York and Sentinel's \"securities inventory,\" rather than Sentinel's \"detailed customer ledgers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n    at 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The evidence the Seventh Circuit addressed in\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   is precisely the same as what is now presented to this court: UBS's McCloskey Report is the one the Seventh Circuit found compelling, and the Trustee's Feltman reports have not been updated to rebut McCloskey in the meantime. Admittedly, the\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   test case focused on the investors' entitlement to reserve funds set aside under the Liquidation Plan, a matter not at issue here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n    867 F.3d at 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The basis for the Seventh Circuit's ruling in\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   , however, was that the Trustee's characterization of Sentinel's business was at odds with the undisputed evidence. Otherwise the court would have found asset tracing to be impossible. Contrary to the Trustee's argument in this case, at least some of the issues addressed in\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   are identical to the issues advanced in this litigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trustee's Sur-Reply Br. 5-8) (calling the issue of Sentinel's business practices in this dispute merely \"similar\" to the practices at issue in\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   ). The Trustee also claims that the Seventh Circuit did not reject Judge Zagel's findings of fact (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6), but this misses the point. The Seventh Circuit explicitly stated that it disagreed with Judge Zagel's \"legal conclusions stemming from and relating to those findings [of fact].\"\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n    867 F.3d at 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court concludes that the Trustee is collaterally estopped from claiming that Sentinel's allocation process or records were fraudulent, or that Sentinel held its customers' funds \"as a single, undifferentiated pool belonging to Sentinel itself.\" (Complaint \u00b6 61.) For the purposes of this motion for summary judgment, any assertions of Sentinel's \"fraudulent business practices\" are limited to (1) pledging customer assets as collateral for Sentinel's misuse of the overnight loan and (2) misallocating interest revenue across SEGs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Evidentiary Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   As stated, the Trustee asserts three basic theories of Sentinel's fraudulent intent as it relates to the March 30 transfer. The Trustee's evidence purportedly shows that Sentinel paid UBS from an account holding other investors' money, that UBS withdrew its funds only after becoming suspicious of Sentinel's activities, and that all of the interest credited to customer accounts consisted of \"false profits.\" (Trustee's Resp. Br. 18-23.) The Trustee buttresses his claim with evidence of Sentinel's overall scheme of \"illegally comingling customer funds and using the proceeds of that unlawful activity and new investor deposits to pay redeeming customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.) The Trustee believes that this evidence establishes, or at the very least raises a genuine dispute, that Sentinel wrongfully transferred the property of another to UBS-\"the very definition of conduct that has the effect of preventing Sentinel's creditors from their assets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Based on the entire body of evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Trustee, this court finds that no reasonable trier of fact could find that Sentinel acted with actual fraudulent intent when transferring the $14.4 million in cumulative interest to UBS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Payment from a SEG 3 account\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The parties agree that the money used to pay UBS came from the JP Morgan SMG III account, but disagree as to the account's significance. The Trustee claims that the JP Morgan SMG III account was segregated for the sole benefit of SEG 3 investors. (Trustee's SoAF \u00b6 33.) If true, this would be strong evidence that Sentinel intended to defraud its other investors when it paid UBS; but the evidence does not support the Trustee's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The Trustee and UBS both cite to their opposing expert reports to argue that the JP Morgan SMG III account was segregated for SEG 3 alone, or for SEG 1 and SEG 3\n   <em>\n    together\n   </em>\n   , respectively. This court will not weigh expert opinions in ruling on a motion for summary judgment; however, UBS supplements its report with a critical piece of evidence. The NFA's 2006 audit explicitly recognized that Sentinel was permitted to hold SEG 1 and SEG 3 cash together in a single account at JP Morgan. (July 2006 NFA Audit.) The auditors' recommendations specifically permitted SEG 1 and SEG 3 funds to remain in the same account, and stated only that SEG 2's funds needed to be held separately. (Id.) The JP Morgan SMG III account did not exist at the time of the audit, but it is undisputed that the SMG III account was a duplicate of the audited \"SMG 1.20\" account and served an identical purpose. The account names are potentially confusing, but as UBS states, \"the account was not used that way.\" (UBS's Resp. to Trustee's SoAF \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Testimony by two different witnesses in the\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   test case is also noteworthy. The Trustee claims that the trial testimony of Sentinel employee Jeff Logan militates in the Trustee's favor, but that testimony is, at best, inconclusive: Logan stated only that he \"believed\" that the three JP Morgan cash accounts exactly corresponded to SEG 1, 2, and 3, and later admitted on cross examination that he \"wouldn't know anything that the NFA may have said regarding cash being held at JP Morgan.\" (\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 205:13-24; 238:5-21.) Logan also effectively corroborated UBS's argument by admitting that Sentinel, at the very least, did hold SEG 1 and SEG 3 cash together in the SMG 1.2 account before\n   the SMG III account existed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 239:1-24.) Later during trial, James Feltman, the Trustee's own expert, admitted on cross examination that SEG 1 and SEG 3 cash was held together in the JP Morgan accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 708.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Based on this very evidence, another court has already found the Trustee's argument to be without merit. During a bench trial in which he otherwise ruled in favor of the Trustee, Judge Zagel made a finding of fact that \"[t]wo of the non-interest bearing accounts [at JP Morgan] and their interest bearing counterparts were available to be used for both SEG 1 and SEG 3 customer funds. The other non-interest bearing account and its interest bearing counterpart was used to hold SEG 2 funds.\"\n   <em>\n    Grede v.

Judge Zagel's opinion was reversed on appeal, but to the extent the Seventh Circuit disagreed with his treatment of the facts, all of those issues were decided against the Trustee based on the \"essentially unrebutted report\" of Frances McCloskey.\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n    867 F.3d at 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . McCloskey's same report serves as the evidentiary heart of UBS's current motion for summary judgment. That report successfully traced \"all of the cash and securities within Sentinel's records (not only those assets allocated to SEG 1) for 2007\" and \"did not find ... any evidence of misappropriation of customer assets\" apart from the segregation violations connected to the overnight loan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n    at 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The Trustee offers new evidence that it claims disputes this finding. Specifically, the Trustee cites an expert report from Anne Vanderkamp to show that the money used to fund the transfer came from the JP Morgan SMG III account. (Vanderkamp Decl. 2.) Notably, the Vanderkamp report does not actually state that the account should have only held cash for SEG 3. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Vanderkamp makes no representations as to the legal requirements governing the JP Morgan cash accounts. Rather, Vanderkamp simply, and without support, refers to the account as the \"\n   <em>\n    SEG 3\n   </em>\n   cash account.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added). As the JP Morgan account statements she relied on show, that was not the name assigned to the account. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Statement of Account, Ex. 1 to Vanderkamp Decl. [112-47] ) (listing the account's name as \"Sentinel Management Group, Inc. III-1.2\"). Vanderkamp's declaration does not establish that the funds in the JP Morgan SMG III account were undeniably segregated for the benefit of SEG 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Finally, the Trustee also argues that the facts supporting this avoidance action are essentially identical to the facts in his avoidance action against the Bank of New York, which \"led the Seventh Circuit to conclude that Sentinel acted with an intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors.\" (Trustee's Resp. Br. 18.) The Trustee argues that the court's decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Sentinel Management Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058885,5887238\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/958/\">\n    809 F.3d 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    BONY II\n   </em>\n   \"), established, as a matter of law, that actual intent includes unlawfully exposing creditors to a substantial risk of loss of which they are unaware. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058885,5887238\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/958/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The Trustee accurately describes the law, but the facts of\n   <em>\n    BONY I\n   </em>\n   are inapposite. The Seventh Circuit avoided the Bank of New York's liens and returned the securities to the bankrupt estate because \"Sentinel exposed its FCM clients to a substantial risk of loss of which they were unaware when it\n   <em>\n    pledged funds\n   </em>\n   that were supposed to remain segregated for the FCM clients as collateral for Sentinel's overnight loans.\"\n   <em>\n    BONY I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052307,3697815\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/660/\">\n    728 F.3d at 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The critical factor in\n   <em>\n    BONY I\n   </em>\n   was that the unsegregated funds were pledged as collateral, not merely that they were moved out of segregation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052307,3697815\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/660/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n    867 F.3d at 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"Sentinel broke the law by using client assets as collateral\" and \"Sentinel risked customer assets by pledging\n   them as collateral\"). The Trustee claims here that Sentinel's transfer to UBS allegedly left SEG 3 undersegregated by almost $400 million. Assuming first that this statement is accurate-Trustee's expert Vanderkamp appears to rely on the same Bank of New York account statements that the Seventh Circuit found unreliable in\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   BONY SEG Cash Account Statements of 3/30/07, Exs. 2 and 3 to Vanderkamp Decl. [112-47] )-it is not clear why undersegregation would be dispositive. \"Undersegregated\" does not mean \"insolvent.\" It only means that the funds were not where they were supposed to be. What was merely a\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   condition for finding fraudulent intent in BONY, the Trustee incorrectly asserts is a\n   <em>\n    sufficient\n   </em>\n   condition in this case. The court concludes that no reasonable jury could find based on this evidence that \"Sentinel paid UBS with cash that it was legally obligated to hold in segregation for the benefit of its SEG 3 customers.\" (Trustee's Resp. Br. 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   As a final matter, the court also feels compelled to recognize the ill fit between the Trustee's argument and his requested relief. The Trustee claims that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the funds used to pay UBS were in fact the property of SEG 3 investors. But if that were true, why then would the Trustee only seek to avoid a portion of the transfer? (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UBS's Reply Br. 17) (\"If the Trustee really believed that the funds ... actually belonged to SEG 3 investors, he would have sought to claw back the entire March 30 and not just the Cumulative Interest.\") If the Trustee's allegations had any support, he likely would have tried to claw back the full $108 million for the SEG 3 investors-not just the $14.4 million identified as interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    b. UBS and Sentinel communications regarding the transfer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The Trustee claims that UBS only withdrew its funds from Sentinel after becoming \"suspicious\" of Sentinel's business practices. (Trustee's Resp. Br. 19.) In support of this idea, the Trustee cites the recorded phone conversation between a UBS employee and a Sentinel employee, as well as internal e-mails from both companies. UBS responds that the communications are irrelevant because they only reveal UBS's intent in requesting and receiving the transfer. (UBS Resp. to Trustee's SoAF \u00b6\u00b6 31-34.) Notably, the Trustee himself makes no further references to these communications after introducing them, nor makes any real attempt to link them to his larger argument concerning Sentinel's intent to defraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The communications represent the closest the Trustee comes to establishing direct \"mindset\" evidence of fraudulent intent. But the phone call and e-mails are insufficient to allow a jury to conclude that Sentinel's managers acted with that intent. A jury could perhaps conclude that\n   <em>\n    UBS\n   </em>\n   was suspicious about Sentinel's activities when it decided to withdraw its funds,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   but that does not shed light on the relevant question in this case: whether\n   <em>\n    Sentinel\n   </em>\n   had the intent to defraud. A transferee's mindset regarding an allegedly fraudulent transfer is irrelevant unless the transferee is a corporate insider-which is not the case here.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re H. King &amp; Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"311994\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/295/246/#p283\">\n    295 B.R. at 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Where the transferee is an insider of the\n   debtor and is in a position to control the disposition of property of the debtor, the transferee's intent is imputed to the debtor.\") Even if UBS had actual knowledge of fraud on the part of Sentinel's managers, evidence that speaks only to UBS's intent as a recipient would not be sufficient for the Trustee to avoid the transfer as fraudulent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boston Trading\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10553405\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/835/1504/#p1510\">\n    835 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1512 ;\n   <em>\n    Sharp\n   </em>\n   , 403 F.3d at 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The sole communication from inside Sentinel simply summarized the contents of the phone call: that UBS was \"not comfortable with how we obtain the yields we post\" but that UBS would \"give us a chance to explain.\" (Stitle E-Mail.) The e-mail concludes by stating that the \"[c]onversation was slightly more positive than I expected. Bottom line is that they can't stay invested in a vehicle that they don't fully understand and are [not] comfortable with.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) No reasonable jury could infer intent to defraud from this single, innocuous e-mail. The Trustee also fails to present any statements from Sentinel executives or employees that would suggest that any of Sentinel's other redemption payments to customers were made with the intent to defraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   At best, UBS's alleged \"suspicions\" are relevant only to the availability of the \"good faith\" defense.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). But the court need not address such a defense unless the Trustee can establish that Sentinel acted fraudulently. In this way, the Trustee's case is very different from his earlier avoidance action against the Bank of New York. In\n   <em>\n    BONY I\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit found that Sentinel had acted with fraudulent intent and then\n   <em>\n    remanded\n   </em>\n   the case for district court to determine whether the Bank of New York had inquiry notice of Sentinel's fraud.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052307,3697815\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/660/\">\n    728 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   668 n.2. The Seventh Circuit did not overrule the good faith defense and find the transfer avoidable until the case's second appeal,\n   <em>\n    BONY II\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058885,5887238\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/958/\">\n    809 F.3d at 961-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the Bank of New York did not receive the transfer of assets as collateral in good faith). The Trustee has not yet established any fraud with respect to the March 30 transfer to UBS. The court notes that the fraud addressed in\n   <em>\n    BONY I\n   </em>\n   was specifically said to be Sentinel's practice of pledging segregated funds as collateral for its\n   <em>\n    personal\n   </em>\n   loan.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052307,3697815\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/660/\">\n    728 F.3d at 667-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That decision does not by itself establish a basis for concluding that Sentinel's transfers to customers in accordance with their investment agreements are fraudulent as well. Based on this evidence, no reasonable jury could find that \"the main or only purpose of the transfer\" was to defraud Sentinel's other customers,\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10550865,12258027\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/825/1180/\">\n    825 F.2d at 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and not simply a response to UBS's demand for a return of its money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    c. \"False Profits\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   As has been discussed, Sentinel did not calculate or allocate interest properly. Instead of distributing interest within each SEG, Sentinel calculated interest revenue based on \"the interest earned by all securities, including those belonging to other Seg[s] and the house pool.\"\n   <em>\n    FCStone I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4029296,4240940\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/244/\">\n    746 F.3d at 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Sentinel's managers would then \"guesstimate the yield its customers expected to receive on their group's securities portfolio, add a little extra so that the rate of return seemed highly competitive, and report the customer's pro rata share of that amount, minus fees, on the customer's statement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4029296,4240940\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/244/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This process, other courts have found, was directed at inflating the returns to the 125 Portfolio-SEG 1-at the expense of the Prime Portfolio-SEG 3. Bloom,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124465,12272634\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/243/\">\n    846 F.3d at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Sentinel's managers also pocketed some of the interest revenue themselves. (Trustee's SoAF \u00b6 20.) UBS disputes this, but there is no real argument to be made to the contrary. Generally speaking, Sentinel's managers inappropriately allocated\n   interest in a manner which favored SEG 1-of which UBS was a member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Nevertheless, the Trustee does not raise a genuine dispute of material fact that Sentinel paid UBS with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud its other investors. The reason for this is clear. The Trustee does not argue that UBS merely received more than its fair share of interest; the Trustee argues that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the $14.4 million in cumulative interest paid to UBS was \"false profits.\" (Complaint \u00b6 81.) \"Simply put there was no interest to pay UBS.\" (Trustee's Resp. Br. 22.) The numerous opinions regarding Sentinel's bankruptcy, however, hold otherwise. The detailed calculations provided by the Seventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Bloom\n   </em>\n   , for example, show that the overall portfolio earned $263,879.60 on December 7, 2006, and that SEG 1 received $6889.82 more than its actual share.\n   <em>\n    Bloom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124465,12272634\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/243/\">\n    846 F.3d at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On July 30, 2007, well after the transfer to UBS and just two weeks before Sentinel filed for bankruptcy, \"SEG 1 actually earned $63,477.53, but was paid $100,420.34.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124465,12272634\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/243/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These figures show that SEG 1 received extra interest revenue, but defeat any suggestion that the interest did not exist. Even the Trustee's expert witness does not support the Trustee's claim to avoid the entire $14.4 million. James Feltman states numerous times that Sentinel indeed received interest on its investments, which it credited to the different SEGs on a regular basis. (2013 Omnibus Feltman Rep. 55-58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   As stated, the Trustee has not provided any evidence regarding the specific securities that UBS should have been earning interest on, nor regarding the exact amount by which UBS was overpaid. Prior cases show that such overpayment was likely, but the undisputed evidence, including evidence submitted by the Trustee, shows that it was minor at best. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   Feltman Dep. at 219:4-20) (saying that Sentinel made \"a significant attempt to match the interest accrued and allocated to customer accounts to the actual earnings that the securities would have reflected for those customers.\") The Trustee himself admits \"that Sentinel tried really hard to appear legitimate.\" (Trustee's Resp. Br. 25.) No reasonable jury could conclude that the entire $14.4 million payment consisted of \"false profits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Instead, the Trustee repeats his claim that Sentinel was \"undersegregated\" and that, accordingly, \"Sentinel did not have sufficient funds to return all of its customers' initial investments, let alone interest on those investments.\" (Trustee's Resp. Br. 21-22.) As stated, however, while the Trustee treats the two terms as synonymous, undersegregated does not mean \"insolvent.\" The Trustee asserts that Sentinel was \"insolvent-which necessarily meant its customer account were under-segregated,\" but provides no support for this claim, citing only to portions of its Complaint which do not suggest insolvency. (Trustee's Sur-Reply Br. 16.) The Trustee's Complaint also inaccurately alleges that Sentinel's entire operation was merely a sham to cover up Sentinel's treatment of the assets under its control as an undifferentiated pool-a theory the Seventh Circuit has rejected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n    867 F.3d at 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, the Trustee's focus on undersegregation ignores Seventh Circuit's other findings in\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   that the Trustee's expert, Feltman, relied on inappropriate documents in crafting his opinions and that UBS's expert, McCloskey, \"did not find, after validating the accounting for all of Sentinel's securities inventory for more than 200 business days, any misappropriation of customer assets\" beyond the times when Sentinel pledged customer assets as collateral to the Bank of New York.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n    at 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Based on the evidence, no reasonable jury could find that the\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   $14.4 million\n   in cumulative interest was money to which UBS was not entitled-and therefore raise the inference that it was transferred with the intent to defraud others. The Trustee has not, however, made any effort to prove the much more likely proposition that a portion of the transfer in fact belonged to others. It seems likely that the Trustee cannot identify what that sum should be. The Trustee suggests that discovery in this case has been \"limited,\" but the more than one hundred unique exhibits attached to the parties' briefs on the motion belie that suggestion. Discovery on this particular matter may have stayed on and off pending the results of related cases, but the Trustee and his lawyers have already had the opportunity to take depositions, examine witnesses at trial, craft expert reports, and examine documents across the dozens of avoidance actions he has filed for the benefit of Sentinel's estate over the past decade. In any case, if the Trustee believed that he was likely to uncover new evidence regarding this eleven-year-old payment, he should have filed a Rule 56(d) affidavit attesting to that evidence with the court. Instead, the Trustee only presents evidence of the general scheme to manipulate yield rates-which is not sufficient to establish Sentinel's intent in regards to the specific transfer at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    d.

The return was inflated (or deflated, as the case may be), but that does not render Sentinel's entire business\n   fraudulent in the manner of a Ponzi scheme.

(UBS's Opening Br. 3.) The court finds it difficult to disagree. It is the Trustee's view that UBS's luck at withdrawing its funds before the financial crisis hit seems too good to be true. Perhaps it is, but this is not enough to establish that any transfer to an investor during the relevant time is fraudulent. The Trustee anchors his claim on the hope that a jury will find Sentinel's overall behavior suspicious enough to infer that this specific transfer was fraudulent. But general schemes are not sufficient: the Trustee is required to prove that the transfer itself was made with fraudulent intent.\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10550865,12258027\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/825/1180/\">\n    825 F.2d at 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Trustee has provided no relevant evidence of intent to defraud as it relates to the March 30 transfer to UBS. The evidence viewed in the light\n   most favorable to the Trustee does not raise a genuine dispute as to Sentinel's intent when making the transfer-rather, it supports UBS's position that Sentinel paid UBS on demand because Sentinel was required to. Certainly no adverse inference may be drawn from the mere fact that UBS redeemed its investment. And although the interest credited to UBS's account was likely overstated by some amount, the evidence does not support the Trustee's belief that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   $14.4 million constitutes \"false profits\" derived from a generally fraudulent scheme that never returned profits to investors. Nor is there any evidence that Sentinel paid UBS from a SEG 3 account or that Sentinel was insolvent in March 2007. Sentinel's other transfers to redeeming customers around the same time and Sentinel's officers' continued involvement until the summer of 2007 further suggest that Sentinel was operating normally at the time of the transfer to UBS. As a result, this court concludes that no reasonable jury could find that Sentinel transferred the $14.4 million in cumulative interest with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud its other investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   For the reasons stated, the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [96] is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    SEG 2 consisted of funds derived from FCM clients' trades on foreign futures and foreign options markets.
