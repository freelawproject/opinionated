Specifically, Plaintiff alleges the following in his Complaint: On the afternoon of May 12, 2016 Samantha Joyce Broberg, age 33, along with two traveling companions, boarded the Carnival Liberty cruise ship in Galveston, Texas with destination to Cozumel, Mexico. (Complaint \u00b6 16). Beginning that afternoon and continuing for the next twelve hours, bartenders served Mrs. Broberg multiple alcoholic drinks and she became visibly intoxicated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 18). Around 2 a.m. on May 13, Mrs. Broberg, in her inebriated state, approached a lounge chair on Deck 10 and began climbing the outside railing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22). She momentarily sat on the rail, then fell backwards into the water, and presumably drowned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Carnival Liberty's\n   camera system recorded Mrs. Broberg's fall overboard but ship personnel did not become aware of it for several hours. (Complaint \u00b6 27). As a result, the Carnival Liberty did not initiate a search and rescue operation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32). The ship's captain did not report the fall to the United States Coast Guard until approximately fifteen hours after the incident and eight hours after Mrs. Broberg's travel companions notified ship personnel that she was missing. (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 34-36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In addition, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant acted with reckless indifference by making public media announcements about Mrs. Broberg's identity and death without first notifying him that she had fallen overboard and had not been rescued. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 92). Plaintiff instead received telephone calls from numerous news stations regarding his wife's death, which caused him extreme emotional distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 93).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant is seeking dismissal of 1) Plaintiff's negligence claim, 2) intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, and 3) request for punitive damages.

Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd.,\n   </em>\n   this Court concluded that Plaintiff's complaint which included seven counts, was a total of 123 paragraphs, and incorporated previous count's allegations by reference, was not a shotgun pleading because it was sufficiently organized.\n   <em>\n    Martins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347168\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/174/1345/#p1358\">\n    174 F.Supp.3d at 1358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The first 54 paragraphs established the facts of the case generally at the outset and each count included specific allegations unique to the claim alleged.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347168\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/174/1345/#p1358\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Perricone v. Carnival Corp.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   this Court declined to dismiss plaintiff's seven-count complaint as a shotgun pleading because the complaint was organized and comprehensible.\n   <em>\n    Perricone,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201161214\">\n    2016 WL 1161214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.

This is not a situation where the Complaint is difficult to understand because each claim is repleaded in every count or where Plaintiff's referencing back is disorganized and incomprehensible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201161214\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, Plaintiff's Complaint includes only two counts. Count I alleges negligence under the Death on the High Seas Act and is based upon Defendant's excessive service of alcohol, its failure to detect and report Mrs. Broberg's fall overboard, and its failure to initiate a prompt search and rescue operation. (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 58-88). Count II alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress and is based upon Defendant's conduct in making public media announcements about Mrs. Broberg's death without first notifying Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 89-102). The Complaint is a total of 102 paragraphs, the first 57 of which establish the facts of the case and are incorporated by reference in both counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Even if the Court were to find that Plaintiff's Complaint is a \"shotgun\" pleading, dismissal with prejudice would not be proper at this stage of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit, while consistently condemning shotgun pleadings, \"has cautioned that dismissal of a claim should be the last resort.\"\n   <em>\n    Perricone,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201161214\">\n    2016 WL 1161214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. The Eleventh Circuit has said, \"[w]hen faced with a shotgun complaint, we have encouraged defendants to make motions for more definite statements or courts to demand repleader [ ] and not, as the case were, to dismiss a complaint with prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Bailey v. Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=288%20Fed.%20Appx.%20597\">\n    288 Fed.Appx. 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 603,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202898214\">\n    2008 WL 2898214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2008).
