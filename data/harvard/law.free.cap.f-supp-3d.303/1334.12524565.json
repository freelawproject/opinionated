(DE 156).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As explained below, because the undisputed facts establish that Defendants were not deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs' federally protected rights, Defendants' motion for summary judgment on deliberate indifference (DE 60; DE 156) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a disability discrimination case. Defendants are two Miami-area non-profit hospitals and their non-profit parent company. Plaintiffs Cheylla Silva and John Paul Jebian are unrelated deaf individuals who allege that, during their many visits to Defendants' facilities, Defendants ineffectively communicated with them and were deliberately indifferent to their federally-protected rights. Consequently, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit seeking injunctive relief and compensatory damages pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the \"RA\"). The Eleventh Circuit determined that Plaintiffs' injunctive relief claims may proceed to trial because genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Defendants provided Plaintiffs with effective communication as required by the ADA and RA. (DE 149);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Silva v. Baptist Health S. Florida, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276891\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/824/\">\n    856 F.3d 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2017). The sole question now before the Court is whether Plaintiffs' damages claim may also proceed to trial, the answer to which depends on whether triable issues exist regarding\n   whether Defendants were deliberately indifferent to each Plaintiff's federally protected rights to effective communication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By their count, Silva and Jebian visited Defendants' facilities a combined 59 times between March 2009 and April 2016. (DE 158-1; DE 158-2; DE 158-3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs argue that summary judgment is inappropriate because, in light of their long histories of visits which they contend yielded varying degrees of success obtaining in-person American Sign Language (\"ASL\") interpreters, a triable issue of fact must exist as to Defendants' deliberate indifference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   From each Plaintiff's perspective, \"Defendants' failure to fully and effectively communicate with [them] was a common and repeated occurrence, and not isolated\n   to routine visits or check-ups. In fact, Defendants' failure to communicate with [them] often occurred during critical medical encounters.\" (DE 61-13 \u00b6 11; DE 61-14 \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument rests entirely on their generalized and identical affidavit statements that during each visit, they \"repeatedly requested that hospital staff provide a live ASL interpreter to help ... communicate with nurses and doctors regarding ... condition and care. On most occasions, no interpreter was present. On some occasions, an interpreter was provided.\" (DE 61-13 \u00b6 7; DE 61-14 \u00b6 7). They state, without identifying specific instances, that \"[o]n some occasions, hospital staff would attempt to use a video relay interpreting ('VRI') machine to communicate with [them] ... [h]owever, the machine was inoperable or unusable. Sometimes, it appeared that hospital staff could not figure out how to operate the machine. Other times, the picture would be blocked, frozen, or degraded.\" (DE 61-13 \u00b6 10; DE 61-14 \u00b6 10).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs also point to the fact that Defendants often attempted to communicate with them through family and friends. (DE 61 \u00b6\u00b6 28-31, 40-43). Because federal regulations prohibit Defendants from relying \" 'on an adult accompanying an individual with a disability to interpret or facilitate communication' except in narrow circumstances,\" Plaintiffs assert that Defendants must have known that in using family to interpret, they were denying Plaintiffs their federally protected rights. Finally, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants' promulgation of policies to ensure effective communication with deaf individuals shows that Defendants had notice that failure to provide the specific accommodations Plaintiffs requested resulted in ineffective communication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants respond that they have promulgated and diligently adhered to policies for the provision of interpreter services for the deaf. (DE 59 \u00b6 3). Those policies provide for a range of services to assist deaf patients and their family members. (DE 59 \u00b6 7). One of those services is an in-person interpreter. (DE 59 \u00b6 7). Another is VRI, although VRI is not available at Baptist Health's outpatient facilities. (DE 59 \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At other times, depending on circumstances, Defendants provide patients with\n   other auxiliary aids and accommodations such as \"ASL translation via family member, text telephones (TTYs), lip-reading, gestures and written notes.\" (DE 59 \u00b6 59). Defendants also claim that Plaintiffs never complained about the accommodations at the time treatment was provided or that communication was ineffective. (DE 159 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

There, the Court found a genuine issue of material fact on deliberate indifference, where the medical records and the plaintiffs' testimony identified specific instances in which the hospital officials knowingly failed to correct denials of effective communication.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=686%20Fed.%20Appx.%20807\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For example, the Court found a genuine dispute of fact where a plaintiff had to communicate through gesturing, before and after an invasive procedure, even though plaintiff had requested an in-person interpreter and her son had complained that VRI was not working.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=686%20Fed.%20Appx.%20807\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=686%20Fed.%20Appx.%20807\">\n    at 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court also found a genuine dispute of fact where plaintiffs indicated they did not understand the VRI interpreter's signing and the hospital failed to provide an alternative aid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=686%20Fed.%20Appx.%20807\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=686%20Fed.%20Appx.%20807\">\n    at 817-818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

By contrast, the Court found no issue of material fact in circumstances where the VRI malfunctioned but defendants were not aware of the malfunction, or where VRI malfunctioned and defendants provided alternative\n   aids such as pen and paper or an in-person interpreter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=686%20Fed.%20Appx.%20807\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=686%20Fed.%20Appx.%20807\">\n    at 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Based on the framework provided by these four cases, the Court finds that, in this case, there is no genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Defendants acted with deliberate indifference towards Plaintiffs. As noted, \"deliberate indifference plainly requires more than gross negligence. Rather, deliberate indifference requires that the indifference be a 'deliberate choice,' which is an 'exacting standard.' \"\n   <em>\n    Liese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5710734\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/334/#p337\">\n    701 F.3d at 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). For example, \"bad faith or gross misjudgment ... may satisfy the standard.\"\n   <em>\n    L.M.P. ex rel. E.P. v. Sch.

Fla. Sept. 24, 2014) (citations omitted). The record, here, contains no indication-other than Plaintiffs unsupported, conclusory allegations-that Defendants were actually aware of any instance in which they communicated ineffectively with Plaintiffs. Aside from these allegations, there is no evidence that Plaintiffs ever complained to or informed Defendants that they were not receiving proper assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs also incorrectly assert that prior settlements, on their own, put Defendants on notice that harm to a federally protected right is likely. Indeed, the case relied upon by Plaintiffs acknowledges that \"the relevance of the past complaints is limited by the fact that the hospital subsequently amended its policy designed to prevent violations.\"\n   <em>\n    Proctor v. Prince George's Hosp. Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"424500\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/32/820/#p825\">\n    32 F.Supp.2d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 825 (D. Md. 1998). Here, the record demonstrates that Defendants have promulgated policies to ensure the provision of interpreter services for the deaf (DE 59 \u00b6 3)-such as VRI, which did not exist when Mr. Jebian and Defendants settled their prior dispute-and that they continually train their staff to identify need for interpretation and to provide appropriate auxiliary aids. (59 \u00b6 5, 6, 21-27, 30, 44, 51). Plaintiffs have provided no evidence that Defendants have failed to adhere to those policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finally, in support of their claims, Plaintiffs submitted three charts, with supporting medical records, summarizing their visits to Defendants' facilities over the years (DE 158-1; DE 158-2; DE 158-3). But these charts, which were submitted in violation of this Court's Order of July 5, 2017 (DE 154), do not establish that Defendants acted with deliberate indifference. Indeed, of the forty-five\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   visits listed in the charts, Plaintiffs admit they communicated through VRI in at least nineteen of them. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   DE 158). In six other visits, Plaintiffs allege that VRI was not provided or malfunctioned.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"424500\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/32/820/#p825\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But those allegations are refuted by Plaintiffs' own testimony during depositions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (DE 59-1 \u00b6 95-96, 96-98, 106-107, 109-110, 117-118;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   DE 158-2 \u00b6 3). On five occasions, Defendants either refused VRI or refused to be transported to facilities that provided auxiliary aids. (DE 59-1 \u00b6 112). And for the remaining visits, Defendants communicated with Plaintiffs through family members and written notes, but there is no evidence that Plaintiffs complained about these accommodations or that the communication was ineffective at the time they were being treated.\n   <em>\n    (See generally\n   </em>\n   DE 158).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In fact, there is no evidence in the record that Plaintiffs ever complained about the accommodations received in any of the visits. Plaintiff Silva admits that she had no issues with Defendants except for her first visit back in 2009 (DE 59-1 at 83). And even for that visit, Plaintiff Silva admits that she \"allowed\" her brother to interpret, because her brother \"knew what was going on,\" \"knows [her] health\" and \"already knew what was wrong with [her].\" (DE 59-1 at 85). Similarly, there is no evidence in the record that Plaintiff Jebian ever complained about the accommodations provided. Although Plaintiffs generally claim that the communication between Plaintiffs and Defendants was ineffective, Plaintiffs failed to raise any complaints to the hospital at the time of their visits and now fail to specify what information they did not understand during these encounters. There is also no evidence that Silva, Jebian or any of the family members that assisted with ASL interpretation told Defendants' staff at that time that the family members were unqualified to interpret for Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCullum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264374\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/1135/\">\n    768 F.3d at 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court finds that Defendants' failure to obtain a live interpreter or VRI-in light of their efforts to provide alternative aids and in light of Plaintiffs' failure to contemporaneously complain about the accommodations provided-at most constituted negligence, and was not a \"deliberate choice\" to deny Plaintiffs rights as the law requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5710734\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/334/#p337\">\n    701 F.3d at 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Certainly, the facts of this case are not comparable to the circumstances of\n   <em>\n    Liese\n   </em>\n   , where a doctor mocked a deaf patient before refusing to provide available accommodations. They are also not comparable to the circumstances of the winning plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Sunderland\n   </em>\n   , who were able to show, for specific visits involving complex medical procedures, that defendants' doctors refused to provide live-interpretation or alternative aids even though they knew they were not communicating with plaintiffs effectively.\n   <em>\n    Sunderland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=686%20Fed.%20Appx.%20807\">\n    686 Fed.Appx. at 816-818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding, based on deposition testimony and hospital medical records, that the doctors and nurses were aware that VRI was malfunctioning and no alternative aid was provided).

Defendants previously filed a motion for summary judgment arguing, in part, that the undisputed facts show they were not deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs' federally protected rights (DE 60 at 10-16). Plaintiffs' response offered no direct opposition to these deliberate indifference arguments. (DE 79). Consequently, in granting summary judgment at an earlier stage in the proceedings on a separate issue, the Court did not address Defendants' deliberate indifference arguments. (DE 133). On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit reversed the Court's order granting summary judgment as to injunctive relief, but remanded on the question of whether a triable issue of fact existed as to Defendants' alleged deliberate indifference. (DE 149 at 32). After remand, the Court permitted the Parties to brief the issue on the existing record and Defendants filed the supplement now before the Court. (DE 156). Plaintiffs Cheylla Silva and John Paul Jebian then filed a response that added new material to the record in contravention of the Court's instructions. (DE 158). Defendants then filed a reply in support of their supplement (DE 159) and the Court held oral argument (DE 160). At oral argument, the Court permitted Defendants the opportunity to file a response to Plaintiffs' new evidence (DE 162). After oral argument, Plaintiffs filed an additional notice of supplemental authority without asking leave of the Court.

Because these 25 visits were not in the operative complaint, they cannot be the basis for damages, but are nonetheless \"relevant to whether the hospitals had the requisite knowledge to establish deliberate indifference during\" the 18 visits that are the basis for Plaintiffs' RA claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Silva\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276891\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/824/\">\n     856 F.3d at 841-42\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    By Plaintiffs' recollection, on 24 relevant visits to Defendants' facilities, VRI was available but was \"never provided or was completely non-operable\"; on 12 occasions, VRI was \"available, used/functioned for a few minutes, not adequate\"; and on 9 occasions VRI was \"not available\" because Baptist Health's outpatient facilities were not equipped with VRI. (DE 158-1; DE 158-2; DE 158-3).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Plaintiffs focus heavily on purported inadequacies with Defendants' use of VRI, but their objections raise no genuine dispute of material fact as to its deliberate indifference regarding its use. For example, Plaintiffs complain that Defendants often had VRI on hand but failed to provide it; that when Defendants did provide VRI, it was inadequate; and that in some cases Defendants' facilities lacked VRI altogether. (\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    DE 158). They also cite Defendants' acknowledgement that VRI could sometimes be choppy or needed to be moved around to avoid interference from other electronic devices (DE 61 \u00b6 65). But the fact that VRI might have occasionally malfunctioned-about which the Eleventh Circuit found a triable issue as to negligence-does not alone establish deliberate indifference. Plaintiffs would also need to offer evidence that Defendants failed to address the risk the VRI malfunctions posed to their federally-protected rights. They have not offered such evidence. And they have offered no evidence to support their accusation that Defendants \"purposefully adopted\" policies to use VRI where their third-party VRI provider Language Access Network (\"LAN\") suggested such use was inappropriate. (DE 158 at 9). Indeed, save for Plaintiffs' accusation, there is no evidence that Defendants ever relied solely on VRI in situations where they knew VRI would not render effective communication.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Moreover, there is no evidence in the record that Mr. Jebian, at any time, advised the Defendants that they had violated or failed to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement they had reached over 15 years ago. (DE 59 \u00b6 67). When asked about it during his deposition, Mr. Jebian admitted that he never attempted to enforce the terms of the settlement. (DE 59-2 at 52).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    As previously noted, the Court declines to consider those visits listed in the charts that postdate the Complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    For example, in her chart, Silva states that \"VRI was not provided\" when she visited the hospital on November 29, 2010. (DE 158-1 at 5). However, when she was asked about that visit during her deposition, she testified that \"[t]hat was the day they were able to use the VRI.\" (DE 59-1 at 95-96). Similarly, Silva states in her chart that VRI did not function when she visited the hospital on January 3, 2011 (DE 158-1 at 24-25) even though at her deposition she had testified that in that visit, she got VRI and the visit was \"fairly uneventful\" (DE 59-1 at 96-98). Even if the VRI malfunctioned on some occasions, this is not enough to establish deliberate indifference.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
