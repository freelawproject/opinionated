Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 19, 2017, Plaintiff Freddie Garland (\"Garland\") commenced this action in the Circuit Court of Wayne County, Michigan against Defendants U.S. Bank, N.A. (\"U.S. Bank\"), Wells Fargo Home Mortgage Inc. (\"Wells Fargo\") and Orlans PC (\"Orlans\") (collectively \"Defendants\"), alleging\n   that Defendants U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo fraudulently claims an interest in his property (Count 1) and wrongfully initiated foreclosure proceedings against him (Count 2), requesting that the Court issue a stay on the non-judicial foreclosure of his home. Garland also alleges that Defendant Orlans Violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (Count 3). (Doc # 1-1, Pg ID 4-7) Garland also makes several other references to statutes and legal theories that do not form the basis of a cognizable claim throughout the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 11, 2017, Defendant Orlans filed a Notice of Removal in this Court. (Doc # 1) This matter is currently before the Court on Defendant Orlans' Motion to Dismiss (Doc # 4) (pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6) ) and Defendant Wells Fargo's Motion to Dismiss or, alternatively, for Summary Judgment. (Doc # 5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Garland owns certain real property located at 15307 Stout, Detroit, Michigan 48223 (the \"Property\"). (Doc # 5) In 2004, Plaintiff obtained an $89,000 loan from BNC Mortgage Inc. (the \"Loan\") (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff and his then wife, Linda Garland, gave a Mortgage against the Property as security for repayment of the Loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Loan and Mortgage were assigned to U.S. Bank in its capacity as trustee of a securitized trust. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Wells Fargo services the Loan for the bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Garland was incarcerated in the Milan Federal Penitentiary from June 8, 2008 until his release on February 17, 2017. (Doc # 7; Pg ID 5) Sometime in July 2008, Garland also indicated that his then wife would \"take care of the mortgage account.\" (Doc # 5-6) Garland kept up communication with Wells Fargo while incarcerated. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc # 5-8; Doc # 5-9; Doc # 5-10) On February 3, 2011, Garland named his the wife as his general \"power of attorney\" to conduct his affairs during his incarceration. The change was acknowledged by Wells Fargo on March 15, 2011. (Doc # 5-12)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In June 2011, Plaintiff requested assistance from the Wayne County Mortgage Foreclosure Prevention Program. (Doc # 5-13) Wells Fargo acknowledged Garland's request for third-party assistance by letter on June 20, 2011, however, Garland did not default on the Loan. (Doc # 5-14)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In June 2013, Garland changed his power of attorney to Alfreda Garland, which was acknowledged by Wells Fargo. (Doc # 5-15; Doc # 5-16) In October 2014, at a time when his mortgage obligation was past due, Garland sought mortgage assistance from Wells Fargo, but he did not default on the Loan. (Doc # 5-17; Doc # 5-18; Doc # 5-19)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Garland and his wife Linda Garland were divorced on September 22, 2015. (Doc # 7, Pg ID 12) Linda remained as Garland's power of attorney under the terms of the Separation Agreement (the \"Agreement\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Pg ID 13) The Agreement stated that Linda Garland would relinquish power of attorney no later than seven days after Garland's release from prison. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The agreement also specified that Linda and Plaintiff would \"hold the real property located at 15307 Stout, Detroit, MI 48223 ... as joint tenants with rights of survivorship until Defendant husband is released from incarceration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Linda Garland was to pay the monthly mortgage payments on Plaintiff Garland's behalf while he was incarcerated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Agreement specified that Plaintiff was to be awarded sole ownership of the Property upon his release, and hold his ex-wife free from all expenses associated with the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After his release from prison, Garland became the sole owner of the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Garland was past due on his monthly obligation on the Loan once again in February 2017. (Doc # 5-20; Doc # 5-21) On\n   March 18, 2017, on behalf of Wells Fargo, Orlans mailed Garland correspondence (the \"Letter\") that detailed Garland's default on the Loan obligations and explained that the matter was referred to Orlans for further action. (Doc # 4, Pg ID 10) The Letter directed Garland's attention to the \"Notice of Debt Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \" and relevant portions indicated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   You may have the rights to reinstate the Mortgage Loan by paying all past due installments, late charges, delinquent taxes, insurance premiums, and cost and fees incurred in the foreclosure.

In\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff argued that the defendants violated the FDCPA because they sent a letter to plaintiff which purported to state the \"amount of debt\" but only included the unpaid principal balance owed, without unpaid interest, late fees, or any other additional charges applied to the debt.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9969308\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/214/872/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9969308\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/214/872/\">\n    at 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   court determined that the unpaid principal balance was not the debt owed, and acknowledged the difficulty in correctly stating the amount owed on debt that is likely to change daily.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9969308\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/214/872/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Judge Richard Posner of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit explained: \"The [imprecise] statement does not comply with the Act....

First, this Court considers the language Orlans used in the Letter sent to Garland. Orlans stated, \"Because of interest fees, and costs, and other charges that may vary from day to day, the amount you owe at a later date may be greater than the amount state above.\n   <em>\n    Please contact Wells Fargo Home Mortgage Inc. or Orlans PC at (248) 502-1400 to obtain an updated payoff amount\n   </em>\n   .\" (Doc # 4, Pg\n   Id 10) This language is clearly different from the language authorized by the Seventh Circuit. The\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   court added, however, \"we do not hold that a debt collector\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   use this form of words to avoid violating the statute.

While Orlans did not use the specific language validated by the Seventh Circuit, the language used was substantially the same. Second, Garland never attempted to verify the amount he owed on the Loan before filing this action. Garland has not provided any information regarding his debt obligation on the Loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Taking the allegations in Garland's complaint as true, it is not clear that the amount Orlans indicated to Garland was incorrect, or that Garland sought to correct any mistakes. Garland presents only a conclusory statement that Orlans violated the FDCPA because the amount Orlans stated was significantly higher than what Garland expected. Garland did not provide any further details regarding the actual amount owed or his expectations regarding the debt on the Loan. Orlans also indicated that the amount stated was the current amount due on March 18, 2017, that the actual amount owed might be different from what was stated in the Letter, and that Garland could inquire about the amount owed. Garland has not presented any other facts or presented other evidence regarding the debt on the Loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   This Court grants Orlans' Motion and dismisses Garland's claim FDCPA claim (Count 3) against Orlans without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Wrongful Foreclosure Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Garland alleges that Wells Fargo wrongfully seeks to foreclose on his property. (Doc # 1-1, Pg ID 4) Wells Fargo argues that the facts plainly show that Garland defaulted on the Loan, and that foreclosure is lawful under the laws of Michigan. (Doc # 5, Pg ID 10)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Michigan law provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (1) A party may foreclose a mortgage by advertisement if all of the following circumstances exist:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (a) A default in a condition of the mortgage has occurred, by which the power to sell became operative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (b) An action or proceeding has not been instituted, at law, to recover the debt secured by the mortgage or any part of the mortgage or, if an action or proceeding has been instituted, either the action or proceeding has been discontinued or an execution on a judgment rendered in the action or proceeding has been returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (c) The mortgage containing the power of sale has been property recorded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (d) The party foreclosing the mortgage is either the owner of the indebtedness or of an interest in the indebtedness secured by the mortgage or the servicing agent of the mortgage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , M.C.L. 600.3204(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The following facts are uncontested: (1) Garland defaulted on his obligations under the Loan (Doc # 5-21); (2) there is no action or proceeding instituted to recover the debt secured by the Mortgage; (3) the Mortgage contains a power of sale (Doc\n   # 5-5, Pg ID 15 at \u00b6 22), and that U.S. Bank, the foreclosing party, was an owner of an interest in the indebtedness secured by the mortgage. (Doc # 5, Pg ID 13-14) The requirements of M.C.L. 600.3204(1) are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Subsection (3) of \u00a7 3204 also states: \"If the party foreclosing a mortgage by advertisement is not the original mortgagee, a record chain of title must exist before the date of sale under section 3216 evidencing the assignment of the mortgage to the party foreclosing the mortgage.\" There was also a record chain of title at the time of the foreclosure. (Doc # 5, Pg ID 14)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Garland does not dispute the facts above. Garland does, however, argue that neither U.S. Bank nor Wells Fargo is the \"owner or holder of any purported note to which [Garland] may or may not be bound to make payment.\" (Doc # 1-1; Pg ID 5) Under M.C.L. 600.3204(1)(d), U.S. Bank as the Mortgage assignee, can complete a foreclosure by advertisement because it is the owner of an interest in the \"indebtedness secured by the mortgage.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Residential Funding Co. v. Saurman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=490%20Mich.%20909\">\n    490 Mich. 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 910,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=805%20N.W.2d%20183\">\n    805 N.W.2d 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (\"[T]he Legislature's use of the phrase 'interest in the indebtedness' to denote a category of parties entitled to foreclose by advertisement indicates the intent to include mortgagees of record ... along with parties who 'own[ ] the indebtedness' and parties who act as \"the servicing agent of the mortgage.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Garland also argues that foreclosure would be improper based on a number of theories under the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Garland argues that \u00b6 6 of the Mortgage imposes a duty on Defendants to investigate and document the changes in his economic standing following his release from prison, and the failure to do so prohibits foreclosure on the Property. (Doc # 7, Pg ID 6) Garland's argument fails for two reasons. First, \u00b6 6 of the Mortgage deals with borrower occupancy of the home. (Doc # 5-5, Pg ID 9) The extenuating circumstances clause that Garland relies on does not address remedies for financial hardship nor does it impose any additional duty on Wells Fargo to investigate borrower financial hardship. Second, nothing in \u00b6 6 affects the requirements to initiate foreclosure by advertisement established in M.C.L. 600.3204.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Garland argues that he has a right to loan modification due to his financial hardship. (Doc # 7, Pg ID 6) Garland has not plead facts sufficient to establish that such a duty existed. Garland also alleges that the attempted foreclosure of his home is a violation of the federal Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), but there is no private right of action under HAMP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Garland further alleges that Wells Fargo was negligent in initiating foreclosure proceedings against him because Wells Fargo owed him a duty to help ascertain a solution to extenuating circumstances. Garland's negligence claim fails because of the well-established Michigan rule that parties are precluded from pursuing a tort remedy when the parties' relationship is governed by the terms of a contract.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sherman v. Sea Ray Boats, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"276991\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/251/41/#p52\">\n    251 Mich. App. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 52,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=649%20N.W.2d%20783\">\n    649 N.W.2d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) (\"Michigan case law expressly provides that an action in tort may not be maintained where a contractual agreement exists, unless a duty, separate and distinct from the contractual obligation, is established.\");\n   <em>\n    Garden City Osteopathic Hosp. v. HBE Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415373\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/55/1126/#p1134\">\n    55 F.3d 1126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1134 (6th Cir. 1995) (\"Michigan law 'is well-settled that an action in tort requires a breach of duty separate and distinct from a breach of contract.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Under the section of Garland's complaint titled \"SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION,\" Garland requests that this Court set \"aside or vacate the alleged\n   promissory note or mortgage\" based on his belief that he \"may or may not\" have signed the promissory note on the mortgage. (Doc # 1-1, Pg ID 5) Several documents and years of correspondence indicate that Garland did sign the note, and intended to be bound by the terms of the Mortgage and Loan. Garland signed and initialed the original Mortgage document in several places. (Doc # 5-5) Garland signed the Adjustable Rate Note. (Doc # 5-3) Garland communicated with Wells Fargo, in its capacity as servicer of the Loan, on several occasions to inquire about payments and to establish power of attorney over him during his term of imprisonment. (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc # 5-7; Doc # 5-15; Doc # 5-21; Doc # 5-24) Garland has not presented facts or offered evidence that U.S. Bank did not own the Loan or that he was not aware of his commitments under the terms of the Loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   This Court dismisses Garland's wrongful foreclosure claim with prejudice (Count 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Garland's Other Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   This Court dismisses Garland's claim for fraudulent foreclosure (Count 1) because Garland has not provided sufficient facts or case law to support his fraud claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   This Court disregards Garland's references to other statutes and legal theories throughout his complaint. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a), a claim for relief must contain a short and plain statement showing, (1) the grounds for the court's jurisdiction; (2) that the pleader is entitled to relief; and (3) a demand for the relief sought. The other statutes and legal theories referenced by Garland are incoherent, unrelated to the foreclosure of his property, and do not state a claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   This Court need not address Wells Fargo's Motion for Summary Judgment because all claims against Wells Fargo have been dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that Defendant Orlans' Motion to Dismiss (Doc # 4) is DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant Wells Fargo's Motion to Dismiss (Doc # 5) is DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   IT IS ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
