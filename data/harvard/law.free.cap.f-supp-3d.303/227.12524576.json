Bourke, Jr. (\"Bourke\") and Fireman's Fund Insurance Company (\"Fireman's Fund\"), as subrogee of Bourke, bring this diversity action against defendant MAN Engines &amp; Components, Inc. (\"MAN\") alleging that defendant breached express and implied warranties in connection with two diesel marine engines that defendant sold to Bourke. Pending before the court is defendant's motion for summary judgment against sole remaining plaintiff Fireman's Fund. (Doc. # 97.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth below, the motion is GRANTED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts, drawn from the parties' Local Rule 56(a) statements and exhibits, are undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   MAN distributes and sells diesel marine engines designed and manufactured by MAN Truck and BUS, AG. (Defendant's Local Rule 56(a)(1) Statement (\"Def. SOF\"), Doc. # 102, \u00b6 4; Plaintiff's Local Rule 56(a)(2) Statement (\"Pl. SOF\"), Doc. # 105, \u00b6 4.) MAN sold two MAN Truck and BUS, AG diesel marine engines (the \"engines\") to Bourke for installation on Bourke's motor yacht, MV Midnight. (Def. SOF \u00b6 6; Pl. SOF \u00b6 6.) Each of the engines has a component part called an intercooler. (Def. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 8-8; Pl. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) The intercoolers cool the hot charge air coming from Turbo chargers of the engines by using sea water from the ocean, which circulates through the web of tubes in the intercoolers. (Def. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; Pl. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) The cooled air then circulates into the engine where it is compressed and injected by diesel fuel. (Def. SOF \u00b6 12; Pl. SOF \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although the date of purchase is unclear,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the parties agree that the Limited Warranty for New Common Rail Marine Diesel Engines (the \"Limited Warranty\") went into effect on April 3, 2009 and expired on April 3, 2011. (Def. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 15-17; Pl. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 15-17.) The Extended Service\n   Protection Warranty (the \"Extended Service Contract\") went into effect on July 8, 2009. (Def. SOF \u00b6 21; Pl. SOF \u00b6 21.) Pursuant to the Extended Service Contract, the extended warranty expired \"on April 3, 2014 or 2500 hours, whichever comes first.\" (Def. SOF \u00b6 21; Pl. SOF \u00b6 21.) On September 16, 2012, after the expiration of the Limited Warranty, but before the Extended Service Contract expired, the engines failed. (Def. SOF \u00b6 27; Pl. SOF \u00b6 27.) Plaintiff sought repairs pursuant to the warranties. MAN authorized certain repairs which were performed by MAN-authorized service dealer Casco Bay Diesel &amp; Electric of Portland, Maine (\"Casco Bay\"). (Def. SOF \u00b6 28; Pl. SOF \u00b6 28.) Casco Bay then performed additional repairs, which defendant says were unauthorized and plaintiff maintains were \"implicitly authorized.\" (Def. SOF \u00b6 29; Pl.
