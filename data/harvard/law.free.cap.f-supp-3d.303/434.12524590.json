Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This action-and the primary case to which it is related,\n   <em>\n    Lula Williams, et al. v. Big Picture Loans, LLC, et al.\n   </em>\n   , 3:17-cv-461-revolves around the role of Matt Martorello (\"Martorello\") in the creation of a lending business, Big Picture Loans, LLC (\"Big Picture\"), by the Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians (\"the Tribe\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Big Picture offers\n   short-term, high-interest loans through its website. Before Big Picture was formed, Bellicose Capital (\"Bellicose\"), a company in which Martorello had a significant ownership stake, provided marketing, underwriting, and related services to another lending entity that the Tribe had created. Then, in January 2016, Bellicose was purchased by a separate tribal entity, Tribal Acquisition Company, LLC (\"TAC\"). TAC dissolved after transferring control of Bellicose to another tribal entity, Tribal Economic Development Holdings, Inc. (\"TED\"). As part of this transaction, the Tribe and another company, which is managed by a separate entity of which Martorello is president, entered into a note requiring variable payments over the course of a seven-year term (\"the Note\"). Martorello Certification (ECF No. 1-1) \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Given the complicated nature of the transaction and the possibility of audits and litigation based on the terms of the Note, Martorello's tax attorneys recommended that he engage a third party to provide a valuation of the Note.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. The parties dispute whether Martorello or Bellicose engaged Aranca, Inc. (\"Aranca\") to complete that valuation. Plaintiffs highlight the report prepared by Aranca (\"the Valuation Report\"), which states that Aranca \"has been engaged by Bellicose ... to conduct valuation analysis and prepare a written report to express an opinion on the 'Fair Market Value' [of] [Bellicose].\" Valuation Report (ECF No. 8-2) (Under Seal) at 5. In contrast, Martorello asserts that he engaged Aranca, and the engagement letter between Aranca and Kairos PR, LLC (\"Kairos\")-an entity of which Martorello was the president-says that Kairos \"desires to retain A[ranca] to perform certain designated valuation services ... and to provide [Kairos] with a certain valuation report.\" Engagement Letter (ECF No. 12) at 1; Martorello Certification \u00b6 6. In any event, after Aranca was engaged, Martorello provided it with certain documents, including the documents at issue here, to enable Aranca to accurately valuate the Note. In addition, Martorello's attorneys at times interacted directly with Aranca's employees about the valuation. Martorello Certification \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. Aranca then completed the Valuation Report on May 5, 2017. Valuation Report at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 22, 2017, Lula Williams, Gloria Turnage, George Hengle, Dowin Coffy, and Felix Gillison, Jr. (\"Plaintiffs\") brought suit in the related case against Big Picture, Martorello, and other tribal entities and officials, alleging that they violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and Virginia usury laws by conspiring to offer loans to Plaintiffs and other Virginia residents at extremely high annual percentage rates without obtaining the requisite licenses to do so. After Defendants indicated that they would seek dismissal of the Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction, among other grounds, the Court ordered the parties to conduct jurisdictional discovery. Sept. 1 Order (ECF No. 17, Docket No. 3:17-cv-461). The Court later rejected Defendants' objections to Plaintiffs' third-party subpoenas on the basis that they were \"intended to frustrate business operations.\" Oct. 18 Order (ECF No. 49, Docket No. 3:17-cv-461) at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Oct. 16 Transcript (ECF No. 48, Docket No. 3:17-cv-461) at 23:4-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Martorello produced a copy of the Valuation Report in the course of jurisdictional discovery. Then, on October 27, 2017, Plaintiffs served a subpoena on Aranca (\"the Subpoena\") that sought, in relevant part: (1) \"[a]ll documents submitted by ... Martorello ... as part of [Aranca's] engagement with Bellicose\"; (2) \"[a]ll documents submitted by any third parties that\n   were reviewed and/or considered by [Aranca] as part of [its] business valuation of Bellicose\"; and (3) \"[a]ll e-mail correspondence between any employee, officer, director, and/or representative of Aranca and ... Martorello.\" Subpoena (ECF No. 7-2), Ex. A \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 6. The Subpoena required Aranca to produce the requested documents by November 15, 2017. Subpoena at 1. However, after conferring on November 10, Plaintiffs' counsel, Andrew Guzzo (\"Guzzo\"), and Aranca's counsel, Fenn Horton III (\"Horton\"), agreed to extend Aranca's deadline to respond to November 30. Horton then sent Aranca's objections to the Subpoena to Guzzo on November 22. The objections stated in part that certain requests called for information protected by the attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Subpoena Objections (ECF No. 1-1) at 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 27, Martorello's counsel contacted Aranca's counsel to notify them that some of Aranca's documents were privileged and should be withheld at Martorello's direction. Boughrum Decl. (ECF No. 12-1) \u00b6 8. Then, on November 29, Martorello's counsel, Richard Scheff (\"Scheff\"), notified Guzzo that he had identified responsive documents in Aranca's possession that were subject to the attorney-client privilege, and that Martorello intended to file a motion for a protective order, or to quash, \"by early next week.\" ECF No. 7-6 at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then, on December 1, Martorello provided Plaintiffs with a privilege log containing 102 documents, asserting that every document therein was protected by the attorney-client privilege, and two also by the work-product doctrine. Boughrum Decl. \u00b6 10; Privilege Log (ECF No. 1-1) at 20-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When Aranca did not produce any documents by November 30, Guzzo contacted Horton, who expressed his understanding that there was an agreement to give Bellicose \"a few more days\" to move for a protective order regarding the Subpoena, and that Aranca did not need to respond until that motion was resolved. ECF No. 7-6 at 6. After Guzzo clarified Plaintiffs' expectations, Aranca still did not produce the documents. On December 5, Horton indicated that he was separating non-privileged documents (which would be produced) from privileged documents (which would be withheld pending resolution of \"Bellicose's\" expected motion). However, he further stated that, if he was \"not served soon with [that motion],\" he would consider that failure \"a waiver of the privilege by Bellicose\" and would produce both privileged and non-privileged documents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Aranca subsequently produced the non-privileged documents on December 8, Boughrum Decl. \u00b6 15, but it is still withholding the purportedly privileged documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 7, Martorello's counsel suggested a meet-and-confer to Plaintiffs' counsel about Martorello's privilege claims. The parties agreed to table that discussion so that Plaintiffs could focus on an upcoming filing deadline in the related case. The meet-and-confer did not occur until December 11. Martorello's counsel then notified Plaintiffs' counsel on December 19 that Martorello did not agree with Plaintiffs' arguments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Martorello finally moved to quash the Subpoena on December 21, 2017. ECF No. 1. He filed the motion in the Northern District of California, where the Subpoena requires Aranca's compliance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Subpoena at 1; Fed. R. Civ. P. 45 (d)(3)(A). After the motion became ripe, that court transferred it here on February 6, 2018 finding that \"exceptional circumstances\" existed because this Court issued the orders governing the scope of jurisdictional discovery, under which Plaintiffs served the Subpoena.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 14-15; Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Subpoena was issued pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 45. Under that rule, a subpoena can demand \"production of documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things at a place within 100 miles of where the [recipient] resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 45 (c)(2)(A). However, \"[o]n timely motion,\" a court \"must quash or modify a subpoena that,\" as relevant here, \"requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, if no exception or waiver applies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   45 (d) (3) (A) (iii). Courts have broad discretion in determining whether a movant has established that predicate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cook v. Howard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=484%20Fed.%20Appx.%20805\">\n    484 Fed.Appx. 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 812 (4th Cir. 2012) (\"District courts are afforded broad discretion with respect to discovery generally, and motions to quash subpoenas specifically.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court must first decide whether Martorello has standing to quash the Subpoena. The Subpoena is, of course, directed at Aranca, and not Martorello, who is a party in the related case. \"Ordinarily, a party does not have standing to challenge a subpoena issued to a nonparty unless the party claims some personal right or privilege in the information sought by the subpoena.\"\n   <em>\n    Singletary v.

Va. 2004),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Martorello has credibly asserted that some documents requested in the Subpoena are protected by the attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine. Whether those privilege claims should prevail is a separate question that concerns the merits of Martorello's motion to quash, not his standing to bring it. Furthermore, Martorello is \"a party-[d]efendant] to th[e] litigation, with interests adverse to Plaintiff[s].\"\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1336291\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/223/304/#p306\">\n    223 F.R.D. at 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   , Martorello has standing to challenge the Subpoena on privilege grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Alleged Deficiencies of Subpoena\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before discussing the substance of his privilege claims, Martorello notes two mistakes by Plaintiffs that, he claims, are fatal flaws to the Subpoena. First, he argues that the Subpoena is \"procedurally deficient\" because it seeks documents relating to a party, Martorello, that has not asserted jurisdictional defenses, and which have no bearing on other Defendants' jurisdictional arguments. Thus, Martorello says, the Subpoena is merits discovery masquerading\n   as jurisdictional discovery, and Plaintiffs have not engaged in the Rule 26(f) conference required to engage in that merits discovery. Second, Martorello asserts that the Subpoena is \"substantively deficient\" because it states that Aranca must produce documents pursuant to Rule 34, rather than Rule 45, and this error is not harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Both arguments are misguided. Martorello's first contention misunderstands the scope of the jurisdictional discovery authorized by the Court. Martorello concedes that Plaintiffs are permitted to serve subpoenas as a part of jurisdictional discovery, as the Court has already recognized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 16 Transcript at 23:20-22 (\"[ ]I]t's perfectly all right to use any procedural vehicle authorized by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in pursuit of the discovery about a jurisdictional issue ....\"). He contends, however, that documents relating to the Valuation Report could not be relevant to the jurisdictional issues because Martorello himself has not asserted any jurisdictional defenses, and the privileged information only concerns Martorello's tax planning. But these relevance assertions are belied by the fact that Martorello himself produced the Valuation Report in the course of jurisdictional discovery because it contained information about Bellicose's operations. Consequently, it is reasonable for Plaintiffs to believe that communications and documents sent by Martorello to Aranca reasonably can be expected to shed light on Bellicose's operations, and thus it was reasonable for Plaintiffs to seek those documents from Aranca. Therefore, the Subpoena did not exceed on its face the scope of jurisdictional discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Martorello's second argument overlooks the language of the full Subpoena that Aranca received. Exhibit A to the Subpoena states that Aranca is required to produce the requested documents pursuant to Rule 34. But that exhibit is attached to a form subpoena, which notes throughout that Aranca's obligations are set by Rule 45, and even includes a full page with the relevant text of that rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Subpoena at 1, 3. As a result, Aranca would have been fully aware that the rule number mentioned in Exhibit A was a typographical error, which does not make the Subpoena substantively deficient. Thus, both of Martorello's facial attacks on the Subpoena fail, and the Court must turn to the merits of his motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Timeliness of Martorello's Objections and Motion to Quash\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As an initial matter, Plaintiffs assert that the Court cannot consider Martorello's assertions of privilege because: (1) neither Aranca nor Martorello timely objected to the Subpoena, thus waiving any privilege objection; and (2) Martorello did not timely file his motion to quash. Those arguments are addressed in turn below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Timeliness of Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A subpoena recipient can assert objections, but they \"must be served before the earlier of the time specified for compliance or 14 days after the subpoena is served.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 45 (d)(2)(B). Normally, failure to object timely waives any objection, including privilege.\n   <em>\n    Bell Inc. v. GE Lighting, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 6:14-CV-00012,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201630754\">\n    2014 WL 1630754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (W.D. Va. Apr. 23, 2014) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Motorsports Merch. Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"603318\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/186/344/#p349\">\n    186 F.R.D. 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 349 (W.D. Va. 1999) (citing cases). Untimely objections may, however, be considered in \"unusual circumstances and for good cause shown,\" including \"where counsel for the nonparty and for the subpoenaing party were in contact with respect to the nonparty's compliance prior to the time the nonparty challenged the subpoena.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201630754\">\n    2014 WL 1630754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *9 (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Aranca's objections were clearly untimely. The Subpoena was served on October 27, 2017, and the original production date was November 15. The parties later agreed to extend that deadline to November 30. But the parties' agreement cannot change the plain language of Rule 45, which requires objections to be served \"before\n   <em>\n    the earlier of\n   </em>\n   \" the production date or 14 days after service of the subpoena. Fed. R. Civ. P. 45 (d)(2)(B). Accordingly, Aranca needed to object before November 10, 14 days after October 27 or secure an extension of time from the Court. The parties' communications do not indicate that the extension of the production date was also intended to apply to Aranca's objections. Indeed, Horton did not appear to be aware that Aranca was in non-compliance with Rule 45 when he served the objections on November 22.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 7-5 at 9. Under the circumstances presented by the record, the Court can find no good cause to consider Aranca's objections, and they must be considered waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   However, Aranca's waiver of its objections does not affect Martorello's privilege claims. \"A party cannot object to a subpoena duces tecum served on a nonparty, but rather, must seek a protective order or make a motion to quash.\"\n   <em>\n    Moon v. SCP Pool Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"949939\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/232/633/#p636\">\n    232 F.R.D. 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 636 (C.D. Cal. 2005). In other words, even though Aranca waived any privilege objections that it might have, Martorello could still have preserved his privilege challenges by timely moving to quash. Whether Martorello's privilege arguments can be entertained, therefore, depends on whether his motion was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Timeliness of Motion to Quash\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A movant must satisfy the threshold requirement of filing a \"timely motion\" before a court can quash a subpoena under the mandatory provisions of Rule 45 (d)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 45 (d)(3)(A). That rule does not explain what makes a motion timely, so district courts have developed two approaches to decide the timeliness of a motion to quash. Under the older approach, the motion must be filed within the 14-day deadline for serving objections set by Rule 45(d)(2)(B).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tutor-Saliba Corp. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"765391\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/30/155/#p156\">\n    30 Fed.Cl. 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 156 (1993) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    WM High Yield v.

It was not filed until December 21, well after the 14-day objection deadline of November 10. Likewise, the motion was filed more than a month after the original return date of\n   November 15, and several weeks after the amended return date of November 30.

He first asserts that his motion was timely because it was filed by December 8, when Aranca produced the non-privileged documents in response to the Subpoena.

Because Martorello is a party in the related case, he would have first become aware of the Subpoena on or around October 27, when it was served on Aranca.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(a)(4). Martorello did not discover the purportedly privileged documents until November 27, apparently because of Aranca's slow response to the Subpoena. Martorello's counsel, Scheff, conferred with Plaintiffs' counsel on November 29. Then, despite Scheff's statement that Martorello would move to quash the Subpoena \"by early next week,\" Martorello's counsel for some reason did not initiate another meet-and-confer until December 7-a week after the agreed-upon production date had already passed. And, even after the meet-and-confer occurred, Martorello's counsel did not formally reject Plaintiffs' privilege arguments until December 19, a further delay of eight days. Therefore, this situation is nothing like the one in\n   <em>\n    Hartz Mountain Corp. v. Chanelle Pharmaceutical Veterinary Products Manufacturing Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12254019\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/235/535/\">\n    235 F.R.D. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.

Engaging in fruitless meet-and-confers is not the same as negotiating an agreement for document production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This result does not change because Martorello's untimely filing might not have prejudiced Plaintiffs in the related case. Rule 45(d) (3) (A) does not provide that prejudice (or lack thereof) to the party serving the subpoena is a consideration in deciding if a motion to quash is timely. The only court to have considered it as a factor relevant to timeliness did so in the context of the good cause analysis detailed in\n   <em>\n    Moon\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chao\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205988617\">\n    2012 WL 5988617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.

The parties' disagreement, though, concerns two different aspects of the privilege: (1) whether Martorello engaged Aranca, and is thereby the client who has standing to assert the privilege; and (2) whether, if Martorello does have standing, he waived the privilege by providing the communications at issue to Aranca.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The word \"client\" carries two meanings within the context of this dispute: someone must have been a client of the attorneys named in the privilege log, and someone (not necessarily the same person) must have been a client of Aranca. Martorello contends that he is the client in both senses; he had previously engaged his tax attorneys, and then engaged\n   Aranca at his attorneys' direction to properly valuate the Note for tax purposes. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, assert that, although Martorello may have engaged the attorneys with whom he made the underlying communications, Bellicose was Aranca's client because Bellicose engaged Aranca to complete the valuation. Therefore, Bellicose is the true holder of any privilege that attached to communications between Martorello and Aranca in which Martorello forwarded confidential communications. Because control of Bellicose was transferred to TAC and then TED, \"the authority to assert and waive [Bellicose]'s attorney-client privilege\" has likewise passed to TED's current management.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v.

The record reflects that three different parties might have engaged Aranca. First, the Valuation Report states that Aranca \"has been engaged by Bellicose ... to conduct valuation analysis and prepare a written report to express an opinion on the 'Fair Market Value' [of] [Bellicose] along with allocation of 'Fair Market Value' between [Bellicose's] tangible and intangible assets.\" Valuation Report at 5. In addition, Aranca's counsel, Horton, consistently referred to \"Bellicose's\" motion for a protective order, implying that Aranca believed Bellicose held all applicable privileges. Second, Martorello says in his certification that he engaged Aranca himself. Martorello Certification \u00b6 6. Third, the Engagement Letter indicates that Kairos, a third party led by Martorello, was \"retain[ing] A[ranca] to perform certain designated valuation services ... and to provide [Kairos] with [the] ... [V]aluation [R]eport.\" Engagement Letter at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Martorello may be right that Bellicose is unlikely to be the privilege holder, given that it had already been sold to TAC by the time that Martorello contacted Aranca, and there was no apparent interaction between Aranca and TAC after Aranca was engaged. Nevertheless, the evidence that Martorello has submitted does not establish with any certainty that Martorello himself engaged Aranca. Indeed, Martorello relies exclusively on the Engagement Letter to support his argument, but that letter does not identify him as Aranca's client. To the contrary, it plainly states that the agreement for Aranca to complete certain \"business valuation services\" was \"by and between A[ranca] and\n   <em>\n    your company\n   </em>\n   , identified above,\" which is Kairos.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202584\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/343/#p349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In fact, aside from being addressed to and signed by Martorello as Kairos' president, the Engagement Letter does not reference Martorello by name at all. Kairos may still be solvent and managed by Martorello, giving him the authority to assert the attorney-client privilege on its behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weintraub\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202584\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/343/#p349\">\n    471 U.S. at 349-350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202584,6124730\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/105/1986/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he corporate attorney-client privilege rests with the corporation's management and is normally exercised by its officers and directors\"). But it is equally plausible that Kairos, like Bellicose, has been sold or has new management. In any case, Martorello has made no attempt to prove that he currently manages Kairos, instead completely ignoring the distinction between the privilege being possessed by Kairos or by Martorello. Therefore, he has\n   not established that he is the party entitled to assert the privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Waiver\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Furthermore, even if Martorello had standing to assert the privilege, his privilege claim fails because he disclosed the privileged information to Aranca for purposes other than securing legal advice. As the privilege holder, the client can waive otherwise privileged materials by \"ma[king] any disclosure of a confidential communication to any individual who is not embraced by the privilege.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Subpoena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9099089\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/341/331/#p336\">\n    341 F.3d 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 336 (4th Cir. 2003) (internal quotations omitted). Where waiver is an issue, the proponent of the privilege bears the burden of showing both \"that an attorney-client relationship existed, [and] also that the particular communications at issue are privileged and that the privilege was not waived.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9099089\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/341/331/#p336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9099089\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/341/331/#p336\">\n    at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   At the same time, not every disclosure of a confidential communication to a third party destroys the privilege.

Martorello Reply (ECF No. 12) at 7. According to Martorello, the privilege log reveals that his attorneys were actively involved in helping Aranca, as all parties were working towards the same goal of accurately valuating Bellicose for tax purposes. But this statement does not accurately characterize the privilege log; almost all of the entries are described as either \"[e]-mail communication between ... Martorello and Aranca including ... Martorello relaying\" confidential information, or \"[e]-mail communication from ... Martorello to Aranca forwarding\" confidential information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Privilege Log at 20-22. That language does not imply extensive, or, indeed, any, involvement by Martorello's attorneys. In fact, it suggests the opposite: that Martorello sent, and presumably received, the majority of the communications with Aranca for his personal benefit. This evidence of limited attorney involvement weighs in favor of finding waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Black &amp; Decker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633386\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/219/87/#p90\">\n    219 F.R.D. at 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Moreover, Martorello's argument focuses on the wrong issue. The determinative factor is that Aranca was engaged for the sole purpose of \"perform[ing] certain business valuation services\" and \"conducting valuation analysis\" for Martorello's tax purposes. Engagement Letter at 1; Valuation Report at 5; Martorello Certification \u00b6 5. Put differently, Aranca was engaged to better help Martorello understand the effect of the Bellicose sale and the Note on his taxes. Courts have rejected the extension of the attorney-client privilege in similar circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adlman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416071\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/68/1495/#p1500\">\n    68 F.3d at 1500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If the facts were that [the client] furnished information to [its accounting firm] to seek [the firm]'s expert advice on the tax implications of the proposed transaction, no privilege would apply.\");\n   <em>\n    Black &amp; Decker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633386\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/219/87/#p90\">\n    219 F.R.D. at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Given the complexity of the transactions at issue, it is understandable why plaintiff ... retain[ed] the services of [its agent] to help evaluate the tax and business implications of the transaction.

Furthermore, the purpose of Aranca's valuation activities illustrates why\n   <em>\n    Grand Jury Proceedings Under Seal\n   </em>\n   is not analogous to this case. The client in that case consulted with his accountant because he was the subject of a grand jury investigation into his tax returns, and those communications were intended to help the attorney defend the client in the investigation.\n   <em>\n    Grand Jury Proceedings Under Seal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525531\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/947/1188/#p1191\">\n    947 F.2d at 1189, 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, however, Martorello was not the subject of any investigation or proceeding at the time he engaged Aranca, and he has not identified how Aranca's work helped his attorneys provide\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   instead of\n   <em>\n    tax\n   </em>\n   services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Martorello's reading takes the attorney-client privilege far beyond the narrow scope that the Fourth Circuit has prescribed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The mere fact that an attorney recommended a transaction, as Martorello's attorneys did, \"does not place a cloak of secrecy around all the incidents of [that] transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Fischel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"951373\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/557/209/#p212\">\n    557 F.2d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 212 (9th Cir. 1977).
