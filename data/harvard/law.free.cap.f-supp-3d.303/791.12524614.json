More specifically, patent holder GS CleanTech Corporation (\"CleanTech\") has moved for summary judgment of infringement of what has been termed the \" '858 patent family:\" U.S. Patent Nos. 7,601,858 (the \" '858 patent\") ; 8,008,516 (the \" '516 patent\"), 8,008,517 (the \" '516 patent\") ; and 8,283,484 (the \" '484 patent\"), collectively; against the Plant Defendants in this Multi-District Litigation (\"MDL\").

The Plant Defendants have moved for summary judgment of non-infringement as to the '858 patent family. MDN 932. As an alternative defense, the Plant Defendants assert that CleanTech lacks standing to bring any claims with respect to the patents-in-suit because it failed to establish title to them in its opening brief. MDN 932, at 49;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   MDN 1096, at 29-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   With respect to non-infringement specifically, Defendants Ace, Adkins, Al-Corn, Blue Flint, Bushmills, Cardinal, CVEC, Heartland, Iroquois, Lincolnland, Lincolnway and UWGP claim they are entitled to summary judgment on all of CleanTech's claims of infringement as to the '858 patent family either for the entire relevant period or for some relevant period because they add chemicals as an intervening, non-disclosed and disavowed step in their oil recovery processes. Independently, all the Plant Defendants claim they are entitled to summary judgment of non-infringement as to Claim 15 of the '858 patent ; Claim 10 of the '516 patent ; and Claims 1-3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12-14, 16, 17, 19-24 and 26-29 of the '484 patent ; because none of them dries thin stillage concentrate or concentrated byproduct as required by those claims. Defendants Ace, Adkins, Al-Corn, Blue Flint, Bushmills, CVEC, Heartland, Iroquois, Lincolnway, and UWGP assert that they are entitled to summary judgment of non-infringement as to Claims 7-10 of the '516 patent and Claims 8, 10, 12-14, and 27 of the '484 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Further, Iroquois argues that it is entitled to summary judgment of noninfringement as to Claims 2 and 9 of the '516 patent, and Claim 14 of the '484 patent for independent reasons. MDN 923. Lincolnway joins Iroquois' argument with respect to Claim 9 of the '516 patent. MDN 930.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition, Cardinal asserts that it is entitled to summary judgment on all of CleanTech's infringement claims against it because CleanTech and the Court have impermissibly broadened the scope of the term \"oil\" during claim construction and urges the Court to clarify the scope of that term. MDN 924. If the Court does so as Cardinal urges, Cardinal argues that its process cannot infringe the claims of the '858 patent family.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ace and GEA Mechanical Equipment US, Inc.

Vander Griend (all original defendants, collectively, \"Defendants\"); have moved for summary judgment as to their affirmative defense and/or counterclaim of invalidity of the '858 patent family, as to CleanTech's request for provisional remedies and as to CleanTech's request for enhanced damages for willful infringement of the '858 patent family. MDN 940. CleanTech has cross-moved for summary judgment of no invalidity under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against these Defendants.

MDN 1096 at 29-30. The Plant Defendants list the following as the chain of title set forth in those records:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   On June 1, 2005, [David] Winsness and [David] Cantrell assigned [their] rights \"in and to any and all patents ... issued for [the alleged] inventions\" described in the provisional application to which the patents-in-suit claim priority to Ethanol Oil Recovery Systems LLC (\"EORS\"). On January 25, 2007, EORS assigned those rights to Cantrell Winsness Techs., LLC, which had previously changed its name to Mean Green Biofuels of Georgia, LLC (\"Mean Green\") on December 21, 2006, and its successors. On April 4, 207, Mean Green then assigned the rights to GS Ethanol Techs., Inc. (\"GSET\"). On January 11, 2008, GSET and 16 other entities collectively executed a Security Agreement, conditionally assigning their individual property to YA Global Investments, L.P. (\"YA Global\"). On May 15, 2009, GSET purported to assign the patent application that led to the '858 [p]atent, and \"any and all Patents that may be issued therefrom ...., including all revivals, refilings, continuations, continuations-in-part, divisions and reissues thereof\" to GS CleanTech Corp. Finally, on June 30, 2009, GreenShift Corp. (f/k/a GS CleanTech Corp.), GS CleanTech Corp. (f/k/a GSET), and 16 other entities executed\n   an amendment to the January 11, 2008 Security Agreement, ratifying, confirming, and reaffirming the terms therein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   MDN 1096 at 30 (citing MDN 1036-1 at 6-8, 10-14, 16-17, 19-20, 25-43, 45-46, 52-61 (internal citations omitted) ). According to the Plant Defendants, the first of the two holes in the chain of title occurred when GSET made the conditional assignment to YA Global and transferred \"continuing interest\" and the \"power of sale\" to YA Global, which the Plant Defendant claim vested title to the patents-in-suit with YA Global upon recording of the Security Agreement with the PTO.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639103\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/67/#p81\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 30-31 (citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , MDN 1036-1 at 27, 30;\n   <em>\n    Waterman v.

Therefore, the Plant Defendants claim that GSET's subsequent assignment to CleanTech is void.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The second hole in the chain of title the Plant Defendants assert is that when CleanTech and its parent, GreenShift, failed to file Delaware state taxes by March 1, 2012, CleanTech's right to maintain a legal action became inoperative unless cured.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing MDN 1097-1 &amp; 1097-2); 8 Del. Code \u00a7\u00a7 312 &amp; 510. CleanTech asserts that the agreement between GSET and YA Global merely granted YA Global a security interest in the patents. MDN 1137, at 10-13. As such, like all security interests under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\"), the Security Agreement did not convey title to YA Global.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. In addition, CleanTech argues that the Plant Defendants misstate the language of the Security Agreement: where they say that the document conveyed \"a continuing interest in the patents,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (citing MDN 1096 at 30-31), the agreement actually grants YA Global \"a continuing\n   <em>\n    security\n   </em>\n   interest\" in the patents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting MDN 1036-1 at 27, Section 2, adding emphasis). Therefore, recording the Security Agreement did not transfer title; it only perfected YA Global's security interest in the patents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. In addition, CleanTech contends that it has paid its taxes and is in good standing; but even if it was not, the inadvertent failure to pay franchise taxes under Delaware law would not divest CleanTech of standing since it would \"always continue[ ] as a 'body corporate' for purposes of this litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10 &amp; n.9 (citing 8 Del. C. \u00a7 278;\n   <em>\n    Krapf &amp; Son, Inc. v.

As CleanTech suggests, the Plant Defendants rely upon incomplete language from the Security Agreement. By its terms, the grantors were not conveying title to the intellectual property; they were conveying a security interest in it. MDN 1036-1 at 27. Moreover, the Plant Defendants point to nothing in the language of the Security Agreement that evidences any intent for the title of the patents to pass to the Secured Party when the security interest was recorded. Absent such language of intent, there was no transfer of title. Further, CleanTech has paid its taxes and is in good standing as of January 30, 2014. MDN 1137-1 &amp; 1137-2. In addition, CleanTech has evidenced that under Delaware law, even if the company had been dissolved for not paying its taxes, it would still operate with respect to any litigation for at least three years. 8 Del. C. \u00a7 278. For these reasons, the Plant Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment as to the issue of standing is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A. THE PROCESSES IN GENERAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Each of the Plant Defendants processes corn to produce ethanol and employs a corn oil extraction system to separate corn oil from evaporated thin stillage. MDN 878 at 7-9; MDN 986 at 6-7. Ace, Adkins, Al-Corn, BRWB, Cardinal, CVEC, Lincolnland and Lincolnway first began to extract corn oil from syrup or thin stillage in or around 2008; Heartland started to use its own corn oil extraction system in one plant in 2007, and in both by 2008; Blue Flint, Bushmills, BR-G, Iroquois and UWGP began to extract corn oil from syrup or thin stillage in or around 2009. MDN 878 at 9; MDN 986 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although there are some differences in individual processes that the Court will outline as necessary, at each of the Plant Defendants' facilities, whole stillage, a byproduct of the corn to ethanol production process, is separated into a substance that is essentially solids and is known in the industry as wet distillers grains or wet cake; and a substance that is primarily fluid and is known in the industry as thin stillage, which includes water, oil and solids.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   MDN 878 at 10; MDN 986 at 8. At the Ace, Blue Flint, Bushmills, CVEC, Lincolnland and UWGP facilities, that separation is facilitated by the use of a decanter centrifuge. MDN 878 at 10; MDN 1037-2 (Bushmills). Bushmills and Heartland add a chemical to the portion known as thin stillage before anything else is done with the material. MDN 932 at 15 (Bushmills) &amp; 16-17 (Heartland). Then, as to all Defendants, the portion known as thin stillage (or thin stillage plus chemical) is pumped through an evaporation system (a system that varies by Defendant), which produces a material known in the industry as syrup, which again contains water, oil and solids. MDN 878 at 11; MDN 986 at 8. Ace introduces a chemical to the syrup before it is pumped to a holding tank. MDN 932 at 6-7. Several other Plant Defendants including Adkins, Al-Corn, Blue Flint, Bushmills, Cardinal, CVEC, Iroquois, Lincolnland, Lincolnway, and UWGP, mix in a chemical with the syrup after the evaporation step. MDN 932 at 15, 37-38; MDN 949-39 (Iroquois). The Plant Defendants that use a chemical additive at some point before the pre-centrifugation (or pre-mechanical) processing step started using chemicals at different points in time to improve their oil recovery. MDN 932 at 37-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Next, the syrup is passed through one or more centrifuges to separate the syrup into two output streams: one is a light phase consisting of oil, water and solids, which the Court and the parties will sometimes refer to as the \"oil stream\"; the other one is reduced oil syrup. MDN 878 at 11-12; MDN 932 at 5; MDN 986 at 8-9; MDN 1179 at 15. The light phase stream is put into tanks where, for nearly all of the Plant Defendants, the solids and water are allowed to settle or are otherwise further separated. MDN 878 at 12-13; MDN 932 at 5, 18, 21, 23-24; MDN 881-22 (Heartland); MDN 1037-3 (UWGP); MDN 986 at 9: MDN 1179 at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The parties dispute whether the evidence supports CleanTech's assertion that the Plant Defendants' processes run in a \"continuous fashion\" as required by some of the asserted claims of the '858 patent family. MDN 878 at 13; MDN 932 at 8, 16, 18, 20, 22, 23-24, 31; MDN 923; MDN 930. Iroquois and Lincolnway specifically argue that their systems are not continuous.

The Court addresses each one in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   <strong>\n    A. THE \"OIL\" &amp; \"SUBSTANTIALLY FREE OF OIL\" TERMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   As previously mentioned, Cardinal challenges the Court's construction of the so-called \"oil\" term where the Court has construed the term \" oil\" to mean \"substantially (meaning largely or mostly) oil.\" MDN 924. The Plant Defendants also urge the Court to further refine the scope of \"substantially oil free,\" where the Court has construed \"substantially\" to mean \"largely or mostly,\" or reject CleanTech's evidence as to this term because CleanTech's expert's conclusion that 51% of the oil removed meets the definition is without a scientific foundation. MDN 932 at 44-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     \"Oil\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   With respect to the term \"oil,\" Cardinal argues that the Court has improperly rewritten the scope of the claims by concluding that \"oil\" means \"substantially oil,\" which means \"largely or mostly oil,\" because adding \"substantially\" allows for greater leeway than the term \"oil\" alone. MDN 924 at 2-3. Cardinal contends that \"[t]he patentee's choice of language did not equivocate as to the nature of the oil recovered, or include as part of the recovery anything other than oil. The use of the term 'substantially' is a known claiming method to prevent exactness as to the claimed outcome. The patentee did not include such language in its claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Further, Cardinal asserts that the specification confirms that the patentees meant what they said, \"oil,\" without qualification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6. Further, without guidance in the '858 patent for the scope of the Court's \"substantially oil\" definition, Cardinal argues that \"CleanTech has taken the liberty of reading the 'substantially oil' limitation on a wide range of oil quan[tities] represented by CleanTech's testing of all Defendants' product streams exiting the centrifuge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   CleanTech asserts that there is no basis for reconsideration of the Court's claim construction because Cardinal's arguments are not new. MDN 1025 at 43-45 (citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , MDN 120, 688, 692 and 694). Further, CleanTech argues that Cardinal is merely asking the Court to limit the\n   term oil to the amounts and or teachings of Figure 2, which has been rejected as the proper way to interpret the \"oil\" term.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45. CleanTech also contends that the experts understood the Court's construction to mean that the oil stream contained at least 51% oil; therefore, the term is not indefinite.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45. In addition, CleanTech incorporated by reference its previous arguments regarding proper construction of the \"oil\" term.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46 (citing MDN 118, 121, 464).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   The '037 Defendants repeat Cardinal's argument with respect to the term \"oil\" in the '037 patent. In support of their argument, the '037 Defendants specifically reference the use of the term \"oil\" in the '858 patent family specification as well as similar, un-modified usages of the term in the '037 patent specification and claims. MDN 1072 at 35-41. They agree that the Court impermissibly broadened the scope of the claim language that was intended to be narrow.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-41. In response to these arguments, CleanTech asserts that the Court has declined to re-address this term before and should do so again and states in a footnote that if the Court should decide to reconsider the issue, CleanTech would like the opportunity to brief it. MDN 1160 at 12-13 &amp; n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   The Court declines Cardinal's and the '037 Defendants' invitation to reconsider construction of the term \"oil.\" It is true that the term \"oil\" in the claims of the '858 patent family is not preceded by a qualifier; however, that could mean anything from \"any amount of oil\" to \"pure oil\" and anything in between. In its past claim construction orders, the Court endeavored to follow the pertinent claim construction rules to identify any quantity or quality limitations on the term \"oil\" in the intrinsic evidence. The Court has consistently concluded that the specification identifies the invention broadly enough in too many places to limit the scope of the term \"oil\" to the quantity/quality delineated by the descriptions of the preferred embodiments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MDN 169 at 20-23; MDN 784 at 20-23; MDN 118 at 14-15; MDN 121 at 17-21; MDN 464 at 17. In other words, the Court has found no principled way within the intrinsic evidence to limit the \"oil\" term other than to adopt CleanTech's proffered language of \"substantially,\" meaning \"largely (but not wholly) or mostly.\" The inventors simply did not include in the claims any efficiency or quantity/quality requirements with respect to the \"oil\" term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Yes, descriptions of the preferred embodiments refer to usable oil, col3, ll53-55; col3, l59 to col4, l7; but many other aspects of the invention are more broadly written. '858 Patent, Abstract; col2, ll21-22, 26-27, 37; col2, ll43-44; col2, ll51, 54; col 2 l61. Further, the specification leaves open the specific parameters under which one of ordinary skill in the art can obtain the results identified in the preferred embodiment. The '858 patent family specification teaches:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-239\">\n   Reference is made to FIGS.\n   <strong>\n    3\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    4\n   </strong>\n   , which illustrate a prophetic comparison between one processing method and the inventive method. The set-up is essentially the same as shown in FIGS.\n   <strong>\n    1\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    2\n   </strong>\n   , but a more effective centrifugal decanter is used than the one used in Example 1. As a result, the syrup introduced to the disk stack centrifuge\n   <strong>\n    14\n   </strong>\n   would have a moisture content estimated at 60% by weight. While this does not impact the product value figures, the syrup from the centrifuge\n   <strong>\n    14\n   </strong>\n   has a moisture content of only 66.6% by weight as compared to 82.5% by weight in Example 1. As a result, the cost per hour of drying this syrup when combined with the distillers wet grains to achieve an end product having a moisture content of less than 10% is only $158.92, or approximately 40% less. Assuming a\n   savings in dryer efficiency of 10%, the product value per hour ($678.46) less the estimated dryer operating cost ($143.03 per hour) and less the estimated evaporator operating cost ($74.96 per hour) is $460.46 per hour. This represents an approximate 15% increase over the corresponding value calculated for Example 1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-240\">\n   As should be appreciated, the above-described method and subsystem of the preferred embodiment essentially require the addition of a centrifuge downstream of the evaporator in the conventional system for processing thin stillage (which centrifuge may thus be considered a \"means for\" recovering thin stillage). Accordingly, instructions on how to implement the above-described method (including the optimum process variables) may be provided along with a centrifuge for use in an ethanol plant for forming the novel subsystem\n   <strong>\n    10\n   </strong>\n   disclosed herein. Such instructions result in the most efficient implementation of the method, as compared to the situation where the scientists or engineers at the plant must experiment with the centrifuge to determine the optimum process conditions required to achieve a favorable result.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   '858 Patent, col5, ll7-41. \"[T]he novel subsystem\n   <strong>\n    10\n   </strong>\n   \" identified in the second paragraph here refers to an evaporator and the mechanical processing system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   col 3, ll6-20 &amp; Fig. 2. The Court interprets this to mean that the inventors purposefully avoided specific qualitative and/or quantitative features in the claims because the \"optimum process variables\" that would \"result in the most efficient implementation of the method\" were not necessary to the inventive method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   There is nothing in the prosecution history that limits the term \"oil\" to the quantitative/qualitative amounts in the preferred embodiment either. The primary statement the inventors relied upon to distinguish their invention from prior art had nothing to do with efficiency, or the quantity or quality of the oil recovered. Rather, the patentees emphasized that their invention taught \"a\n   <em>\n    post evaporation process\n   </em>\n   for recovering oil from the concentrated byproduct by heating and mechanically processing as in claim 1 and 16 or by centrifuging as in claim 14.\" MDN 120-5 at 104 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   Although the consequences for arguing for and obtaining a broad construction may have unintended results, again, the Court will not import limitations from the specification into the claims when such a result is not mandated by the intrinsic evidence. For these reasons, the Court will not narrow the construction for the term \"oil.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     \"Substantially Oil Free\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   The term \"substantially oil free\" appears in independent claim 7 of the '516 patent, '516 Patent, col6, l.42; and independent claim 8 of the '484 patent, '484 Patent, col6, l.47. Although the Defendants have argued that it is a necessary limitation in all the claims of the '858 patent family, the Court rejected that argument. MDN 784 at 10-14. In the instant motions, the Plant Defendants argue that CleanTech's expert's, John McKenna's (\"McKenna's\"), testimony that any process infringes the \"substantially oil free\" term so long as more than 50% of the oil entering the mechanical oil-recovery device is removed, MDN 932 at 45, should be rejected because it is not based on any scientific standard or analysis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44-49. Specifically, McKenna testified that his opinion that the reduced oil syrup leaving the mechanical processing device is \"substantially free of oil\" when it contains less than 50% of the oil present in the stream entering the centrifuge is based on his \"common sense\" understanding of the Court's claim construction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-46. In fact, McKenna stated that he was \"going basically on\n   the verbiage that's been used which says mostly or largely, right.... I have arbitrarily set up that 50, 51 percent.\" MDN 949-8 at 3 &amp; 5 (stating that 51% is the phrase or number he would \"throw out\" to describe syrup that is substantially oil free). However, in his reports, he repeatedly used the phrase \"a reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" to describe his opinions regarding infringement. MDN 932 at 46; MDN 949-8 at 5.

And, other courts have construed similar claim terms of \"substantially: or \"mostly\" to mean \"completely or nearly so,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Alwin Mfg. Co. v.

MDN 1025 at 39 (citing MDN 1025 at 13). Further, CleanTech asserts that McKenna also testified that he reviewed the '858 patent family specification before he formed his opinion about the percentage of oil removal, including the following sentence, \"Moreover, removal of the majority of the oil before the drying step makes the process more efficient, and results in an estimated energy savings of approximately 10 percent, or $26.27 per hour.\" MDN 1037-4 at 15. Apparently, McKenna construed \"majority\" to mean 51% of the oil is removed. CleanTech also argues that Rockstraw conceded that the Court's construction meant that 51% removal of oil would infringe the claims; however, Rockstraw only conceded that it had been interpreted that way, not that it was a correct, scientific determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Contrary to the situation with the term \"oil,\" the Court concludes that \"substantially\" or \"largely or mostly\" with respect to the \"substantially oil free\" term cannot possibly mean a preponderance, as suggested by CleanTech's expert, in the context of the '858 patent family. The Court has determined the reduced oil syrup stream must be \"substantially free of oil\" in comparison to the incoming stream. MDN 784 at 19-20. In systems where the incoming oil concentration is often near 5%, it is nonsensical for substantially oil free to mean that 51% of the oil has been removed. This is particularly true in light of the language in the specification that CleanTech and its expert allegedly relied upon, which teaches that removal of the majority of the oil leads to efficiencies in drying the combined DDG and reduced oil thin stillage. MDN 102-5, '858 Patent, col4, ll63-66.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   MDN 1238 at 2-3 (discussing the meaning of this language in the specification with respect to enablement of the \"oil\" term). When the oil percentage in the incoming stream is already a very low 5%, there is no basis to conclude that any efficiency would be gained if the reduction in oil content of the thin stillage component was only 51%. Reading that statement in the specification in the context of the actual claim language, or even the Court's construction of \"largely\n   or mostly,\" it is clear that the requirement is more than a preponderance; it is largely or mostly all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   To the extent any clarification of the scope of the \" substantially free of oil\" term is necessary, the term requires the reduced oil thin stillage stream to be \"largely or mostly all\" free of oil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   <strong>\n    B. THE \"MECHANICAL PROCESSING\" TERM\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   The Plant Defendants claim that the invention in the '858 patent family is limited to processes that use certain mechanical means exclusively to recover oil. MDN 932 at 34-35; MDN 1096 at 8-16. Specifically, the Plant Defendants aver that the patentees disavowed chemical processing. They argue that each of the patents in the '858 patent family specifically discloses that oil is recovered from concentrated thin stillage only through \"relatively simple mechanical processing, without the prior need for multiple stages of filtration or other expensive and complicated undertakings.\" '858 Patent, col3, ll53-58; MDN 932 at 32. CleanTech also argued to the Patent &amp; Trademark Office (\"PTO\") examiner that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-252\">\n   Here, the Examiner cites to class 554, subclass 7 in characterizing the invention of claims 1021, which she contends is a \"method of recovering oil.\" However, this class relates to \"organic compounds\" and related processes including a phenolic preservative or stabilizer.

It is\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   because of the chemical reaction ... that phase separation occurs....

With regard to post evaporation oil recovery processes, prior art processes have been limited to solvent extraction as discussed above and microfiltration....

In addition, CleanTech avers that the patentees' statements differentiating their process from one that relies exclusively on preservatives or stabilizers does not mean that the use of such in a process that otherwise infringes is disavowed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. Moreover, CleanTech asserts that the remaining quotes from the prosecution history of the '858 patent either discuss a different process altogether,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 34 (discussing the \"prior processes\" statement); emphasize the required element of evaporation,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35 (distinguishing Prevost); or distinguish pure solvent extraction processes,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Also, CleanTech asserts that the claims using the \"consisting essentially of\" language can include chemical or filtration steps because those steps \"do not materially affect the basic and novel properties of the invention-that is, to recover oil.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.

MDN 1137 at 3-4. To the contrary, CleanTech asserts that Rosten teaches separation of oil from a different stream, the one that is an emulsion of oil and water, which is made clear when the entire relevant passage from Rosten is considered.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%204%2C137%2C335\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 4-5 (citing Rosten Patent, col3, ll30-39 &amp;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   col2, ll43-45).

Adding elements to a process does not prevent a finding of infringement unless the claims are specific as to the number of elements and adding elements eliminates an inherent feature of the claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Insituform Technologies, Inc. v.

With regards to filtration, as the Court had concluded before, there is nothing in the claims that limits mechanical processing to a specific mechanism or even a single mechanism to perform separation. MDN 169 at 14-15. As the Court pointed out in its Order on Claim Construction, the specification of the '858 patent family supports such a construction because it specifically references other oil separation devices suited for materials with suspended solids, which would include a filtration-type device. '858 Patent, col5, ll54-55. Although the patent specification teaches that the invention does not need \"multiple stages of\n   filtration,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8941726\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/419/1374/#p1381\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   col3 ll56-57, this is not a complete rejection of that process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   The Plant Defendants point to this same passage as evidence that the inventors rejected all chemical processing.

First, with respect the patentees' statements regarding the patent examiner's classification of the invention, there is no disavowal of anything other than being sub-classified as a \"phenolic preservative or stabilizer\" when the invention does not require or need such stabilizer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MDN 120-5 at 72. Second, the patentees' statement describing Yokoyama and describing other prior art systems that used solvent extraction or microfiltration, then describing the patented process, MDN 120-5 at 106-07, 128, 129, are no more than that: descriptions of prior art as contrasted with the patented process.

THE '037 PATENT\"POST OIL RECOVERY THIN STILLAGE CONCENTRATE\" TERM\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   The '037 Defendants also request that the Court clarify construction of the term \"post oil recovery thin stillage concentrate\" in the '037 patent, which has been used to define the material that is subjected to further evaporation in that patent. MDN 1072 at 41-46. Specifically, the '037 Defendants contend that during prosecution of this patent, inventor \"Winsness clearly defined the invention to require a unique type of concentrated thin stillage with a reduced amount of solids as the concentrated thin stillage that is further processed in the evaporator system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43. The '037 Defendants assert that CleanTech has admitted that the claims of the '037 patent are described in the embodiment of Figure 5, which identifies exactly this type of reduced-solids syrup stream leaving the centrifuge that is subject to further evaporation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, the patentee expressly touted the advantages removing the suspended solids.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44 (citing '037 Patent, col 7, ll61-64). Therefore, the '037 Defendants advocate a different definition for the term \"post oil recovery thin stillage concentrate\" that is further evaporated in this patent: \"a syrup containing water, oil and solids resulting from the concentrating or evaporating process and a suspended solids removal process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   CleanTech asserts that there is nothing new in this argument and that pointing to claims 3 and 4 of the '037 patent does not help to change the plain meaning of the term as the Court has previously construed it. MDN 1160 at 12-13 &amp; n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   As it did after the\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   hearing regarding the '037 patent, the Court concludes that the post oil recovery thin stillage concentrate has the same meaning it did in the '858 patent family. Although the Court agrees that the description of Figure 5 in the specification contemplates removal of solids as well as production of oil and reduced oil thin stillage, the same description makes clear that this is only \"one aspect of the invention.\" '037 Patent, col7, ll11-33. Claim 1, for example, is not limited to a separation process that results in three streams: oil, reduced oil thin stillage and suspended solids.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   col10, ll57-67. The type of separation advocated by the '037 Defendants is represented in\n   Claims 3 and 4; however, those are dependent claims and are necessarily more narrow than Claim 1.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   col11, ll4-11. Further, although Figure 5 is representative of the claimed method and depicts the invention of Claim 4, the Court will not limit the remainder of the claims to what the inventor termed \"one aspect of the invention,\" even if it is a preferred embodiment of the invention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    3M Innovative Props.

MDN 932 at 34-41; MDN 1096 at 7-16. The Court considered the entirety of these arguments in the context of the proper scope of the claim term \"mechanical processing\" and has determined that a process may infringe the claims of the '858 patent family even if the process includes extra steps such as adding chemicals or surfactants, or filtering the concentrated thin stillage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Part IV.B. Therefore, the Plant Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Claims that Require \"Drying\" of the \"Thin Stillage Concentrate\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   The Plant Defendants contend that none of them infringe any claims of the '858 patent family that require drying of the post oil recovery step thin stillage concentrate. MDN 932 at 41-44; MDN 1096 at 16-21. Specifically, the Plant Defendants assert that CleanTech's expert admitted that the product they dry is uniformly considered DDGS, not \"thin stillage concentrate\" as required by the claims. MDN 932 at 41; MDN 1096 at 16-21. The unconverted evidence, according to the Plant Defendants, is that evaporating and drying are different: evaporators are generally closed systems that permit recovery of water; dryers are generally open systems using hot air to dry out a material. MDN 932 at 43; MDN 1096 at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   CleanTech argues that the Plant Defendants are relying upon \"a logically-inconsistent\n   construction of the claim terms related to drying, an issue that Defendants never raised during claim construction.\" MDN 1025 at 37. Further, CleanTech states that McKenna opined that \"whenever concentrated thin stillage is sent to a dryer, whether alone or in combination with other materials, such as wet grains,\" the drying claims are satisfied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   The relevant claims of the '858 patent, the '516 patent and the '484 patent state, respectively, and in pertinent part: \"including the step of drying the concentrate after the step of recovering the oil,\" '858 Patent, col6, ll57-58; \"including the step of drying the concentrate after the step of recovering the oil,\" '516 Patent, col6, ll48-49; and \"drying the thin stillage concentrate to reduce the moisture content in the thin stillage concentrate.\" '484 Patent, col6, ll18-19 &amp; ll48-49. CleanTech's expert, McKenna, admitted that he would call a mixture of wet distillers grains, sprayed-on concentrated thin stillage and previously-dried DDGS: DDGS with solubles. MDN 1096 at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   The plain meaning of \"drying the concentrate\" in patent in the '858 patent family is just that: the reduced oil syrup leaving the oil recovery process is dried and it is implicit in this simple phrase that it is not mixed with anything else first-it is dried, then it is either used alone or something else is done with it. The claims of the '484 patent are even more explicit because the entire phrase requires that the thin stillage concentrate be dried to reduce the moisture content in the thin stillage concentrate alone, not to reduce the moisture content of some mixture. '484 Patent, col6, ll18-19 &amp; ll48-49. Furthermore, McKenna's testimony on the subject is telling in that when asked to name a mixture of wet distillers grains, previously-dried DDGS and thin stillage concentrate, he unequivocally said \"[t]hat combination would be consistent with what was called DDGS with solubles\" and to him, \"that material is DDGS.\" MDN 1210 at 55-56. There is no question then, that a process that mixes the reduced oil thin stillage concentrate before drying the mixture is not practicing the \"drying\" claims of patent in the '858 patent family. The Court also notes that CleanTech has carefully avoided any argument that sending the reduced oil thin stillage concentrate back through the evaporators is \"drying\" within the meaning of that term in any patents in the '858 patent family because to do so would be inconsistent with its arguments on the validity of the '037 patent, which specifically claims further evaporation of the post oil recovery thin stillage concentrate to reduce its moisture content. '037 Patent, col10, ll61-62;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   col11, ll37-38;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   col12, ll13-14 &amp; ll26-27 &amp; ll43-44; MDN 1160 at 14-15 (stating that the '858 patent discloses redirecting the de-oiled syrup stream through the evaporators for additional oil recovery and further, that \"[t]he '037 patent represents an improvement in the process downstream of the oil recovery ... the post oil-recovery de-oiled syrup that exist the centrifuge is further evaporated to reduce the moisture content before it is combined with distillers wet grains\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17 (stating that \"[t]he '858 patent contemplates repeated iterations within the oil recovery step; while the '037 patent is directed to further reducing the moisture in the de-oiled syrup and then combining the de-oiled syrup with wet distillers grains to improve drying efficiency\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   For these reasons, summary judgment in favor of the Plant Defendants is proper on CleanTech's claims that they infringe Claim 15 of the '858 patent, Claim 10 of the '516 patent ; and Claims 1-3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12-14, 16, 17, 19-24 and 26-29 of the '484 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     \"Substantially Oil Free\" Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   Plant Defendants Ace, Adkins, Al-Corn, Blue Flint, Bushmills, CVEC, Heartland, Iroquois, Lincolnway Energy, and UWGP (collectively, \"SOF Defendants\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   assert that their processes do not infringe Claims 7-10 of the '516 patent and Claims 8, 10, 12-14 and 27 of the '484 patent because the reduced-oil syrup is not \"substantially oil free.\" MDN 932 at 41-42 &amp; n.5. The SOF Defendants argue that CleanTech's expert testimony that \"substantially oil free\" should be rejected,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 46, and that the Court should adopt their expert's now uncontroverted opinion that in applying scientific principles at least 90% of the oil must be removed before the reduced-oil syrup is \"substantially free of oil.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47-49. The SOF Defendants also claim that testing results show that Heartland, Blue Flint, Lincolnway and UWGP do not always even exceed a 50% threshold and CleanTech has admitted that its sampling method was flawed, MDN 932 at 48; therefore, this is an additional reason to grant the SOF Defendants summary judgment on the \"substantially oil free\" claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   CleanTech asserts that a visual inspection of the samples taken from the SOF Defendants' plants evidence that the concentration exiting the oil recovery process are \"largely or mostly\" oil free. MDN 1025 at 38-39. Further, CleanTech asserts that both parties' experts agree that the Court's \"claim construction means that any process that removes more than 50% of the oil in the incoming concentrated thin stillage stream meets this claim limitation,\" and the test results indicate that all of the SOF Defendants' streams remove more than 50% of the oil.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   The Court concludes that McKenna's opinion regarding the \"substantially oil free\" limitations lacks a scientific foundation on this issue and should be excluded. McKenna's approach does not pass muster pursuant to Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\"Rule 702\"). McKenna referred to his approach to understanding the term as \"common sense,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MDN 949-8 at 3, McKenna Dep. at 146; or that he \"arbitrarily set up that 50, 51 percent\",\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , McKenna Dep. at 147. Neither of these statements have a foundation in scientific principles nor grounding in the claim language. MDN 1037-4 at 4-6. Only when pressed did McKenna claim that the reference in the specification to removal of the \"majority\" of the oil provided a basis for his conclusion that removal of 51% of the oil from the thin stillage concentrate infringed the relevant claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. This single statement, which he acknowledged by saying \"I think the percentage thrown out was 51 percent of the oil has been removed from the concentrated thin stillage\" is simply not enough to ground McKenna's opinions in scientific principles. Further, the \"majority\" of the oil language in the specification refers to the oil in the combination of DDG and the reduced oil syrup, which would generally only occur if well over 51% of the oil has been removed from the thin stillage concentrate. MDN 120-2, '858 Patent, col4, ll64-66.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   MDN 1238 at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   Therefore, the uncontested admissible evidence on this issue is a comparison of some of the samples taken by CleanTech; and Rockstraw's opinion that, to a person of ordinary skill in the art, 90% oil removal meets the definition of \"substantially [or largely or mostly all] oil free.\" None of the test results show that any SOF Defendant's process produced a post oil recovery step thin stillage concentrate that is \"substantially oil free\" as the Court has construed\n   the term. The test results showed that each of the SOF Defendants removed the following amounts of oil: Ace-[redacted]%-[redacted]% (MDN 882-35 &amp; MDN 882-36); Al-Corn-[redacted]%-[redacted]% (MDN 882-43 &amp; MDN 882-44); Blue Flint-MDN 45.5%-56.5% (MDN 882-30 &amp; MDN 882-49); CVEC-54.5-56.7% (MDN 882-31 &amp; MDN 882-32); Iroquois-74%-80% without additives, 78%-87% with additives (MDN 883-33 &amp; MDN 883-34); Lincolnway-37.7%-61.3% (MDN 882-13); and UWGP-45.5%-78.0% (MDN 883-45 &amp; MDN 883-46). Based on this evidence, the Court concludes that no reasonable jury could decide that Ace, Al-Corn, Blue Flint, CVEC, Heartland, Iroquois, Lincolnway or UWGP infringe the \"substantially oil free\" claims of the '858 patent family. None of these plants remove largely or mostly all of the oil from the incoming stream. Adkins, Bushmills and Heartland successfully challenged the admissibility of CleanTech's test results on their processes that it relied upon to assert infringement of the \"substantially oil free\" claims.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Sections III.B.2, III.B.6. &amp; n.14, III.B.10 &amp; n.24. Therefore, in the absence of evidence to support its claim of infringement, after being challenged by Adkins, Bushmills and Heartland to produce such evidence, summary judgment is appropriate as to these defendants on the \"substantially oil free\" claims as well. Even if the Court considered the data and accepted it as true, the evidence shows that Adkins', Bushmills' and Heartland's processes do not infringe the \"substantially oil free\" limitation because those Plant Defendants do not remove largely or mostly all of the oil: Adkins-76% (MDN 882-29); Bushmills-52.3%-69% (MDN 883-8); Heartland-26.6%, 28.2%, 45% and 44.1% (MDN 883-24 &amp; 883-25). The Court notes that CleanTech's evidence against Heartland does not even meet its own expert's definition that the majority of the oil is removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   For these reasons, summary judgment is appropriate in favor of Ace, Adkins, AlCorn, Blue Flint, Bushmills, CVEC, Heartland, Iroquois, Lincolnway Energy, and UWGP on CleanTech's claims that they infringe Claims 7-10 of the '516 patent and Claims 8, 10, 12-14 and 27 of the '484 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Iroquois &amp; Lincolnway Arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   Iroquois and Lincolnway (collectively, the \"Claim 9 Defendants\") assert that their processes do not infringe Claim 9 of the '516 patent. Claim 9 of the '516 patent requires that \"the recovering and concentrating steps are performed in a continuous fashion.\" '516 Patent, col6, ll46-47. Iroquois asserts that McKenna admitted that he did not know if Iroquois' centrifuge operated continuously. MDN 923 at 2-3. Further, Iroquois' Supplemental Answer to Plaintiffs' Interrogatory No. 13 explained that syrup (concentrated thin stillage) does not flow to the centrifuge continuously because the syrup is processed in batches where the flow of syrup going into the centrifuge is stopped so that accumulated solids can be flushed from the system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Similarly, Lincolnway asserts that in its supplemental interrogatory responses it explained that its solids discharging centrifuges are designed to stop periodically to discharge solids that collect in the separation bowl and, additionally, each centrifuge is subjected to periodic clean in place procedures. MDN 930 at 1-2. During these times, flow of syrup or thin stillage concentrate is stopped.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CleanTech's expert, McKenna, admitted during his deposition that when the feed to the centrifuge is stopped while solids are ejected, the process is not continuous. MDN 1088 at 1-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   CleanTech claims that both Iroquois and Lincolnway admitted that their processes are continuous in their initial responses to CleanTech's interrogatories and creative\n   attorney arguments regarding periodic cleaning should be rejected. MDN 1025 at 15, 46-47. Most importantly, CleanTech asserts that Iroquois' witnesses testified that the system is continuous and only shut down for cleaning or emergencies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49-51. Likewise, Lincolnway's witnesses testified that the system is continuous except for shut downs from scheduled maintenance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   Given the unrefuted evidence that McKenna testified that a system is not continuous if there is no feed to the centrifuge, the Court concludes that there is no material question of fact on whether or not either Iroquois or Lincolnway infringe Claim 9 of the '516 patent : the processes are not continuous because CleanTech has not proffered proof that, during normal processing, the feed to the centrifuge is continuous. For these reasons, the Claim 9 Defendants' motion for summary judgment must be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   Iroquois also asserts that partial summary judgment is appropriate on CleanTech's claims that it infringes Claim 2 of the '516 patent and Claim 14 of the '484 patent because the test data for Iroquois shows that the moisture content of the syrup fed to the centrifuge is between 55% and 72%, whereas the relevant claims require the moisture range to be between 60% and 85% by weight. MDN 923 at 4. As a result, Iroquois argues, when Iroquois' system is run with a syrup having moisture content of 55% to less than 60%, there is no infringement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CleanTech does not refute this statement other than to say that \"an accused produce that sometimes, but not always, embodies a claimed method nonetheless infringes.\" MDN 1025 at 54 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bell Commc'ns Research, Inc. v.

MDN 924 at 1. In addition to stating that Cardinal's claim construction argument should not be considered, as discussed above, CleanTech alleges that the undisputed facts show that the oil stream exiting Cardinal's centrifuge contained between 87.53% and 90.26% oil; therefore, it is largely or mostly oil. Further, relying upon its single set of data points from each of the plants, CleanTech asserts that summary judgment is appropriate as to the remaining Plant Defendants on all of the remaining claims. MDN 878 at 101-03; MDN 1025 at 41. CleanTech avers that there is no question of material fact that the Plant Defendants sometimes infringe because they all produce an oil stream that is greater than 50% oil; therefore, summary judgment is appropriate. MDN 878 at 102-03 (relying heavily on the visual inspection of settled samples); MDN 1025 at 41-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   To the contrary, the Plant Defendants contend that a material question of fact precludes summary judgment in favor of CleanTech because there is significant process variability in each plant, which is the reason a number of plants have installed settling tanks or other similar systems to remove solids and moisture before storing or selling the recovered oil. MDN 932 at 50-51. In addition, the Plant Defendants\n   point to CleanTech's own expert's admission that the samples that were taken are not reliable because they should have been taken over a 24-hour period, then averaged. MDN 1096 at 29. Moreover, the Plant Defendants argue that neither CleanTech nor its expert tried to account for this process variability in the infringement analysis or accounted for industry specifications for acceptable levels of contaminants; therefore, material questions of fact exist on infringement. MDN 932 at 51-52. Finally, because CleanTech has proffered no proof that the samples taken are representative of other process parameters on other dates, summary judgment should be granted in the Plant Defendants' favor for lack of proof. MDN 1096 at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-311\">\n   With respect to Adkins and UWGP, CleanTech has no admissible evidence that Adkins' or UWGP's process meets the \"oil\" limitation of the claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.B.2;\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.B.14 &amp; n.33. The Plant Defendants' own Motion for Summary Judgment of Non-Infringement clearly put CleanTech on notice that it needed evidence to support its claims of infringement. Yet in response to Adkins' and UWGP's challenge to the admissibility of any test data (Adkins) or oil concentration test data (UWGP), CleanTech merely responded that the Midwest results speak for themselves and/or that the Rule 30(b)(6) testimony establishes that the results are largely consistent with typical results Adkins or UWGP observes at other times. MDN 1025 at 12, 68-69; MDN 1025 at 13. As stated previously, CleanTech never addressed Adkins' or UWGP's objection that there was no foundation for admission of the test results.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.B.2; Section III.B.14. Therefore, CleanTech has failed to meet its burden on summary judgment and there is no material question of fact on its claims that Adkins or UWGP infringe any of the asserted claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Minkin v.

CleanTech relies upon three things to prove infringement of the oil limitations: (1) sample data; (2) expert testimony; and (3) Rule 30(b)(6) testimony of some Plant Defendants that the sample data is consistent with other data taken by that Defendant of its own process. However, CleanTech's expert's testimony about the sample data is inherently unreliable under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   and its progeny because he admitted that a proper analysis, at a minimum, would have taken an average of readings over a 24-hour period. MDN 1210 at 38, 68-69. Therefore, even if there is admissible data reflecting the amount of oil in samples taken during inspections at the Plant Defendants' facilities, there is no reliable expert testimony about whether or not the data supports a conclusion that the Plant Defendants infringe the \"oil\" limitation of the '858 patent family. Because the \"oil\" limitation appears in all the claims in the '858 patent family,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Claims 1-3, 5-16 of the '858 Patent ; Claims 1-11 of the '516 Patent ; Claims 1 and 2 of the '517 Patent ; and Claims 1-3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12-14, 16, 17, 19-24, 26-30; this conclusion is dispositive of all of CleanTech's allegations as to all of the Plant Defendants and summary judgment in favor of the Plant Defendants is warranted on CleanTech's allegations of infringement of all claims of the '858 patent family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   <strong>\n    C. THE '037 PATENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   Further, for the reasons discussed in the previous Section,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section V.B.5., CleanTech has no admissible evidence and/or testimony that the '037 Defendants infringe the \"oil\" limitation of the '037 patent. Therefore, summary judgment in favor of the '037 Defendants is appropriate on CleanTech's allegations of infringement of the '037 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

GEA asserts that summary judgment is appropriate because CleanTech cannot establish that GEA induced infringement with specific intent or that GEA's centrifuges have no other use besides infringing the patents-in-suit.

GEA also argues that it is not liable under the contributory infringement prong of \u00a7 271 because its centrifuges are pre-existing models that were not designed exclusively for use in corn oil extraction.

Here, GEA produced several documents from the time period prior to the issuance of the '858 patent to evidence that it never believed the '858 patents would issue or could be valid.

Reliance on counsel, however, is not the test; the test is whether or not GEA had a good faith belief of invalidity. The uncontested evidence is that GEA always believed the CleanTech method was not patentable; even when the USPTO issued a Notice of Allowance, GEA insisted the technology was not new and continues to do so in this litigation. MDN 935 at 9. But, as the\n   <em>\n    Commil\n   </em>\n   court cautioned, there is more to the inquiry of \"intent\" than the good faith belief in the invalidity defense. CleanTech relies on other evidence of \"intent\" such as post-grant sales activity, MDN 1025 at 59-60; therefore, on the issue of intent, generally, there is a material question of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   Notwithstanding that conclusion, however, there is no dispute that GEA sold centrifuges to the GEA Plant Defendants prior to issuance of any of the patents in suit. Therefore, there can be no induced infringement based on those sales because prior acts are not actionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Presto Indus., Inc. v.

Similarly, there is no case law to support CleanTech's suggestion that GEA's provision of a test to an existing customer so that the customer can determine when a centrifuge is operating properly could provide the basis for actionable culpable conduct. This conduct, which the Court will label troubleshooting, is similar in nature to repair or maintenance in that it is focused on identification of a malfunctioning part, the replacement of which is not actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   Moreover, specifically addressing any remaining contributory infringement allegations, products that are staple articles of commerce that are not adapted to infringe cannot form the basis of a claim for contributory infringement.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

It is preferred that an oil removal technique be used that will remove substantially all of the oil from the dried distillers grains. Non-limiting examples of oil removal techniques that can be used include centrifugation, pressing with and without the use of a solvent, and solvent extraction without the use of pressing. The preferred solvent for solvent extraction is a normally gaseous solvent, more preferably butane, propane, or mixture thereof. By normally gaseous we mean a solvent in which the oil is soluble and being in the gas phase at atmospheric pressure and at room temperature (approximately 75\u00b0F).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-363\">\n   [0014] The syrup can be added to the wet distillers grain prior to the drying step and be processed under the same conditions as the wet distillers grains as described above. An oil removal step can be performed on either the thin stillage before evaporation or on the syrup after evaporation. If performed prior to evaporation, an oil removal process such as centrifugation is preferred whereas after evaporation a solvent extraction process is preferred to extract at least a portion of the oil from the syrup.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-364\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-365\">\n   [0026] Both the thin stillage and syrup can each be individually, or a mixture thereof, conducted to an oil removal step, 17A and 20A. For example, the thin stillage can be centrifuged in a similar manner as the wet distillers grains and the resulting oil/water mixture sent to a separation zone wherein the water is separated from the oil. As mentioned previously, separation can be done by simple decanting, by distilling the water from the oil, or by passing a solvent, in which the oil is at least partially soluble or miscible, can be run counter current with the flow of mixture, which solvent will pickup [sic] the oil and carry it in\n   the opposite direction than the water. If using solvent extraction it is preferred that the material being oil-extracted be [sic] substantially dry.

Moreover, Defendants argue that the second element of the\n   <em>\n    Pfaff\n   </em>\n   test is met because there was sufficient description of the invention prior to August 17, 2003, to allow one of ordinary skill in the art to practice the claimed methods.

MDN 1028 at 85-87. Relying on some documents from July and August of 2003 as well as documents from 2004, CleanTech further argues that the July 31 Proposal concerned an experimental use of the technology where the inventors were trying to prove that the method was \" 'capable of performing its intended purpose in its intended environment.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89-93 (quoting\n   <em>\n    EZ Dock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9454124\" index=\"546\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/276/1347/#p1352\">\n    276 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1352 ). CleanTech asserts that it could not confirm the method worked for its intended purpose in its intended environment until spring 2004.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93. Similarly, CleanTech contends that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether or not the invention was ready for patenting prior to August 17, 2003, because the method had not been tested under the actual working conditions of a dry-mill ethanol plant; in other words, the method had not been proven for its\n   intended purpose until Spring 2004.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94-96. Moreover, CleanTech denies that the Ethanol System Diagram and other documents were sufficient to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to practice the claimed method.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96-99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-606\">\n   The Court concludes that the undisputed contemporaneous evidence supports only one conclusion, the on-sale bar applies and invalidates the '858 patent family because (1) the July 31 Proposal was the culmination of a commercial offer for sale and (2) the method described in the '858 patent family had either or both been reduced to practice or/and there was sufficient description of the patented method by August 17, 2003, to allow one of ordinary skill in the art to implement the method. CleanTech focuses on the language of the July 31 Proposal for its argument that a jury could find that the letter was not a commercial offer to sell. MDN 1028 at 85-86. However, the major elements of a contract for the sale of a system that could perform the patented method are contained in the letter: all items necessary to recover oil and the price. MDN 1173 at 51-52; MDN 949-57. Any mention of a \"test\" was not related to the method for securing oil, but rather to the quality of the oil produced and/or the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the module.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   None of the claims of the '858 patent family have oil quality, efficiency or cost-effectiveness elements. In fact, CleanTech has argued throughout this litigation that, except for the unrelated temperature, moisture content and pH requirements of the incoming concentrated thin stillage stream, there are no quantifiable elements in the claims at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MDN 1025 at 38-40 (arguing that \"largely or mostly\" adequately conveys a broad definition for the term \"substantially oil free\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-46 (arguing that \"largely or mostly\" adequately conveys a broad definition for the term \"oil\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   MDN 118 at 14-15 (arguing that the \"oil\" term should not be limited to the preferred embodiment); MDN 121 at 17-21 (same); MDN 464 at 17(same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-607\">\n   Further, CleanTech wholly ignores the course of dealing between the parties prior to Agri-Energy's receipt of the July 31 Proposal as well as the contemporaneous internal VDT documents that evidence that VDT considered the letter an offer for sale. Prior to the letter, VDT had advised Agri-Energy what the system looked like,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MDN 1173 at 41; where the oil recovery module would be placed,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (referencing removal of fat from \"syrup,\" which is an industry name for concentrated thin stillage); MDN 949-57 at 3 (requiring that the system be placed \"inside or within 50' of the evaporator\"); why it needed to be placed at that location (to minimize heat loss), MDN 949-16 at 6 &amp; 10 (Sommers Dep. at 48, 71-73), MDN 949-9 at 7 (Stanley Dep. at 85); that the major component of the module was a disk-stack centrifuge that would separate the oil from the syrup, MDN 1173 at 41 (explaining that the centrifuge model that would be needed was a disk stack centrifuge), MDN 949-61 (stating that the \"right centrifuge\" would either be a three phase nozzle machine or a solids discharging machine); that it would recover over 80% of the oil, MDN 1173 at 44, MDN 949-61 (stating, \"We are optimistic that we can recover over 80% of this oil.\"); cost a certain amount to operate, MDN 1173 at 41 (stating that the operational cost would be similar to that of the Case Farms system), MDN 949-57 at 4 (stating an operating cost of $60.00/day); required a certain amount of space and utilities at Agri-Energy's facility, MDN 949-57 at 3; provide a certain payback,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2; and that it was a simple process comprised of \"just sucking the top of the [syrup] tank and centrifuging that product.\" MDN 1173 at 44-45; MDN 949-61 (\"We have methods of just sucking the top of the tank and centrifuging that product.\"). The July 31 Proposal itself had many of these parameters\n   contained within it as well as a specific price, $423,000.00. MDN 949-57. Sommers confirmed that after receipt of the July 31 Proposal, Agri-Energy could accept the offer and receive the equipment; some details needed to be worked out, such as timing and payment terms, but Agri-Energy believed that its acceptance of the offer would have created a binding contract. MDN 1173 at 52, MDN 949-16 (Sommers Dep. at 82-83). Sommers did testify that he expected a formal contract to follow, but never considered that he could not accept the offer and create a binding agreement. MDN 1173 at 52; MDN 1028 at 62-63; MDN 1093 at 92. Moreover, it is undisputed that the \"sale on approval\" form of the July 31 Proposal was common in the industry. MDN 1173 at 52 &amp; 55. A \"sale on approval\" contract is a commercial agreement recognized in the Uniform Commercial Code, UCC \u00a7 2-326, which the Federal Circuit has explicitly recognized as a source to help determine whether something is a commercial offer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Group One\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11092661\" index=\"547\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/1041/#p1046\">\n    254 F.3d at 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-608\">\n   In addition, VDT's internal documents at or around the time Cantrell sent the July 31 Proposal indicate that VDT believed it had offered to sell the system to Agri-Energy.

Moreover, there is no dispute that Dyer produced the July 22, 2003, Ethanol System Diagram believing it was for sales purposes. MDN 1173 at 48-49. In addition, Cantrell was focused on finding a market for the oil that Agri-Energy would recover with the system stating that he wanted to remove all obstacles to Agri-Energy's acceptance of the offer.

Specifically, Defendants argue that the pH, temperature and moisture content ranges disclosed in the claims are broad enough to capture the typical operating conditions at all standard ethanol plants; therefore, those elements are inherent in any disclosure that discusses the typical dry mill ethanol process. MDN 1173 at 99 n.15 &amp; 102-03. Prevost, Defendants assert, describes the typical dry mill ethanol plant process, including the evaporation of thin stillage to form a syrup, the typical fat content of syrup as well as the combination of the thin stillage with wet distillers' grains to form DDGS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99-100. Prevost further discloses recovering oil at various points of stillage processing: before evaporation, after evaporation, from wet distillers' grains and from DDGS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100 (referencing MDN 945-49, Prevost, Fig. 1). According to Defendants, Prevost also discloses at least three methods for extracting oil: centrifugation, pressing, and solvent extraction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100-01 (quoting MDN 945-49, Prevost \u00b6\u00b6 0014 &amp; 0026). Although Prevost states a preference for solvent extraction after evaporation of the thin stillage,\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   he expressly claimed using a centrifuge to recover oil from syrup in Claims 19 and 20 of the application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101 (quoting MDN 945-49, Prevost, Claims 19 &amp; 20). Defendants assert that Claim 19 contains an obvious typographical error where it references the moisture content of the syrup stream entering the centrifuge as being 15% by weight moisture because such a product would not flow.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101-02. Therefore, one of ordinary skill in the art would read Prevost as disclosing recovery of \"oil by centrifuging syrup containing less than 15 wt.% fats, which is equivalent to a moisture content of less than 85 wt.% water and falls squarely within the range claimed by the patents-in-suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102. Defendants further assert that the '858 patent family does not specifically describe or disclose a separate post-evaporation heating step or a separate heating apparatus to perform such a step; therefore, if the Court concludes that such is disclosed in the '850 patent family, it is inherent in Prevost as well\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103; MDN 1093 at 33. Defendants also argue that Claims 19 and 20 separately and wholly anticipate all of the asserted claims, but, at the very least Claim 1 of the '517 patent.

Like the '858 patent family specification, Prevost describes the traditional dry mill ethanol production process. MDN 945-49, Prevost \u00b6 0005. The Prevost application teaches recovery of oil from concentrated thin stillage and lists a centrifuge as a possible method for doing so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prevost \u00b6\u00b6 0009, 0013, 0014, 0026, Fig. 1.

Prevost also specifically claims a process that uses a centrifuge to recover oil from syrup (concentrated or evaporated thin stillage) in a \"moisture range\" that buttresses the moisture ranges disclosed in the '858 patent family. Specifically, in Claims 19 and 20, Prevost describes a process for extracting oil from a syrup stream that contains \"less than about 15 wt. % water.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prevost at 6, Claims 19 &amp; 20. Claims 1 and 2 of the '517 patent includes a requirement that the concentrate have a moisture content of \"greater than 15% by weight\" as well. MDN 267-1, '517 Patent, col6, l34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-623\">\n   Even if Prevost did not specifically disclose a moisture range that overlaps one of the claims of the '858 patent family, the Court agrees with Defendants that the moisture, pH and temperature ranges disclosed in the relevant claims of the '858 patent family are inherent in the Prevost disclosure. As the Court previously mentioned, CleanTech argues that Prevost does not inherently disclose these elements because the invention therein does not necessarily depend upon standard operating conditions of an ethanol plant. MDN 1028 at 104-05. CleanTech's argument is premised on the conclusion that Prevost did not recognize the parameters as important. But, absolute recognition of inherent parameters is not required. In fact, the Federal Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Schering\n   </em>\n   \"reject[ed] the contention that inherent anticipation requires recognition in the prior art.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105276\" index=\"567\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/339/1373/#p1377\">\n    339 F.3d at 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[I]nherent anticipation does not require that a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time would have recognized inherent disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105276\" index=\"568\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/339/1373/#p1377\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, there is no evidence in the record that the moisture and pH ranges disclosed in the '858 patent family were critical to the invention or would otherwise affect the recovery of oil using the method. In fact, there is one point in the specification where the inventors acknowledge that the moisture percentages in the syrup stream have no impact on the product value figures. MDN 120-2, '858 Patent, col5, ll11-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-624\">\n   Further, there is no dispute that Prevost is directed to the identical process as that of the '858 patent family: byproducts of \"ethanol production from agricultural products, such as cereal grains.\" MDN 945-49, Prevost, Abstract.

That all of the experts agree that \"15 wt. % water\" is some type of typographical error or not feasible only supports the conclusion that the invention was intended to work at the standard operating conditions of a dry mill ethanol plant where the syrup would contain between 8% and 15% fat or oil.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (\"The thin stillage fraction, after evaporation to form a syrup, will typically contain from about 8 to 15 wt. % fat.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 0011 (\"The thin stillage is typically subjected to an evaporation step [to] remove water and produce a syrup that will contain about 7 to about 15 wt. % oil or fat.\").

The syrup is added to these dried distiller's grains after an oil removal step.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 0014. There is nothing in the Prevost specification to suggest that the syrup alone has a moisture content of 15% by weight or less. In fact, such substances in Prevost are identified differently: \"retentate,\" \"permeate,\" or \"free flowing powder [that] will contain 15 wt. % or less water.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 0015 (carotenoid retentate and nutrient rich permeate after the dryer); 0016 (protein and yeast containing retentate after being dried); 0034 (thin stillage passed through ultrafiltration to produce \"a protein and yeast rich retentate\"); 0038 (describing the product after the dryer as \"free flowing powder [that] will contain 15 wt. % or less water\").

MDN 1173 at 105-06. The concentrated thin stillage is further centrifuged to recover oil.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 106. Defendants also suggest that, like with Prevost, Rosten describes a process similar to that of a conventional ethanol plant; therefore, the pH, temperature, and moisture content of the asserted claims are inherent therein.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, Defendants argue that Rosten anticipates Claims 10-14 and 16 of the '858 patent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 106-07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-630\">\n   CleanTech claims that Rosten extracts corn oil from a different point in the ethanol manufacturing process, namely thin slops, which is a product created after screening the bottoms from the fermentation and distillation of a cereal-containing mash. MDN 1028 at 105-06. This thin slop is run through a first centrifuge to create an oil/water emulsion. The intermediate remaining thin slop stream is then evaporated and dried to sell as poultry feed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 106. This process, CleanTech asserts, does not extract oil from the evaporated thin stillage as required in the '858 patent family.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, CleanTech states that neither the thin slop nor the oil/water emulsion is evaporated before it is sent through the second centrifuge to recover oil.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In contrast, the patents-in-suit concentrate the thin stillage \"and then require just one centrifuge to recover oil.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CleanTech also claims that Rosten does not inherently disclose the moisture content, temperature, and pH ranges claimed in the '858 patent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, CleanTech argues that Defendants cannot rely on Eckhoff's misstatement that Rosten discloses using a centrifuge to separate oil from concentrated thin stillage because he later corrected it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 107.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-631\">\n   With respect to Rosten, the Court concludes that there is a material question of fact on whether or not the reference anticipates Claims 10-14 and 16 of the '858 patent. The Court is not troubled by Rosten's use of more than a single centrifuge or a screening process prior to use of a centrifuge to recover oil; both of these options are not foreclosed by the relevant claims or the specification of the '858 patent. But, the relevant claims of the '858 patent state that the thin stillage includes \"oil and solids.\" MDN 120-2, '858 Patent, col6, ll35-36. In Rosten, distillers thin slops contains all three elements, MDN 945-66, Rosten col1, ll44-50; however, there is no indication in Rosten that this\n   material is concentrated and there is conflicting expert testimony on this issue. MDN 1173 at 21-22, 105-07; MDN 1028 at 41-42, 129. In addition, it is not entirely clear that the \"lighter cut, i.e. the emulsion of germ oil and water\" that is further centrifuged to recover oil, meets the definition of thin stillage concentrate in the '858 patent as defined by the Court. \"Concentrated thin stillage\" is defined as \"syrup containing water, oil and solids resulting from the concentrating or evaporating process.\" MDN 169 at 10-13. Although Claims 10-14 and 16 of the '858 patent do not require evaporation, as asserted by CleanTech, they do require production of a \"thin stillage concentrate\" that includes solids. MDN 120-2, '858 Patent, col6, ll37. Rosten equivocates on the content of the emulsion stating that \"[t]he lighter of these is mainly an emulsion of corn oil and water.\" MDN 945-66, Rosten col2, ll24-25. And there is competing expert testimony about the components of Rosten's version of \"concentrated thin stillage\" that cannot be resolved on summary judgment. MDN 1173 at 21-22, 105-07; MDN 1028 at 41-42, 129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-632\">\n   With respect to the temperature, moisture content and pH elements, there is also a material question of fact as to whether or not Rosten inherently discloses them. Although Defendants characterize the screened distillers slops, or distillers thin slops, as the \"concentrated thin stillage\" that is subjected to heat, then a centrifuge to recover oil, whether this meets the definition of \"concentrated\" in this the case is contested. Moreover, as stated above, it is the lighter emulsion in Rosten that is further introduced to a centrifuge to recover oil. MDN 945-66, Rosten col2, ll39-46. Therefore, it is far from clear that Rosten teaches heating a concentrated thin stillage, meaning a mixture of oil, water and solids created by some kind of concentrating step. Further, unlike in the '858 patent family or in Prevost where it is clear that the dry mill ethanol process is the focus of the inventions, in Rosten, the inventor used broader language to describe the field of his invention and never sets forth the distinct steps to obtain whole stillage, thin stillage or concentrated thin stillage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rosten col1, ll1-36. As a result, there is a material question of fact as to whether Rosten inherently discloses the pH and moisture ranges specified in the relevant claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-633\">\n   For these reasons, the Court cannot conclude as a matter of law that Rosten anticipates Claims 10-14 and 16 of the '858 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-634\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

MDN 1093 at 34-57. Specifically, the inventions are nothing more than a combination of old elements that yield a predictable and unremarkable result: separating oil from other constituent materials. MDN 1173 at 108. Defendants contend that neither the scope of the prior art nor the level of skill of a POSA is materially disputed, and, presuming that CleanTech's version of the scope of the claims is accurate, the claims are obvious. MDN 1093 at 34-51 &amp; n.5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   MDN 1173 at 108-16. Defendants argue further that secondary considerations do not overcome the strong evidence of obviousness.

MDN 1028 at 107-09. CleanTech contends that the patented \"invention was a counterintuitive solution to a long-existing problem, one that overcame several significant obstacles to reach previously unheard efficiency in the extraction of corn oil.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110. Specifically, a POSA would not have tried to centrifuge the higher-viscosity concentrated thin stillage; rather, he or she would have followed Prevost, which taught away from centrifuging concentrated thin stillage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110-13. In fact, CleanTech asserts that material questions of fact exist as to each of the prior art references and combinations thereof that preclude summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 128-34. In addition, a POSA would have had a variety of equipment options, not just a centrifuge, to perform the separation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113-15. According to CleanTech, compounding the complexity of the problem was that the concentrated thin stillage contained solids, which would have made it difficult, if not impossible, for a POSA to predict the success of any particular piece of separation equipment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115. Further, CleanTech argues that the secondary considerations of non-obviousness at least create a question of material fact and the Court should ignore any facts raised regarding these factors by Defendants in their reply.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115-27; MDN 1138 at 2-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-638\">\n   The Court concludes that there is no material question of fact that the '858 patent family would have been obvious to a POSA at the time of the invention. There is no material dispute about the level of skill of a POSA. A POSA is at least a person with a chemical engineering degree or a person with another engineering degree with experience in process engineering and/or separation technology. MDN 1093 at 35-36 &amp; n.5; MDN 1028 at 15 &amp; 31. Persons with a science degree and a work history in oil separation techniques may also qualify as a POSA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-639\">\n   With respect to the scope of the prior art, there is no material question of fact regarding the scope of the relevant patents or the other prior art disclosures proffered by Defendants. In fact, CleanTech's major argument focuses on the secondary considerations of non-obviousness, which the Court addresses later. The Court's anticipation discussion regarding the two major pieces of prior art cited by Defendants, Prevost and Rosten, makes clear that there is only minor differences between those references and the prior art. Prevost discloses centrifugation of concentrated thin stillage to recover oil. The only elements of the '858 patent family missing from Prevost's explicit teachings are specific pH, moisture content and temperature range requirements that are\n   indisputably encompassed by the standard operating conditions of a dry mill ethanol plant and the heating element recited in some of the claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section VI.C,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . The Court has concluded that the heating elements are not described in the '858 patent family and therefore, they are invalid pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"579\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section VI.E.,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . Even if the Court is incorrect in this conclusion, Rosten discloses a heating step on thin slops, which is a mixture of solids, water and oil. MDN 945-66, Rosten col1, l50 to col2, l6. A \"mixture of solids, water and oil\" is analogous to the Court's construction of the term \"concentrate\" / \"concentrated byproduct\" / \"concentrated thin stillage\" in the '858 patent family and is consistent with the meaning of the term in this industry. MDN 169 at 10-13. Moreover, a POSA would know from his own standard process that heat in the evaporator was essential to keep the product flowing through the system. MDN 1173 at 19. A jury could only conclude from the evidence in the record that if there was a need to recover oil from thin stillage, a POSA would be motivated to try centrifugation of evaporated thin stillage based on these two references alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-640\">\n   If these two references alone were not enough, Lachle teaches that, regardless of feedstock, i.e. fish, other animal fats, or corn, the byproduct could be processed similarly (using a centrifuge) to recover oil. MDN 1173 at 30; MDN 945-67, Lachle at 4, left col, ll40-53. Further, there is no dispute that by the time of the '858 patent family invention the markets for oil recovered from byproducts in the fish, poultry and meat industries were well-developed because there was a need for the revenue source and a market for the product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Sections VI.3.d. &amp; d.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . The \"systems\" sold in these industries to recover oil were identical to the patented invention; CleanTech's own expert identified the diagrams from the fish and whey processing industries as the same process as the one described in the patents-in-suit. MDN 1173 at 33 (citing MDN 949-4, Eckhoff Dep. at 262-66, MDN 949-108 &amp; MDN 949-109). CleanTech makes much of the argument that the fats or oils in these systems were different in many respects, MDN 1028 at 44-46, 47-49, 110-111, 115; but those are not the material aspects of the patented invention. In fact, other than the references to moisture and pH, the chemical composition of thin stillage or thin stillage concentrate is never discussed in the '858 patent family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-641\">\n   CleanTech's disavowal of animal processing references is surprising considering the inventors themselves connected their success in poultry processing to the patented invention. Indeed, Winsness instructed Dyer to base the Ethanol System Diagram on the system at Case Farms. MDN 1173 at 47-48. Contemporaneous documents surrounding the July 31 Proposal confirm that both Winsness and Cantrell saw a synergy between VDT's success in the meat and poultry industries and recovery of oil in the dry mill ethanol manufacturing industry. MDN 1173 at 28, 58. Therefore, such prior art is relevant to the obviousness analysis and highlights the similarity of the processes as identified in Lachle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-642\">\n   Furthermore, any efficiency or quality improvements that CleanTech boasts to differentiate the patented invention from prior art systems is belied by its stance about the breadth of its claims with respect to infringement. There are no efficiency or oil quality requirements in the claims save for the \"substantially oil free\" limitation. If the Court had adopted CleanTech's proffered view that \"substantially oil free\" means 51% or more oil is removed, there is no difference between that system and the one proposed in Rosten. Further, Prevost specifically identifies that one of its main goals is to produce \"substantially\n   fat free products ... from both the thin stillage stream and the wet distillers grains.\" MDN 945-49, Prevost, Abstract. In any event, there is no specific quantification of any alleged improvements in the patented invention over the prior art; therefore, the Court cannot agree that they provide a meaningful basis upon which to distinguish any of the prior art and do not create a question of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-643\">\n   CleanTech's expert has asserted that Prevost teaches away from the patented invention because it expresses a preference for solvent extraction if oil removal is performed on the post-evaporation thin stillage and would be inconsistent with Stokes Law. MDN 1028 at 129-30; MDN 1040-2 at 36-37, Eckhoff Van Gerpen Rebuttal Rep. \u00b6 103. A reference teaches away \" 'when a person of ordinary skill, upon reading the reference, would be discouraged from following the path set out in the reference.' \"\n   <em>\n    Galderma Labs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3730879\" index=\"580\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/737/731/#p738\">\n    737 F.3d at 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    DePuy Spine\n   </em>\n   , 567 F.3d at 1327. \"[A] general preference\" does not teach away unless it \"criticize[s], discredit[s] or otherwise discourage[s] investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    DePuy Spine\n   </em>\n   , 567 F.3d at 1327 ). Here, the actual claims of Prevost specifically negate such an understanding because Claims 19 and 20 expressly claim centrifugation of evaporated thin stillage. MDN 945-49, Prevost at 6. As discussed above, no matter which expert you believe, Prevost's claim to centrifugation of thin stillage with a moisture content of 15% water by weight was most likely an error because all the experts agree it would be difficult if not impossible to recover oil from thin stillage via centrifuge with only 15% moisture. MDN 945-11 at 5, Hammond Aff. \u00b6 16; MDN 949-125 at 17, Harris Rep. at 16; MDN 949-126 at 38039, Rockstraw Rep. \u00b6 81; MDN 949-2 at 46-47, Monceaux Rep. at \u00b6 103; MDN 949-124 at 28-29, Reilly Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 63-64; MDN 949-4 at 14, 22, 24, Eckhoff Dep. at 120-21, 210, 238-39; MDN 1040-2 at 39, Eckhoff Rebuttal Expert Rep. \u00b6 116. Any reasonable substitute, or just striking the requirement in its entirety, reads on the patents-in-suit. The undisputed evidence makes clear that a POSA would have looked to the prior art and would have been motivated to use a centrifuge to recover oil from concentrated thin stillage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-644\">\n   CleanTech also focuses heavily on secondary considerations of nonobviousness. Specifically, commercial success, long felt need, copying, unexpected results, acceptance by others and initial skepticism. MDN 1028 at 115-27. It also argues that Defendants' failure to raise them in their opening brief means summary judgment on obviousness should be denied summarily.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116. The Court disagrees with CleanTech's assessment of Defendants' arguments as well as the purpose of secondary considerations. Defendants never labeled it as such, but they addressed secondary considerations of non-obviousness both in some introductory paragraphs of their opening brief as well as statements of fact and within their obviousness analysis. MDN 1173 at 22 (discussing GEA's test at CVEC and its belief that ethanol producers were not interest in this revenue stream at the time), 107, 109-110 (discussing the failure of the industry to need oil recovery), 113 (discussing old world technology). Even if they had not done so, \"once a challenger introduces evidence that might lead to a conclusion of invalidity-what [the Federal Circuit calls] a prima facie case-the patentee 'would be well advised to introduce evidence sufficient to rebut that of the challenger.' \"\n   <em>\n    Pfizer, Inc. v.

For example, the need for oil recovery in the market at the time of the invention is far from clear. But, Cantrell himself recognized that creating a market for the recovered oil would be paramount to successful sales of systems into the dry mill ethanol industry. MDN 1173 at 53-54 (discussing undisputed facts related to Cantrell's development of a marketing team in \"an effort to remove all obstacles\" to Agri-Energy's \"acceptance of an offer\"). And, CleanTech's own data in 2007 suggested that supply in the domestic market for the oil recovered already exceeded demand. MDN 1093 at 53-54 (discussing CleanTech's expert Shurson's testimony and data). In further example, any industry praise is contested because many of the articles and comments CleanTech relies upon were made by CleanTech business partners, or fail to mention or relate to the patents specifically.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   MDN 1028 at 81-82\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   MDN 1093 at 103. The question is whether or not these factual issues overcome strong evidence presented by Defendants that the '858 patent family invention is nothing more than a new combination of old elements. The Court is convinced that the evidence is overwhelmingly in Defendants' favor primarily because the difference between the prior art and the claimed invention is very, very small and, as acknowledged by Winsness, the technology at issue was over fifty years old and a well-known solution to the problem of separation of oil from byproducts of processing foods and grains, even when the byproduct is contaminated with solids.

Specifically, the patentees stated: (1) \"Applicants have carefully studied Prevost and can find no teaching or suggestion of a\n   <em>\n    post evaporation process\n   </em>\n   for recovering oil from the concentrated byproduct by heating and mechanical processing as in claim 1 and 16 or by centrifuging as in claim 14.\"; MDN 120-5 at 105 (emphasis in original); and (2) \"For the reasons discussed above, any disclosed heating [in Minowa] is limited to whole stillage.

CleanTech further argues that the prosecution history related to Minowa is irrelevant because it only addresses Minowa's lack of an evaporation step for thin stillage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-653\">\n   The Court concludes that the '858 patent family does not disclose a separate method for heating the concentrated thin stillage; therefore, the \"heating\" claims are invalid pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"596\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). The language in the specification that CleanTech relies upon does not specifically disclose a method for separately heating the evaporated thin stillage; it merely states that the recovery step could include providing the concentrate at a certain temperature. MDN 120-2, '858 Patent, col2, ll23-30. Also, CleanTech acknowledges that Defendants' expert was talking about well-known methods for heating \"thin stillage,\" namely a heat exchanger. MDN 1028 at 138 (citing MDN 1040-4 at 151, Reilly Dep. at 150). When taking that fact in CleanTech's favor, it suggests that the '858 patent inherently discloses methods of heating; but such an argument is belied by the prosecution history where the inventors specifically distinguish prior art based on the absence of a disclosed heating process. MDN 120-5 at 105, 128. Like the patents-in-suit, Prevost discloses an evaporator for concentrating thin stillage, which necessarily heats the resulting syrup. In other words, as Defendants have suggested, if the '858 patent inherently discloses well-known methods of heating concentrated thin stillage (the product resulting from the prior art evaporation process), then a reasonable jury could only conclude that Prevost also inherently discloses the same methods of \"heating\" prior to centrifugation because it discloses centrifugation of post-evaporation thin stillage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-654\">\n   Further, the Court disagrees with CleanTech that the prosecution history references are irrelevant because post-evaporation heating was specifically identified as a point of differentiation between Prevost and/or the combination of Prevost/Minowa and the '858 patent family. The referenced description distinguishing Minowa makes clear that the inventors were relying upon the evaporation process to heat the thin stillage and perform the desired effect of freeing bound oil in the thin stillage. MDN 120-5 at 128. This is not what they claimed; what they claimed was a heating step separate and apart from the concentrating step. MDN 169 at 17-19. Nowhere in the specification do the inventors disclose how such an independent step would be performed other than evaporation. Accordingly, a separate heating step as required by the Court's claim construction is not included in the written description and the heating claims must fail pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"597\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-655\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

Defendants argue that the uncontested evidence in the record is that centrifuges will not work on products with moisture contents that low. MDN 1093 at 61-62. Specifically, CleanTech's expert testified that he was more certain that centrifugation of syrup with a moisture content below 30% would not work to recover oil.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"598\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"598\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    at 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; MDN 1173 at 118 (citing MDN 949-4, Eckhoff Dep. at 238-40).

MDN 1093 at 62. Similarly, Defendants claim that Claims 8 and 13 of the '858 patent ; Claim 1 of the '517 patent ; and Claims 16, 18 and 28 of the '484 patent are not enabled because CleanTech's expert clearly stated that a centrifuge cannot be used to recover oil from syrup with a moisture content of 30% or below; rather, the limit was 40%.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"599\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"599\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

CleanTech asserts that these facts at least create a genuine issue of material fact on inventorship because a jury could conclude that Barlage's suggestion of a different, two-phase process to recover oil was not a contribution to the conception of the invention.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 142.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-670\">\n   The undisputed material facts compel the conclusion that Barlage was a co-inventor of the '858 patent family. It is undisputed that neither Cantrell nor Winsness knew the best location for recovering oil from the thin stillage prior to Barlage's spin tests on May 31, 2001. MDN 1173 at 41-42; Cause No. 1:13-mc-0058-LJM-DML, Dkt. No. 16 at 9; MDN 1028 at 20; MDN 1093 at 64. It is also undisputed that Barlage wrote the following after the spin test regarding recovery of oil from concentrated thin stillage that he had heated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-671\">\n   Something in the evaporation process allows for the product to breakdown to a level where the oil can be taken out easily. The possible methods for doing this separation would require two steps. First, a nozzle type centrifuge or decanter would be used to remove the heavy suspended solids. The liquid from here could be run to a secondary centrifuge where the oil is purified. The liquid from this centrifuge could be blended back with the solids or possibly evaporated further in the current evaporator. The solids from the first centrifuge would go to the drier as they do today. Further in plant testing will be required to fully determine the best method of commercialization for this process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-672\">\n   MDN 1173 at 43-44; MDN 949-66; MDN 1042-20. CleanTech has admitted that a key discovery for the patented inventions was where to put the oil recovery system, MDN 1028 at 97, which was clearly answered here by Barlage in this passage. Further, the patentees identified this feature as a reason that the invention was patentable over prior art. Specifically, the patentees argued: \"[The] claimed processes frees a portion of the bound oil as a result of evaporating the thin stillage to remove water and form a concentrated by product. Removing a portion of the bound water breaks the emulsion allowing mechanical processing to further separate and recover the oil.\" MDN 1173 at 67 (citing MDN 120-5 at 130, '858 Patent Prosecution History at 129).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-673\">\n   Moreover, the Court agrees with Defendants that the claims of the patents-in-suit do not foreclose the method described by Barlage as being an optimal one for commercialization of a process. In fact, the Court has rejected Defendants' argument that the \"mechanical processing\" term must exclude multiple mechanical processing techniques, which is exactly what Barlage suggests-multiple mechanical processing techniques-although both of his techniques involve a centrifuge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sections IV.B. &amp; V.B.1.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Under the Court's construct as advocated by CleanTech itself, even the claims referencing a centrifuge do not foreclose the possibility that other mechanical processing techniques be used to facilitate the recovery of oil. In fact, some of the claims do not require an evaporator to perform the concentrating step, which suggests other options for performing that step, including a centrifuge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-674\">\n   Finally, contemporaneous marketing documents clearly evidence that Cantrell, Winsness and Barlage agreed that Barlage was a co-inventor: at least three VDT documents regarding the oil recovery team identify Barlage as a co-inventor. MDN 949-110 at 2; MDN 949-111 at 2; MDN 945-20 at 3. In light of all the contemporaneous evidence, Barlage's objection to being named as a co-inventor, his prior experience in the ethanol industry (which in point of fact is no different than that of Cantrell or Winsness), and any instructions he may or may not recall having received from Cantrell and/or Winsness before performing the spin test are irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-675\">\n   The patents in the '858 patent family are invalid for failure to name the correct inventors pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"610\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) and summary judgment in favor of Defendants is appropriate on that ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-676\">\n   <strong>\n    H.

The Court requested supplemental briefing on the issue and has considered all of the relevant arguments from both sets of briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-678\">\n   Section 112, \u00b6 2 requires that a patentee \"conclude the specification with 'one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.' \"\n   <em>\n    Nautilus\n   </em>\n   , 134 S.Ct. at 2124 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"614\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 2). This requirement has given rise to questions regarding how precise a patentee must be in drafting his claims given that he must take into account \"the inherent limitations of language\" but ensure that the language is \"precise enough to afford clear notice of\n   what is claimed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"615\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"615\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    at 2128-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the competing interests in drafting claims).

MDN 1215 at 3. Recognizing that there are inherent limits to the language, Defendants assert that there should have been no issue regarding the oil purity level claimed in the '858 patent family because the percentage of oil is definable and the inventors knew how to claim percentages with respect to other elements such as moisture percentage and as to all relevant materials in Figure 2.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court rejected Defendants suggestion to read the limitation from Figure 2 into the claims, but, according to Defendants, the Court's definition leaves one of ordinary skill in the art to guess at the boundaries of the \"oil\" term.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Defendants, this \"is the epitome of\n   <em>\n    uncertainty\n   </em>\n   , and a far cry from the 'reasonable certainty' that \u00a7 112, \u00b6 2 demands.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, Defendants point to the expert testimony in this case to substantiate their view that the term \" 'largely or mostly oil' is \"not very precise' \" and absent further guidance from the Court, the experts cannot agree on an amount of oil recovery that would satisfy the claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Moreover, Defendants claim that CleanTech's reasoning regarding the teachings in the specification is flawed because it has focused on the wrong parameter, namely the amount of oil in the pre-drying recombined product consisting of wet distillers grains and reduced oil syrup. MDN 1238 at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-680\">\n   CleanTech asserts that the Court's claim construction analysis effectively performed a \"reasonable certainty\" analysis when it determined that the plain meaning of substantially applies, particularly with respect to the \"substantially oil free\" term. MDN 1226 at 3. Further, a POSA would read the specification's disclosure to mean that \"substantially oil\" means a stream that contains a majority of oil.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Specifically, CleanTech points to the portions that teach: \"Recombining the syrup (which is\n   <strong>\n    substantially free of oil\n   </strong>\n   ) from the centrifuge\n   <strong>\n    14\n   </strong>\n   with the distillers wet grains' can result[ ] in further efficiencies upon drying. 'Moreover,\n   <strong>\n    removal of the majority of the oil\n   </strong>\n   before the drying step makes the process more efficient.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4 (quoting MDN 120-5, '858 Patent, col4, ll54-55, 63-65 (emphasis added by CleanTech) ). Further, even Defendants' expert understood the Court's claim construction to mean that the scope of the term \"substantially\" was greater than 50%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-681\">\n   The Court concludes that under its claim construction for the pertinent terms \"oil\" and \"substantially oil free\" as further discussed and clarified in Section IV.A. of this Order, summary judgment is appropriate on Defendants' claim that the terms that recite recovery of \"oil,\" without the \"substantially oil free\" limitation, are invalid for indefiniteness. CleanTech's argument to the contrary fails because it is based upon the notion that the term \"substantially oil free\" means that more than 50% of the oil is removed, which the Court has rejected. The Court further rejects CleanTech's argument because the \"oil\" term is in all the claims, but the \"substantially oil free\" term is not. CleanTech won on this issue during claim construction as to the '516 and the '484 patent and clarification of the scope of the remaining claims of\n   the '858 patent family, and the Court will not adopt CleanTech's sophistic argument to the contrary now. MDN 784 at 9-14; MDN 179, at 34-36; MDN 510 at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-682\">\n   The Court has concluded that, based on the intrinsic evidence, there is no principled way to limit the scope of the term \"oil\" other than \"substantially\" or \"largely or mostly\" and there is evidence in the specification itself that indicates the patentees intended for the term to be ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section IV.A.1.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . It is precisely in this type of case that the balance struck in \u00a7 112, \u00b6 2 and by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Nautilus\n   </em>\n   should apply: too much uncertainty must doom the claims because they do not reasonably \"inform those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.\"\n   <em>\n    Nautilus\n   </em>\n   , 134 S.Ct. at 2124. The contrast between CleanTech's arguments on infringement and invalidity only highlight the problem with the term \"oil\" in the claims: as to infringement, it argues that \"anything over 50% infringes;\" but as to invalidity, the invention is different from what Barlage did in either the lab or at Agri-Energy because it was not proven to \"work for its intended purpose,\" MDN 1028 at 94-96; and further disavow prior art because those systems were not successful in either efficiency or economy, MDN 1028 at 17, 29, 52, 71-72. Even more telling, is that CleanTech admits in it its brief on invalidity that the claims do not require a commercial embodiment. MDN 1028 at 136. CleanTech is right: the claims contain no efficiency or quality requirements at all much less ones related to commercial standards. It is precisely for that reason that the claims with an \"oil\" limitation fail \"to inform those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention with reasonable certainty.\"\n   <em>\n    Nautilus\n   </em>\n   , 134 S.Ct. at 2124.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-683\">\n   For these reasons, the Court concludes that the term \"oil\" is indefinite and renders invalid Claims 1 through 16 of the '858 patent ; Claims 1 through 6 of the '516 patent ; Claims 1 and 2 of the '517 patent ; and Claims 1 through 7 and fifteen through 30 of the '484 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-684\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.\n    <em>\n     WILLFUL INFRINGEMENT- '858 PATENT FAMILY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-685\">\n   Defendants contend that under the objective prong of the\n   <em>\n    In re Seagate Tech., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3618527\" index=\"616\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/497/1360/\">\n    497 F.3d 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed.

The Court agrees with CleanTech that, while the requirements of the '037 patent claims regarding oil recovery systems meet the definition of \u00a7 102(e) prior art, the specific disclosure of the '858 patent references the reintroduction of the reduced oil syrup to an evaporator to recover more oil, not to reduce the moisture content before drying. Dkt. No. 120-2, '858 patent, col5, ll46-48. Further, evidence that the USPTO rejected similar claims under \u00a7 102(e), but withdrew the objection based on Winsness' affidavit of sole inventorship of the evaporative steps that are novel and unique to the '037 patent, convinces the Court that the '858 patent does not render the '037 patent obvious pursuant to \u00a7 102(e).

MDN 1179 at 6. If it is not already disclosed in the '858 patent specification, the alleged improvement, Defendants contend, is merely an obvious extension of the existing ethanol recovery process for creating DDGS and one of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to further reduce the moisture content of the post-oil recovery thin stillage before mixing it with distillers wet grains and drying the mixture. MDN 1072 at 30-31; MDN 1179 at 6-10.

There is no dispute that a POSA would be familiar with the prior art ethanol plant processes, including evaporation of the thin stillage to reduce the moisture content before mixing it with wet distillers grains to form DDGS. There is also no real dispute that the '858 patent is prior art with respect to the oil recovery processes disclosed therein, nor could there be since the oil recovery portions of the claims of the '037 patent mirror those of the '858 patent family. In fact, the '858 patent teaches that the oil recovery method is performed on concentrated thin stillage, which is formed using the evaporators already in existence at an ethanol plant. Dkt. No. 120-2, '858 Patent, col5, ll28-30. It discloses further that dryer efficiencies can be gained from removal of the oil from the syrup prior to mixing with wet distillers grains.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556178\" index=\"659\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/398/#p427\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   col4, ll54-56;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556178\" index=\"660\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/398/#p427\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   col5, ll15-25. In other words, efficiencies in making DDGS would be important in an ethanol plant that is selling its valuable byproducts. Moreover, CleanTech makes no real argument to refute that the prior art cited by the '037 Defendants discloses that an evaporator system is four or five times more efficient for removing water than a dryer. MDN 1160 at 24-26; MDN 1072 at 31-32. Because the '858 patent both suggests (and claims) drying the post-oil recovery syrup before adding it back to the DDGS and references\n   the possibility of re-introducing the post-oil recovery syrup to the evaporation system, a POSA would have been motivated to lower the moisture content of the de-oiled syrup using evaporation based on either her own knowledge of the prior art system, or the Alcohol Textbook, or the Willgohs patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-709\">\n   With respect to secondary considerations of non-obviousness, CleanTech proffers no evidence that such considerations would overcome the strong showing of obviousness proffered by the '037 Defendants.

Adkins requests that the Court deny CleanTech's motion for summary judgment;\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   deem established that as of April 18, 2007, CleanTech was in breach of the Corn Oil Agreement; order CleanTech to pay Adkins' reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, for taking depositions of CleanTech's witnesses; and order CleanTech to pay Adkins' attorneys' fees for filing the motion for sanctions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-726\">\n   In contrast, CleanTech claims that its delay was justified and that Adkins' own failure to participate in the consolidated discovery process ordered by the Court caused any perceived prejudice. MDN 817 at 5-13. In any event, according to CleanTech there is no prejudice because Adkins knew that discovery was ongoing even when it filed its own motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract counterclaim and, the documents Adkins cites as prejudicial were found in Adkins' own production.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9, 12. CleanTech also takes issue with Adkins' failure to confer with CleanTech regarding the dispute prior to filing the motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. CleanTech asserts its own request for relief from \"Adkins' [a]busive [b]ehavior,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19; but, other than complaining about Adkins' litigation tactics, CleanTech makes no specific request for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-727\">\n   Adkins' Motion for Sanctions is brought pursuant to\n   Rule 37(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\" Rule 37(c)\"). Rule 37(c) states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-728\">\n   [I]f a party fails to provide information ... as required by rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information ... to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless. In addition to or instead of this sanction, the court, on motion and after giving an opportunity to be heard, may order payment of the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-729\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c). A sanction determination under this rule is guided by the following factors: (1) the prejudice or surprise to the opposing party; (2) the ability to cure the prejudice; (3) the likelihood of disruption of the trial; and (4) the bad faith or willfulness involved in the party's failure timely to disclose the evidence.\n   <em>\n    David v. Caterpillar, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2160795\" index=\"714\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/324/851/#p857\">\n    324 F.3d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 857 (7th Cir. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-730\">\n   In weighing these factors, the Court concludes that minimal sanctions are required. Under the guidance of this Court, the parties have engaged in coordinated discovery, particularly with respect to electronically stored information or \"ESI.\" Although it is clear that Adkins and CleanTech agreed to ESI search terms in June 2011, it is equally clear that the parties each thought that agreement would be carried out differently. CleanTech believed it was searching all relevant terms for all Defendants, MDN 811-6; Adkins believed CleanTech would work with Adkins independently of the remaining Defendants on ESI specific to Adkins. MDN 811-7. Adkins' belief that all documents, including ESI, had been produced was also predicated on multiple assertions by CleanTech's counsel and witnesses that everything had been produced, but a double-check of sorts would be performed and anything new turned over promptly. MDN 824 at 7 (listing various assertions by counsel or witnesses as to the status of document production). But, Adkins cannot claim total ignorance of the status of production of ESI in particular because, as CleanTech points out, it was discussed, at least, at a January 9, 2013, status conference with the Magistrate Judge. MDN 817 at 15-16. Further, there is no evidence that Adkins did any follow up of its own regarding CleanTech's production until CleanTech announced its intention to file a motion for summary judgment on Adkins' breach of contract counterclaim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-731\">\n   In addition, some of the documents Adkins claims prevented it from adequately deposing CleanTech's witnesses or from preparing its opposition to CleanTech's motion for summary judgment were already in Adkins' possession.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. The Court recognizes that the documents Adkins references are only a small portion of the total documents CleanTech produced; however, there was no evidence in the briefing of CleanTech's motion for summary judgment that Adkins could not adequately respond to CleanTech's allegations that no material questions of fact existed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , MDN 801 at 9-15, 28-39 (setting forth the material facts, including material facts in dispute). In fact, the Court overwhelmingly concluded in Adkins' favor that many facts related to Adkins' breach of contract counterclaim remained in dispute. MDN 843.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-732\">\n   The Court is concerned, however, that some of the ESI documents produced two weeks before CleanTech filed its motion for summary judgment were internal documents between employees at CleanTech for which Adkins had no other source. Further, some of the documents will undoubtedly be used by Adkins at any trial on the merits of its breach of contract counterclaim (and, perhaps, other defenses) and Adkins did not have them when it took depositions of CleanTech's key witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-733\">\n   Despite CleanTech's protestations regarding rolling discovery and agreements to depose witnesses without complete discovery, there is prejudice to Adkins regarding the late production of these key internal documents. If CleanTech had reminded Adkins at the depositions that ESI discovery was still ongoing or otherwise mentioned at the time of the depositions that further discovery was probable, or even possible, Adkins could have adequately assessed the risk of proceeding with depositions without the totality of CleanTech's production. But CleanTech's vague references do not amount to notice that significant disclosure remained. As previously mentioned, Adkins is not completely blameless for its assumptions, but the great weight of the inferences raised by CleanTech's attorney's and witnesses comments about production was that CleanTech had produced the relevant documents, or would do so soon after the depositions if something needed to be clarified. Now that discovery is closed, absent leave of the Court, Adkins is prejudiced by the delayed disclosure because it cannot adequately prepare for CleanTech's witnesses responses regarding those internal documents. Moreover, it is likely that the documents and testimony about them could shift the settlement positions of the parties; therefore, Adkins is further prejudiced for having to prepare for a settlement conference without the benefit of the documents and testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-734\">\n   The Court concludes that any prejudice can be cured by allowing Adkins some additional time to depose CleanTech's witnesses on the late-disclosed documents at CleanTech's expense. Such a sanction would provide Adkins the opportunity to investigate further the content and meaning of the documents and adequately prepare for further settlement discussions as well as any trial on the merits. The Court will not exclude the documents, enter judgment against CleanTech or otherwise summarily decide the dispute between Adkins and CleanTech; such a sanction is too harsh in light of the obvious miscommunication between the parties and the availability of a cure for the prejudice. Adkins and CleanTech shall have twenty-eight days from the date this Order is entered to agree on a schedule to depose CleanTech's witnesses on the late-disclosed documents. No deposition shall exceed one and one-half hour absent leave of Court. Absent agreement, the parties shall file a Joint Motion for Status Conference asking the Court to resolve the issue. Accordingly, Adkins' Motion for Sanctions is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   . CleanTech's motion for relief of any kind related to the Motion for Sanctions is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-735\">\n   That issue being decided, the Court turns to Adkins' Motion for Summary Judgment on Unclean Hands. Assessing all of CleanTech's conduct to date, the Court concludes that factual issues remain and summary judgment is not appropriate. The crux of a decision to bar a plaintiff's claim under the doctrine of unclean hands is the egregious nature of the misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Therasense\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715257\" index=\"715\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/1276/#p1287\">\n    649 F.3d at 1287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although there are facets of Adkins' argument that bear close resemblance to the circumstances in the Supreme Court's trio of cases, the most egregious allegations here, which relate to CleanTech's failure to produce the July 31 Proposal (and attendant circumstances surrounding disclosure of the document and/ or others to the USPTO), CleanTech's correspondence to Sommers in 2010 requesting confirmation of Agri-Energy's understanding of the July 31 Proposal, and the potential conflict of interest of certain CleanTech experts, have not been proven with certainty. Questions remain on scienter, for lack of a better term, particularly with respect to the failure to produce the July 31 Proposal (discovery about which is ongoing), which is not an issue the Court will decide without hearing live testimony from the relevant\n   witnesses. To the extent that CleanTech expects the unclean hands issue to be heard by a jury, the Court could find no case in which a court asked a jury to opine on such a defense, which is not a surprise because it is an equitable doctrine that speaks to fraud on the court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hazel-Atlas Glass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142921\" index=\"716\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/322/238/#p244\">\n    322 U.S. at 244-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142921\" index=\"717\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/322/238/#p244\">\n    64 S.Ct. 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the power of a court to set aside judgments that are \"manifestly unconscionable\" or \"fraudulently begotten\"), and, therefore, is not an issue for a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-736\">\n   In summary, the Court is troubled by the evidence that suggests CleanTech has engaged in a pattern of obfuscation, possible deceit, and ever-shifting positions, but is unwilling at this juncture to cry foul and declare the proceedings \"manifestly unconscionable\" or \"fraudulently begotten.\" Such a determination does not preclude Adkins, or the other Defendants if they pled it, to argue for application of the doctrine at a later time, or at trial. For these reasons, Adkins' Motion for Summary Judgment on Unclean Hands, MDN 925, is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-737\">\n   <strong>\n    XI.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-738\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, the Court makes the following rulings:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-739\"><strong>Master</strong> <strong>Motion</strong> <strong>Disposition</strong> <strong>Docket</strong> <strong>Number</strong> 809 Adkins Energy LLC Motion for Sanctions GRANTED in part and DENIED in part 864 GS CleanTech Corp.
