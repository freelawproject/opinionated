Plaintiff alleges that about two weeks after entering the agreement, Moss stopped making the required payments, and defendant Anna Hakobyan, the principal of Moss, did not indemnify plaintiff for the breach, as agreed. Plaintiff claimed to have served defendants, who reside in California, on September 8, 2016. However, defendants did not respond to the complaint within 21 days as required under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(a)(1)(A)(i). On May 12, 2017, the clerk entered default. Plaintiff has moved for default judgement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Forward Financing v. Arthur Schuster, Inc., et al\n   </em>\n   ., 16-10981-MLW, plaintiff's motion was not accompanied by a memorandum of law, as required under Rule 7.1(b)(1) of the Local Rules for the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (\"Local Rule 7.1\"). In addition, \"before a default can be entered, the court must have subject-matter jurisdiction and jurisdiction over the party against whom the judgment is sought, which also means that the party must have been effectively served with process.\" 10A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Fed.

Gen. Laws Chapter 223A, \u00a7 3, permit the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendants, both of whom reside in California.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. Plaintiff alleges that its principle place of business is in Boston, Massachusetts and that its members reside in the state. However, there is no allegation that defendants negotiated or executed the contract in Massachusetts, sent payments to defendants' Massachusetts headquarters, or otherwise transacted any business in the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baskin-Robbins Franchising LLC v.

Rather, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 4(h) and 4(e)(1) require a plaintiff to serve a corporation in a judicial district of the United States in one of two ways. First, the plaintiff may \"follow[ ] state law for serving a summons in an action brought in courts of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located or where service is made.\" Fed. R. Civ. 4(e)(1). The plaintiff has sued in the District of Massachusetts and purported to serve Moss in California. Therefore, he must serve process according to: Rules 4(d)(2) and (e) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure ; \u00a7 416.10 of the California Code of civil Procedure ; or Rule 4(h)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Massachusetts and federal rules require service on \"an officer,\" a \"managing or general agent,\" or any other agent authorized to accept service on behalf of a corporation. Mass. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(2) &amp; (e); Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(h)(1)(B). California law requires service on \"the person designated as the agent for service of process or the 'president, chief executive officer, or other head of the corporation, a vice president, a secretary or assistant secretary, a treasurer or assistant treasurer, a controller or chief financial officer, a general manager, or a person authorized by the corporation to receive service of process.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bovier v.
