Doc. 1. The parties are currently engaged in discovery. Trench-France, a French corporation with its principal place of business in France, has filed a motion to appoint a commissioner pursuant to Article 17 of Chapter II of the Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters (the \"Hague Convention\"),\n   <em>\n    opened for signature\n   </em>\n   March 18, 1970, 28 U.S.T. 2555, T.I.A.S.

Doc. 78 at 43 \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Trench-France seeks to use the Chapter II procedure. It has identified Mr. Christian Curtil, an independent French attorney, as its proposed commissioner, and has submitted a formal request form, which it will translate to French and submit to the appropriate office of the French Ministry if the Court approves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 78 at 44 \u00b6\u00b6 21-22; Doc. 78-1 at 5-9.

Trench-France has consistently maintained this position, raising the need for the appointment of a commissioner at the parties' Rule 26(f) conference, the Rule 16 scheduling conference, and in its initial MIDP response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 67 at 7; Doc. 79 at 22-26; Doc. 78 at 29-30.

Analysis.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Given Trench-France's declaration that it has relevant evidence in France, and the declaration it has provided from an experienced French attorney on the applicable French law and procedures, the Court will accept Trench-France's assertion that production of the documents and ESI required by the MIDP would violate French law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richmark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524342\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/1468/#p1471\">\n    959 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1474 &amp; n.7 (accepting foreign party's assertion on the basis of a letter from the foreign government, and stating that \"[w]e have neither the power nor the expertise to determine for ourselves what [the other country's] law is\");\n   <em>\n    Connex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203433542\">\n    2017 WL 3433542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (accepting French party's assertion on the basis of a declaration from French counsel, a copy of the French Blocking Statute, and a letter from the French Ministry of Justice). With that assumption, the Court will address each of the relevant factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Importance of the Documents and ESI.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Where the outcome of litigation 'does not stand or fall on the present discovery\n   order,' or where the evidence sought is cumulative of existing evidence, courts have generally been unwilling to override foreign secrecy laws. Where the evidence is directly relevant, however,\" this factor weighs against utilizing Hague procedures.\n   <em>\n    Richmark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524342\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/1468/#p1471\">\n    959 F.2d at 1475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Trench-France argues that the documents and ESI in its possession are not of critical importance because they are mostly cumulative of evidence that Trench-Canada will produce. Doc. 78 at 10. SRP argues that, by definition, any documents and ESI subject to the MIDP are \"directly relevant\" and crucial to this litigation. Doc. 84 at 5-6. Although it is unclear how many documents are possessed exclusively by Trench-France, the Court has no basis at this point for concluding that the documents are critically important to the resolution of this case. The MIDP sweeps broadly, requiring production of information relevant to claims or defenses, but that does not mean that all information subject to production will prove pivotal to the outcome of this case. The Court finds that this factor weighs slightly in favor of utilizing Hague procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Specificity of the Request.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This factor considers \"how burdensome it will be to respond to\" the discovery request.\n   <em>\n    Richmark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524342\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/1468/#p1471\">\n    959 F.2d at 1475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Broad, generalized requests for information weigh in favor of utilizing Hague procedures, while specific, limited requests disfavor the use of Hague procedures.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524342\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/1468/#p1471\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Connex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203433542\">\n    2017 WL 3433542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Trench-France argues that the MIDP's request for all documents and ESI that \"may be relevant\" is broad and generalized. Doc. 78 at 11. SRP responds that the MIDP is narrowly tailored to evidence that is relevant to the claims, and Trench-France itself has already identified the documents and ESI in its initial MIDP response. Doc. 84 at 6. Thus, SRP argues, even if facially broad, the request in reality is tailored to those specific documents which Trench-France admits to having already identified. Doc. 84 at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court cannot conclude that production under the MIDP is narrowly tailored for purposes of this analysis. It is a broad requirement for the production of relevant information. This factor weighs in favor of using the Hague procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Location of Evidence.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   If all of the information to be disclosed and the persons who will produce the information are located in the foreign country, this weighs in favor of utilizing Hague procedures because \"those people and documents are subject to the law of that country in the ordinary course of business.\"\n   <em>\n    Richmark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524342\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/1468/#p1471\">\n    959 F.2d at 1475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . SRP argues that much of the evidence originated in Arizona, and that Trench-France is \"a multinational corporation, operating under various entities in various countries.\" Doc. 84 at 7. Trench-France states that Trench-Canada will produce all relevant information in its possession without the need for Hague procedures. Doc. 78 at 4. Thus, the only information subject to this motion is information not in the possession of Trench-Canada-information that Trench-France asserts is located in France. This factor favors use of the Hague procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Availability of Alternative Means.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"If the information sought can easily be obtained elsewhere, there is little or no reason to require a party to violate foreign law.\"\n   <em>\n    Richmark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524342\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/1468/#p1471\">\n    959 F.2d at 1475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

SRP asserts that using Hague procedures will \"undoubtedly delay this litigation\" and that it may be forced to hire a French attorney \"to litigate the MIDP before\" the commissioner, but SRP provides no support for these assertions. Doc. 84 at 11, 14. The Court will accept the assertions of Trench-France's French counsel who is experienced in using the Hague procedures.

Doc. 78 at 14. SRP asserts that any hardship to Trench-France is speculative. Doc. 84 at 13. Many courts have expressed doubt as to whether the French Blocking Statute subjects parties to a \"realistic risk of prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re CRT Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205462496\">\n    2014 WL 5462496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (collecting cases). Nonetheless, the Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of utilizing Hague procedures because the statute at least creates a possibility of criminal prosecution. Moreover, there is no indication that Trench-France imposed this hardship on itself or could have avoided it. Trench-France proactively has sought to overcome the hardship by raising the issue early and taking necessary steps to initiate voluntary Chapter II Hague procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    G.
