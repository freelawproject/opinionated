The issues raised have been fully briefed and are ripe for adjudication. For the following reasons, the court grants plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denies defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 25, 2015, plaintiffs the American Humanist Association (\"AHA\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Kwame Jamal Teague (\"Teague\") filed a complaint pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against defendants Frank L. Perry, David Guice, George Solomon, Betty Brown, Gwen Norville, David Mitchell, and Sara R. Cobb in their official capacities only. Defendants are current and former\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   employees of the North Carolina Department of Public Safety (\"DPS\"), and involved in policy decisions related to the recognition of faith groups in the state's prisons. Plaintiffs allege that the DPS's disparate treatment of Humanists violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs seek the entry of a declaratory judgment, permanent injunctive relief, nominal damages, and attorney's fees. Compl. [DE-1], p. 19-22. Specifically, plaintiffs seek the entry of a declaratory judgment finding,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that defendants' actions violated the Establishment and Equal Protection Clauses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 19-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, plaintiffs request that the court enter a permanent injunction ordering,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , DPS to recognize Humanism as a faith group and to authorize Humanists to meet in a study group on the same terms defendants authorize for inmates of recognized faith traditions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 20-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 28, 2017, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment [DE-68, 83].

Moreover, there are no written standards of any sort outlining the requirements for DPS to recognize a particular faith group. Pl. Ex. 107 [DE-82-2], p. 163. DPS does not recognize Humanism as a faith group. Def. Ex. C [DE-86-3]. Thus, at present, a Humanist inmate cannot assemble with other Humanist inmates to study and discuss Humanist values. Pl. Ex. 107 [DE-82-2], p. 58. Likewise, an inmate cannot designate Humanism as his preferred faith group in OPUS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Teague first sought recognition of Humanism from DPS officials in 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Def. Ex. A [DE-86-1], p. 59. After fully exhausting his administrative remedies, Teague was instructed to complete a \"Request for Religious Assistance Form (DC-572).\" Pl. Ex. 27 [DE-74-2], p. 1. Teague submitted a form DC-572 on September 18, 2012. Pl. Ex. 37 [DE-75-2]. In January 2013, DPS's Religious Practices Committee (\"RPC\") denied Teague's requests. Def. Ex. C [DE-86-3], p. 6. In support of its decision, the RPC noted: (1) it could not find a contact person for Humanism; (2) Humanism appeared to \"be a philosophy of life\" rather than a religion; (3) Humanist websites focused more on advocacy than faith practices; (4) Teague was represented by an attorney who worked for an advocacy group; (5) Teague was still listed in OPUS as a Muslim; and (6) Teague participated in religious services provided by other faiths.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The RPC met again on March 5, 2013, to reconsider recognition of Humanism as a faith group. Pl. Ex. 50 [DE-76-5]. First, the RPC noted that Teague's request for recognition of Humanism was moot because Teague was now listed in OPUS as a Buddhist.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That notwithstanding, the RPC further concluded that Humanism failed to meet the standards for approval as a faith group \"because there are many disciplines of Humanism,\" and\n   \"[t]here is no evidence ... to conclude that there is a religious structure that includes a hierarchy of religious leaders.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The RPC, however, acknowledged that Humanism promoted \"a life of personal fulfillment that aspires to the greater good of humanity,\" and did not pose a security threat.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, the RPC declined to recognize Humanism as a faith group, but determined that Teague could individually pursue his study of Humanism through \"published literature of his preference at his own expense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 15, 2013, Teague was advised by DPS officials that his DC-572 request for recognition of Humanism as a faith group was still under review. Pl. Ex. 51 [DE-76-6]. He also was notified that DPS \"records determine that you no longer have an interest for Humanism, because ... you changed your faith to Buddhist.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, Teague only changed his OPUS status from Islamic to Buddhist because Humanism was not a valid selection, and Buddhism was the only nontheistic option other than \"none.\" Pl. Ex. 110 [DE-82-5], p. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Teague submitted another DC-572 form requesting recognition of Humanism as a faith group on April 26, 2013. Pl. Ex. 53 [DE-76-8]. After Teague submitted his request, prison officials sent him a series of additional questions beyond what is normally required. Pl. Ex. 53 [DE-76-8], pp. 4-7; Pl. Ex. 108 [DE-82-3], pp. 68-69. During this time, Teague also met with prison officials and provided them additional information regarding Humanism. Def. Ex. C, [DE-86-3], pp. 13-19. On May 15, 2013, Teague was informed by letter that his renewed request was denied. Pl. Ex. 55 [DE-76-10]. Prison officials, instead, indicated they would accommodate Teague \"through individual private devotions in [his] cell, with publications that [he] may purchase.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In September 2013, Randy Best, a Humanist chaplain and a leader in the Ethical Humanist Society of the Triangle in North Carolina, sought permission from DPS to visit Teague as his pastor and conduct Humanist services for other inmates. Pl. Ex. 62 [DE-77-7]. It appears that the application was never formally approved. Pl. Ex. 98 [DE-81-3], p. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 15, 2013, Teague submitted a third DC-572 form seeking recognition of Humanism as a faith group. Pl. Ex. 64 [DE-77-9]. He also renewed his request for weekly Humanist group meetings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ex, 76 [DE-79-1], p. 3. Of note, in July 2015, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") officially recognized Humanism as a faith group and provides the group two time slots per week for worship and study. Pl. Ex. 18, [DE-73-3]. Likewise, the Department of Defense, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Department of Veterans Affairs also now recognize Humanism as a religion. Pl. Ex. 20 [DE-73-5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A. Mootness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants argue that plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief are moot because the actions described in the complaint primarily occurred at Lanesboro, and Teague has since been transferred to Nash. \"[A]s a general rule, a prisoner's transfer or release from a particular prison moots his claims for injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to his incarceration there.\"\n   <em>\n    Rendelman v.

However, an exception to the mootness doctrine exists for cases that are \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" The \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" doctrine \"applies only in exceptional situations\" where \"two circumstances [are] simultaneously present: (1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to a cessation or expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be subject to the same action again.\"\n   <em>\n    Spencer v.

Here, DPS's decision to not approve Humanism as a faith group is a system wide policy. Pl. Ex. 49 [DE-76-4].

An association has standing to sue on behalf of its members if they would have standing to sue on their own, the association seeks to protect interests germane to its purpose, and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires its individual members to participate in the lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Am.

Here, plaintiffs challenge defendants' alleged refusal to recognize Humanism as a faith group and refusal to accommodate Humanist group meetings. It is undisputed that the RPC recognizes a number of other religious groups and permits inmate members of those groups to meet in groups for study and worship in the state's prisons. Defendants provide a variety of reasons why they denied faith group recognition to Humanism, which include: (1) lack of a centralized head, formal structure, or hierarchy of other religions; (2) a multi-discipline nature; and (3) a stronger focus on advocacy, rather than faith practices. Pl. Ex. 49 [DE-76-4], p. 3; Pl. Ex. 50 [DE-76-5]; Def. Ex. C [DE-86-3], p. 6. However, DPS has recognized other faith groups, such as American Indian, Wicca, Hinduism, Asatru, Rastafarianism, and Buddhism, which also lack a centralized head or the formal structure or hierarchy of other religions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.

Sept. 29, 2015) (\"The North Carolina Department of Public Safety (\"DPS\") recognizes Wicca as an approved religion in its Religious Practices Reference Manual.\") (footnote omitted) ). Similarly, many denominations of Christianity with diverse beliefs have been approved as faith groups. Pl. Ex. 2 [DE-72-2]. Furthermore, DPS conceded that, at best, participation in advocacy was a neutral factor. Pl. Ex. 106 [DE-82-2], p. 143.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   DPS also denied recognition of Humanism because: (1) it could not find a contact person to discover more information about Humanism; (2) Teague was listed in OPUS initially as Muslim and later as a Buddhist; and (3) Teague participated in religious services provided by other faiths. Pl. Ex. 49 [DE-76-4], p. 3; Pl. Ex. 50 [DE-76-5]; Def. Ex. C [DE-86-3], p. 6. To the extent prison officials lacked information on Humanism, the record indicates that AHA's general counsel corresponded with DPS and offered to answer any questions. Pl. Ex. 31 [DE-74-6]. Additionally, Teague only identified as Buddhist because it was the available option that most closely resembled his Humanist beliefs because his preferred faith group was not available. Pl. Ex. 110 [DE-82-5], p. 14. In any event, DPS permits prisoners to attend religious services even when they do not subscribe\n   to all of that faith group's beliefs. Pl. Ex. 106 [DE-82-2], p. 149;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ben-Levi v.

Attendance at services for a recognized faith group does not preclude an inmate from having another religion recognized. Pl. Ex. 106 [DE-82-2], p. 149. Based upon the foregoing, defendants have not demonstrated a secular purpose for denying Humanism recognition as a religious group or for the decision to prohibit Humanist inmates from organizing group meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The court next considers both the second and third factors of the\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   test-whether DPS's policies regarding faith groups either advance or inhibit religion, and whether those policies foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027402\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/602/#p612\">\n    403 U.S. at 612-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027402\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/602/#p612\">\n    91 S.Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The process DPS uses to determine whether to recognize a particular faith group advances more traditional religions, but inhibits non-traditional religious groups such as Humanism. For example, Teague was subjected to additional requirements in his attempt to obtain DPS's recognition of Humanism as a faith group, without explanation. Pl. Ex. 53 [DE-76-8]; Pl. Ex. 108 [DE-82-3], p. 67-68. Indeed, it appears that Teague was asked to provide this additional information despite the fact that DPS had already decided to not recognize Humanism as a faith group. Pl. Ex. 42 [DE-75-7]; Pl. Ex. 50 [DE-76-5]. The record further reflects that DPS prison officials expressed skepticism and bias toward Humanism because it did not have a \"religious tone\" and its members \"did not believe in a deity.\" Pl. Ex. 42 [DE-75-7], p. 1; Pl. Ex. 50 [DE-76-3], p. 1 (describing Humanism as a \"weird faith\" during a committee meeting); Pl.

Rather, on the record before the court, DPS's arbitrary decision to recognize some faith groups, and not Humanism, fostered an excessive government entanglement with religion.

However, defendants are unable to establish the first\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   factor because there is no rational connection between DPS's\n   cited interests and its refusal to recognize Humanism as a faith group. As stated, it does not appear from the summary judgment record that size or demand played a role in DPS's refusal to recognize Humanism. Indeed, other faith groups have been recognized with as few as two interested inmates. Pl. Ex. 10 [DE-72-10], p. 2. The record further does not establish that Humanism was denied recognition as a faith group based on space or resource concerns. Rather, when DPS rejected Teague's requests, they focused on the merits of Humanism as a religion rather than any space, resource, or security concerns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   Def.

Rather, DPS specifically concluded that recognition of Humanism did not pose a security threat. Pl. Ex. 50 [DE-76-5]. Finally, the BOP has approved Humanism as a faith group and allots the group two time slots per week for worship and study. Pl.
