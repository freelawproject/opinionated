LAWSON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The plaintiffs in this case are victims and family members of deceased victims of the mass shooting at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Florida perpetrated by Omar Mateen on June 12, 2016. They have sued the three defendants, which provide social media platforms used by terrorist groups to spread their messages of violence and hatred. The plaintiffs believe that the access that the defendants furnished to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which apparently allowed Mateen to hear its messages via the Internet and become radicalized, triggers liability for the shooting. The plaintiffs bring claims under federal statutes that create causes of action for aiding acts of international terrorism and providing material support to terrorists and foreign terrorist organizations. They also have alleged claims under state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendants have filed a joint motion to dismiss, arguing that the claims are barred by the immunity granted to online service providers under the Communications Decency Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that the pleaded facts do not support the causes of action. There are many conclusions that can be drawn from the facts alleged in the amended complaint about the ethics and moral responsibility of those maintaining social media sites, including the defendants. But because the plaintiffs have not pleaded facts that plausibly establish\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   claims for which relief can be granted, the Court will grant the motion and dismiss the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts are taken from the amended complaint, as read favorably to the plaintiffs for this motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Omar Mateen killed 49 people and injured 53 during the June 12, 2016 shooting at the Pulse Night Club. The plaintiffs (and their decedents) are included in those numbers. They posit that the defendants are accountable for those deaths and injuries under the civil remedy allowances Congress added to the federal Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), found in Chapter 113B of the federal criminal code. In particular,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202333\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) establishes a cause of action for damages for \"[a]ny national of the United States\" who is killed or injured by \"an act of international terrorism.\" Liability extends to \"any person who aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, or who conspires with the person who committed such an act of international terrorism.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202333\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2333(d).

Although certain organizations, most notably banks, occasionally have been found liable under these federal statutes for aiding international terrorists,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4080677\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/718/456/#p489\">\n    718 F.Supp.2d 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 489 (S.D.N.Y. 2010),\n   <em>\n    aff'd on other grounds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864637\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/109/\">\n    714 F.3d 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2013), there is not a single case in which social media providers have been held responsible.

Cal. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To establish their claims, the plaintiffs must plead facts that plausibly suggest the likelihood that the Orlando night club shooting was \"an act of international terrorism,\" and that the defendants aided and abetted or conspired to commit that act, or that they provided material support directly to Mateen, or material support to ISIS\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that ISIS perpetrated the attack. Here is what they allege in their amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A. ISIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The amended complaint devotes considerable space to general allegations describing the well-known public persona of the organization popularly known as ISIS, and in particular its heavy use of the Internet and various social media facilities, including those maintained by the defendants, to spread the organization's message promoting the establishment of an Islamic State governed by Sharia law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-103. The defendants do not appear seriously to contest those general background allegations, mostly coming from published news reports, suggesting that elements of ISIS operate (or have operated) numerous Internet accounts on the defendants' services, some with thousands or tens of thousands of followers, which actively publish media and messages encouraging those who might view them to commit violent acts of terrorism, and which also publish messages claiming responsibility for violent terrorist acts around the world. The amended complaint also alleges that ISIS uses the defendants' platforms actively to solicit sympathetic funders to donate to its cause. It appears to be undisputed that as far back as December 2004, the United States designated ISIS as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that all of the defendants place targeted ads on web pages featuring content posted by ISIS accounts, and that they derive revenue from views of those ads. Additionally, defendant Google, Inc., through its YouTube platform, places ads on pages where ISIS videos are displayed and shares revenue from those ads with the account holders who post videos. That results in direct payments to the ISIS affiliates that operate those accounts. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59-60, 137-42. Despite public appeals to the defendants to take action to disable known ISIS-affiliated accounts on their services, the defendants have been unable or unwilling to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 104-133. Any ISIS accounts that the defendants do disable rapidly reappear within hours or days under simple reiterations of the same formulaic account handles used by previous accounts that were banned (e.g., accounts named \"DriftOne00147\" through \"DriftOne00151\" serially created, posting substantially the same messages, after accounts \"DriftOne00146\" through \"DriftOne00150\" were deleted). Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 121-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B. The Orlando Night Club Shooting\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On Friday, June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen entered the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Florida, and began shooting. By the time Mateen's shooting rampage ended, 49 persons attending the club that night were dead, and 53 were injured. The attack was widely reported by local, national, and international news outlets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that, shortly after the shooting, the ISIS official news agency, known as \"Amaq,\" issued a \"flash bulletin\" stating that, \"The attack that targeted a nightclub for homosexuals in Orlando, Florida, and left more than one hundred dead and wounded was carried out by an Islamic State fighter.\" The ISIS official radio station, al-Bayan, also reported on the shooting with a statement as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Allah has enabled brother Omar Mateen, one of the soldiers of the Caliphate in America, to carry out a raid where he was able to infiltrate a Crusaders' gathering at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Allah enabled him to inflict heavy casualties amongst the filthy Crusaders. He killed and injured over a hundred of them. This is the biggest raid to be carried [out] in America after the raid of Manhattan 16 years ago.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 175. During the investigation of the shooting, FBI analysts concluded that Mateen viewed Internet sites over several years and became \"self-radicalized.\" But he decided only recently before the attack to embrace the Islamic State. Mateen supposedly watched online \"jihadist sermons\" since 2012. He also had downloaded \"jihadist material\" to his computer, which included videos of beheadings of militants' captives. Omar Mateen's spouse, Noor Salman, was arrested. During the arrest, the FBI learned that Mateen viewed ISIS YouTube videos, which presumably contributed to his recruitment and radicalization. (Noor Salman was charged with providing material support to an international terrorist organization and obstruction of justice in connection with the Orlando shooting, and was acquitted by a jury earlier today.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that the Orlando night club shooting was an act of \"international terrorism,\" based on the following chain of inferences, as set forth in the amended complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   One of the state[d] goals of ISIS is to use social media including Defendants platforms to radicalize individuals to conduct attacks throughout the world, including the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   By radicalizing individuals through social media, this allowed ISIS to exert its influence without the necessity of direct physical contact with these individuals. Furthermore, this allows ISIS to incite or participate in attacks without the necessity of sending its own operatives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Thus, an attack in the United States to which ISIS' use of social media caused or contributed is an action by ISIS. Given that ISIS has been declared an international terrorist organization, such an action is an act of international terrorism.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Omar Mateen was radicalized by ISIS' use of social media. This was the stated goal of ISIS. Mateen then carried out the deadly attacks in Orlando. Conducting terrorist acts via radicalized individuals is a stated goal of ISIS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Mateen's attack on the Pulse nightclub was a violent act causing death and injury and constitutes numerous criminal acts under the laws of the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   ISIS intended to intimidate and coerce western populations and governments through a pattern of intimidation and coercion as discussed throughout Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ISIS acts from outside the United States using Defendants' platforms in a manner [that] transcend[s] national\n   boundaries because of the international usage of Defendants' platforms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   But for ISIS' postings using Defendants' social media platforms, Mateen would not have engaged in his attack on the Pulse nightclub.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Mateen's terrorist actions were a direct result of ISIS' actions and given that ISIS is an international terrorist organization, Mateen's actions were also an act of international terrorism.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 206-214.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The plaintiffs also allege that the defendants know (1) that ISIS is designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization; (2) that ISIS members and its official news outlets use numerous accounts on the defendants' platforms to publish the organization's messages and to recruit and \"radicalize\" persons such as Mateen; (3) that ISIS raises significant amounts of money and recruits numerous individuals to its cause through the organization's use of the defendants' social media platforms; and (4) without that funding and widespread global messaging, the organization's capacity to carry out terrorist acts \"would essentially evaporate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that the defendants \"provided [their] services and equipment to ISIS, knowing that they were to be used in preparation for, or in carrying out, criminal acts including the acts that injured the Plaintiffs,\" and that \"but for the material support and resources provided by ISIS, the attack that injured the Plaintiffs would have been substantially more difficult to implement.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 234-35. They also allege that by providing their services to ISIS, the defendants \"aided and abetted\" the organization's accomplishment of its goals, and \"conspired\" with ISIS to achieve those goals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 221-22, 227-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   C. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The plaintiffs filed their complaint in this case on December 19, 2016, and they later filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint pleads four counts under federal law for (1) aiding and abetting acts of international terrorism, contrary to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202333\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (d) (Count One); (2) conspiracy in furtherance of acts of international terrorism (same) (Count Two); (3) provision of material support to terrorists,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202333\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2339A (Count Three); and (4) provision of material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202333\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2333B (Count Four). The complaint also pleads state law counts for negligent infliction of emotional distress (Count Five), and \"wrongful death\" (Count Six). The defendants jointly filed a motion to dismiss all of those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The motion to dismiss has been brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The defendants open with the argument that all of the claims premised on the defendants' complicity in the publication of content created by third parties are barred by the blanket grant of immunity to online service providers against such liability in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They follow with the contention that the amended complaint does not establish any cause of action because it does not allege facts to show that \"ISIS\" committed the Orlando night club shooting, or that the defendants had any association with or provided any support or assistance to the shooter, Omar Mateen; it does not allege any facts to show that the shooting was \"an act of international terrorism\"; and the plaintiffs have not pleaded any facts that establish that the defendants' conduct was the proximate cause of their injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Because the amended complaint does not plead facts that plausibly support any viable claims against these defendants, the Court need not address the defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   first argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fields v.

It appears to be undisputed that the Pulse Night Club attack was carried out by a single shooter-Omar Mateen-and that both Mateen and his victims were, at the time of the attack, all located and resident in Orlando, Florida, within the United States. The plaintiffs have not pointed to any \"means by which [the shooting] was accomplished\" that involved acts crossing any national border; nor do they point to any persons outside the United States whom the shooting was \"intended to intimidate or coerce\"; and they have not pointed to any international \"locale in which [the] perpetrator[ ] operate[d] or [sought] asylum.\" The only allegations of the complaint even hinting at some trans-national connection are those concerning Mateen's viewing of videos and Internet content that the plaintiffs contend were posted by agents of ISIS. But the complaint fails to assert any facts plausibly suggesting that the substance of those videos and other messages, or the posting of them, had anything at all directly to do with the shooting, other than that the principles espoused in them motivated Mateen to carry out the dreadful act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The plaintiffs plainly have attempted to characterize Mateen as ISIS's \"cat\" in a \"cat's paw\" scenario.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mys v.

And their attempt consists of the following syllogism: \"ISIS acts from outside the United States using Defendants' platforms in a manner [that] transcend[s] national boundaries because of the international usage of Defendants' platforms. But for ISIS's postings using Defendants' social media platforms, Mateen would not have engaged in his attack on the Pulse nightclub. Mateen's terrorist actions were a direct result of ISIS' actions and given that ISIS is an international terrorist organization, Mateen's actions were also an act of international terrorism.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 212-214.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Those statements suggest, at most, nothing more than that ISIS posts information on the Internet, which might be communicated over international borders. But nothing in those statements points to\n   any element of Mateen's conduct in carrying out the attack that had any transnational component. And the terminal allegation is nothing more than an unsupported legal conclusion, devoid of any specific factual support. Together, the allegations merely assert that because some acts of ISIS are \"international,\" and because Mateen may have viewed Internet postings or videos sympathetic to ISIS's cause, Mateen is an \"international terrorist,\" and any violent act he committed therefore comprised \"international terrorism.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   There are no pleaded facts that tend to show that Mateen carried out\n   <em>\n    this act\n   </em>\n   under ISIS's express direction. To be sure, even ISIS never claimed that it had any contact with Mateen or instructed him to shoot up the Pulse Night Club. And the heaps of relatively concrete facts that the amended complaint does offer-despite the immense emotional gravity of the violent and tragic global events to which they allude-do not bridge the gap between ISIS's violent screeds and Mateen's shooting spree. In their attempts to span the separate streams of events described in the pleadings, the plaintiffs have shown little beyond mere happenstance and possibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   2.

That the defendants maintained social media platforms that enabled ISIS to spread its radicalizing message of violence and hatred of western cultures, and that those platforms allowed ISIS's message to\n   reach Mateen. After the enactment of JASTA, it is sufficient for a plaintiff to plead either (1) that a defendant \"aided or abetted\" in the first instance \"an act of international terrorism\"; or (2) that a defendant \"aided or abetted\" a violation of some underlying criminal provision of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hussein v.

The plaintiffs rely on two underlying violations in this case, for (1) providing material support to a terrorist; and (2) providing material support to a designated terrorist organization. However, the plaintiffs have failed to allege any facts to show plausibly that the defendants knowingly supplied support or encouragement\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mateen\n   </em>\n   in any way that aided his commission of the shooting. (The claim relating to material support of a designated foreign terrorist organization is discussed further below.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   There are no facts that suggest that the defendants \"encouraged\" Mateen to commit his crimes. Likewise, the plaintiffs do not allege that the defendants provided him with any assistance, such as instructions on how to build a bomb or obtain an assault rifle. Certainly, no one suggests that any of the defendants' representatives were present at the scene, that they had any \"relationship\" with Mateen, or that they were of a mind to see this horrible event take place. As the court explained in\n   <em>\n    Linde\n   </em>\n   , aiding and abetting liability for a specific act of terrorist violence cannot be premised merely on a finding that the defendant knowingly provided support to a designated terrorist organization, as might suffice for a \"material support\" liability theory (more on that later). \"[A]iding and abetting an\n   <em>\n    act\n   </em>\n   of international terrorism requires more than the provision of material support to a designated terrorist organization. Aiding and abetting requires the secondary actor to be 'aware' that, by assisting the principal, it is itself assuming a 'role' in terrorist activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Linde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515951\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/314/#p329\">\n    882 F.3d at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Some cases pre-dating the enactment of JASTA countenanced, even if they did not explicitly uphold, the theory that \"liability under 2333(a) may be premised upon a theory of civil 'aiding and abetting' of a tort...created by the Anti-Terrorism Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Weiss v.

Here, the plaintiffs have not pointed to any tortious act committed by any of the defendants while handling Internet postings to their social media services that was taken \"in concert with\" Mateen's attack. Similarly, they have not pointed to anything the defendants did \"pursuant to a common design\" related to the shooting; nor have they alleged any facts plausibly to show that any of the defendants knew that Mateen's \"conduct constitute[d] a breach of duty\" to any of the plaintiffs and \"[gave] substantial assistance to [Mateen]\" in accomplishing the supposed breach. So far as the facts alleged in the amended complaint suggest, it appears to be undisputed that none of the defendants, or any of their employees or agents, knew anything at all about Mateen or his plans before he carried out the horrific attack in Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The amended complaint falls far short of the requirements outlined by these cases: there are no plausible allegations at all that there was any tangible connection between ISIS and the Pulse Night Club shooting attack, or between Mateen and the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   3. Conspiracy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Similarly, the plaintiffs have not alleged any viable conspiracy claim, because they have not stated any facts that plausibly suggest that any of the defendants, or any persons affiliated with them, made any agreement with Mateen (or, for that matter, with ISIS, or any identified person or entity associated with its cause of promoting international terrorism). The sufficiency of allegations of conspiracy was the proximal issue before the Supreme Court when in\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   it overhauled the pleading standard in federal courts and ushered in the sea change to our modern regime of plausibility pleading.

The only conduct involved with the attacks that is described with any particularity is Mateen's, which, so far as the allegations of the amended complaint suggest, he undertook in isolation, when he \"\n   <em>\n    self\n   </em>\n   -radicalized\" by perusing Internet postings, and then acted on his self-informed radical sentiments by carrying out a shooting rampage at a crowded night club.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   4. Material Support\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   None of the facts in the amended complaint plausibly suggest that any of the defendants knowingly provided any \"material support\" to Mateen that facilitated his commission of the night club shooting, sufficient to make out a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B. That section punishes a defendant who provides \"material support or resources,\" and who does so \"knowing or intending that they are to be used in preparation for, or in carrying out [a terrorist act],...or in preparation for, or in carrying out, the concealment of an escape from the commission of any\" act of terrorism, or who aids and abets or conspires in the provision of such support. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339a(a) ; 18 U.S.C. 2332b(g)(5)(B). \"[T]he term 'material support or resources' means any property, tangible or intangible, or service, including currency or monetary instruments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation or identification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel (1 or more individuals who may be or include oneself), and transportation, except medicine or religious materials.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339a(b)(1). The complaint contains no discernible facts to sustain any plausible claim that any of the defendants offered or delivered any such things to Mateen that facilitated the attack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The plaintiffs contend that it is enough that the defendants provided \"material support\" to ISIS, and that ISIS had some connection with the attack because (1) Mateen viewed the organization's literature and videos online at some point before the attack; and (2) the organization \"claimed responsibility\" for the attack via its official news outlets after the attack. Even if the Court assumes that something the defendants did could have constituted some form of \"material support\" for ISIS, the allegations of the complaint do not establish that there is any tangible connection, about which the defendants knew anything, between ISIS, Mateen, and Mateen's shooting spree. In fact, so far as the amended complaint suggests, it appears that no entity or agent of ISIS knew anything about the attack before it occurred, since the organization only claimed responsibility\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the attack was public knowledge, due to the news coverage of it, and the plaintiffs apparently concede that Mateen never had direct contact with any agent or entity directly connected to ISIS.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am.

The\n   <em>\n    Linde\n   </em>\n   court debunked that analogy in a case where the defendant, Arab Bank, was accused of providing material support to Hamas, a known terrorist organization.: \"We conclude only that providing routine financial services to members and associates of terrorist organizations is not so akin to providing a loaded gun to a child as to excuse the charging error here and compel a finding that as a matter of law, the services were violent or life-endangering acts that appeared intended to intimidate or coerce civilians or to influence or affect governments.\"\n   <em>\n    Linde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515951\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/314/#p329\">\n    882 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   327 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864637\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/109/\">\n    714 F.3d 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 124 (2d Cir. 2013) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Nothing in the amended complaint plausibly suggests either (1) that the defendants knew that any \"services\" they provided to ISIS were destined to aid the\n   person responsible for the Orlando attack (Mateen), or (2) that the defendants knew of any terrorist activities of ISIS that could be facilitated by the specific use of their services by any identified member or affiliate of ISIS. Because the defendants must \"knowingly\" provide support with some discernible apprehension that it could be used to facilitate terrorism, the failure to allege facts to show knowledge of a foreseeable connection to terrorist acts is fatal to the material support claims, particularly where the only allegations of the amended complaint are that the defendants provided \"routine\" services knowing only generally that some (unidentified) users could be affiliated with terrorism.\n   <em>\n    Hussein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269090\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/230/167/#p175\">\n    230 F.Supp.3d at 176-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that although \"[p]roviding unusual services that are not part of the defendant's ordinary course of business might...raise red flags,\" \"an inference of knowing or deliberately-indifferent support is generally implausible when the only allegations are that the defendants provided 'routine' banking services unaccompanied by any allegations tending to show that the defendants had reason to believe that their customers were terrorists or were assisting terrorists\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The facts alleged here contrast sharply with those where federal courts have found that the plaintiffs plausibly made out material support claims against a service provider.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4080677\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/718/456/#p489\">\n    718 F.Supp.2d at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The claimed wrongdoing of DIB...does not relate to the performance of routine banking and financial services, or its use as a passive conduit through which monies were indirectly channeled to and from al Qaeda.

In this case, although the plaintiffs have alleged that the defendants provided routine social media services to ISIS, they have not pointed to any individual or cognizable entity that the defendants plausibly knew to be facilitating or carrying out any acts of terrorism, and to whom the defendants nevertheless knowingly continued to provide services or support to in any form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   5.
