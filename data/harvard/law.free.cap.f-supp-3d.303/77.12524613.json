This provision shows that Congress did not provide absolute discretion to the Secretary, but rather, it intended for the Secretary's decision be subject to some form of review. And indeed, as the Accrediting Council points out,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 17-18, the\n   Secretary promulgated a regulation that explicitly provides that \"[a]n agency may contest the Secretary's decision [to deny, limit, suspend, or terminate an agency's recognition] in the Federal courts as a final decision in accordance with applicable Federal law,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20602.38\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 602.38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the defendants acknowledge this regulation and generally assert that the Secretary's implementing regulations \"reflect the statutory scheme,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Second, \u00a7 1099b(n)(3) provides that \"[t]he Secretary shall not, under any circumstances, base decisions on the recognition or denial of recognition of accreditation agencies ... on criteria other than those contained in this section.\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1099b(n)(3). Again, this section demonstrates that Congress intended to limit the Secretary's discretion and to subject her decisions to some form of review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

However, the authority cited by the defendants does not compel the Department staff to complete its review within any set period of time.

Indeed, the defendants concede that the regulations provide for at least two occasions in the administrative process when it is appropriate for an accrediting agency to submit (and the Department to consider) supplementary evidence-when an accrediting agency submits its response to the Department staff's draft report, and prior to or during the Advisory Committee meeting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Prior to June, the defendants claim that the Department staff had informed the Accrediting Council that it would not consider its Part II submission as part of the recognition process, so it is perplexing that the defendants now claim that the Accrediting Council should have ignored that communication and submitted its Part II submission a second time.

The Department Staff's Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Court has already determined that the Department staff violated the HEA and the Secretary's regulations by declining to consider the Accrediting Council's Part II submission, and thus, it need not address that claim again here. However, the Court must dismiss the Accrediting Council's remaining arguments that the Department staff committed procedural error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Accrediting Council first argues that the Under Secretary's request for supplemental information violated the Secretary's regulations because those regulations \"do not contemplate involvement of the Secretary or the Secretary's deputies at the [Department staff] review stage.\" Pl.'s Mem. at 34 (emphasis removed). However, as the defendants point out,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. at 30, the Accrediting Council has provided no evidence that the Secretary was involved in the Department staff's review, and indeed, as the Secretary observed, evidence in the record expressly refutes the Secretary's involvement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 12 n.88 (citing testimony of the Department staff at the Advisory Committee meeting that \"both the [senior Department official] and the Secretary 'ha[d] been completely walled off from the discussion of [the Accrediting Council] and from the preparation of the staff report' \"). Further, although it is undisputed that the Under Secretary was involved in the Department\n   staff proceedings,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 355 (stating in the Department staff's written submission to the senior Department official that \"[it] is true that the Under Secretary and his Office participated in the efforts of the Department [s]taff to develop the record on the [Accrediting Council] matter\"), the Accrediting Council has failed to cite any regulation or other authority for its assertion that the involvement of the Under Secretary, who is \"himself a member of the Department staff,\" Defs.' Mem. at 30, was improper. Nor is the Court persuaded that a Department staff member's vague statement at the Advisory Committee hearing that he did not \"want to comment\" on \"advice [he received] from outside\" the Department staff's accreditation office, AR 520 (Advisory Committee Transcript at 51), \"suggest[s] that the outside involvement [ ] violated the prescribed regulatory process,\" Pl.'s Mem. at 35.

As the Secretary concluded in her decision, none of these statements show that the Advisory Committee proceedings were compromised by the Under Secretary's comments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 11 (\"Any individual statements by [Advisory Committee] members prior to the vote do not indicate that the votes by the majority of the members [against recognition of the Accrediting Council] were not based on their expert assessment of the facts.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   As to Senator Warren's report, the Accrediting Council has not directed the Court to any evidence demonstrating that any of the members of the Advisory Committee even considered the report, let alone that they improperly relied upon it to make their decision. The Accrediting Council merely asserts that the senior Department official's argument on appeal that \"[Advisory Committee] members neither can, nor are expected to, close their eyes to information they are exposed to day-to-day by virtue of th[eir] expertise,\" AR 354, demonstrates that \"[the Advisory Committee] members\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have been influenced by the report,\" Pl.'s Mem. at 40 (emphasis added). This speculative statement is not proof that any Advisory Committee member in fact considered or was influenced by the report. Nor is the Court persuaded by the statement of \"one [Advisory Committee] member expressly acknowledg[ing] the impact of politics on the proceedings,\" Pl.'s Mem. at 41, as the Accrediting Council has not identified anything in the record as support for this claim, and in any event, the general opinion of one member that politics had some impact on the Advisory Committee proceedings does not persuade the Court that the Advisory Committee's recommendation, or the Secretary's ultimate decision, were improperly influenced by politics. Finally, the Accrediting Council's reliance on a statement from a third-party observer that \"the [Advisory Committee's recommendation] makes clear the extent to which both [the Advisory Committee]-and accreditation-have been politicized\" is even less persuasive.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20602.34\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing AR 386, statement of Judith Eaton, President of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

The senior Department official's decision listed each of the twenty-one criteria as to which she found the Accrediting Council noncompliant,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 315, and incorporated the Department staff's findings as to those criteria,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 314 (indicating that she \"agree[d]\" with the Department staff report). Further, she provided reasons for her conclusion that the Accrediting Council could not come into compliance within twelve months, including that \"[the Accrediting Council]'s track record d[id] not inspire confidence that it [could] address all of [its] problems effectively\" and \"most of the remedial efforts currently underway began in earnest just several months ago, despite having reason to take action long before that.\" AR 315.

Pl.'s Mem. at 42. The Accrediting Council cites as \"precedent\" the fact that, \"[i]n all but one\" of the \"[seventy] petitions for continued recognition heard by [the Advisory Committee] since December 2010 in which an agency was found to have one or more violations of the [r]ecognition [c]riteria,\" the \"Department staff and [the Advisory Committee] recommended that the institution be given more time to come into compliance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20602.36\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   42 n.15 (citing AR 140);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 427.

The Accrediting Council's Additional Challenges\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Court must resolve two final matters.

However, because the Court concludes that the Secretary procedurally erred by failing to consider various categories of relevant evidence in violation of the HEA, the Secretary's implementing regulations, and the APA, the Court finds it unnecessary to reach these challenges at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \"Under settled principles of administrative law, when a court reviewing agency action determines that an agency made an error of law, the court's inquiry is at an end: the case must be remanded to the agency for further action consistent with the corrected legal standards.\"\n   <em>\n    PPG Indus., Inc. v.
