Doc. 6-1 at \u00b6 3. In 2009, OHNM entered into a \"Statewide Contract\" with the New Mexico Inter-Agency Behavioral Health Purchasing Collaborative (the \"Collaborative\") to manage New Mexico's Medicaid and state-funded programs. Id. at \u00b6 4. Pursuant to the Statewide Contract, from 2009 through December 31, 2013, OHNM served as the \"Statewide Entity\" to administer the delivery of behavioral health services to individuals enrolled in and eligible to receive services under the Collaborative's agency programs. Id. In turn, in its capacity as the Statewide Entity, OHNM entered into contracts with numerous healthcare providers, including Plaintiffs, to provide the necessary behavioral health and/or substance abuse health care services to the individual enrollees. Id. at \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Specifically, Plaintiffs Border Area Mental Health Services, Counseling Associates, Easter Seals El Mirador, Families &amp; Youth, Hogares, Southwest Counseling Center, Southern New Mexico Human Development, TeamBuilders Counseling Services, The Counseling Center, and Valencia Counseling each entered into a \"Provider Agreement\" with OHNM. Id. at \u00b6 6. Each Provider Agreement contains the following arbitration provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   OHNM and Provider will work together in good faith to resolve any disputes about their business relationship. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 days following the date one party sent written notice of the dispute to the other party, and if OHNM or Provider wishes to pursue the dispute, it\n   shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). In no event may arbitration be initiated more than one year following the sending of written notice of the dispute. Any arbitration proceeding under this Agreement shall be conducted in a location agreed to by the parties or as selected by the AAA if the parties cannot agree on a location. The arbitrators may construe or interpret but shall not vary or ignore the terms of this Agreement, shall have no authority to award any punitive or exemplary damages, and shall be bound by controlling law. If the dispute pertains to a matter that is generally administered by certain OHNM procedures, such as credentialing or quality improvement plan, the procedures set forth in that plan must be fully exhausted by Provider before Provider may invoke its right to arbitration under this Article. The parties acknowledge that because this Agreement affects interstate commerce the Federal Arbitration Act applies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Doc. 6-1, Ex. 1 at Art. 30. Similarly, Plaintiffs Counseling Associates, Families &amp; Youth, Hogares, and TeamBuilders Counseling Services each entered into a \"Facility Participation Agreement\" with United Behavioral Health. Id. at 10. Each Facility Participation Agreement contains the following arbitration provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   UBH or Payor and Facility will work together in good faith to resolve any disputes about their business relationship. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 days following the date one party sent written notice of the dispute to the other party, and if UBH, Facility or any Payor that has consented in writing to binding arbitration wishes to pursue the dispute, it shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.

Doc. 1-1 \u00b6\u00b6 36, 43. Plaintiffs further allege that OHNM audited Plaintiffs with the predetermined outcome of finding \"credible allegations of fraud,\" in order to trigger the suspension of payments to Plaintiffs for the healthcare services that they had provided pursuant to their contracts with OHNM. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 52-55. As a result, Plaintiffs allege, they are owed payments totaling $11.5 million. Id. \u00b6 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on these allegations, Plaintiffs commenced the instant action in the First Judicial District Court of New Mexico, Santa Fe County, on June 23, 2016, against United Behavioral Health and United Healthcare Insurance Company, doing business as OHNM, Elizabeth Martin,\n   Chief Executive Officer of OHNM, Andrew Sekel, Chief Executive Officer of OptumHealth Behavioral Solutions, and Timothy S. Miller, regional manager for OHNM, collectively referred to as the \"United Defendants,\" in addition to the Public Consulting Group, the entity that was hired to conduct the audits of Plaintiffs. Doc. 1-1. On November 3, 2016, United Defendants removed the action to this Court. Doc. 1. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege claims against United Defendants for interference with contractual relations, prima facie tort, civil conspiracy to commit interference with contractual relations and prima facie tort, and violations of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 67-89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   United Defendants filed the instant motion to compel arbitration, arguing that the terms of the Provider Agreements and the Facility Participation Agreements require Plaintiffs to submit their claims to arbitration. Plaintiffs Border Area Mental Health, Counseling Associates, Easter Seals El Mirador, Families &amp; Youth, Hogares, Southwest Counseling Center, and Valencia Counseling (collectively referred to as \"Border Area Mental Health Plaintiffs\") filed a response in opposition to the motion. Additionally, Plaintiff Teambuilders Counseling Services (\"Teambuilders\"), filed a separate response in opposition to the motion. Border Area Mental Health Plaintiffs and Teambuilders similarly argue that their claims are not subject to arbitration because they fall outside the scope of their contracts with OHNM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") applies to arbitration provisions in \"a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In support of their motion, United Defendants argue that the Provider Agreements and the Facility Participation Agreements, entered into by each Plaintiff herein, contain valid and binding arbitration provisions, and that Plaintiffs' claims fall directly within the scope of those provisions. Plaintiffs do not dispute that they entered into valid arbitration agreements, but oppose United Defendants' motion to compel on the basis that their claims do not bear a reasonable relationship to the subject matter of the arbitration agreements and thus do not fall within the scope of those agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Whether Plaintiffs' Claims are Subject to Arbitration is for the Arbitrator to Decide.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Clay v.

Doc. 29 at 4-10; Doc. 30 at 3-10. Plaintiffs further argue that their claims are beyond the subject matter of the Provider Agreements and the Facility Participation Agreements, and are based on outrageous and unforeseeable conduct by United Defendants.

Indeed, in confirming the \"soundness\" of its determination, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Belnap\n   </em>\n   explained that, \"in an analogous context, all of our sister circuits to address the issue have unanimously concluded that incorporation of the substantively identical (as relevant here) AAA Rules constitutes clear and unmistakable evidence of an agreement to arbitrate arbitrability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178078\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/1272/#p1280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1283 (citing\n   <em>\n    Brennan v.

Accordingly, all questions of arbitrability-including the questions Plaintiffs raise as to whether their claims reasonably relate to the subject matter of the parties' agreements to arbitrate-must be resolved by an arbitrator. Under\n   <em>\n    Belnap\n   </em>\n   , this Court has no discretion to decide whether Plaintiffs' claims are outside the scope of the arbitration provisions in the Provider Agreements and the Facility Participation Agreements, but rather must defer that determination to the arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiffs do not dispute that they entered into valid agreements to arbitrate, but oppose United Defendants' motion to compel arbitration on the basis that the claims alleged in the instant action do not fall within the scope of the arbitration agreements. For the reasons set forth above, however, the issue of whether Plaintiffs' claims are arbitrable is for the arbitrator, rather than this Court, to determine, and the Court must defer that decision to the arbitrator. Accordingly, no basis exists for the Court to deny United Defendants' motion to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that United Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration [Doc. 6] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
