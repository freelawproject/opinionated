These cross-motions for summary judgment have been fully briefed (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 193-96.) For the following reasons, the Court grants RLTHC's motion for summary judgment and denies Plaintiff's partial motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case stems from a copyright infringement suit brought against Plaintiff by Paula White Ministries (\"\n   <strong>\n    PWM\n   </strong>\n   \") in 2014.\n   <em>\n    See Paula White Ministries v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 6:14-cv-497-Orl31DAB, Doc. 1, March 27, 2014 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Prior Suit\n   </strong>\n   \"). Plaintiff runs a website and posts videos seeking to expose Defendant Paula Michelle White (\"\n   <strong>\n    White\n   </strong>\n   \") as a false prophet. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Doc. 16, p. 1.) Citing fair use, Plaintiff vehemently opposed the Prior Suit and vigorously litigated it. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Docs. 32, 34-36, 37.) Hoping to quell Plaintiff, PWM moved to dismiss the complaint with prejudice (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Doc. 37), which U.S. District Judge Gregory A. Presnell granted (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Doc. 40.) At the same time, Judge Presnell noted that if Plaintiff \"wishes to pursue affirmative relief against [PWM] for malicious prosecution, she may do so by filing a separate complaint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff did so, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , and initiated this action for malicious prosecution against Defendants White, New Destiny Christian Center, Inc. (\"\n   <strong>\n    NDCC\n   </strong>\n   \"), and Paula Michelle Ministries, Inc. (\"\n   <strong>\n    PMMI\n   </strong>\n   \"), on October 8, 2015. (Doc. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Six months later, Plaintiff sought leave to file an amended complaint to add RLTHC as a party. (Doc. 63.) She alleged that after NDCC was served with her complaint for malicious prosecution, it formed a title holding company named RLTHC, which she contended was a sham corporation fraudulently formed by NDCC, PMMI, and White to shield them from direct liability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-6.) Finding these allegations sufficient to state a claim to pierce the corporate veil under the alter ego theory of Florida law, U.S. Magistrate Judge Gregory J. Kelly permitted Plaintiff to add RLTHC as a party. (Doc. 75.) Plaintiff then filed her third amended complaint, bringing a malicious prosecution claim against PMMI, White, and NDCC (Doc. 76, \u00b6\u00b6 58-90) and a piercing the corporate veil, \"alter-ego/sham corporation\" claim against RLTHC, alleging it was the alter-ego of NDCC (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Meanwhile, the case proceeded to discovery. This quickly turned contentious, as Plaintiff sought financial documents and information from White, NDCC, and PMMI (\"\n   <strong>\n    Financial Information\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 67-72.) After these requests ping-ponged to no avail, Plaintiff filed motions to compel production of the Financial Information. (Docs. 67-72.) In a series of successive rulings, White, NDCC, and PMMI were ordered to produce the Financial Information in part. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 78, 103, 115, 131, 138, 144;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 183, pp. 3-11 (detailing these rulings).) They did not fully comply, so Plaintiff moved for default judgment against these defendants. (Doc. 152 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Default Motion\n   </strong>\n   \").) In a comprehensive ruling, this Court granted the Default Motion due to White, NDCC, and PMMI's willful and bad faith noncompliance with court orders. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 183.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff's claims against RLTHC, however, remained, and Plaintiff informed the Court that she still wished to pursue them. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 27; Doc. 184.) Both Plaintiff and RLTHC filed cross-motions for summary judgment and responses on the issue of whether RLTHC's corporate veil could be pierced under sham corporation and alter ego theories of liability. (Docs. 162, 164, 193-96.) The matters are now ripe for adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

UNDISPUTED FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Paula White is currently the Senior Pastor-President of NDCC. (Docs. 152-15, \u00b6 2; 162-4, p. 12.) NDCC is a corporation first incorporated on June 7, 1996 by Pastor Zachery Tims in Orlando, Florida to operate as a church. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 194-1, pp. 1-4.) Since then, NDCC's leadership has changed and grown. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-7.) Its board of directors currently has six members, including White, and NDCC is now located at 505 E. McCormick Rd, Apopka, FL 32703. (Doc. 162-4, pp. 1, 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Over the years, White has been associated with different organizations. Beyond NDCC, these include the fictitious name Paula White Ministries and the corporations Paula Michelle Ministries, Inc. and Resurrection Life THC, Inc. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 152-11, 152-12, 164-7.) Of these, PWM is seemingly the oldest as its registration can be traced back at least to March 22, 2002. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 164-3.) After PWM, PMMI comes next-it filed articles of incorporation on August 29, 2011. (Doc. 162-3.) Soon thereafter, PWM was registered to PMMI on February 13, 2012. (Doc. 164-3.) PWM didn't stay with PMMI long; NDCC registered PWM on May 2, 2014 (Doc. 164-4), and PMMI administratively dissolved on August 11, 2014 (Doc. 1-C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally comes RLTHC, the entity here with the shortest lifespan. It filed articles of incorporation on December 18, 2015, but this was about the only thing it did. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 164-7). After incorporation, RLTHC was \"inactive.\" (Doc. 164-8.) It had \"no day-to-day operations since its inception,\" \"no employees, assets, [or] bank accounts,\" and did not register with the IRS. (Doc. 162-14.) Although its listed purpose in its articles of incorporation was \"holding title to property, collecting income therefrom, and turning over the entire amount thereof, less expenses, to [NDCC],\" RLTHC never did these things. (Docs. 164-7, 162-14.) Indeed, no assets or titles were transferred to or from RLTHC since its formation, nor did RLTHC receive income from any rentals, turn over income to NDCC, or issue checks to anyone, including employees. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 162-14, 194-4.) RLTHC never operated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was administratively\n   dissolved on September 23, 2016, and Defendants have no plans to reinstate it. (Docs. 164-8; 162-14, p. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   By contrast, PMMI engaged in active operations. It had employees, day-to-day operations, dispensed payroll, and owned the PWM name. (Docs. 152-11, 152-12, 164-3.) And while PMMI owned PWM, PWM brought the Prior Suit suit against Plaintiff. (Doc. 164-3);\n   <em>\n    see Paula White Ministries v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 6:14-cv-497-Orl31DAB, Doc. 1, March 27, 2014. During the course of the Prior Suit, PMMI administratively dissolved and NDCC took over ownership of PWM, which retained control of PMMI's assets. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 164-4; 1-C; 152-11; 152-12.) With this, the entities directly involved in the Prior Suit were PWM, PMMI, and NDCC-not RLTHC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 162, p. 22, 196, p. 2, 194, p.4.) As default judgment has been entered against White, PMMI, and NDCC (Doc. 183), the only way for Plaintiff to recover against RLTHC here is by piercing its corporate veil (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 76, \u00b6\u00b6 40-57;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 164-2, p. 21 (Plaintiff's deposition) ). Now, at summary judgment, the Court must determine whether Plaintiff's claim holds any water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Such allegations sufficiently stated a claim for piercing the corporate veil at the complaint stage (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 75), but now, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. To withstand Defendant's motion for summary judgment, or to be granted summary judgment, Plaintiff must support her allegations with evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671701\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/1315/#p1320\">\n    461 F.3d at 1320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the record before the Court reveals, this she cannot do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First up is Plaintiff's assertion that RLTHC was formed as part of \"an illegal scheme to fraudulently convey or conceal NDCC/PWM's and possibly Defendant White's assets so that they could not be reached by this lawsuit.\" (Doc. 162, p. 23.) Her sole support for this fraudulent purpose argument is that RLTHC was formed on December 18, 2015, sixteen days after Plaintiff served summons for this suit on White, NDCC, and PMMI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.) Putting aside the fact that these dates aren't entirely correct,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   this fact tells the Court nothing about RLTHC's purpose for forming. Rather, the record evidence reflects that RLTHC was formed for a legitimate business purpose-to hold title to property for NDCC-and Plaintiff provided no evidence to controvert this. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs 162, pp. 22-23; 164-7; 196, p. 8.) Alone, the proximity of RLTHC's formation to White, NDCC, and PMMI receiving summons of Plaintiff's suit does not constitute the requisite improper purpose to pierce its corporate veil.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steinhardt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7553000\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/511/336/\">\n    511 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   339 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    17315 Collins Ave.\n   </em>\n   , 34 So.3d at 168-69 (finding improper purpose of subsidiary because parent placed funds in subsidiary instead of satisfying obligation and subsidiary depleted funds). Thus, the Court considers other evidence to support Plaintiff's theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Next, Plaintiff points out that RLTHC had no day-to-day operations, employees, assets, bank accounts, or income; and shared a principal and mailing address with NDCC as \"more evidence that RLTHC was merely a sham corporation.\" (Doc. 162, p. 23.) Actually, just the opposite. RLTHC and NDCC had no relationship because, by all accounts, RLTHC did nothing from its formation until its dissolution. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 162-14; 162-2, p. 21 (Plaintiff's deposition).) What is more, that RLTHC never operated, never had assets or expenses, and never exchanged in transfers with NDCC conclusively establishes\n   that RLTHC was neither a sham corporation nor NDCC's alter ego.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bookworld Trade Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 532 F.Supp.2d at 1360 (finding Plaintiff's \"unsupported allegations\" insufficient to pierce corporate veil as \"[t]here is no evidence that Smith used Bookworld to defraud existing personal or corporate creditors, by transferring funds into or out of the corporation\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   With this, Plaintiff's theory that NDCC established and used RLTHC to escape liability by hiding assets there is plainly unsupported. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Docs. 162, p. 23; 196, p. 3\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Docs. 162-14; 194-4 (Plaintiff's arguments with RLTHC's documents).) Here, the absence of evidence is evidence of absence. The Court cannot pierce RLTHC's corporate veil on this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Having said that, it is clear that RLTHC has no further place in this action. As both Plaintiff and Defendants recognized, RLTHC's involvement and potential liability here hinged on piercing its corporate veil. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 196, p. 2, 194, p.4.) And because that is not happening, the Court need not address the parties' other arguments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 162, 164). Summary judgment is granted for RLTHC and denied for Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Accordingly, it is\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED AND ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   1.

These \"bylaws\" were provided to Plaintiff during discovery before RLTHC was added as a party, and were the subject of one of her motions to compel. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docs. 69, p. 5; 69-1;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Doc. 103, p. 10 (noting that RLTHC's bylaws appear to have been produced already).) But these \"bylaws\" are unsigned and undated, so the Court will not consider them as representative of RLTHC's affairs. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 69-1, p. 6.) Notably, the only depositions in this action were submitted by Defendants; Plaintiff did not introduce any depositions, including individuals affiliated with RLTHC.
