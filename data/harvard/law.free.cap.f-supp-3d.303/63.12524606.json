A YDR is expected to adhere to the \"eyes-on-supervision policy,\" which requires that a YDR \"maintains ongoing visual contact with all youth under supervision.\" Policy # 8-9.3, ECF No. 25-1 at Ex. 5. An YDR can only be removed for cause. Such causes include neglect of duty, insubordination, incompetence, misfeasance, and other employment-related reasons for which adverse action is not arbitrary or capricious. D.C. Personnel Regulations \u00a7\u00a7 1603.2, 1603.3, ECF No. 25-1 at Ex. 3. In determining which, if any, adverse action is warranted for a specific policy violation, DYRS utilizes \"progressive discipline,\" in which imposed punishments become harsher as the severity of the infraction and/or number of offenses increases.

Moreover, he correcting admits that this Court is not the forum for relitigating the merits of his prior disciplinary actions. Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 39 at 29-30.

Thus, the District merely admitted that Ms. Brown was not disciplined for an event that it denied happened in the first place.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This clearly does not support Mr. Duru's allegation of the unrecorded violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Furthermore, although he cites his deposition, Mr. Duru did not testify about the alleged unrecorded incident whatsoever.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Dep., ECF No. 39-4.

When asked if Ms. Brown had any other infractions, Mr. Duru said he \"had no idea.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 143:21-144:3. His testimony therefore contradicts his own allegations. As in\n   <em>\n    Burley\n   </em>\n   , \"despite the opportunity ... to develop the point\" by, for example, deposing Ms. Brown, \"the record is devoid of even a circumstantial basis\" from which the Court could infer that this unrecorded event happened and that the District knew but chose not to act. 301 F.3d at 299.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The second allegedly unrecorded violation occurred on December 12, 2011, the day before the December 13, 2011 incident involving Ms. Brown and Mr. Duru.

Beyond his own testimony, however, Mr. Duru does not offer any support in the record that this second unrecorded incident occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fields v.

However, the Court reviewed the entire record and was unable to locate a log book or testimony that corroborates Mr. Duru's account. Moreover, at the OEA hearing Superintendent Baynes testified that while DYRS maintains a log book, he did not recall seeing any entry regarding Ms. Brown's alleged December 12, 2011 infraction. Baynes Test., ECF No. 39-6 at 79:5-80:21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Mr. Duru also relies on Ms. Ohler's OEA testimony, frequently citing it for the proposition that \"Brown had a disciplinary infraction on December 12, 2011, although [Ohler] seems to not be aware that Brown also had a disciplinary action on December 13, 2011.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 39 at 14, 33, 36, 39. The Court disagrees that Ms. Ohler was aware of a third, unrecorded infraction. After carefully reading the entire hearing transcript, it is clear that Mr. Duru mischaracterizes Ms. Ohler's testimony. Making all inferences in Mr. Duru's favor, Ms. Ohler was obviously confused about the dates of the two December 2011 incidents. For example, Mr. Duru's counsel begins questioning Ms. Ohler about the allegedly unrecorded December 12, 2011 incident by asking whether Ms. Ohler was \"aware of whether Ms. Brown, the day before this incident, had been involved in an incident .... were you aware of any event on December 12th involving Ms. Brown?\" Ohler Test., ECF No. 39-7 at 162:20-163:3.
