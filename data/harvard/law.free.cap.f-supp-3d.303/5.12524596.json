(ECF No. 1-1). Defendants have moved for dismissal of all claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), alleging that Defendant Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (\"WMATA\") is entitled to sovereign immunity and that Defendant Metro Transit Police Department (\"MTPD\") is merely a department within WMATA, not a separate legal entity. Plaintiff has also filed a motion for leave to amend his complaint to add claims for hostile work environment and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), which WMATA opposes. For the reasons stated below, Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend his complaint is GRANTED. Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is also GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claims under the ADA/ADAAA, the DCHRA, and \u00a7 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff has been employed as an officer at MTPD since 2005. Plaintiff suffers from a medical condition characterized by low blood circulation and impotence. He takes prescription medication-including injectable medication-for his ailment. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-13, 18 ECF No. 1-1). On October 25, 2015, MTPD placed Plaintiff under investigation following an allegation of steroid use. (ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6 14). Plaintiff denied the allegation at an interview with representatives of MTPD's Office of Professional Responsibilities and Inspections, informing them that he only used a prescribed injectable medication. (ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6\u00b6 15-18). After the interview, MTPD required Plaintiff to undergo a fitness for duty and psychological evaluation and to meet with a counselor. (ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 19, 2015, Plaintiff was required to undergo a random urinalysis, and on December 28, 2015, he was cleared of the allegation of steroid use. (ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6\u00b6 25-26). He did however receive a 15-day suspension for failing to report his use of prescription drugs, as required by MTPD policy. (ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6\u00b6 27-28). Plaintiff alleges that he suffered from esophagitis caused by stress during this period. (ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon Plaintiff's return to work on January 26, 2016, MTPD required him to undergo a random urinalysis, and another on May 14, 2016. (ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6\u00b6 32, 36). Plaintiff further alleges that his supervisor acknowledged receipt of a discrimination charge from the EEOC on March 30, 2016. (ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6 35). He also alleges that on one occasion his supervisors told him that they were going to \"fuck with [him] bad.\" (ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6 34). Plaintiff filed the original complaint in the Superior Court of the District Columbia on March 8, 2017. (ECF No. 1 at 1). The case was removed to federal court. (ECF No. 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Here, WMATA has not (1) identified any evidence of bad faith, or (2) provided any specific contentions to support their claim that amendment would be futile. Moreover, since the court will afford WMATA the opportunity to fully brief the newly added claims via an additional motion to dismiss, there is also no showing of prejudice at this early procedural stage. Accordingly, the court grants Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition to the two new claims under Title VII, Plaintiff's Amended Complaint alleges six claims against WMATA: two (Counts IV and VI) under the DCHRA; three (Count I for declaratory judgment,\n   Count III for money damages, and Count V for money damages) under the ADA/ADAAA; and one (Count II) under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth below, the court finds that WMATA is (1) not subject to claims brought pursuant to state law, (2) immune from claims brought under the ADA/ADAAA, and (3) not a \"person\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1983 and therefore ineligible to be sued under that statute.
