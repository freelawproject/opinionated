(\"the Church\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"). Upon learning that the improvements did not comply with the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations (\"BCZR\"), she filed a Petition for a Special Hearing and zoning variances with the Defendant Board of Appeals of Baltimore County (\"the Board\") to approve a site plan for the Church. The Board denied the Petition, finding in part that the plan did not minimally comply to the extent possible with certain BCZR requirements. On appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County and then ultimately to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, the Board's findings were affirmed. While the appeal was pending, Ware filed a second Petition which the Board ultimately denied on September 13, 2017 on the basis of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   One month later, Plaintiffs filed suit in this Court against the Board and Baltimore County, Maryland (collectively, \"Defendants\") stemming from the denial of the second petition. Plaintiffs allege violations of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (\"RLUIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000cc\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Counts I and II); the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Count IV); the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Count V); Article 36 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (Count VII); and seek judicial review of the Board's September 13, 2017 Opinion and Order (Count IX).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Currently pending before this Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, or in the alternative, for Summary Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 10.)

In 1992, Reverend Ware (\"Ware\"), a native of Kenya, established Jesus Christ is the Answer Ministries, Inc. (the \"Church\") in Baltimore, Maryland. (Compl., ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.) The Church is a nondenominational, multicultural Christian church with associated churches in Kenya and Seychelles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15, 18-19.) According to the Complaint, ten years later in 2002, the Church consisted of ten or less members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.) This small group started meeting at Ware's home in Baltimore County, Maryland. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.) Over the next ten years, the Church grew beyond a mere ten members and met at different locations including an elementary school and hotel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23-33.) In 2008, Ware and other Church officials began fundraising and looking for a property for a house of worship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34-36.) In August of 2012, Ware identified 4512 Old Court Road, Baltimore, Maryland (the \"Property\") as a potential location, and was told by a realtor that a church was a permitted use on the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.) On August 31, 2012, Ware purchased the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Property is approximately 1.2 acres in size, and contains a 2,900 square foot structure previously used as a home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.) Without checking any applicable zoning regulations, Ware converted three rooms of the dwelling into a worship area, added two bathrooms, replaced the roof, and replaced a small deck. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.) In addition, Ware created a new, gravel parking area at the rear of the house and planted Cypress trees to line the new parking area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 57-58.) In October of 2012, the Church held its first service, a cookout, and a party. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.) Local residents subsequently complained about the events to the County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62.) On November 8, 2012, the County informed Ware that the Property could not be used as a church until it complied with Baltimore County Zoning Regulations (\"BCZR\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Property is zoned \"Density Residential 3.5.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 99.)

Notably, item one sought approval for a site plan of a\n   <em>\n    new church\n   </em>\n   under BCZR \u00a7 1B01.1B1g(6). The\n   <em>\n    Ware I\n   </em>\n   Petition also sought variances from three parking regulations. (ECF No. 10-2 at 639; ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 103.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In January of 2013, the \"People's Counsel\" entered its appearance in the case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 104.) On February 5, 2013, the County Director of the Department of Planning indicated that he did not oppose the petition, \"provided a landscape and signage plan is submitted to the department for review and approval.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 105.) On February 27, 2013, a hearing was held before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), with People's Counsel and\n   nearby residents, \"the Protestants,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   present. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 104, 106-107.) During the proceeding, Plaintiffs claim that the Protestants made the following comments directed at Reverend Ware and the Church:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [D]ancing and hollering like they are [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] back at their home back in Africa somewhere.... She can come over here from Africa ... branch out from another church and put all of this in our neighborhood.... They were out there dancing like from Africa. We don't have that in our block.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 108.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The ALJ recommended denying Ware's petition for a zoning variance, which the Board reviewed during a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 109-111.) At that hearing, Ware and two other congregants testified in addition to an expert witness who prepared the site plan for the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 112-13.) Several Protestants also testified and called an expert who testified that the site plan did not satisfy the RTA requirements and that the variances should not be granted because the hardship was self-imposed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 114-17.) On October 9, 2013, the Board denied the petition, finding that: (1) RTA restrictions applied to the development of the Property; (2) the petition did not qualify for an exception as a new church under BCZR \u00a7 1B01.1.B.g(6) given that the site plan did not minimally comply with the RTA requirements and was not compatible with the neighborhood; and (3) given the Board's decision, the requests for parking variances were moot. (\n   <em>\n    Ware I\n   </em>\n   Opinion, ECF No. 10-2 at 75-88.) Specifically, the Board noted that \"[t]he proposal is for no buffer and no setbacks,\" all other churches in the area, except one, were located in different density residential zones or located on corners, and all of the other churches had adequate land for parking lots which were paved and striped. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84-85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, the court verbally affirmed the Board's decision. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 125.) Ware then appealed to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 126.) While\n   <em>\n    Ware I\n   </em>\n   was progressing through its hearings and appeals, Ware filed a second Petition for Special Hearing (\"\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   \") on October 31, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 134.) Specifically, the\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   Petition sought:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   1) To approve the site plan for a proposed building for a new church pursuant to BCZR \u00a7 1B01.1B1g(6).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   2) To approve an addition to a church including parking areas and driveways pursuant to BCZR \u00a7 1B01.1B1g(4).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   3) For such other and further relief as may be deemed necessary by the Administrative Law Judge for Baltimore County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   4) That the submitted site plan demonstrates compliance to the extent possible with section 1B01.1B1g(6) (BCZR).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (ECF No. 10-2 at 640.) The site plan for the new church in\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   called for a 50-foot buffer and for setbacks measuring 62 feet to the property to the east, 72.7 feet to\n   the property to the north, and 55 feet to the property to the west. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 138-39.) Accordingly, Plaintiffs assert that unlike\n   <em>\n    Ware I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   either meets or comes close to meeting the RTA setback and buffer requirements and does not request parking variances. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 132-135.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Notably, like the\n   <em>\n    Ware I\n   </em>\n   Petition, item one of the\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   Petition sought approval for a site plan of a\n   <em>\n    new church\n   </em>\n   under BCZR \u00a7 1B01.1B1g(6); the difference according to Plaintiffs being that\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   does not entirely eliminate the RTA buffer and setback, but rather proposes the above described measurements. However, unlike the\n   <em>\n    Ware I\n   </em>\n   Petition, item two of the\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   Petition sought to add an addition to an\n   <em>\n    existing church\n   </em>\n   under BCZR \u00a7 1B01.1B1g(4). Although not emphasized by the parties in the current litigation, as described below the Board relied heavily on this fact in denying the\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   Petition, which sought relief under \u00a7 1B01.1B1g(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that despite the differences between\n   <em>\n    Ware I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   , specifically the different proposed buffer and setback measurements, People's Counsel-responding to local residents' opposition to the Church-incorrectly told the ALJ that\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   sought the same relief as\n   <em>\n    Ware I\n   </em>\n   . (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 143-144.) On November 4, 2013, the ALJ dismissed the Petition without a hearing on the basis of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 146-148.) Ware subsequently filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the ALJ denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 150.) On January 9, 2014, Ware filed an appeal to the Board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 151.) On February 4, 2014, People's Counsel filed a Motion to Dismiss the\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   Petition on the basis of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 152, 155.) The Board stayed the proceedings pending the Maryland Court of Special Appeal's decision.

On September 13, 2017, the Board granted the Motion to Dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 156-159.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In the Board's Opinion granting the Motion to Dismiss, the Board stated that during the hearing, \"[Ware] argued that, in\n   <em>\n    Ware I\n   </em>\n   , it was seeking an exception pursuant to BCZR \u00a7 1B01.1B1g(6) but in\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   , was seeking an exception pursuant to\n   BCZR \u00a7 1B01.1B1g(4).\" (\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   Opinion, ECF No. 10-2 at 574.) As described above, \u00a7 1B01.1B1g(4) applies to existing churches while \u00a7 1B01.1B1g(6) applies to new churches. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Board then summarized the \"real thrust of [Ware's] argument\" as \"\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable because the second case,\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   , is different from\n   <em>\n    Ware I\n   </em>\n   in that different sections of the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations apply.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Board rejected this argument, explaining that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The facts in\n   <em>\n    Ware I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   concern the same Petitioner, regarding the same property, and same proposed conversion of a single-family residence into a church.... The only difference is that Petitioner, once denied in\n   <em>\n    Ware I\n   </em>\n   as a new church, wants a second bite as under the theory it is an existing church.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 575.) Accordingly, the Board found that Plaintiffs' claims in\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   were barred by\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and relatedly collateral estoppel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 576-78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiffs claim, however, that the County has permitted other applicants to file successive petitions without invoking\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 165.) Further, Plaintiffs claim that throughout the process, they faced significant and hostile discrimination from neighbors of the Property and tremendous opposition based on their status as African immigrants and the nature of their ministry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 166-169.) Since being notified in November of 2012 that the Property could not be used as a house of worship until brought into BCZR compliance, there have been no Church-related activities on the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 63-64.) The Church now holds services in the homes of Ware and other congregants, and as a result has lost the ability to hold certain services, lost members, and lost financial contributions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 65-75.) On October 13, 2017, Plaintiffs brought the instant action against Defendants Baltimore County, Maryland and the Board of Appeals of Baltimore County, stemming from the denial of the\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, or in the alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment, implicating this Court's discretion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(d).

At the outset, this Court notes that the facts and arguments presented before this Court in Plaintiffs' Complaint and the parties' submissions do\n   not mirror those which the Board addressed in its Opinion. Specifically, while the Board's Opinion depends heavily on the fact that during the hearing Ware relied\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on BCZR \u00a7 1B01.1B1g(4) for \"existing churches\" rather than BCZR \u00a7 1B01.1B1g(6) for \"new churches,\" nowhere in the record before this Court do the parties emphasize-let alone rely on-this distinction. Rather, Plaintiffs assert that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   does not apply because the\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   Petition specifically addresses, by offering new setback and buffer measurements, exactly what the Board, Circuit Court for Baltimore County, and Maryland Court of Special Appeals identified as problems with the\n   <em>\n    Ware I\n   </em>\n   Petition under BCZR \u00a7 1B01.1B1g(6) for new churches.

Plaintiffs assert that\n   <em>\n    Ware II\n   </em>\n   \"address[es] exactly those issues identified by the Board which resulted in its previous denial\" in\n   <em>\n    Ware I\n   </em>\n   .

If any member of the Church had looked into the zoning regulations, they would have learned that although a church is a use \"permitted as of right\" in the Property's zone, it still must comply with the dwelling-type and other supplementary use restrictions. BCZR \u00a7\u00a7 1B01.1.A, B. Rather than reviewing the zoning regulations, Ware converted three of the home's rooms into a worship area, created a new, gravel parking area lined by newly planted trees, and held a service, cookout and party. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 54-61.)
