The defendants objected to this evidence on the ground that the plaintiffs failed to file a timely Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a) disclosure. As a result, the defendants had not deposed Dr. Rachal. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(c)(1) prohibits the introduction of evidence that, without substantial justification, has not been disclosed as required by Rule 26(a) unless the failure to disclose is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In evaluating whether the failure to disclose is harmless, a court looks to four factors: 1) the importance of the evidence; 2) the prejudice to the opposing party from including the evidence; 3) the possibility of curing any prejudice by granting a continuance; and 4) the explanation for the party\u2019s failure to disclose. <em>Primrose Operating Co. v. Nat\u2019l Am. Ins. Co., </em>382 F.3d 546, 563-64 (5th Cir.2004). The plaintiffs contend that although their disclosure of Dr. Rachal was tardy, it was nevertheless made several months prior to trial. However, the plaintiffs failed to file any opposition to the motion, to provide a reason for the late disclosure to either the district court or this court, or to identify the importance of Dr. Rachal\u2019s testimony. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in excluding this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The plaintiffs next contend that the district court erred in granting judgment for the defendants as a matter of law. We review the district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) <em>de novo. Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>237 F.3d 567, 576 n. 9 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Motions for directed verdicts on claims of employment discrimination pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and Title VII based on circumstantial evidence are evaluated under the <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), burden shifting framework.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Davis v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, </em>383 F.3d 309, 316 (5th Cir.2004) <em>(McDonnell Douglas </em>applies to claims under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983); <em>Raggs v. Miss. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>278 F.3d 463, 468 (5th Cir.2002) <em>(McDonnell Douglas </em>applies to Rule 50(a) motions). A plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>The burden then shifts to the employer to proffer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action. <em>Id. </em>The burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to meet its ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue of intentional discrimination. <em>Baker v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>430 F.3d 750, 753-54 (5th Cir.2005). This may be achieved by presenting evidence that the employer\u2019s stated reason for its action is pretextual. <em>Id. </em>at 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">Applying this framework, the district court concluded that neither plaintiff proffered evidence to rebut the defendants\u2019 claim that the plaintiffs had been terminated due to their falsification of medical records. On appeal, plaintiffs argue that they presented evidence that the defendants\u2019 proffered reason is pretextual. They fail, however, to identify any nurse who falsified hospital records but was not terminated. <em>Cf. McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>411 U.S. at 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817 (evidence that employees outside the protected class who committed similar wrongful acts were not terminated is relevant to pretext). In addition, Trusdair was hired and fired by the same actor, thereby attenuating any inference of pretext. <em>See Cartagena v. Aegis Mortgage Corp., </em>275 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>46 (5th Cir.2001) (\u201cIn undertaking the pretext inquiry, we must consider Cartagena\u2019s evidence in light of the fact that the same individual ... both hired and discharged Cartagena.\u201d); <em>Brown v. C.S.C. Logic, Inc., </em>82 F.3d 651, 658 (5th Cir.1996) (hiring and firing by same actor permits but does not mandate inference that firing was not racially motivated). Finally, it is undisputed that Terrance was replaced by someone of the same race. The plaintiffs have therefore not met their burden of rebutting the defendants\u2019 nondiscriminatory reason for terminating them.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b486-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\">. Although the plaintiffs discuss the law of disparate impact in their brief, no such claim was presented to the district court. A claim may not be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Alford v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>975 F.2d 1161, 1163 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
