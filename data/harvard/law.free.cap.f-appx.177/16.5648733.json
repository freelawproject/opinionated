Homer Drake. Bush argues that the district court erroneously concluded that the doctrine of judicial immunity applies to allegations of bribery. Because the Supreme Court has held that judicial immunity applies even in cases of alleged corruption, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">In August 2004, Washington Mutual Bank scheduled a foreclosure sale on property held by Bush. The day before the sale, Bush filed for bankruptcy in the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Georgia and his petition was assigned to Judge Drake. The bank moved for relief from the automatic stay of bankruptcy, and Judge Drake granted the motion. Bush appealed to the district court, and the district court affirmed. Bush did not appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Bush then filed suit in state court and alleged that the bank, its attorneys, and Drake conspired to \u201ctak[e] a bribe and throw[ ] the case\u201d in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962, common law fraud, and conspiracy to violate his civil rights, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Bush sought actual and punitive damages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. The defendants removed the action to federal court and moved to dismiss the complaint. The district court granted the motion to dismiss as to Drake on the ground that \u201c[]Judicial immunity is an absolute bar to plaintiffs action against Judge Drake.\u201d The district court later entered final judgment as to Drake. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>the grant of a motion to dismiss, \u201caccepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Dalrymple v. Reno, </em>334 F.3d 991, 994 (11th Cir.2003). We construe the pleadings of a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff more liberally than pleadings drafted by attorneys. <em>Powell v. Lennon, </em>914 F.2d 1459, 1463 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">\u201cFew doctrines were more solidly established at common law than the immunity of judges from liability for damages for acts committed within their judicial jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 553-54, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 1217, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967). Judicial immunity applies when (1) \u201cthe judge deal[t] with the plaintiff in his judicial capacity\u201d and (2) the judge did not act \u201cin the \u2018clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dykes v. Hosemann, </em>776 F.2d 942, 945 (11th Cir.1985) (en banc) (quoting <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 357, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 1105, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978)). \u201cThis immunity applies even . when the judge is accused of acting maliciously and corruptly.\u201d <em>Pierson, </em>386 U.S. at 554, 87 S.Ct. at 1218. The doctrine of judicial immunity applies to both suits for damages and suits seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. <em>Bolin v. Story, </em>225 F.3d 1234, 1242 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-14\">Judge Drake is entitled to judicial immunity. The first requirement for immunity is met because issuing an order is one of the \u201cparadigmatic judicial acts involved in resolving disputes between parties who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>have invoked the jurisdiction of a court.\u201d <em>Forrester v. White, </em>484 U.S. 219, 227, 108 S.Ct. 538, 544, 98 L.Ed.2d 555 (1988). The second requirement is met because the U.S. Bankruptcy Court had subject matter jurisdiction over the motion decided by Drake. <em>See Dykes, </em>776 F.2d at 943 (holding that \u201ca judge enjoys absolute immunity where he or she had subject matter jurisdiction over the matter forming the basis for such liability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Bush contends that our decision \u201capprovers] judicial corruption,\u201d but this argument is without merit. Although judicial immunity prevents a civil suit against a federal judge accused of taking bribes, other safeguards exist to protect litigants against judicial corruption. <em>See Bryan v. Murphy, </em>243 F.Supp.2d 1375, 1379 (N.D.Ga.2003) (listing \u201cspecific procedures ... for the public to lodge complaints about federal judges\u201d). First, an aggrieved litigant can appeal the judgment. Second, \u201c[a]ny person alleging that a judge has engaged in conduct prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts ... may file with the clerk of the court of appeals for the circuit a written complaint containing a brief statement of the facts constituting such conduct.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 351(a). Third, a bankruptcy judge may be removed from office, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 152(e), or criminally prosecuted, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, for taking bribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The dismissal of Bush\u2019s complaint against Judge Drake is</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
