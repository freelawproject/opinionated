RamirezRosas argues on appeal that his sentence was unreasonable because his sentence was greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He does not challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of his guidelines sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Because Ramirez-Rosas\u2019s sentence was within a properly calculated guidelines range of 70 to 87 months, we infer that the district court considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Ramirez-Rosas has failed to demonstrate that his properly calculated guidelines sentence was unreasonable. <em>See id.; Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Ramirez-Rosas also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Ramirez-Rosas contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Ramirez-Rosas properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
