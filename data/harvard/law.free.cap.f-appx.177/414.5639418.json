Her original application was denied in October 2001; her reapplication, in January 2002. After requesting reconsideration, benefits were again denied in August 2002. Swist then requested a hearing by an administrative law judge (ALJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-17\">As of the ALJ hearing, TRG was six-years old. His medical records showed, beginning at age two, a history of treatment for shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. TRG testified he took pills and used a breathing machine and inhaler to treat these asthmatic symptoms. Swist testified TRG\u2019s illness often caused him to miss school, and, when he did attend, his medications caused him to be hyper and inattentive. His medical records also showed his parents allowed his prescriptive medications to lapse on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-18\">In addition to the above testimony, the ALJ considered reports from medical consultants and TRG\u2019s teachers. In 2001, TRG\u2019s preschool teacher rated TRG average in all areas, including: following oral instructions, comprehension of classroom discussion, and completion of tasks on time. In 2001 and 2002, two medical consultants assessed TRG\u2019s functioning on behalf of the Commissioner. Both concluded his impairments were severe, but did not meet, medically equal, or functionally equal any Listing of Impairments (Listing) in the Social Security Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-19\">After reviewing the above reports and testimony, the ALJ concluded TRG was <em>not </em>disabled within the meaning of the Act. The ALJ determined TRG\u2019s asthma was severe, but did not medically equal any impairment on the Listing. The ALJ concluded TRG had no limitations in attending and completing tasks, interacting and relating with others, and caring for self, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>had less than marked limitations in acquiring and using information, moving about and manipulating objects, and health and physical well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">After the ALJ denied benefits, Swist appealed to the Appeals Council, which denied review in April 2004. She then appealed to the district court, which affirmed in March 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Our review is limited to determining whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the proper legal standards were applied. <em>E.g., Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 236 (5th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1120, 115 S.Ct. 1984, 131 L.Ed.2d 871 (1995). \u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \u201c[I]t must be more than a scintilla, but it need not be a preponderance\u201d. <em>Leggett v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 558, 564 (5th Cir.1995) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Any findings of fact made by the Commissioner and supported by substantial evidence are conclusive. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We \u201ccannot reweigh the evidence\u201d; instead, our review is limited to determining whether the record \u201ccontains substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision\u201d. <em>Leggett, </em>67 F.3d at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In determining whether a child is disabled under the meaning of the Act, a three-step evaluation is employed by the Commissioner: (1) \u201cwhether the child is engaged in substantial gainful activity\u201d; (2) \u201cwhether the child has an impairment that is \u2018severe\u2019 \u201d; and (3) \u201cwhether the child\u2019s impairment is medically or functionally equivalent in severity to the impairments listed in the disability regulations\u201d. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>413 F.3d 718, 721 (8th Cir.2005) (paraphrasing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924). For the third inquiry, the ALJ must consider whether the applicant\u2019s impairment results in a marked limitation in two domains or an extreme limitation in one domain for the following: (1) acquiring and using information; (2) attending and completing tasks; (3) interacting and relating with others; (4) moving about and manipulating objects; (5) caring for oneself; and (6) health and physical well-being. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(b)(1). Swist asserts the ALJ erred in concluding TRG\u2019s impairment did not satisfy this third inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Substantial evidence, including reports from two medical consultants and TRG\u2019s preschool teacher, supports the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding TRG\u2019s functional capabilities. The ALJ also found that Swist\u2019s assertions regarding functional limitations and restrictions of activities of daily living were \u201cexaggerated, lack[ed] corroboration or substantiation in the medical evidence, and [were] not credible as to a disabling impairment\u201d. The ALJ based his findings on substantial evidence and applied the proper legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">We do not consider Swist\u2019s claims raised for the first time on appeal, including whether TRG\u2019s condition \u201cwaxes and wanes\u201d pursuant to <em>Frank v. Barnhart, </em>326 F.3d 618 (5th Cir.2003), and whether a treating physician\u2019s statement should have been afforded greater weight than a teacher\u2019s statement, pursuant to <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448 (5th Cir.2000). <em>See Capps v. Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co., </em>536 F.2d 80, 82 (5th Cir.1976) (\u201cA party cannot raise a new theory on appeal that was not presented to the court below.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b443-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
