That decision vacated the immigration judge\u2019s grant of a good-faith marriage waiver to Dillon-Bonaparte pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(c)(4)(B) (2000) and ordered her removal from the United States. In her brief before this court, Dillon-Bonaparte presents challenges to the Board\u2019s initial order of July 4, 2004, rather than raising arguments that the Board abused its discretion in denying her motion to reconsider. However, Dillon-Bonaparte failed to petition for review of that initial order. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000) (petition for review must be filed within 30 days of final order of removal); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (holding that the timely filing of a motion to reconsider with the Board does not toll the thirty-day period for seeking review of the underlying order). Accordingly, we find that Dillon-Bonaparte has abandoned the only issue that she could properly raise on appeal, and we therefore dismiss the petition for review. Given this disposition, we deny the Attorney General\u2019s motion to dismiss as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
