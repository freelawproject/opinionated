Rivera-Magana appeals, arguing that his twenty-seven month sentence was unreasonable when considered in light of all the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the applicable guideline range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>If the sentence imposed is within the properly calculated guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">Here, Rivera-Magana\u2019s adjusted offense level was seventeen and the district court reduced his criminal history category from III to II. Rivera-Magana\u2019s twenty-seven month sentence was within the guideline range of twenty-seven to thirty-three months, and well within the statutory maximum of twenty years. Although RiveraMagana contends that the district court did not adequately consider the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), the court heard argument about Rivera-Magana\u2019s family circumstances, and the court stated it had considered the nature and circumstances of the offense. The court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>\u2014 F.3d \u2014, 2006 WL 893594, *5 (4th Cir. Apr.7, 2006). Because the record demonstrates the court\u2019s consideration of \u00a7 3553(a), we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">Accordingly, we affirm Rivera-Magana\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
