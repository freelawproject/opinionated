The district court sentenced Martinez-Higareda to 37 months in prison and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-26\">For the first time on appeal, MartinezHigareda argues that the district court violated his Fourth Amendment rights by ordering, as a written condition of his supervised release, that he cooperate in the collection of DNA by his probation officer. As Martinez-Higareda concedes, his claim is not ripe for review. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1101-02 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 9, 2006) (No. 05-8662). He raises the issue only to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-27\">The appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
