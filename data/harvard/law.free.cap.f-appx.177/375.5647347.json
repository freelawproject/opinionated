The district court accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and rejected Little\u2019s claim that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) was inadequate and ineffective to test the legality of his detention.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Little does not meet the standard set forth in <em>In </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>re <em>Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333-34 (4th Cir.2000), we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition. We also affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Little\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-9\"> The district court also noted that to the extent it might consider Little\u2019s claim under \u00a7 2255, such relief would be barred as successive. We also note that the district court erroneously stated that Little was sentenced as an armed career criminal instead of a career offender.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
