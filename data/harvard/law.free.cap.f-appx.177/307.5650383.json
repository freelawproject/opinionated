Avilez\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>that, in his opinion, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Although concluding that such allegations lacked merit, counsel claims on appeal that there was insufficient evidence to support Avilez\u2019s conviction. Avilez was notified of his right to file a supplemental pro se brief, but did not do so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel asserts that there was insufficient evidence to support Avilez\u2019s conviction. We disagree. Avilez was discovered by law enforcement officials in a house with other suspected drug traffickers. Items discovered in the house included methamphetamine, cocaine, baggies, ingredients to make drugs, scales, balance sheets, cell phones, and cash. Moreover, several of Avilez\u2019s co-defendants testified against him at trial, noting his participation in setting up drug buys and hiding drugs from police.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Avilez\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
