Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the issue of whether the sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable. Although Navarette-Beltran was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, he has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-24\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in determining a sentence post-Booker, sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>tencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the applicable guideline range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>Id. </em>If the sentence imposed is within the properly calculated guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 2006 WL 267217, at *5 (4th Cir. Feb.6, 2006) (No. 05-4270).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Navarette-Beltran\u2019s sentence was both within the guideline range of fifty-seven to seventy-one months, and well within the statutory maximum of twenty years. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly calculated and considered the guideline range and the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find the sentence reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
