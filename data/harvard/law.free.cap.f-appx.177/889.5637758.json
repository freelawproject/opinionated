The problem BMG faces seeking appellate review of these issues is that out precedent holds that \u201cafter a full trial and judgment on the merits, [we] will not review the pretrial denial of a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Akouri v. State of Florida Dept. Of Transp., </em>408 F.3d 1338, 1347 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). In short, this precedent precludes our review of the court\u2019s summary judgment ruling. We turn, then, to BMG\u2019s argument that the court erred in submitting the case to the jury, i.e., the claims that formed the bases for Kendrick\u2019s recovery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">BMG moved the court for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the plaintiffs case. The court did not rule on the motion, and BMG proceeded to put on its own case. After it rested, BMG did not move for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In other words, it stood silent as the court submitted the case to the jury under instructions that are not challenged here. As Wright and Miller explain, \u201c[i]t is thoroughly established that the sufficiency of the evidence is not reviewable on appeal unless a motion for judgment as a matter of law was made in the trial court. Indeed a motion at the close of the plaintiffs case will not do unless it is renewed at the close of all the evidence.\u201d 9A Wright and Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 2536.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">In sum, the law precludes us from reviewing the court\u2019s denial of BMG\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant submission of the case to the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court\u2019s judgment is therefore due to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-18\">. The parties stipulated to the amount of back pay Kendrick should receive if the jury retumec\u00ed a verdict in his favor. The jury also gave Kendrick $48,000 in front pay, but miti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>gation in the sum of $49,229 canceled that recovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b918-8\">. The parties tried the case to a magistrate judge by consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b918-11\">. In the section of its brief with the heading \"Standard or scope of review,\" BMG only cites the standard for reviewing summary judgments; the section is silent as to the standard we use in determining the sufficiency of the evidence (at the close of all the evidence) to withstand a motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b918-16\">. After the jury returned its verdict, BMG moved the court for a new trial \"based on Juror Misconduct.\u201d The court denied the motion. BMG does not challenge the ruling in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b918-17\">. BMG\u2019s brief contains no argument to the effect that allowing the judgment to stand would result in manifest injustice. Assuming that the rules of appellate review permit us to scan the trial transcript to determine whether manifest injustice occurred here, we find nothing that would warrant setting aside the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
