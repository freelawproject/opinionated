He appeals his sentence of 110 months of imprisonment. Because we conclude that the district court properly determined Allen\u2019s sentence and that his sentence is reasonable, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-25\">On appeal, Allen does not dispute that the district court properly calculated the applicable Guideline <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> range. He argues, however, that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court improperly de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>termined his sentence by failing to adequately explain its sentencing determination, failing to adequately consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005); and imposing a sentence greater than necessary to fulfill the purposes of sentencing. Allen\u2019s Guideline range was ninety-two to 115 months. The statutory maximum term of imprisonment based upon Allen\u2019s guilty plea was 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We recently considered the analysis required in reviewing a sentence for reasonableness and formulated the following standards for district courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">Thus, to sentence a defendant, district courts must (1) properly calculate the sentence range recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines; (2) determine whether a sentence within that range and within statutory limits serves the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and, if not, select a sentence that does serve those factors; (3) implement mandatory statutory limitations; and (4) articulate the reasons for selecting the particular sentence, especially explaining why a sentence outside of the Sentencing Guideline range better serves the relevant sentencing purposes set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-7\"><em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.2006) (footnote omitted). We also agreed with a sister circuit that \u201ca sentence imposed \u201cwithin the properly calculated Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457 (quoting <em>United States v. Newsom, </em>428 F.3d 685, 687 (7th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Our review of the record in this case leads us to conclude that the district court complied with the requirements announced in <em>Green, </em>despite the fact that it did not have the benefit of that decision at Allen\u2019s sentencing. Contrary to Allen\u2019s assertions, the record demonstrates a very deliberate, thorough, and careful consideration of the proper sentencing factors by the district court. We recently held that \u201c[t]he district court need not discuss each factor set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) \u2018in checklist fashion\u2019; \u2018it is enough to calculate the range accurately and explain why (if the sentence lies outside it) this defendant deserves more or less.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Dean, </em>414 F.3d 725, 729 (7th Cir.2005)). The transcript of the sentencing hearing in this case includes a sufficient discussion of those factors to allow us to review the sentencing determination. Having conducted that review, we find no error in the district court\u2019s selection of the particular sentence imposed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Allen\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-26\"> <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
