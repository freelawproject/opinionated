At sentencing, the district court enhanced his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) based on a prior state felony conviction for possession of cocaine. Aurelien asserts this Court should overrule its precedent and find an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) does not include state fel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>onies that would only be punishable as a federal misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Simon, </em>168 F.3d 1271, 1272 (11th Cir.1999). Under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C), if a defendant was deported previously after a \u201cconviction for an aggravated felony,\u201d the base offense level should be increased by eight levels. In <em>Simon, </em>we held a drug offense meets the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d if two criteria are met: (1) the offense must be punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, and (2) the offense must be a felony. <em>Simon, </em>168 F.3d at 1272. <em>Simon </em>held a state felony conviction for possession of cocaine satisfied these two criteria, and therefore qualified as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[O]nly the Supreme Court or this Court sitting en banc can judicially overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Marte, </em>356 F.3d 1336, 1344 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Aurelien\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Simon. </em>The district court enhanced Aurelien\u2019s base offense level because he had a prior Florida state conviction for possession of cocaine, which, under <em>Simon, </em>is an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d <em>Simon, </em>168 F.3d at 1272. To the extent Aurelien argues this Court should overrule the prior panel decision, that argument is without merit as only the Supreme Court or this Court sitting en banc may do so. <em>Marte, </em>356 F.3d at 1344. The district court did not err in following <em>Simon </em>and applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C). Accordingly, we affirm Aurelien\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
