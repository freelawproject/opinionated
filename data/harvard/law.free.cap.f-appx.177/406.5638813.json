His civil rights lawsuit alleged that the defendants failed to protect him from an attack by another inmate in the Grayson City Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Dolan does not address the district court\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s actions were, at most, negligent, and did not constitute deliberate indifference, and he alleges no facts which would indicate that the defendants knew Dolan faced an excessive risk of harm from the other inmate on the day in question. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 833, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Dolan\u2019s arguments that the district court erred in dismissing his lawsuit without first allowing discovery, that the district court erred in not allowing him to have a jury trial, and that the dismissal of his lawsuit constituted a denial of access to the courts are without merit. The district court can dismiss a suit \u201cat any time\u201d if it determines that it is frivolous or fails to state a claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). In addition, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Dolan\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel. <em>See Cupit v. Jones, </em>835 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">As Dolan\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit, it is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of his case as frivolous and for failure to state a claim and the dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Dolan is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
