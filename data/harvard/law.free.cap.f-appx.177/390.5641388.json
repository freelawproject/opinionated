The district court imposed a $200 assessment and ordered O\u2019Kane to pay $22,491.54 in restitution. She now appeals, arguing that the appeal waiver provision of her plea agreement does not bar a challenge to her sentence, that the scope of appellate review regarding her sentence is not limited if the waiver provision is inoperable, and that the district court erred in the application of the Sentencing Guidelines with regard to the calculation of the amount of loss. O\u2019Kane asserts that the plea agreement, which reserved the right to appeal a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum, does not bar her claims because her sentence exceeds the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d as that term is defined in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Government seeks to enforce the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">By its plain language, O\u2019Kane\u2019s knowing and voluntary appeal waiver bars her claims, as she was not sentenced above the statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544-46 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>413 F.3d 502, 503 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 502, 163 L.Ed.2d 365 (2005). O\u2019Kane\u2019s attempts to distinguish these cases are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
