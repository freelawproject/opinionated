In a criminal case, the defendant must file his notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final order. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). The appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-23\">The district court\u2019s final order in this case was entered on October 14, 2005. Even giving Ross the benefit of Fed. R.App. P. 4(c), his notice of appeal is deemed filed on November 7, 2005\u2014out-side the ten-day appeal period. Because Ross failed to file a timely notice of appeal and did not obtain an extension of time to appeal, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
