Diaz contends that his sentence must be vacated and his case remanded for resentencing because the district court committed reversible error by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines regime, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The district court\u2019s sentence pursuant to a mandatory guideline scheme constitutes <em>Fanfan </em>error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir.2005). The Government thus bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the Guidelines been advisory only. <em>See id. </em>at 464-65. If the Government cannot show that the error was harmless, we ordinarily will vacate and remand for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The sentencing transcript does not reveal whether the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the Guidelines been advisory. Because the Government cannot meet its burden, we vacate Diaz\u2019s sentence and remand the case for resentencing. <em>See id. </em>at 464-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Diaz also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated-felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than as elements of the offense that must be found by a jury, on authority of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Diaz\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Diaz contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Diaz properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, Diaz\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
