By moving for IFP here, Marzon is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). Marzon does not challenge the district court\u2019s determinations that Rule 60(b) was inapplicable to his criminal case or that an amendment to his sentence was not authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Marzon\u2019s sole argument is that the district court should not have recharacterized his motion as an initial 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion without following the procedure set forth <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003), involving notice and leave to amend. We do not consider the court\u2019s alternative discussion of \u00a7 2255 and the applicability of the statute of limitations to be a \u201crecharacterization.\u201d However, even if it were, such recharacterization without warning is not reversible error. It merely means that \u201cthe motion cannot be considered to have become a \u00a7 2255 motion for purposes of applying to later motions the law\u2019s \u2018second or successive\u2019 restrictions.\u201d <em>Castro, </em>540 U.S. at 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">Marzon has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201c\u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED as FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
