Rocha challenged his conviction based on <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-22\">Rocha argues that his challenge to the firearms offense falls within the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. \u201c[T]he savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies to a claim (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-23\">This court has already held that the evidence was sufficient to support Rocha\u2019s conviction for carrying a firearm under \u00a7 924(c). <em>See United States v. Rocha, </em>916 F.2d 219, 236-37 (5th Cir.1990). We have also held that this prior holding precludes Rocha from seeking the application of the savings clause under \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Rocha, </em>2002 WL 31049460 at *1 (5th Cir. Sept. 3, 2002). Rocha has not shown that he meets the first prong of the <em>Reyes-Requena </em>test. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-24\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
