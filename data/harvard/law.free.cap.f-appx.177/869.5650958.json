Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Appellant\u2019s convictions and sentences for conspiracy to commit access device fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, access device fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029, and social security number fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408. <em>See United States v. James, </em>126 Fed.Appx. 462 (11th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further consideration in the light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-19\">In his initial brief on direct appeal, Appellant did not assert error based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or any case extending or applying the <em>Apprendi </em>principle. Appellant, however sought permission to file a supplemental brief to present additional arguments about <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We denied Appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-20\">In <em>United States v. Sears, </em>411 F.3d 1240, 1241 (11th Cir.2005), a case with a procedural history similar to this one, we wrote that <em>Booker </em>did not require us to alter our prior decision because Sears did not raise a <em>Booker </em>issue in his initial brief, he was denied leave to file a supplemental brief raising <em>Booker, </em>and nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order demanded a different conclusion. The same reasoning applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-21\">Appellant did not assert error based on <em>Apprendi </em>(or its progeny) in his initial brief on appeal. We, thus, reinstate our previous opinion in this case and affirm Appellant\u2019s convictions and sentences after our reconsideration in the light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-22\">OPINION REINSTATED; CONVICTIONS AND SENTENCES AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
