We grant the petition, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Because the BIA, in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning, our review focuses on the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To the extent the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is de novo. <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test, and this Court \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (citation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General have discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. The alien\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof for asylum without corroboration. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(a), 208.16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">Here, the IJ found Hernandez\u2019s testimony credible, but insufficient to make out a claim for asylum. The IJ never decided whether the actions about which Hernandez testified rose to the level of persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the IJ held Hernandez was unable to show persecution primarily on account of an enumerated ground and was unable to meet the burden of showing any fear of persecution would exist throughout Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">The Second and Ninth Circuits have held there is no requirement that persecution be based solely on account of a protected ground. <em>See Borja v. INS, </em>175 F.3d 732, 735-36 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc); <em>Osorio v. INS, </em>18 F.3d 1017, 1028 (2d Cir.1994) (\u201cThe plain meaning of the phrase \u2018persecution on account of the victim\u2019s political opinion,\u2019 does not mean persecution <em>solely </em>on account of the victim\u2019s political opinion.\u201d). If an applicant can show the persecution was at least in part motivated by a protected ground, the applicant can establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See Borja, </em>175 F.3d at 736 (holding evidence compelled the conclusion that persecution was on account of both political opinion and attempts at extortion, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>such a \u201cmixed motives\u201d case satisfied applicant\u2019s burden). The record in this case compels the conclusion the Revolutionary-Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) targeted Hernandez, in part, because of his political opinion. Evidence in the record compels the conclusion the FARC targeted Hernandez for two reasons: (1) believing he was wealthy, the FARC wanted to extort money from him to finance their terrorist operations; and (2) attempting to quiet all opposition to their group, the FARC threatened to kill him unless he stopped his political activities, and public opposition and denouncement of their ideals.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Importantly, the IJ found Hernandez\u2019s testimony to be credible. The FARC\u2019s threats against Hernandez, when taken together with the facts of his political activism\u2014hosting Liberal party meetings in his office, publicly opposing the FARC, and assisting social welfare programs, compel a conclusion that Hernandez was targeted, at least in part, on account of his political opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Because the IJ failed to determine whether the Petitioners suffered past persecution or established they have a well-founded fear of future persecution, we must remand the case to allow a decision on this issue in the first instance. Accordingly, the petition is granted, and the case is remanded to the BIA for further proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-8\">. Petitioners do not appeal the IJ\u2019s denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-9\">. The IJ stated, however, \u201d[h]ad the respondents demonstrated statutory eligibility, the court would grant asylum as a matter of discretion given the lack of adverse factors in their case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b66-6\">. Because withholding of removal is also dependent on whether the alien would be threatened because of a political opinion, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), this analysis also applies to the IJ's denial of withholding of removal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b66-7\">. We realize the IJ also based the decision to deny asylum on Petitioners\u2019 inability to show their fear of persecution would exist throughout Colombia. \u201cIn cases in which an applicant has demonstrated past persecution ... the <em>Service </em>shall bear the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d that \"[t]he applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality ... and under all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)(i)(B), (ii) (emphasis added). In cases in which an applicant has not established past persecution, the <em>applicant </em>bears the burden of establishing that it would be unreasonable for the applicant to relocate. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.13(b)(3) (emphasis added). Because there are different burdens depending on whether the applicant has shown past persecution, and it is unclear whether Petitioners have shown past persecution in this case, on remand, if past persecution is shown, the burden should be on the Service, rather than the Petitioners, to show the Petitioners have an internal relocation option.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
