He appeals, claiming that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court refused to depart from the advisory guidelines range which took into account the 100:1 crack to powder cocaine ratio.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-20\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the applicable guideline range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>Id. </em>If the sentence imposed is within the properly calculated guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 2006 WL 267217, at *5 (4th Cir. Feb.6, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-21\">Wilfoung\u2019s sentence was both within the guideline range of 210-262 months, and well within the statutory maximum of life imprisonment. See <em>21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) (2000). Moreover, we have recently considered and rejected a <em>post-Booker </em>challenge to the 100:1 crack to powder cocaine ratio contained in the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Euro, </em>440 F.3d 625 (4th Cir.2006). Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly calculated and considered the guideline range and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find the sentence reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
