As the manager of the transfer station, Lee was initially classified as a garbage route supervisor. Lee felt he was actually performing the work of a superintendent and began complaining to his supervisors that he was improperly classified. The City subsequently changed Lee\u2019s job title to waste disposal supervisor, and then to transfer station supervisor, pursuant to two studies analyzing Lee\u2019s job duties and responsibilities. Lee remained dissatisfied with his classification and continued to complain to his supervisors that he believed he was performing the job of a superintendent and should be paid accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">In 2001, Lee discovered a draft copy of the City\u2019s site operating plan, which indicated that the City was required to have a waste disposal superintendent manage the transfer station facility. Lee\u2019s discovery confirmed his belief that he had been improperly classified, and as a result, he filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-16\">Lee subsequently sued the City in federal court, alleging, among other things, that the City discriminated against Lee on the basis of race and thereby violated Title VII.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The City then moved for summary judgment. In a pre-trial ruling, the mag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>istrate judge struck several attachments to Lee\u2019s summary judgment response, on the ground that they were improperly certified under Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and then recommended that the district court grant summary judgment in the City\u2019s favor. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation, and Lee appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">On appeal, Lee argues that: (1) the \u201cmagistrate judge and/or trial court\u201d erred by striking portions of his summary judgment evidence; (2) the evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact on his discrimination claim; and (3) the district court erred by <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing his Equal Protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Despite the magistrate judge\u2019s pre-trial order excluding several of Lee\u2019s exhibits, the district court alternatively considered the disputed evidence and deemed it insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact on Lee\u2019s discrimination claim. Having reviewed the district court\u2019s summary judgment <em>de novo,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Under the familiar burden-shifting test set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Lee can establish a <em>prima facie </em>discrimination case by showing that he: (1) is a member of a protected class; (2) was qualified for the position sought; (3) suffered an adverse employment decision; and (4) was treated differently from similarly situated individuals outside his protected class.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The burden then shifts to the City to offer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for failing to classify Lee as a superintendent and pay him accordingly.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the City satisfies its burden, then Lee must show that the City\u2019s proffered reason is a pretext for discrimination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">In his affidavit, Lee makes two attempts to show that he was treated differently from similarly situated individuals outside his protected class. Because Lee\u2019s eonclusory allegations are unsupported by the evidence accompanying his affidavit, both attempts fail.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He first asserts that Leonard Odom, an Anglo, managed the transfer station from 1981 to 1983 and was classified as a superintendent. In support, Lee attaches two state inspection reports of the transfer station facility, which list Odom as the superintendent. However, even assuming that these reports were properly authenticated, they do not constitute any evidence that the City classified Odom as a superintendent. In fact, Lee is similarly referred to as the \u201csite superintendent\u201d on a state inspection report. This evidence thus fails to create a genuine fact issue that Lee and Odom, even if similarly situated, were treated differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-14\">Lee further alleges in his affidavit that Jesse Hernandez, who is Hispanic, is classified as the superintendent of a landfill facility, which Lee claims is not significantly different than the transfer station that he manages. Lee\u2019s only support for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>this assertion is a section from the Texas Administrative Code, which generally describes the types of municipal solid waste sites, including landfills and transfer stations. Neither Lee\u2019s affidavit, nor any of the documents attached to his summary judgment response, detail Lee\u2019s and Hernandez\u2019s respective job duties or responsibilities or raise a genuine question as to whether Lee and Hernandez perform nearly identical jobs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Lee has not produced sufficient evidence for summary judgment purposes to show that he and Hernandez are similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Finally, the district court properly dismissed Lee\u2019s Equal Protection claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 because Lee never alleged, and his summary judgment evidence fails to show, that \u201can official municipal policy, practice, or custom led to a violation of his constitutional rights.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b466-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
