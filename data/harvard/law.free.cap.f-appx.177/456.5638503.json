For the following reasons, we affirm his convictions, but we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In his first assignment of error, Young argues that the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(b)(1), which provides for a three-level increase if the defendant assaulted a law enforcement officer, constituted Sixth Amendment error in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We agree. We reject the Government\u2019s argument that Young admitted the facts supporting the enhancement and, therefore, there was no Sixth Amendment <em>Booker </em>error. Young made no statements admitting that he knew or had reason to believe that the officer was a law enforcement officer. To the contrary, he repeatedly denied such assertions. As the district court applied the \u00a7 3A1.2(b)(1) enhancement based on facts that were neither admitted by Young nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the district court committed Sixth Amendment error. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir.2005). Moreover, even absent the Sixth Amendment error, the mandatory application of the Guidelines was \u201cFan-fan\u201d error, which Young preserved. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Mesa, </em>443 F.3d 397, 403 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We further conclude that the Government has failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d at 286. The imposition of a sentence at the top of the applicable guidelines range, without more, is insufficient to show that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory guidelines regime. <em>United States v. Woods, </em>440 F.3d 255, 258-59 (5th Cir.2006). The fact that the district court imposed a consecutive sentence for Young\u2019s firearms conviction likewise sheds no light on this issue as the district court was required by statute to order the sentences to run consecutively. <em>See id.; </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Young\u2019s challenges to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and (b) and to his conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) are foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Gresham, </em>118 F.3d 258, 264-65 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Kuban, </em>94 F.3d 971 (5th Cir.1996). Young concedes as much but raises these arguments to preserve them for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Young\u2019s conviction, but we VACATE his sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b484-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
