On appeal, Peay argues that the district court erred by sentencing him as an armed career criminal in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-21\">Peay\u2019s argument is foreclosed by two of our recent decisions. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 282-84 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that district court may enhance sentence based on fact of prior convictions under \u00a7 924(e) regardless of whether admitted by defendant or found by jury), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1463, \u2014 L.Ed.2d <em>\u2014 (2006); United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-53 (4th Cir.) (holding that the armed career criminal designation, based on prior convictions, does not violate the Sixth Amendment under <em>Booker), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-27\">Accordingly, we affirm Peay\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument as the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-28\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
