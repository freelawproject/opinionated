Graham argued in the district court that (1) the indictment against him was defective for failing to specifically allege that he was not authorized to distribute controlled substances; (2) 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) was only intended to apply to persons registered with the Attorney General under federal controlled substances laws; and (8) 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) was altered after being signed into law, thus rendering the statute void. The district court found that Graham\u2019s petition did not fall within the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and therefore dismissed the petition for failing to state a claim cognizable under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). The savings clause in \u00a7 2255, however, permits a prisoner to \u201cfile a \u00a7 2241 petition if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1365. The savings clause \u201capplies when (1) a claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of the Supreme Court decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted for an offense that is now nonexistent; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Wofford v. Scott, 177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">None of the three claims Graham raised in the district court are supported by a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision, and therefore none survive the first prong of <em>Wofford. We </em>have held that the cases cited by Graham to support his first claim\u2014namely, <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)\u2014are not retroactively applicable on collateral review. <em>See McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1256-58 (11th Cir.2001) (addressing <em>Apprendi); Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 867-68 (11th Cir.2005) (addressing <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker), cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1122, 120 S.Ct. 1992, 146 L.Ed.2d 817 (2005). Because none of Graham\u2019s claims satisfy the first <em>Wofford </em>requirement, it is unnecessary for us to consider the second and third prongs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">Based on review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. The district court properly dismissed Graham\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition upon its determination that none of Graham\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>claims satisfied the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\">. Graham urges us to consider his petition despite his failure to satisfy the <em>Wofford </em>test. But even assuming that a conclusory statement to this effect in the district court preserved this claim for appeal, Graham\u2019s newly formulated justifications are unavailing. Graham is flatly incorrect to assert that his allegedly insufficient indictment constituted a jurisdictional defect. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 630, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). Nor does Graham present evidence to support his alternative argument that the executive branch has engaged in a multi-decade plot to prosecute a war on drugs <em>contrary to </em>Congressional intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
