And it argues that even if he preserved the error, it was harmless.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-24\">\u201cWaivers of constitutional rights not only must be voluntary but must be knowing, intelligent acts done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences; in other words, such a waiver must constitute an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ceasar did not waive the error. His first counsel raised a <em>Blakely </em>objection to the PSR and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>then withdrew. Although his second counsel did not mention <em>Blakely </em>in his objections to the amended response, neither Ceasar nor his second counsel withdrew the initial objection. That Ceasar did not \u201crenew\u201d his challenge at sentencing is irrelevant, for he had an outstanding objection. Given the change of counsel in the middle of the case and that the district court never told Ceasar he was waiving his objection, we cannot say Ceasar knowingly waived his Blakely/Booker<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Moreover, we cannot say that Ceasar forfeited the challenge. A forfeited error is one the defendant fails to make. Once Ceasar objected under <em>Blakely, </em>the issue was on the table and could only be preserved for appeal or waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Consequently, we review for harmless error, reversing unless the Government can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory Guidelines regime.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Government points only to the fact that the district court sentenced Ceasar in the middle of the Guidelines range. In a recent unpublished opinion, we held that insufficient to show harmlessness.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a result, we VACATE Ceasar\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Because we vacate Ceasar\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing, we do not address Ceasar\u2019s other claims that the district court misapplied the Guidelines.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
