To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence [s]he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Nkandu fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-24\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of Nkandu\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum\u2014even though the facts that must be proved are the same\u2014an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). As Nkandu fails to show that she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-25\">We also find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Nkandu fails to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2005). We find that Nkandu failed to make the requisite showing before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
