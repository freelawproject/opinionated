We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">Sotelo first contends the district court erred under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) (2003) in ruling his prior felony conviction for carnal knowledge, without force, of a child between thirteen and fifteen years of age was a crime of violence and applying a sixteen-level enhancement. We review the district court\u2019s determination de novo. <em>See United States v. Pierce, </em>278 F.3d 282, 286 (4th Cir.2002). Acknowledging' that a crime of violence includes \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1) comment. (n.1(B)(iii)), Sotelo argues that because the statute of conviction did not expressly use the term, we should \u201clook behind the categorical approach to determine whether elements of [the] prior offense involved conduct presenting a serious risk of physical injury to another.\u201d However, because the offense categorically constitutes \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d <em>see United States v. Pereira-Salmeron, </em>337 F.3d 1148, 1155 (9th Cir.2003), we conclude the district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-17\">Sotelo next contends the district court erred by concluding he committed the instant offense while under a criminal justice sentence and adding two criminal history points under USSG \u00a7 4A1.1(d).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We review a district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing for clear error and its legal conclusions, including its interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines, de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217-18 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-18\">Sotelo admitted that he returned to the United States shortly after his 1997 felony conviction for which he received a two-year prison sentence that was suspended on the conditions that he \u201cbe of good behavior\u201d and obey all state and federal laws. However, he contends the sentence was not a \u201ccriminal justice sentence\u201d because the sentencing court did not expressly use the term \u201cprobation,\u201d and even if he was under a probationary sentence, he did not commit any part of the instant offense during his probationary term. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-19\">The district court did not err in concluding Sotelo\u2019s suspended sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>constituted a criminal justice sentence based on the undisputed terms of the sentencing order. Moreover, even though Sotelo\u2019s indictment alleged he was found in the United States in 2003, the court did not err in ruling that it was not bound by the terms of the indictment when applying the guidelines and concluding his reentry was relevant conduct for the instant offense. The district court properly relied on Sotelo\u2019s admission that he reentered the United States during the two-year period. Moreover, \u201c[b]ecause the crime of being \u2018found in\u2019 the United States is not complete until an alien is discovered by immigration authorities, it is considered a \u2018continuing offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Godinez-Rabadan, </em>289 F.3d 630, 632 (9th Cir.2002) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Finally, Sotelo contends the district court committed Sixth Amendment error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and we should remand for resentencing under <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005). Sotelo\u2019s sentence was imposed before <em>Booker </em>issued, and he did not raise objections to his sentence in the district court based on the mandatory nature of the sentencing guidelines or the district court\u2019s application of sentencing enhancements based on facts not admitted by him or found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We therefore review his sentence for plain error. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-60. Because we conclude the district court was not required to resolve any disputed facts about Sotelo\u2019s pri- or conviction to reach its legal conclusions under the sentencing guidelines, we find there was no Sixth Amendment error. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1463, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2006); <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The determination as to whether Sotelo\u2019s prior felony conviction categorically constituted sexual abuse of a minor was a legal determination based on the definition of the offense that inhered in the fact of conviction. Moreover, the district court was not required to resolve any disputed facts in concluding Sotelo\u2019s two-year suspended sentence was a criminal justice sentence and that Sotelo returned to the United States during the two-year term. The terms of the sentencing order were undisputed, and the district court\u2019s construction of those terms and the guidelines were legal conclusions. <em>See Thompson, </em>421 F.3d at 285 (neither <em>Booker </em>nor <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), \u201ctransmogrify what have always been questions of law into questions of fact\u201d). Although the question of when Sotelo returned was a factual question, Sotelo admitted the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Even if the district court\u2019s ruling that Sotelo committed the instant offense during a criminal justice sentence constituted a finding of disputed fact, there was no prejudice resulting from the error. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005). Without a reduction for acceptance of responsibility or added criminal history points, Sotelo\u2019s sentencing guideline range would have been fifty-seven to seventy-one months in prison. While the district court unwittingly committed plain error by imposing a sentence under the then-existing mandatory guidelines regime, the district court expressly noted its conclusion that Sotelo\u2019s conduct properly fell within the guideline range. There is thus no nonspeculative basis in the record for concluding Sotelo was prejudiced by the error. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-13\"> \"Two points are added if the defendant committed any part of the instant offense (i.e., any relevant conduct) while under any criminal justice sentence,\u201d including \"unsupervised probation.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.1(d) comment.
