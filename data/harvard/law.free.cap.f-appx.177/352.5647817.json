Wallace was sentenced following the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>court applied the holding of <em>Booker </em>and sentenced Wallace to 262 months imprisonment. On appeal, Wallace claims that he was sentenced in violation of <em>Booker </em>because his sentence was unreasonable and the district court failed to fully account for all the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) . However, in determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the applicable guideline range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>Id. </em>If the sentence imposed is within the properly calculated guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 2006 WL 267217, at *5 (4th Cir. Feb.6, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Wallace\u2019s sentence was both within the guideline range of 262-327 months, and well within the statutory maximum of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) (2000). Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly calculated and considered the guideline range and the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find the sentence reasonable. <em>See also United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, No. 05-4437, slip op. at 11 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201cTo establish reasonableness of a sentence, a district court need not explicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm Wallace\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">We grant Wallace\u2019s motion for leave to file a pro se supplemental brief and find the issues he asserts therein without merit. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
