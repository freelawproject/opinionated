In <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997), this court held that a state conviction is an \u201caggravated felony\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b) if the offense was punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and a felony under applicable state law. <em>Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d at 693. Rivas concedes that his simple-possession conviction was a felony under Texas law. Also, the CSA criminalizes possession of a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). Rivas\u2019s prior conviction therefore is an aggravated felony that warrants the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) eight-level offense level increase. <em>See Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d at 694; <em>see also United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312-13 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Rivas recognizes this court\u2019s prior decisions, but he argues that this circuit\u2019s precedent is inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis set forth in <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943). <em>Jerome </em>did not involve interpretation of the Guidelines. Also, <em>Jerome, </em>a 1943 decision, is not \u201can intervening Supreme Court case\u201d that explicitly or implicitly overruled <em>HinojosaLopez. </em>Thus, this court is bound by <em>Hinojosa-Lopez, see Martin v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>254 F.3d 573, 577 (5th Cir.2001), and <em>Jerome </em>does not affect the binding precedential value of <em>Rivera </em>and <em>Hinojosa-Lopez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Rivas also argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred by ordering him to cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample as a condition of supervised release. Rivas\u2019s claim is not ripe for review on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1101-02 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 9, 2006) (No. 05-8662). The claim is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Additionally, Rivas\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Rivas contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rivas properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-12\">Pursuant to 5th Cir.
