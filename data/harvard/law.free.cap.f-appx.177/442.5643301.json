We find no error in the district court\u2019s opinion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-16\">Plaintiffs are practitioners of Falun Gong, a spiritual belief system whose members are persecuted by the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d). When it was announced that Jiang Zemin, the former president of the PRC, intended to visit Houston and stay in the Intercontinental Hotel, plaintiffs made reservations at the nearby Homestead Studio Suites hotel (\u201cHomestead\u201d) to protest his presence. Homestead later made arrangements with a representative of the PRC to rent a substantial number of rooms to PRC members at a premium rate for the duration of Jiang\u2019s visit. Because this contract with the PRC resulted in overbooking, Homestead implemented its \u201cwalk policy\u201d with respect to persons scheduled for short-term stays, including plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-17\">Under the \u201cwalk policy,\u201d Homestead provides displaced patrons free transportation to, and a complimentary one-night stay at, a neighboring Homestead hotel. If no Homestead in the area has a vacancy, Homestead will pay for the first night\u2019s stay at a comparable hotel. Plaintiffs rejected the alternate accommodations, claiming that Homestead implemented its \u201cwalk policy\u201d because they were members of Falun Gong. Plaintiffs and Homestead filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards as the court below. <em>Vulcan Materials Co. v. City of Tehuacana, </em>369 F.3d 882, 886 (5th Cir.2004). Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Vulcan, </em>369 F.3d at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Plaintiffs allege that Homestead violated their right to make and enforce contracts under \u00a7 1981.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To prove a \u00a7 1981 claim, a plaintiff must show that (1) he is a member of a racial minority, (2) the defendant had an intent to discriminate on the basis of race, and (3) the discrimination concerns one of the activities listed in the statute. <em>See Green v. State Bar, </em>27 F.3d 1083, 1086 (5th Cir.1994). Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that plaintiffs state a claim under parts (1) and (3) of this test, as persons of Chinese national origin who sought specific enforcement of their contracts with Homestead, they cannot demonstrate that Homestead had any intent to discriminate. First, Homestead filled the rooms previously reserved by plaintiffs with members of the PRC, who are also of Chinese national origin. Second, there is no evidence that Homestead did not also exercise the \u201cwalk policy\u201d with respect to non-Chinese patrons with short-term reservations. Thud, there is no evidence that Homestead, once it decided to implement its \u201cwalk policy,\u201d offered different alternate accommodations to plaintiffs than to non-Chinese guests. For these reasons, plaintiffs fail to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact on their \u00a7 1981 claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">Plaintiffs allege violations of \u00a7 1982,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which guarantees the right to be free from discrimination based on race in the leasing of property. \u201cA cause of action based upon section 1982 likewise requires an intentional act of racial discrimination by a defendant.\u201d <em>Vaughner v. Pulito, </em>804 F.2d 873, 877 (5th Cir.1986). Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1982 claim suffers from the same fatal flaw as then\u2019 \u00a7 1981 claim: an inability to provide evidence of racial animus. The record merely reflects that Homestead took advantage of a legitimate business opportunity by implementing its \u201cwalk policy\u201d and renting out its rooms at a premium rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">Plaintiffs argue that Homestead violated their right to be free from racial or religious discrimination in places of public accommodation under \u00a7 2000a.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have already explained why plaintiffs fail to make a <em>prima facie </em>claim of racial discrim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ination, and the same logic applies to their claim for religious discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Falun Gong qualifies as a religion, plaintiffs have offered no evidence that Homestead did not also \u201cwalk\u201d non-practitioners of Falun Gong, nor that plaintiffs received unequal alternate accommodations, nor that Homestead had any knowledge whether the particular patrons being \u201cwalked\u201d practiced Falun Gong. Therefore, plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that Homestead engaged in \u201cdiscrimination ... on the ground of ... religion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2000a.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Plaintiffs maintain that Homestead conspired with the Chinese government to deny them the equal protection of the laws under \u00a7 1985(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To state a \u00a7 1985(c) claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) a conspiracy between two or more people, (2) for the purpose of depriving a person or class of the equal protection of the laws, and (3) an act that furthers the conspiracy, (4) whereby a person is injured in his person or property or denied any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States. <em>See Deubert v. Gulf Fed. Sav. Bank, </em>820 F.2d 754, 757 (5th Cir.1987). \u201cEssential to the [\u00a7 1985(c)] claim ... is that the conspiracy be motivated by racial animus.\u201d <em>Word of Faith World Outreach Ctr. Church v. Sawyer, </em>90 F.3d 118, 124 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">We have declined to extend \u00a7 1985(c) claims into the realm of religious discrimination. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, because plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that Homestead acted out of racial animus, <em>a fortiori </em>they cannot demonstrate that Homestead conspired with the Chinese government to act out of racial animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">Plaintiffs bring state law actions under the DTPA and for breach of contract. The DTPA applies to all transactions for goods and services and prohibits \u201cany unconscionable action or course of action\u201d that causes damages. <em>See </em>Tex. Bus. &amp; Com.Code \u00a7 17.50(a)(3). To prevail, plaintiffs must show that Homestead \u201ctook advantage of [plaintiffs\u2019] lack of knowledge and that the resulting unfairness was glaringly noticeable, flagrant, complete and unmitigated.\u201d <em>See Bradford v. Vento, </em>48 S.W.3d 749, 760 (Tex.2001) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">Because the evidence suggests that Homestead\u2019s \u201cwalk policy\u201d is a standard practice in the hotel industry, and because Homestead offered plaintiffs reasonable alternative lodgings, plaintiffs cannot prove the high degree of unfairness necessary to sustain an action under the DTPA. Likewise, plaintiffs cannot prevail on their breach of contract claim because they have presented no evidence that they suffered damage as a result of the transfer of their reservation from one hotel to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">Plaintiffs merely assert, without citing record evidence, that they suffered inconvenience. Even were there such evidence, supporting their claim that they suffered inconvenience as a result of Homestead\u2019s actions, they point to no evidence that damages from disappointment or distress from being relocated further from Zemin and the PRC delegation were within Homestead\u2019s contemplation when the contract was formed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>For the above reasons, we adopt the thorough reasoning of the district court and AFFIRM the denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and the grant of defendants\u2019 cross-motion. To the extent that defendants\u2019 counterclaim under the DTPA is before us on appeal, we AFFIRM the dismissal of the claim with prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b472-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
