Houston argues that the district court should have applied the \u201csafety valve\u201d to sentence Houston below the statutory minimum and that his five-year sentence was not reasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Houston used an America Online chat room to contact the \u201cmother\u201d of a \u201c14 year old girl\u201d to attempt to set up a meeting with the girl to engage in sexual activity with her. The \u201cmother\u201d and the \u201c14 year old girl\u201d were undercover police officers. When Houston arrived at the rendezvous he arranged with the \u201cmother,\u201d he was arrested. Houston pleaded guilty to using a computer to attempt to persuade, induce, and entice a minor to engage in sexual activity. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">The pre-sentence investigation report calculated Houston\u2019s offense level at 20 with a recommended sentence of imprisonment of 33 to 41 months, but section 2422(b), imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment of five years. Houston argued that the court should apply the \u201csafety valve\u201d to sentence him below the statutory minimum, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a), and an offense level reduction for meeting the five criteria for sentencing below the statutory minimum, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6). The district court overruled Houston\u2019s objections and sentenced him to the statutory minimum of five years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">We review interpretations of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Davis, </em>329 F.3d 1250, 1252 (11th Cir.2003). Houston\u2019s argument that he satisfied all five requirements of the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision of the Sentencing Guidelines fails. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a). The \u201csafety valve\u201d applies to sentences imposed for crimes committed under five enumerated provisions of Title 21 of the U.S.Code. The selection of these five provisions by Congress reflects its intent to exclude all other crimes from this \u201csafety valve.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>200 F.3d 1344, 1348 (11th Cir.2000). Because Houston was not convicted under any of the five enumerated provisions, the \u201csafety valve\u201d does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">Houston also erroneously argues that he should have received a two-level offense reduction, under section 2D1.1(b)(6), and that the failure to apply the two-level reduction renders his sentence unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Houston\u2019s argument fails for two reasons. First, section 2D1.1(b)(6) applies only to drug offenses. Second, <em>Booker </em>did not affect statutory minimums. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">Houston\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b86-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
