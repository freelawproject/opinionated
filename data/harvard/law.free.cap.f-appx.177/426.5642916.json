Walker\u2019s notice of appeal was timely only with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of Walker\u2019s post-judgment motion, which is properly characterized as a motion filed under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b). <em>See Harcon Barge Co., Inc. v. D &amp; G Boat Rentals, Inc., </em>784 F.2d 665, 668-69 (5th Cir.1986) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-22\">Walker maintains that the defendant violated his constitutional rights by forcing him to work while he was incarcerated. This court has explicitly upheld the Texas prison\u2019s practice of requiring inmates to work against the challenge that such a practice amounted to involuntary servitude. <em>Wendt v. Lynaugh, </em>841 F.2d 619, 620-21 (5th Cir.1988); <em>see also Murray v. Mississippi Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>911 F.2d 1167, 1167-68 (5th Cir.1990). Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Walker\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. <em>Carimi v. Royal Carribean Cruise Line, Inc., </em>959 F.2d 1344, 1345 (5th Cir.1992)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-23\">Walker\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it should be dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Walker should be cautioned that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Walker is cautioned that, if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
