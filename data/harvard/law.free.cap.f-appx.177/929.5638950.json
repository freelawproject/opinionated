After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b958-17\">Prior to this case, Brandel-Mena, a native and citizen of Honduras, was convicted in the United States for felony narcotics offenses two times and deported three times. Brandel-Mena\u2019s last deportation occurred in 2003.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In January 2005, Brandel-Mena was arrested in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and pled guilty to a state offense of possession of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-18\">A federal grand jury indicted Brandel-Mena of knowingly and unlawfully reentering the United States, after having been previously removed, without the express consent of the Attorney General, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). The indictment expressly referred to \u00a7 1326(b)(2), which provides that, if an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>alien\u2019s previous removal was \u201csubsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony,\u201d the alien is subject to a maximum of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">At his plea hearing, the district court explained to Brandel-Mena that his indicted offense had a maximum penalty of two years, but that, if the government proved at sentencing that Brandel-Mena had a prior aggravated felony conviction, his maximum sentence could be twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. In response, Brandel-Mena indicated that he understood that, if the government proved his prior convictions, he faced a possible twenty-year sentence. Later in the plea hearing, the district court again asked Brandel-Mena whether he understood the twenty-year maximum penalty if Brandel-Mena had a prior aggravated felony conviction. Brandel-Mena responded that he understood. The district court asked whether Brandel-Mena was hoping either that the court would give him a break at sentencing or that the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and Brandel-Mena agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">The government summarized the factual basis for Brandel-Mena\u2019s guilty plea, including that Brandel-Mena was deported after several felony narcotics convictions. Brandel-Mena\u2019s counsel stipulated to the government\u2019s summary of the facts, but \u201creserve[d] the right to examine and challenge the priors.\u201d The district court then found that the government\u2019s stipulated factual basis was \u201csufficient to constitute the crime of illegal reentry after deportation subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction .... \u201d The district court then asked Brandel-Mena if it was \u201cstill [his] desire to plead guilty as previously announced ...,\u201d to which Brandel-Mena responded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">Also during the plea colloquy, the district court informed Brandel-Mena that, by pleading guilty, he was giving up the right to a trial by jury, to confront witnesses, to compel witnesses and to remain silent. The district court explained that, by pleading guilty, Brandel-Mena would also be giving up any defenses he could have presented at trial. Brandel-Mena acknowledged that he wanted to give up those rights and plead guilty. The district court found that Brandel-Mena voluntarily and intelligently entered his guilty plea and that he understood the nature of the charges against him and the consequences of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) set Brandel-Mena\u2019s base offense level at 8. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. The PSI recommended a sixteen-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), due to his deportation after felony convictions for possession with intent to sell cocaine base and heroin. The PSI noted, among other things, that in 1996 Brandel-Mena was arrested for and pled guilty to possession of cocaine base with intent to sell and that in 1997 he was arrested for and pled guilty to possession of heroin with intent to sell. The PSI recommended a three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. With a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of VI, the PSI\u2019s recommended advisory Guidelines range was 77 to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment. Brandel-Mena did not file written objections to the PSI.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">At the sentencing hearing, Brandel-Mena did not dispute the existence of his prior felony drug convictions or that they were aggravated felonies. He also did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>dispute the factual accuracy of the PSI or object to the PSI\u2019s recommended 16-level Guidelines enhancement based on his prior felony drug convictions. Rather, Brandel-Mena objected solely to the use of his prior felony drug convictions to increase the statutory maximum sentence. The district court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">During allocution, Brandel-Mena apologized for reentering the United States illegally, but stated that he was never informed that it would be illegal to reenter once he was deported. In response, the district court asked Brandel-Mena whether he wished to withdraw his guilty plea, to which he answered that he did not, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-5\">THE COURT: So, Mr. Bonilla, what you are saying maybe could be a defense to this charge. Maybe you want to move to withdraw your plea and we will see what Mr. Ramos has to say. Or maybe you want to think about what you have been saying.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-6\">Let me put the case on recall for a second and give Mr. Bonilla a chance to talk to Mr. Marks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-7\">(Pause.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-8\">MR. MARKS: Thank you, Your Hon- or, for the time to confer with Mr. Bonilla.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-9\">We are prepared to go forward with the sentencing. He does not desire to withdraw\u2014or make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-10\">THE COURT: You understand, Mr. Bonilla, that you could have asked your lawyer to file a motion to withdraw your guilty plea saying that you didn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t come back to this country, and if I granted the motion to withdraw your guilty plea, then we would go to trial on the case, and if you are found not guilty, then that would be the end of the case? If you persist with your guilty plea, you can\u2019t complain later on about not being told that you couldn\u2019t come back to the country. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-13\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-14\">THE COURT: And this is what you want to do, persist with your guilty plea and waive any complaint about not being told that you were not allowed to come back to the country?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-15\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-16\">The district court then sentenced Brandel-Mena to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-17\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AfX\">A. Guilty Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b960-18\">On appeal, Brandel-Mena argues that his guilty plea is invalid because, during the plea colloquy, the district court failed to advise him of his right to persist in pleading not guilty, as required by Rule 11. Because Brandel-Mena raises this issue for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1019 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cTo establish plain error, a defendant must show there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If a defendant meets all three of these conditions, we may exercise our discretion to recognize the error \u201cif the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-19\">A court accepting a guilty plea must comply with Rule 11 and, in particular, address three \u201ccore concerns\u201d by ensuring that: (1) the guilty plea is voluntary; (2) the defendant understands the nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>the charges; and (3) the defendant understands the consequences of his plea. <em>Id. </em>Rule 11 states that the district court, before accepting the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, must advise the defendant in open court of, <em>inter alia, </em>his \u201cright to plead not guilty, or having already so pleaded, to persist in that plea.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(B). Here, the district court did not <em>explicitly </em>inform Brandel-Mena of his right to persist in his not-guilty plea. The government contends that the district court was not required to recite the Rule 11 waiver of rights verbatim and that the district court effectively advised Brandel-Mena of his right to persist in his not-guilty plea during the course of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">We need not resolve this issue because, even assuming there was Rule 11 error that was plain, Brandel-Mena has not shown that the error affected his substantial rights. At a minimum, Brandel-Mena was required to show a \u201c \u2018reasonable probability that, but for the [Rule 11] error, he would not have entered the plea.\u2019\u201d <em>See Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1020 (quoting <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2340, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004)). Brandel-Mena has not alleged, much less shown, that, but for the district court\u2019s omission, he would not have pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Indeed, during the plea colloquy, the district court thoroughly questioned Brandel-Mena about his intention to plead guilty in spite of the requirement that he give up numerous constitutional rights. After the government recited the factual basis for the guilty plea, the district court asked Brandel-Mena whether he still wanted to plead guilty, and Brandel-Mena responded that he did. Moreover, at sentencing, after Brandel-Mena asserted that he had never been told that it would be illegal for him to reenter the United States, Brandel-Mena declined the district court\u2019s invitation to move to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Monroe, </em>353 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining that, when considering whether a Rule 11 error affected a defendant\u2019s substantial rights, \u201cthe reviewing court may consult the whole record\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">B. Prior Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Brandel-Mena argues that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated because the district court increased his statutory maximum sentence based on prior felony drug convictions that were not charged in the indictment or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Brandel-Mena\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 228, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1223, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). As Brandel-Mena candidly acknowledges, the Supreme Court consistently carved out an exception for prior convictions in <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We repeatedly have explained that, despite speculation about the future viability of <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>we are bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>until it is explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>1267, 1272-1276 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246 (11th Cir.2006). Therefore, the district court did not err in using Brandel-Mena\u2019s prior convictions to enhance his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Accordingly, for all of these reasons, we affirm Brandel-Mena\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-9\">. On April 28, 1996, Brandel-Mena was deported after being convicted in Los Angeles, California of possession of cocaine base with intent to sell. On March 3, 1999, he was deported again after being convicted in Los Angeles of possession of heroin with intent to sell. On April 30, 2003, Brandel-Mena was deported after being convicted in North Lauderdale, Florida of lewd and lascivious molestation of a person sixteen years old.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b959-7\">. Because Brandel-Mena did not object to the factual portions of the PSI relating to his prior felony drug convictions, he has admitted those facts. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b960-11\">. Brandel-Mena is also known as William Bonilla, and the district court referred to him as such at the plea hearing and at sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b961-7\">. Because Brandel-Mena timely raised his <em>Apprendi/Booker </em>objection in the district court, we review his claim <em>de novo. See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). We note that Brandel-Mena challenges only the increase in his statutory maximum sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). He does not challenge the 16-level increase in his base offense level (pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i)) that was used in calculating his advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
