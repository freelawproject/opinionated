Medina argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), when it increased his base offense level by nine levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(2)(C), because the facts warranting the increase were not found by a jury and not admitted by him. As the Guidelines were only advisory when Medina was sentenced, the Sixth Amendment was not implicated when the district court increased his base offense level. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 245, 125 S.Ct. 738. Medina\u2019s alternative argument that the district court clearly erred when it applied \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(C)(2) is unavailing. The PSR established that the conspiracy went on for about 40 weeks and that the conspirators produced an average of seven documents a week during the course of the conspiracy, meaning that 280 documents were involved. This, combined with the forensic evidence that 578 names were retrieved from computers, does not support \u201ca definite and firm conviction\u201d that the district court made a mistake when it attributed more than 100 documents to Medina. <em>See United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 248 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. De Jesus-Batres, </em>410 F.3d 154, 164 (5th Cir.2005), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1020, 163 L.Ed.2d 865 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
