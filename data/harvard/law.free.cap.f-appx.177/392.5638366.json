The district court sentenced Diaz-Perez to 77 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-23\">Diaz-Perez first challenges the 16-level sentencing enhancement he received under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), arguing that the district court erred by finding that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The district court correctly found that Diaz-Perez\u2019s prior conviction for burglary of a habitation was a conviction for a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). <em>See United States v. Hornsby, </em>88 F.3d 336, 339 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Diaz-Perez also argues that the district court erred in ordering him to cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample as a condition of supervised release. As Diaz-Perez concedes, this claim is not ripe for review on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 9, 2006) (No. 05-8662). Accordingly, this claim is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">In his final argument, Diaz-Perez contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Diaz-Perez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Diaz-Perez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Diaz-Perez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
