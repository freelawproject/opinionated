On appeal, each defendant argues that the district court erred by denying a minor-role adjustment to his sentence. Castro also challenges his sentence as unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings regarding a defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cSo long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record <em>and </em>does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, we believe that it will be rare for an appellate court to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 945. We review the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). In making our reasonableness review, we consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWe do not apply the reasonableness standard to each individual decision made during the sentencing process; rather, we review the final sentence for reasonableness.\u201d). And our \u201c[rjeview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">The Guidelines provide for a two-level decrease when the defendant is a minor participant in any criminal activity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number><em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A minor participant is defined as \u201cany participant who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3). To determine whether the adjustment applies, a district court first should measure the defendant\u2019s role against the conduct for which he has been held accountable. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 934. With regard to drug couriers, this Court has indicated that its holding in <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>\u201c[did] not create a presumption that drug couriers are never minor or minimal participants, any more than that they are always minor or minimal,\u201d but \u201c[r]ather ... [established] only that the district court must assess all of the facts probative of the defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct in evaluating the defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002). Moreover, also in drug courier cases, \u201cthe amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct\u201d and \u201cmay be dispositive\u2014in and of itself\u2014in the extreme case.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Second, where there is sufficient evidence, a court also may measure the defendant\u2019s conduct against that of other participants in the criminal scheme attributed to the defendant. <em>See id. </em>In making this inquiry, a district court should look to other participants <em>only </em>to the extent that they (1) are identifiable or discernable from the evidence, and (2) were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant. <em>See id. </em>at 944 (stating that \u201c[t]he conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant\u201d). \u201c[W]here the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to [his] actual conduct, [he] cannot prove that [he] is entitled to a minor role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which [he] was a minor participant but for which [he] was not held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of proving his minor role by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Boyd, </em>291 F.3d at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">In the present case, the defendants argue that the district court erred by denying minor-role adjustments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hernandez highlights that he was only the mechanic on the boat and asserts that he was under the command of the boat captain and, therefore, could not be a \u201cmajor player\u201d in the cocaine-smuggling scheme. Similarly, Castro states that he was only a \u201cmule\u201d for more significant participants in a larger conspiracy and that, as a crewman, he was under the control of the boat\u2019s captain. We are unpersuaded by any of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">The record supports the district court\u2019s finding that the relevant conduct attributed to Hernandez and Castro was not minor, and we hold that the district court did not clearly err in denying both defendants a minor-role adjustment. With respect to the first prong of the <em>De Varon </em>analysis, the district court held both defendants accountable only for the possession of 1,580 kilograms of cocaine, which was the amount of cocaine found on the vessel when it was intercepted with the defendants onboard. Moreover, the sheer quantity of drugs is evidence that a minor-role reduction was not warranted. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 943 (noting that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>\u201camount of drugs is a relevant factor and recognizing] that under some circumstances it may be dispositive\u201d). Because they were held responsible only for the amount of cocaine they personally smuggled, which we note was a <em>significant </em>quantity, the defendants\u2019 relevant conduct was sufficient to support the district court\u2019s factual finding that they played essential roles in the importation of 1,580 kilograms of cocaine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Turning to Castro\u2019s reasonableness challenge to his sentence, our inquiry is guided by the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786; <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors take into account</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-5\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-6\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. While a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, such as Castro\u2019s sentence, is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 787-88. The burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">Here, we readily conclude that Castro\u2019s sentence was reasonable. Castro\u2019s concurrent 135-month sentences were at the low end of the Guidelines range <em>and </em>well below the statutory maximum of life imprisonment. At the sentencing hearing, the district court acknowledged the advisory nature of the Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Moreover, our review of the district court\u2019s deliberations reveals consideration of several \u00a7 3553(a) factors, apart from the Guidelines range. <em>See Martinez, </em>434 F.3d at 1322-23 (affirming appellant\u2019s sentence against reasonableness challenge and noting that the district court applied the Guidelines as advisory and its deliberations reflected a consideration of the 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) factors); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (affirming sentence as reasonable and noting that the district court calculated the correct Guidelines range, treated the range as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and imposed a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">As for his claim that the district court did not adequately consider <em>all </em>of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we have held that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s failure to expressly reference each and every one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors does not constitute error under <em>Booker. </em>In any event, at the sentencing hearing, the district court expressly stated that it had considered <em>all </em>of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). Simply put, Castro\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable and is fully supported by the district court\u2019s sentencing considerations and factual findings. Accordingly, we can discern no <em>Booker </em>error in the district court\u2019s sentencing scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-6\">. We have jurisdiction to review the reasonableness of Castro\u2019s sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2006) (rejecting government\u2019s threshold argument that this Court lacks jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) to review a sentence within a correctly-calculated guideline range for reasonableness; concluding that \"a post <em>-Booker </em>appeal based on the 'unreasonableness' of a sentence, whether within or outside the advisory guidelines range, is an appeal asserting that the sentence was imposed in violation of law pursuant to \u00a7 3742(a)(1)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">To the extent the defendants assert a <em>Booker </em>Sixth Amendment violation, we can find no error. It is now well-established that there is no constitutional <em>Booker </em>error when, as here, the district court applied the Guidelines in an advisory fashion. <em>See United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that, when the district court applies the Guidelines in an advisory manner, it does not violate a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Booker </em>by applying extra-verdict enhancements); <em>see also United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir.) (explaining that <em>Booker </em>error \"is not that there were extra-verdict enhancements\u2014enhancements based on facts found by the judge that were not admitted by the defendant or establish by the jury verdict\u2014that led to an increase in the defendant's sentence. The error is that there were extra-verdict enhancements used in a mandatory guidelines system\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b901-6\">. For the first time on appeal, Hernandez also suggests that the district court\u2019s minor-role decision was based, in part, on a disposition to treat Hernandez as a repeat offender even though he had no prior convictions. Simply put, the district court\u2019s reasons for denying the adjustment related solely to Hernandez\u2019s relevant offense conduct. Our review of the sentencing transcript reveals no indication that the district court's imposition of sentence was in any way based on assuming, despite Hernandez's lack of a criminal record, that Hernandez was a repeat offender. Accordingly, we find no plain error on this basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b902-7\">. Given the defendants' failure to carry their burden on the first prong, we need not reach the second <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>prong, but we nevertheless observe that this second principle would also defeat the award of minor-role reductions here. With the possible exception of the boat\u2019s captain, Hernandez\u2019s and Castro\u2019s conduct was <em>identical </em>to that of their codefendants, who were other crew members. It is well-settled that the conduct of others who were involved in the overall scheme of transporting and selling cocaine\u2014the organizers or recruiters or those with an equity interest in the cocaine\u2014is irrelevant to the assessment of the defendants' roles, as they were not charged with a larger conspiracy to import or distribute drugs, and, in any event, the other individuals are not identifiable from the evidence. <em>See DeVaron, </em>175 F.3d at 944.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
