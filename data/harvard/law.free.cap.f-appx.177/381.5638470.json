United </em>States, 523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Saravia contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Saravia properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">Saravia also argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred when it imposed a condition of supervised release that requires him to cooperate in the collection of his DNA. Saravia\u2019s claim is not ripe for review. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1101-02 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 9, 2006) (No. 05-8662). Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to review this claim, and this portion of the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-17\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
