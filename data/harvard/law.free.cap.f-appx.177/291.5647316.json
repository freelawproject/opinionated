We have reviewed the immigration judge\u2019s decision and the administrative record and find the record supports the conclusion that Su failed to establish past persecution or a well founded fear of persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2004) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish his eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). The record does not compel a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-23\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-24\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-19\"> Su has waived any challenge to the denial of withholding from removal and withholding under the Convention Against Torture by not arguing against the denials in her brief. <em>See Yousefi v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 318, 326 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
