To obtain reversal of a decision denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Perez fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"AAu\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-16\"> Perez does not challenge the immigration judge\u2019s denial of withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. Therefore, these claims are waived. <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
