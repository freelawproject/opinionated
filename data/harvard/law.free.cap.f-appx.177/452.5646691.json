He asserts that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level enhancement to his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) because his prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation did not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The district court correctly found that Lopez\u2019s prior conviction for burglary of a habitation was a conviction for a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 457 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-24\">For the first time on appeal, Lopez asserts that the district court\u2019s belief during sentencing that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory, rather than advisory, is reversible error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We review Lopez\u2019s <em>Booker-based </em>challenge for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th. Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). Lopez has failed to establish that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Brin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>gier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317 n. 4 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 264, 163 L.Ed.2d 238 (2005). Therefore, he cannot demonstrate plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Lopez also asserts that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. This constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326 is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Lopez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Lopez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">The judgment of the district court is thus AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
