The petitioners argue that the IJ erred in applying a standard of \u201cphysical mistreatment\u201d or \u201charm\u201d to establish past persecution and in finding that there was no correlation between Saldarriaga\u2019s political activities and the guerrillas. The petitioners further argue that the IJ erred in determining that Saldarriaga could relocate in Colombia and in finding that Saldarriaga was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">We review the IJ\u2019s decision in this case, not the BIA\u2019s, because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, thereby making the IJ\u2019s decision the final agency determination. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)(ii); <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1. (11th Cir.2003). To the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). However, we examine factual findings under the substantial evidence test. <em>Id. </em>at 817-18. Under this highly deferential standard of review, the IJ\u2019s decision must be deferred to if supported by substantial evidence, unless the evidence \u201ccompels\u201d a reasonable factfinder to find otherwise. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815 n. 1, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Therefore, a finding of fact will be reversed \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal.... \u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201c[T]he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">We also review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247 (11th Cir.2006). The trier of fact determines credibility under this test, and this court \u201cmay not substitute its judgment for that of the [IJ] with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">[T]he IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding. Once an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. A credibility determination, like any fact finding, may not be overturned unless the record compels it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1287 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Any alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum, which the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General (\u201cAG\u201d) has discretion to grant if the alien is a \u201crefugee\u201d as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A), as amended by the REAL ID Act \u00a7 101(c), Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 302 (2005); <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). That statute defines a \u201crefugee\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). The asylum applicants carry the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status and thereby establishing asylum eligibility. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a); <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\u201cTo establish asylum eligibility based on political opinion or any other protected ground, the alien must, with credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of her political opinion or any other protected ground, or (2) a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that her political opinion or any other protected ground will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b)). Absent corroborating evidence, the applicant\u2019s testimony, \u201cif credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Neither the INA nor the regulations define \u201cpersecution.\u201d We have stated, however, that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations omitted). To be an act of persecution, the behavior must threaten death, punishment, or the infliction of substantial harm or suffering. <em>See Sharif v. INS, </em>87 F.3d 932, 935 (7th Cir.1996). \u201cThreats alone generally do not constitute actual persecution; only rarely, when they are so immediate and menacing as to cause significant suffering or harm in themselves, do threats per se qualify as persecution.\u201d <em>Vatulev v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 1207, 1210 (10th Cir.2003). \u201cTo qualify as persecution, a person\u2019s experience must rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\u201d <em>Nelson v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 258, 263-64 (1st Cir.2000) (citing various cases regarding past persecution and finding that three episodes of solitary confinement accompanied by physical abuse did not constitute persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">\u201cA showing of past persecution creates a presumption of a \u2018well-founded fear,\u2019 subject to rebuttal by the INS.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (citing 8 C.F.R \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)). If, however, the alien does not establish past persecution, she bears the burden of demonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution by showing that (1) she fears persecution based on her political opinion or other statutorily listed factor; (2) there is a reasonable possibility she will suffer persecution if removed to her native country; and (3) she could not avoid persecution by relocating to another part of her country, if under all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect relocation. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2), (3)(i); <em>see also Mazariegos v. Office of U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1327 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that the petitioner must show that she could not avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>persecution by relocating to another part of her country if it was possible).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">To establish eligibility for withholding of removal under the INA, the alien must show that it is more likely than not that, if she returned to her country, her life or freedom would be threatened because of one of the five covered grounds. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232. Where an applicant fails to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, her other claims for withholding of removal under the INA generally fail. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Here, the record demonstrates that the IJ provided specific, cogent reasons for finding Saldarriaga not credible, specifically listing several facets of Saldarriaga\u2019s story that the IJ found incredible, and which were supported by substantial evidence. Thus, a reasonable factfinder would not be compelled to reach a conclusion different than the IJ. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. In addition, even if Saldarriaga was credible, she was not eligible for asylum because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Saldarriaga neither has suffered past persecution nor has a well-founded fear of future persecution because, while the events that Saldarriaga described may have been unpleasant, they amount more to isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, which is not persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Further, Saldarriaga cannot establish a fear of future persecution because she has not shown that there is a reasonable possibility that she will suffer persecution if removed to Colombia or that she could not avoid persecution by relocating to another part of that country. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2), (3)(i). Because the petitioners failed to establish a claim of asylum, their petition for withholding of removal under the INA also fail, as it requires a more stringent standard to be satisfied. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">For the above-stated reasons, we deny the Petition for Review.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-5\">. The petitioners do not challenge in this court the denial of relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d), and, thus, this issue is abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b50-6\">.
