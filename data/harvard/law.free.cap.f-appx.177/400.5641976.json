California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).

We decline to address any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, without prejudice to Longmire\u2019s right to assert such claims in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Brewster, </em>137 F.3d 853, 859 (5th Cir.1998). Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b428-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
