The district court granted a certificate of appealability on two issues: (1) whether trial counsel was ineffective in failing to obtain and analyze the audiotape of Sprouse\u2019s confession; and (2) whether counsel was ineffective in failing to raise at sentencing an argument under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>In order to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance, a defendant must show that his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that counsel\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Under the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>there is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To satisfy the second prong, the defendant must show that his attorney\u2019s errors altered the outcome of the proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Sprouse claims that counsel was ineffective in failing to obtain and analyze the audiotape of Sprouse\u2019s confession. We have reviewed the materials submitted by the parties, the formal briefs, and the district court\u2019s orders. We find that the district court\u2019s opinion is well reasoned and accordingly find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Sprouse\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Sprouse, </em>Nos. CR-01-51-JHM; CA-04-596-JHM (W.D.Va. filed May 26, 2005; entered May 27, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-15\"> Although he seeks to preserve the issue, Sprouse concedes on appeal that his claim that counsel was ineffective in failing to raise an Apprendi-based argument is non-meritorious.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
