Arthur claims that the use of a prior conviction to increase his sentence violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial because the conviction was not alleged in the indictment, admitted by him, or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. He also claims that his sentence imposed under the advisory guidelines scheme established by <em>United States v. Booker, 543 </em>U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), violated the Due Process and Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States Constitution because he committed his offense prior to <em>Booker </em>and relied on a mandatory guidelines scheme when he pled guilty to the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">First, we reject Arthur\u2019s Sixth Amendment argument challenging the use of his prior conviction to enhance his sentence. Because he properly preserved this constitutional argument, we review this claim <em>de novo, </em>but reverse only for harmful error. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). With regard to <em>Booker </em>constitutional errors, an individual\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial is violated where a judge enhances an individual\u2019s sentence based solely on judicially found facts pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system. <em>Id. </em>at 948. However, a district court does not violate the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted in <em>Booker, </em>when it enhances a defendant\u2019s sentence based on prior convictions. <em>United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1276 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, we have repeatedly upheld the continuing validity of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which allows a district court to use prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence without alleging them in the indictment and proving them beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329; <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005). Accordingly, we find no constitutional <em>Booker </em>error here because Arthur\u2019s sentence was imposed under an advisory guidelines system and the district court was authorized to use his prior conviction to increase his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">Second, we find meritless Arthur\u2019s due process and <em>ex post facto </em>argument, which was raised for the first time on appeal. Because we have held that there are no due process or <em>ex post facto </em>violations based on the retroactive application of <em>Booker' </em>s remedial opinion making the guidelines advisory, <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1306-08 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005), we conclude that no due process or <em>ex post facto </em>violations are implicated in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Arthur\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
