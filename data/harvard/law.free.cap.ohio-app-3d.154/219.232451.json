Young, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">{\u00b6 1} Defendants-appellants, Melissa Krull and Bart Hilt, appeal from their convictions in the Butler County Court of Common Pleas for endangering children.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">{\u00b6 2} On September 12, 2001, Michelle Money, an intake social worker at Butler County Children Services (\u201cBCCS\u201d), received a referral regarding six-year-old C.V. Because the referral was deemed an emergency, Money was escorted to the Krull residence by two Middletown police officers to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-16\">{\u00b6 3} When C.V.\u2019s mother, Melissa Krull, answered the door, Money advised her that they were investigating allegations that her son had marks on him. According to Money, Krull became upset and said that she didn\u2019t abuse her kids, but stated, \u201c[W]e kicked his ass, we kicked his ass good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On further investigation, Money and the police officers observed marks on C.V.\u2019s buttocks. Money described the marks as \u201cslashes going through, side to side, inside of [a] bruised area\u201d that appeared to be raised, along with a mark with blood on his leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">{\u00b6 5} According to Money, Krull stated that C.V. had gotten into trouble at school and Krull had spanked him two to three times with a switch. When C.V. squirmed and laughed at her, she held C.V. down while her boyfriend, appellant Hilt, switched C.V. four to six more times. According to the officers, Hilt told them that he \u201cmay have hit [C.V.] too hard.\u201d Money and the officers removed C.V. from the home and took him to the hospital for an examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">{\u00b6 6} Dr. Martin Dunskee examined C.V. at the hospital. Dr. Dunskee described C.V.\u2019s injuries as linear contusions across the buttocks, upper back, and the back of his legs. He also described abrasion injuries. Dr. Dunskee stated that to break the capillaries, the blows had to be at least moderately hard and that more of a significant blow was necessary to make the contusions. He stated that it was doubtless that the contusions were painful because the strikes were hard enough to break and tear capillaries under the skin. According to Dr. Dunskee, the worst pain would be experienced while getting the bruise, but blood anywhere outside the body is irritating, and the bruises would continue to be painful when moving around. He stated that he generally tells patients to take Motrin or Tylenol for the pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">{\u00b6 7} Appellants were each charged with one count of child endangering with a specification that they caused serious physical harm. They were found guilty of the charges and were sentenced accordingly by the trial court. Appellants separately appealed their convictions and the cases were consolidated on appeal. Appellants\u2019 assignments of error are each discussed individually below.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Melissa Krull\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">{\u00b6 8} On appeal, Krull raises four assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court erred in overruling the Criminal Rule 29 motion where there was no evidence of serious physical harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">Assignment of Error No. 3</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe trial court erred in not permitting the defense expert to testify whether the child was an abused child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Assignment of Error No. 4</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred in excluding the daycare records of [C.V.].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">{\u00b6 13} In her first assignment of error, Krull contends that the trial court erred in denying her Crim.R. 29 motion. When reviewing the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29, this court applies the same test as it would in reviewing a challenge based upon the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction. <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 511, 525, 713 N.E.2d 456. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">{\u00b6 14} Krull argues that her Crim.R. 29 motion should have been granted because the state failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that C.V. suffered serious physical harm. As mentioned above, appellants were charged with child endangering with a specification of serious physical harm. See R.C. 2919.22(E)(2)(d). The Ohio Revised Code defines \u201cserious physical harm\u201d as:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(a) Any mental illness or condition of such gravity as would normally require hospitalization or prolonged psychiatric treatment;</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(b) Any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death;</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(c) Any physical harm that involves some permanent incapacity, whether partial or total, or that involves some temporary, substantial incapacity;</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(d) Any physical harm that involves some permanent disfigurement or that involves some temporary, serious disfigurement;</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(e) Any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.\u201d R.C. 2901.01(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">{\u00b6 20} The state alleged that the evidence was sufficient to establish \u201ctemporary, serious disfigurement\u201d and \u201cacute pain resulting in substantial suffering.\u201d Krull argues that C.V. did not testify that he was in pain. She also argues that while the photographs show bruising, the state\u2019s expert could say only that there was pain at the time of bruising and while the bruise heals, but he did not discuss the extent of pain. She further argues that the doctor\u2019s records do not show that C.V. complained of pain or that the doctor prescribed anything to relieve pain. Krull also argues that the testimony of her medical expert was that the bruises were superficial.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">{\u00b6 21} However, there was also testimony from Money and the police officers that when they investigated two days after the switching, there was extensive bruising on C.V.\u2019s buttocks and legs, some of which involved raised linear marks, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>and a bloody cut. Several photographs were introduced at trial documenting the severity of the bruises. Dr. Dunkee testified at trial and described the extent of C.V.\u2019s injuries and that the bruises would have been painful when inflicted and continued being painful for seven to ten days. He also stated that in this type of case, he would recommend Tylenol or Motrin for the pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">{\u00b6 22} This court has previously found the evidence sufficient to establish serious physical harm where there were bruises around a child\u2019s buttocks and back, described as moderate, purple and red in color, and somewhat raised and swollen, and where the jury had the opportunity to view the photographs of the injuries and determine the extent of the injury. <em>State v. Burdine-Justice </em>(1998), 125 Ohio App.3d 707, 709 N.E.2d 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">{\u00b6 23} We find the evidence in this case, viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, similar to that of <em>Burdine-Justice. </em>Accordingly, we find that the evidence was sufficient to establish the elements of child endangering, including the element of serious physical harm. Evidence was presented that C.V. suffered bruising and marks on his buttocks and thighs that caused pain that likely lasted several days after being inflicted. The bruises were severe enough for Money to remove C.V. from his mother\u2019s care and to take him to the emergency room for an examination. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">{\u00b6 24} In her second assignment of error, appellant contends that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. An appellate court will not reverse a judgment as against the manifest weight of the evidence in a jury trial unless it unanimously disagrees with the fact-finder\u2019s resolution of any conflicting testimony. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 389, 678 N. E.2d 541. The standard for reversal of a verdict that is against the manifest weight of the evidence has been summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe court, reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u201d <em>Thompkins </em>at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. In making this analysis, the reviewing court must be mindful that the original trier of fact was in the best position to judge the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to the evidence. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>{\u00b6 26} Appellant argues that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence for the same reasons expressed in her first assignment of error, that there was insufficient evidence of serious physical harm. We disagree. As mentioned above, there was sufficient evidence which, if believed, could establish serious physical harm. Furthermore, the jury not only heard the testimony of the witnesses regarding C.V.\u2019s injuries, but also had the opportunity to view the photographs and to see the extent of the injury. Thus, we cannot say that the jury clearly lost their way in determining that serious physical harm existed in this case. Krull\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">{\u00b6 27} In her third assignment of error, Krull contends that the trial court erred in not permitting her expert witness to testify regarding whether C.V. was an abused child. Krull argues that, pursuant to Evid.R. 704, an expert is permitted to testify on an ultimate issue to be determined by the fact-finder, but her expert was prohibited from testifying that C.V. was not an abused child.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">{\u00b6 28} It is well established that the admission or exclusion of evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Robb </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 59, 68, 723 N.E.2d 1019. Absent an abuse of discretion, an appellate court will not disturb a ruling by a trial court as to the admissibility of evidence. <em>State v. Martin </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 122, 129, 19 OBR 330, 483 N.E.2d 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">{\u00b6 29} Evid.R. 704 provides: \u201cTestimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable solely because it embraces an issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d The Staff Notes to Evid.R. 704 state that the rule does not necessarily \u201cmake opinion evidence on the ultimate issue admissible; it merely provides that opinion evidence on an ultimate issue is not excludable per se.\u201d The rule is to be read in conjunction with Evid.R. 701 and 702, each of which requires opinion testimony to help or assist the trier of fact in the determination of a factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">{\u00b6 30} In this case, Krull and Hilt were each represented by their own attorneys and jointly presented the testimony of Dr. Robert Lerer. Defense counsel for Hilt asked Dr. Lerer, \u201c[D]o you have an opinion based upon reasonable medical certainty as to whether or not this amounts to child abuse?\u201d The trial court sustained an objection to the question. During a sidebar conference on this issue, the trial court stated that the question went to the ultimate issue in the case, whether appellants\u2019 acts constituted child abuse. The trial court explained that there may be different definitions of child abuse from a medical and legal standpoint and that it would be charging the jury on the legal definition and did not want confusion regarding the standard. The trial court stated that a proper foundation had not been laid to establish whether the physician\u2019s opinion was based on a medical or legal definition of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>{\u00b6 31} Krull\u2019s counsel stated that it doesn\u2019t matter whether the opinion goes to the ultimate issue, but that she had no problem with requiring that a foundation be laid. The trial court stated that Hilt\u2019s counsel needed to lay more of a foundation regarding the difference between a medical diagnosis of an abused child and a legal definition of what constitutes child abuse in the state of Ohio. The trial court then stated, \u201c[I]f you can say, Doctor, if you assume the legal definition of abuse is this and your medical opinion, I might permit that, but that was not the question and we have an improper foundation at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">{\u00b6 32} Counsel for Hilt then asked a series of questions relating to child abuse but failed to lay a foundation establishing whether the doctor was assuming a medical or legal definition of abuse. Krull\u2019s counsel then questioned the doctor and asked questions regarding the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 criteria for diagnosing abuse. However, she did not ask any further questions regarding the legal definition of abuse or whether the facts of this case would amount to a diagnosis of abuse under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">{\u00b6 33} Thus, we find that the trial court did not err in sustaining objections to Dr. Lerer\u2019s opinion on whether C.V. was an abused child. At the point the question was asked, an insufficient foundation had been laid. As mentioned above, although an opinion on the ultimate issue in a case may be admissible, the rule does not necessarily make opinion evidence on the ultimate issue admissible. Instead, it merely provides that opinion evidence on an ultimate issue is not excludable per se. The evidence must first be \u201cotherwise admissible.\u201d Evid.R. 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">{\u00b6 34} The trial court did not err by sustaining the objection on the basis that the evidence was not admissible because a proper foundation had not been laid. After sustaining the objection on this basis, neither defense counsel attempted to ask the question again after laying the proper foundation. Thus, we find no merit to Krull\u2019s argument that she was prohibited from asking Dr. Lerer whether the punishment in this case constituted child abuse. Krull\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">{\u00b6 35} In her fourth assignment of error, Krull contends that the trial court erred in excluding C.V.\u2019s daycare records. According to Krull\u2019s brief, the trial court \u201cgranted the State\u2019s motion in limine to exclude the daycare records as the child\u2019s conduct goes to his character.\u201d However, while a review of the record in this case reveals a motion to exclude the records on this basis, we find no evidence in the record regarding the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion, nor has Krull provided any reference to where in the record the motion in limine was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>{\u00b6 36} On the other hand, the state incorrectly states in its brief that the records were never proffered to the trial court, while, in fact, they were submitted with a discovery response and were the subject of the state\u2019s motion in limine to exclude them from trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">{\u00b6 37} An order granting or denying a motion in limine is a tentative, preliminary, or presumptive ruling about an evidentiary issue that is anticipated. An appellate court need not review the propriety of such an order unless the claimed error is preserved by a timely objection when the issue is actually reached during the trial. <em>State v. White </em>(1982), 6 Ohio App.3d 1, 4, 6 OBR 23, 451 N.E.2d 533. A motion in limine, if granted, \u201cis a tentative, interlocutory, precautionary ruling by the trial court reflecting its anticipatory treatment of the evidentiary issue.\u201d <em>State v. Grubb </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 199, 201-202, 28 OBR 285, 503 N.E.2d 142. The granting of a motion in limine, in and of itself, does not preserve the record on appeal. Id., 28 OBR 285, 503 N.E.2d 142. An appellate court need not review the propriety of such an order unless the claimed error is preserved by a timely objection when the issue is actually reached at trial. Id., citing <em>White, </em>6 Ohio App.3d at 4, 6 OBR 23, 451 N.E.2d 533. The wisdom of this requirement is apparent from the confusion evident in the facts discussed above. Since no proffer of the daycare records was made at trial, there is no evidence that they were excluded, nor is there any rationale by the trial court for excluding the evidence available for this court to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">{\u00b6 38} Thus, assuming that the trial court granted the state\u2019s motion in limine before trial as asserted in Krull\u2019s brief, the failure to proffer this evidence and renew her objection to the trial court\u2019s ruling on the state\u2019s motion in limine waived any error except plain error. See <em>Grubb, </em>at 203, 28 OBR 285, 503 N.E.2d 142; Evid.R. 103(A). An alleged error does not constitute plain error unless, but for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise. <em>State v. Stojetz </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 452, 455, 705 N.E.2d 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">{\u00b6 39} Only one of C.V.\u2019s daycare records, an incident report regarding his actions on the day he was suspended, was offered at trial. The trial court allowed this record and testimony from daycare workers and Hilt regarding the events surrounding the suspension. Furthermore, the trial court also allowed testimony from Hilt regarding C.V.\u2019s repeated disciplinary problems at school. Hilt testified that he and Krull received frequent reports on disciplinary problems with C.V. from the daycare and had to pick him up because of uncontrollable behavior on several occasions. He testified that C.V. had been disciplined for attacking students and teachers, hitting, kicking, pinching, and spitting in teachers\u2019 faces. This is the type of evidence that the daycare records contained. Thus, given the fact that the jury heard that C.V. was a disciplinary problem at daycare, we cannot say that the result of trial would have been different had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>records themselves been admitted. Krull\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Appellant Bart Hilt\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">{\u00b6 40} Appellant, Bart Hilt, raises three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cThe trial court erred by making the finding of serious physical harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cThe trial court erred by giving an improper jury charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">Assignment of Error No. 3</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cThe trial attorney was constitutionally ineffective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">{\u00b6 44} In his first assignment of error, Hilt argues that his conviction violates the constitutional requirement that the jury decide every element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt, as determined by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">{\u00b6 45} In <em>Apprendi, </em>the defendant pled guilty to firearm possession charges as part of a plea agreement. The trial court then separately determined that the crime was committed with the purpose to intimidate because of race pursuant to the state\u2019s hate-crime statute. The finding by the trial court elevated the penalty from five to 10 years to a period of 10 to 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">{\u00b6 46} The Supreme Court found that \u201cit is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed. It is equally clear that such facts must be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-15\">{\u00b6 47} In this case, appellant argues that the jury were not charged on the issue of determining whether serious physical harm was present. Under Ohio law, if child endangering causes serious physical harm, the penalty is increased from a first-degree misdemeanor to a second-degree felony. See R.C. 2919.22(E)(2)(a) and 2919.22(E)(2)(d). Appellant argues that the jury were not instructed and did not make a finding on whether serious physical harm occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-16\">{\u00b6 48} However, reading the jury instructions as a whole, it is evident that the jury were charged that they should determine whether serious physical harm occurred. The trial court instructed the jury that they must evaluate the physical harm to the child. The trial court initially instructed that to find Hilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>guilty, the jury must find that he \u201crecklessly abused a child which created a substantial risk of serious physical harm.\u201d The trial court defined the concept of \u201cserious physical harm\u201d to the jury. The trial court then explained to the jury that if they did not find Hilt guilty as charged in the indictment, then they must consider the lesser included offense, also defined as child endangering. The trial court then explained that \u201cthe primary offense of endangering children is distinguished from the lesser offense by the absence or failure to <em>prove the harm caused was serious physical harm as defined to you.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The verdict forms given to the jury were labeled as \u201cVerdict-Count One\u201d and \u201cVerdict-Count One \u2014 Lesser Offense.\u201d The jury signed and returned the forms for the greater offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">{\u00b6 49} Thus, we find that the facts of this case are distinguishable from <em>Apprendi, </em>since the jury, not the trial court, made the determination that serious physical harm existed, increasing appellant\u2019s possible sentence. See <em>State v. Elkins, </em>148 Ohio App.3d 370, 2002-Ohio-2914, 773 N.E.2d 593 <em>(Apprendi </em>not violated where jury determined that offender possessed at least 100 times the bulk amount of illegal substance, thus qualifying him for major drug-offender status and increased penalty). Hilt\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">{\u00b6 50} In his second assignment of error, Hilt contends that the trial court erred in giving a jury instruction that the court, not the jury, should assess the appropriateness of the corporal discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">{\u00b6 51} Defense counsel requested an instruction informing the jury of the reasonableness of Hilt\u2019s actions as corporal punishment. Counsel requested an instruction from language in <em>State v. Ivey </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 249, 258, 648 N.E.2d 519, which states, \u201cIn making the determination of abuse, the trial court must look at the circumstances giving rise to the harm to the child, the disciplinary measures employed by the parent, the child\u2019s past history and any other potential relevant factors.\u201d The trial court incorporated the requested instruction into the jury instructions. However, the trial court did not change the language to reflect that the jury, as the trier of fact, should determine whether the corporal punishment was reasonable. See <em>State v. Burdine-Justice </em>(1998), 125 Ohio App.3d 707, 713, 709 N.E.2d 551 (\u201ctrier of fact\u201d must consider the circumstances in relation to the disciplinary measures).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">{If 52} Hilt did not object to the jury instruction after it was read. Therefore, we review this assignment of error under a plain-error analysis. To constitute plain error, it must appear from the record that an error occurred and that except for that error the outcome of the trial would have been different. <em>State v. Williford </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 247, 252, 551 N.E.2d 1279. Moreover, a single jury instruction \u201c \u2018may not be judged in artificial isolation but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Taylor, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 27, 2002-Ohio-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>7017, 781 N.E.2d 72, at \u00b6 75, quoting <em>State v. Price </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 136, 14 O.O.3d 379, 398 N.E.2d 772, paragraph four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">{\u00b6 53} In this case, the trial court used the words \u201ctrial court\u201d instead of \u201ctrier of fact.\u201d However, viewing the instructions as a whole, we find that the mistake did not rise to the level of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">{\u00b6 54} With regard to the language surrounding the instruction at issue, the context makes it apparent that this consideration is part of the jury\u2019s determination of whether abuse occurred. In its instructions, the trial court carefully explained the nature of the charge against appellants. The trial court then defined several terms, including \u201cabuse,\u201d that it instructed the jury to use in determining whether appellants were guilty of the offenses charged. The trial court then instructed the jury with the language Hilt now objects to as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cIn making the determination of abuse, the trial court must look at the circumstances giving rise to the harm to the child, the disciplinary measures employed by the parent, the child\u2019s past history, and any other potential relevant factors. Of importance in evaluating the physical harm to a child is whether the nature of the physical harm is warranted based upon the underlying circumstances. Clearly, parents are entitled to utilize disciplinary measures for their children, however, such discipline must not be of such gravity that it becomes unreasonable in light of the underlying cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">{\u00b6 56} Viewing the error in light of the instructions as a whole, we find that the jury instructions did not mislead the jury in a manner that would amount to plain error. They were instructed that one of the elements they must determine was whether abuse occurred. The above instruction further defined elements for the jury to consider in making their determination of whether abuse occurred. Furthermore, where necessary in the instructions, the trial court explicitly stated in clear and uncertain language certain things that the jury should <em>not </em>consider in making their determination. We find that the instructions as a whole did not rise to the level of plain error as they adequately informed the jury that they should consider the circumstances and other factors surrounding the corporal punishment in determining whether abuse occurred. Hilt\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">{\u00b6 57} In his third assignment of error, Hilt contends that his trial counsel was ineffective. To decide Hilt\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we must apply the two-tier test of <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. First, Hilt must show that counsel\u2019s actions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance. Second, Hilt must show that he was prejudiced as a result of counsel\u2019s actions. Id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Prejudice will not be found unless Hilt demonstrates that there is a reasonable possibility that, if not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>would have been different. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 143, 538 N.E.2d 373, certiorari denied (1990), 497 U.S. 1011, 110 S.Ct. 3258, 111 L.Ed.2d 768. A strong presumption exists that licensed attorneys are competent and that the challenged action is the product of a sound trial strategy and falls within the wide range of professional assistance. Id. at 142, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">{\u00b6 58} Hilt argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the <em>Apprendi </em>violation in his first assignment of error and for failing to object to the jury instruction in his second assignment of error. As mentioned above, the facts of this case did not violate <em>Apprendi. </em>In addition, we found in Hilt\u2019s second assignment of error that the mistake in jury instructions was not prejudicial. Accordingly, Hilt\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b259-6\">Valen, P.J., and Walsh, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
