Painter, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">{\u00b6 1} We reverse defendant-appellant Thomas Duncan\u2019s convictions for murder, felony murder, and voluntary manslaughter, due to erroneous jury instructions by a visiting trial judge. The judge mistakenly told the jury that it could find Duncan guilty on both murder counts, in addition to the voluntary-manslaughter count, for causing the death of Raciel \u201cChubby\u201d Baldwin. The jury returned three guilty verdicts that included a firearm specification for each count. Duncan was sentenced for the murder count. The state concedes that this was an error.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">{\u00b6 2} Because voluntary manslaughter is an inferior degree of murder, the verdicts are inconsistent \u2014 Duncan stands convicted of two inconsistent forms of homicide. We have no way of knowing how the jury would have found had it been properly instructed. We must therefore reverse all three of Duncan\u2019s convictions and remand this case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>\n<em>I. Shooting at the Peppermint Lounge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">{\u00b6 3} On the evening of December 21, 2000, Raciel \u201cChubby\u201d Baldwin went to the Peppermint Lounge in Lincoln Heights with his girlfriend, Glenys Cantrell, Cantrell\u2019s friend, Regina McFinley, and McFinley\u2019s boyfriend, Jermaine Broach, to celebrate McFinley\u2019s birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">{\u00b6 4} Cantrell testified that while they were in the Peppermint Lounge, Baldwin became agitated. Baldwin took his jacket and watch off and walked over to the other side of the bar to confront a man named Derrick \u201cDirty\u201d Minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">{\u00b6 5} The state introduced evidence suggesting that there was \u201cbad blood\u201d between Baldwin and Minor. About eight months before the incident at the Peppermint Lounge, Baldwin had filed a complaint with the police stating that Minor had hit him in the mouth and fired two guns at him. Minor had been indicted on a charge of felonious assault, but the charge was dismissed for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">{\u00b6 6} According to James Clark, a patron in the Peppermint Lounge that evening, Baldwin and several friends attacked Minor and his friend Duncan (nicknamed \u201cBall\u201d). Clark testified that Baldwin and his friends grabbed Minor first and were \u201cgetting him pretty good,\u201d with Minor unable to do anything. Clark testified that Duncan was also attacked, with several men holding Duncan and several men punching him.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">{\u00b6 7} Cantrell testified that after the fight, a number of people took Minor out the front door of the lounge. Cantrell found Baldwin, who was still inside the lounge, demanded that they leave, and began pulling Baldwin toward the back door. McFinley testified that she helped Cantrell push Baldwin, who was still \u201cranting and raving,\u201d toward the back door, and that it took them about three or four minutes to get out of the lounge. The back door of the lounge led into a well-lighted parking lot, where both Cantrell and McFinley had parked their vehicles earlier in the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">{\u00b6 8} Cantrell testified that as they stepped out the back door and into the parking lot they saw that to their left were several men standing near a car, one of them waving a gun. Baldwin and the men began exchanging words. Cantrell remembered the men saying \u201cthat\u2019s him\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re going to get him.\u201d She testified that Baldwin said that he was not afraid to die. McFinley testified that Baldwin was arguing and screaming, \u201cI\u2019m not scared of nobody, I\u2019m not scared of no bullets,\u201d and challenging the men to put the gun down and fight without it.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">{\u00b6 9} Cantrell testified that McFinley\u2019s boyfriend, Broach, was over by the men with the gun, wrestling with them and screaming, \u201cIt ain\u2019t worth it, it ain\u2019t worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>{\u00b6 10} Cantrell testified that she pulled Baldwin across the parking lot and toward the safety of their van. As she tried to get her key in the door of the van, she heard a gunshot. She saw Baldwin twitch and then collapse on the ground. Dr. Daniel Lawrence, a deputy coroner for Hamilton County, later testified that Baldwin had died from a gunshot wound to his head that penetrated his skull and brain, a wound that Baldwin would not have survived even with immediate medical attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">{\u00b6 11} Likewise, McFinley testified that she and Cantrell had struggled to get Baldwin across the parking lot and to the van. She testified that as she stood by the van with Baldwin, urging him to get in, she looked back at the men and saw one of them pull a gun out of his pocket. She turned back to Baldwin and said, \u201cChubby, get in the van before they start shooting.\u201d As soon as she spoke, she heard about six gunshots. When the shooting stopped, she heard Cantrell screaming and crying and saw Baldwin lying on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">{\u00b6 12} Clark testified that after the fight inside the lounge had ended, he followed some of the crowd out the back door and into the parking lot. To his left he saw the men whom Baldwin attacked in the bar \u2014 Minor and Duncan. The men were visibly upset, and Broach was trying to calm them down. Clark testified that Baldwin had several people trying to pull him back to his vehicle but that Baldwin continued to yell at Minor and Duncan that he was not scared of a gun. Clark testified that Duncan held up a gun and fired six or seven shots in rapid succession and that Baldwin fell on the ground. According to Clark, Minor and Duncan quietly and calmly got in their car and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">{\u00b6 13} Cantrell and McFinley both testified that after going to the hospital and learning that Baldwin had died, they went to the Lincoln Heights police station and each gave a description of the shooter. Several weeks later, both Cantrell and McFinley independently picked Duncan out of a photo array as the man who had shot Baldwin. At trial, both identified Duncan as the shooter outside the Peppermint Lounge.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">{\u00b6 14} In addition to the three eyewitnesses who testified that Duncan had shot Baldwin, the state offered the testimony of James Krueger. Krueger was an inmate in the Hamilton County Justice Center along with Duncan for about three weeks after Duncan was arrested in connection with Baldwin\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">{\u00b6 15} Krueger testified that he and Duncan had discussed Duncan\u2019s case on many occasions. Krueger testified that Duncan had told him that while at the Peppermint Lounge, Duncan\u2019s friend was \u201cjumped\u201d and that the friend received a bloody lip and got a tooth knocked out. According to Krueger, Duncan said that he was enraged and \u201cwent outside towards closing time, waited in a vehicle, waited for this person to come out, and shot him in the head.\u201d Krueger also testified that Duncan had said that he planned on using a false alibi defense in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>trial and that he was going to get his brother, sister-in-law, and mother to testify that he was babysitting on the night of the shooting. On cross-examination, Krueger admitted that prior to meeting Duncan, he had once been an informant for the state while incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">{\u00b6 16} The defense offered the testimony of Willie Ray Jones, who was incarcerated with Krueger and Duncan. Jones testified that Krueger had approached him about becoming an informant in the state\u2019s case against Duncan, saying that it had worked for him in the past to gain consideration and that it could help Jones too. Krueger showed Jones notes that he had been making of his conversations with Duncan, but, according to Jones, the notes were not accurate, and Jones decided not to get involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">{\u00b6 17} Duncan\u2019s uncle, Paul Bean, called as a witness <em>by the court, </em>testified that a month or two after the incident at the Peppermint Lounge, his sister, Duncan\u2019s mother, called him and expressed concern about Duncan\u2019s activities and wanted Bean\u2019s help in turning him in to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">{\u00b6 18} Bean knew a Cincinnati police officer, Eric Dunn, so he contacted Dunn and asked for Dunn\u2019s help in turning in his nephew. Bean denied telling Dunn that Duncan\u2019s mother had told him that Duncan had told her that he had been involved in a shooting in Lincoln Heights. Bean denied ever mentioning a homicide in Lincoln Heights to Officer Dunn, denied ever talking personally to his nephew, and asserted that all of his knowledge concerning Duncan came only from Duncan\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">{\u00b6 19} Bean stated that he had testified at Duncan\u2019s grand-jury hearing, after spending one day in jail for refusing to testify. Bean claimed that he did not remember his specific testimony at the grand-jury hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">{\u00b6 20} To refresh his memory, the state read to Bean his previous testimony at the grand-jury hearing. The state read, \u201cThe question \u2014 the first question was: \u2018But did he\u2019 \u2014 that being Thomas \u2014 \u2018did he tell you something?\u2019 \u201d The state then read Bean\u2019s response: \u201cNo, Thomas didn\u2019t tell me nothing.\u201d After further prompting at the grand-jury hearing, Bean changed his answer to the question, \u201c[D]id [Thomas] tell you something?\u201d stating, \u201cThat he was there.\u201d The state at the grand-jury hearing then asked Bean, \u201cSo he told you, your nephew Thomas, who also goes by Ball, told you that he was there when this murder happened?\u201d Bean responded, \u201cNo, he told me he was up there and the guys were Dirty \u2014 .\u201d After hearing his grand-jury testimony read to him, Bean continued to claim that he did not remember making the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">{\u00b6 21} The state then offered the testimony of Officer Dunn. Dunn testified that Bean had called him and asked to speak with him. At their meeting, Bean told Dunn that he had some information about the shooting in \u201cthe Heights,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>that his nephew, Ball, was involved in a shooting at the Peppermint Lounge. According to Dunn, Bean expressed concern for his nephew. . Dunn testified, \u201cHis concern was that his nephew was running with the wrong crowd, that he was concerned that if he didn\u2019t turn his nephew into someone like myself, that his nephew would end up being hurt or killed, because of the situation at the Peppermint Lounge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">{\u00b6 22} The defense objected to the admissibility of Dunn\u2019s testimony. After the state\u2019s questioning of Dunn and before cross-examination, the court stated the following: \u201cThe Court is going to give the jury a cautionary instruction at this time. The testimony of Officer Dunn has not been given for the truth of the matter asserted, but only to show and explain his subsequent investigative activities with regard to the information which he received.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">{\u00b6 23} Finally, in his defense, Duncan offered the testimony of his brother, Curtis Duncan, his brother\u2019s girlfriend, Lolita Harris, and his mother, Ellen Duncan. All three testified that Duncan had babysat for his brother and his girlfriend\u2019s children on the night of the shooting at the Peppermint Lounge. Duncan himself testified that he was babysitting that night. Also in his testimony, Duncan denied that he was a friend of Minor and stated that he never went to bars.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\n<em>II. Erroneous Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">{\u00b6 24} In his first assignment of error, Duncan argues that the trial court erred by convicting and sentencing him for murder after the jury had found him guilty of voluntary manslaughter for the same killing. Duncan is correct. A person cannot be convicted of both murder and voluntary manslaughter for the same killing. The state concedes this error. The more difficult question is what the remedy should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">{\u00b6 25} Duncan was indicted for three separate crimes arising from the death of Baldwin: murder, felony murder, and voluntary manslaughter. Murder occurs when a person purposely causes the death of another, while felony murder occurs when a person causes the death of another as a proximate result of committing or attempting to commit a violent felony of the first or second degree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Voluntary manslaughter occurs when a person knowingly causes the death of another \u201cwhile under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage, either of which is brought on by serious provocation occasioned by the victim that is reasonably sufficient to incite the person into using deadly force.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>{\u00b6 26} A particular offense can have various lesser offenses associated with it. The Ohio Supreme Court has articulated the distinction between an inferior-degree offense and a lesser-included offense. \u201c[A]n offense is an \u2018inferior degree\u2019 of the indicted offense where its elements are <em>identical </em>to or contained within the indicted offense, except for one or more additional mitigating elements which will generally be presented in the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In contrast, \u201c[a]n offense may be a lesser included offense of another if (i) the offense carries a lesser penalty than the other; (ii) the greater offense cannot, as statutorily defined, ever be committed without the lesser offense, as statutorily defined, also being committed; and (iii) some element of the greater offense is not required to prove the commission of the lesser offense.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">{\u00b6 27} From a comparison of the statutory definitions of murder and voluntary manslaughter, it is clear that voluntary manslaughter is an offense of inferior degree to murder, and not a lesser-included offense of murder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201c[vjoluntary manslaughter is, by our prior definition, an inferior degree of murder.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court has also held that, under the voluntary-manslaughter statute, \u201cthe jury must find a defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter rather than murder if the prosecution has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant knowingly caused the victim\u2019s death, and if the defendant has established by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of one or both of the mitigating circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">{\u00b6 28} Despite this clear declaration from the Ohio Supreme Court that a jury cannot find a defendant guilty of both murder and voluntary manslaughter, the transcript of Duncan\u2019s trial reveals that the trial court, as well as both the prosecutor and the defense, from voir dire through sentencing, mistakenly believed that the jury could return guilty verdicts on all three charges. In its jury instructions, the court stated, \u201cThe charges set forth in each count of the indictment constitute a separate and distinct matter. You must consider each count and the evidence applicable to each count separately, and you must state your findings as_to each count uninfluenced by your verdict as to any other count. The defendant may be found guilty or not guilty of any one or all of the offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>that are charged.\u201d That is a proper charge in some circumstances, but not in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">{\u00b6 29} Had the jury been properly instructed, it would have been told that Duncan could be convicted <em>either </em>of murder or voluntary manslaughter. The Ohio Jury Instructions recommend that a jury be told that if it finds that a defendant has committed murder but also finds that the defendant acted while under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage provoked by the victim, \u201cthen you must find the defendant not guilty of murder and guilty of voluntary manslaughter.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That instruction should have been given in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">{\u00b6 80} Because the jury found Duncan guilty of voluntary manslaughter, it apparently believed that Duncan had knowingly caused the death of Baldwin but also that Duncan was either under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage provoked by Baldwin. Having found that the mitigating circumstance of provocation existed, the jury should not have found Duncan guilty of murder. Therefore, it was clear error that Duncan was convicted and sentenced for both murder and voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">{\u00b6 31} Though the defense did not object to the jury instructions during the trial, the state concedes that the erroneous instruction was plain error. The state also agrees that the error was prejudicial to Duncan, requiring a reversal of his convictions and a new trial. The question then becomes what should be at issue in a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">{\u00b6 32} The state argues that Duncan should receive a new trial, once again facing all three charges. Duncan argues that he should receive a new trial on only the voluntary-manslaughter charge because the jury made a finding of fact that the voluntary-manslaughter mitigating circumstance existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">{\u00b6 33} While Duncan asserts that the state cannot retry him on the murder charge, he makes no supporting legal argument and cites no cases in his brief. In oral argument, his attorney said that to allow a new trial on all three charges would allow the state \u201canother bite at the apple.\u201d We interpret this to mean that Duncan believes that double jeopardy or collateral estoppel bars his retrial on the murder charge, and we will analyze the issue accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">\n<em>III. Double Jeopardy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">{\u00b6 34} Double jeopardy is prohibited by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It states, \u201cNo person shall * * * be subject for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d Double jeopardy has been made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">{\u00b6 35} Double jeopardy provides three separate protections for criminal defendants. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after an acquittal, against prosecution for the same offense after a conviction, and against multiple punishments for the same offense.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">{\u00b6 36} But double jeopardy is not an absolute bar to successive trials. The general rule is that a person can be tried a second time for an offense when his prior conviction for that same offense has been set aside in his appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This concept rests on the notion \u201cthat the original conviction has, at the defendant\u2019s behest, been wholly nullified and the slate wiped clean.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition, in such cases, society\u2019s interest in punishing criminals outweighs the defendant\u2019s interest in avoiding further prosecution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">{\u00b6 37} But there is one exception to the rule that permits retrial after a defendant\u2019s successful appeal. It is that double jeopardy bars a retrial when a conviction is reversed due to insufficient evidence presented at the first trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The reasoning is that the appellate court\u2019s reversal of a conviction for insufficient evidence is the functional equivalent of a verdict of acquittal and thus bars reprosecution for the same offense.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In such a case, the government had a fair opportunity but failed to develop a case that warranted submission to a jury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">{\u00b6 38} But the general rule remains that when the defendant\u2019s conviction has been set aside because of an <em>error in the proceedings </em>leading to the conviction, double jeopardy does not bar a retrial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In making the exception to the rule, the Supreme Court noted, \u201c[RJeversal for trial error, as distinguished from evidentia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ry insufficiency, does not constitute a decision to the effect that the government has failed to prove its case. As such, it implies nothing with respect to the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Rather, it is a determination that a defendant has been convicted through a judicial process which is defective in some fundamental respect, e.g., incorrect receipt or rejection of evidence, <em>incorrect instructions, </em>or prosecutorial misconduct. When this occurs, the accused has a strong interest in obtaining a fair readjudication of his guilt free from error, just as society maintains a valid concern for insuring that the guilty are punished.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">{\u00b6 39} In <em>Forman v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the defendant was convicted for conspiring to evade income taxes. After his conviction, but before his appeal, the Supreme Court issued a decision that rendered the jury instructions in Forman\u2019s original trial defective. The appellate court reversed Forman\u2019s conviction and remanded the case with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal. On rehearing, the appellate court modified its original order for acquittal and entered one directing a new trial. The Supreme Court upheld the appellate court\u2019s order for a new trial, ruling that Foreman was not put in double jeopardy. The Supreme Court held that the appellate court did not lose its power to amend its decision on rehearing and that it could order a new trial because of an improper instruction with no violation of double jeopardy.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">{\u00b6 40} Similarly, in <em>United States v. Miller</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the defendants\u2019 convictions were reversed on appeal due to an intervening Supreme Court decision rendering the indictment and the jury instructions invalid. The defendants sought dismissal of the new indictment on double-jeopardy grounds. Citing <em>Forman </em>and other Supreme Court decisions holding that reversals based on \u201cmere trial errors\u201d do not invoke the principles of double jeopardy, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that double jeopardy did not bar a retrial.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The court stated, \u201cSince reversal is based on defects in the indictment and jury instructions rather than on insufficiency of the evidence, there is no apparent obstacle to retrial.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">{\u00b6 41} There are numerous other instances of courts reversing a conviction due to trial error and remanding for a retrial, despite the defendant\u2019s claim that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>retrial would violate double jeopardy. For example, double jeopardy has not barred a retrial due to prosecutorial misconduct,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> defects in the charging instrument,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> or a confession coerced by the trial judge.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">{\u00b6 42} Turning to the particulars of Duncan\u2019s case, we note that the reason we are reversing Duncan\u2019s convictions is that the trial court gave erroneous jury instructions. Our reversal is clearly based on trial error and in no way due to insufficiency of the evidence. Therefore, we hold that it would not violate double jeopardy for the state to retry Duncan for murder in his new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">{\u00b6 43} We note one other possible exception to the rule that allows a retrial after a reversed conviction. In <em>Green v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court held that when a defendant is convicted of a lesser offense included in that charged in the original indictment, he can be retried only for the offense on which he was convicted, and not for the charged offense. Similar to a reversal due to insufficient evidence, the lack of a conviction on the greater charge is an implicit acquittal, meaning that double jeopardy prevents a retrial on the greater charge.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">{\u00b6 44} But this exception does not help Duncan, because Duncan was actually <em>convicted </em>of both murder and voluntary manslaughter. Therefore, he has no ground to argue that he received an implicit acquittal on the murder charge merely because he was convicted of voluntary manslaughter. Under the instructions given by the trial court, the jury could have acquitted Duncan of murder and found him guilty of voluntary manslaughter, but it chose instead to find Duncan guilty of both.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">{\u00b6 45} In addition, we note that the exception pertains only to a \u201clesser offense included in that charged.\u201d A lesser-included offense is distinguishable from an inferior-degree offense. Because voluntary manslaughter is an inferior-degree offense of murder, and not a lesser-included offense, this exception does not apply to Duncan\u2019s case. Therefore, it is proper for him to be retried for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>{\u00b6 46} We have determined that the prohibition against double jeopardy fails to prevent the state from retrying Duncan for murder. If Duncan is also arguing that collateral estoppel bars his retrial for murder, that argument also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\n<em>IV. Collateral Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">{\u00b6 47} Collateral estoppel is the doctrine that recognizes that a determination of facts litigated between two parties in a proceeding is binding on those parties in all future proceedings.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Collateral estoppel \u201c \u2018means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">{\u00b6 48} Duncan\u2019s argument is that the jury made a finding of fact that the mitigating factor existed \u2014 that Baldwin had provoked Duncan to act under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage with deadly force. Under this argument, as an issue of ultimate fact litigated between the state and Duncan, the issue of provocation could not be relitigated. Duncan argues that if the issue of provocation could not be relitigated because it had already been found to exist, Duncan cannot be convicted of murder and, therefore, cannot be retried for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">{\u00b6 49} The problem with this argument is that because we are reversing Duncan\u2019s convictions, none of the findings of fact in the previous trial can be considered valid or final. Due to the erroneous instructions, we must consider the entire jury verdict \u2014 including the finding of fact that Duncan acted either under the influence of sudden passion or in a fit of rage provoked by Baldwin \u2014 as tainted. In the interest of justice, Duncan will receive an entirely new trial. Duncan cannot pick and choose which findings or rulings from the prior trial he would like to carry over to the next. All previous findings are invalidated, and both parties must start from scratch. Therefore, collateral estoppel does not bar Duncan\u2019s retrial for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">{\u00b6 50} Accordingly, we sustain Duncan\u2019s first assignment of error but hold that Duncan can be retried on the same three charges \u2014 murder, felony murder, and voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">\n<em>V. Motion to Suppress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">{\u00b6 51} In his second assignment of error, Duncan argues that the trial court erred when it overruled his motion to suppress the identification testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>of McFinley. Duncan moved before the trial to suppress the identification testimony of Cantrell, McFinley, and Broach. The trial court sustained the motion for Broach but denied the motion for Cantrell and McFinley.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">{\u00b6 52} At the suppression hearing, Lincoln Heights Police Officer Sandy Stevenson testified that she was the officer assigned to investigate the killing of Baldwin at the Peppermint Lounge. She explained that several days after the shooting, at the Lincoln Heights police station, she showed a photo array of six individuals, including Duncan, to Broach. She testified that Broach did not say anything and that Broach did not identity Duncan as the shooter. Stevenson testified that after Broach did not identify anyone as the shooter, she pointed to Duncan\u2019s photo and said, \u201c[W]ell, this is the guy right here.\u201d Broach then agreed that Duncan was the one, saying, \u201cI just wasn\u2019t sure, but yeah, that\u2019s him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">{\u00b6 53} Stevenson testified that McFinley was in the room with Broach when he was shown the photo array. Stevenson said that after she pointed to Duncan\u2019s photo and indicated that Duncan was the suspect and after Broach identified Duncan, McFinley also identified Duncan as the shooter. Stevenson also testified that on a separate occasion, she had Cantrell view the photo array and Cantrell identified Duncan as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">{\u00b6 54} McFinley testified that the morning after the shooting, she and Broach went to the Lincoln Heights police station, where she and Broach were interviewed by the police. Both Broach and McFinley were in the interview room together. She testified, though, that on a different day, within the week, she was shown a photo array by Officer Stevenson. She testified that Broach was not in the room when she viewed the photo array and that she identified Duncan as the shooter at the Peppermint Lounge. She stated that Officer Stevenson did not say anything to her prior to her identification of Duncan as the shooter. She also testified that she was not in the room when Broach identified Duncan as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">{\u00b6 55} Broach testified that he identified Duncan as the shooter only after Officer Stevenson said, \u201c[TJhis is the guy.\u201d Broach stated at the hearing, \u201cAll the other witnesses said yes, then that must be him.\u201d Broach also testified that McFinley was present with him when he was shown the photo array.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">{\u00b6 56} When a witness has been confronted with a suspect before trial, due process requires a court to suppress the witness\u2019s identification of the suspect if the confrontation was unnecessarily suggestive of the suspect\u2019s guilt and the identification was unreliable under all the circumstances.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> \u201cIn a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>on a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of the trier of fact, and determines the credibility of the witnesses and weighs the evidence presented at the hearing. A reviewing court must accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence; but, the reviewing court must independently determine, as a matter of law, whether the facts meet the appropriate legal standards.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">{\u00b6 57} At the suppression hearing, concerning Broach, the trial court stated, \u201cHe\u2019s out. He\u2019s out. I am not even \u2014 everything he says shows that he was contaminated. He even says he made identification based on what other witnesses told him.\u201d But concerning McFinley, the court stated, \u201cI believe the witness. I don\u2019t believe that happened the way the police officer said, or the other witness. She was very articulate about what happened. So, Broach is out, the other two are in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">{\u00b6 58} We conclude that there is competent and credible evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding of fact that McFinley\u2019s identification testimony was not tainted by suggestion. Given that finding of fact, the trial court properly allowed McFinley to testify at trial concerning her identification of Duncan as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">{\u00b6 59} Therefore, we overrule Duncan\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\n<em>VI. Hearsay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">{\u00b6 60} In his third assignment of error, Duncan argues that the trial court erred by allowing the state to present the testimony of Bean and Officer Dunn. Duncan contends that the testimony of both witnesses was hearsay yet was admitted to prove the \u201cfact\u201d that Duncan was involved in the shooting at the Peppermint Lounge.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">{\u00b6 61} Bean\u2019s testimony, which related the contents of a conversation Bean had had with his sister, Duncan\u2019s mother, was hearsay. According to Bean, Duncan\u2019s mother was concerned about Duncan and wanted Bean\u2019s help in turning Duncan in to the police. Bean testified that although she mentioned concerns about possible misbehavior by Duncan, she did not allude to Duncan\u2019s involvement in a shooting in Lincoln Heights. The testimony about Bean\u2019s conversation with Duncan\u2019s mother was clearly inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>{\u00b6 62} The state went even further and, in an attempt to impeach Bean, read into the record some of Bean\u2019s prior testimony from the grand-jury hearing. Bean\u2019s testimony about his previous grand-jury testimony, and the grand-jury testimony itself, was convoluted, and Bean equivocated considerably. Nonetheless, Bean\u2019s testimony at trial regarding his grand-jury testimony was also hearsay, because it concerned conversations with Duncan\u2019s mother, or with Duncan himself, that were not necessarily related to the incident at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">{\u00b6 68} The state argues that it is irrelevant that Bean\u2019s testimony about his grand-jury testimony was hearsay because it was offered only to impeach Bean, not for the truth of the matter. This is a dubious argument. Impeach what? It is not clear what the state would have gained by impeaching Bean. Bean\u2019s testimony \u2014 all hearsay in any event \u2014 only stated that Duncan\u2019s mother expressed concern about Duncan\u2019s activities and, knowing that Duncan was wanted by the police, sought Bean\u2019s help in getting Duncan safely turned in to the police. Why would the state want to impeach that?</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">{\u00b6 64} It is much more likely that the state, rather than impeaching Bean\u2019s credibility, wanted to introduce Bean\u2019s grand-jury testimony for the truth of the matter, which, at best for the state, might have indicated that Bean had indeed talked to Duncan and that Duncan had admitted being someplace with Derrick Minor. It is the old trick of attempting to prove a positive by impeaching a negative. Neither logic nor law permits this sleight-of-hand. The trial court not only allowed \u201cimpeaching\u201d of already improper hearsay with more double hearsay, it facilitated this fiasco by calling Bean as the court\u2019s witness \u2014 thus allowing \u201cimpeachment\u201d by the state. We conclude that Bean\u2019s testimony involved statements made by others, offered for the truth of the matter of those statements, and was not offered for impeachment purposes. Therefore, the trial court erred in allowing Bean\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">{\u00b6 65} Officer Dunn\u2019s testimony was also hearsay. In fact, it was double hearsay. According to Dunn, Duncan told Bean that he had been involved in a shooting in Lincoln Heights and then Bean told Dunn. Though Bean insisted that all his information came from Duncan\u2019s mother (which would have made Dunn\u2019s testimony <em>triple </em>hearsay), Dunn testified that Bean told him he got his information from Duncan himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">{\u00b6 66} It is true that a witness may sometimes testify to explain the subsequent investigative activities of the witness, and that such testimony is not offered for the truth of the matter.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> But it is a very narrow exception to the hearsay and relevance rules \u2014 except seemingly in Hamilton County.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>court here did give a cautionary instruction to the jury stating that it should not consider the truth of what Dunn claimed Duncan said, but should only consider how it explained Dunn\u2019s subsequent investigative activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">{\u00b6 67} Dunn testified to his subsequent investigative activities. He said that he did not take any notes of his conversation with Bean. He testified that once he realized that the homicide did not happen within the city of Cincinnati, his jurisdiction, but in Lincoln Heights, he simply passed on the information to the Lincoln Heights Police Department. Dunn also sent a Cincinnati police officer to an apartment building in Cincinnati where Bean said Duncan might have been staying, but Duncan was not there. Dunn also testified that when he talked to the Lincoln Heights police, they already had Duncan\u2019s name as a suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">{\u00b6 68} Officer Dunn\u2019s subsequent investigative activities were hardly relevant or essential evidence in this trial. Officer Dunn had nothing to do with this homicide investigation \u2014 it was not even in his jurisdiction \u2014 and his only relation at all to the case was his conversation with Bean. Dunn\u2019s testimony concerning his subsequent actions reveals the thinly disguised attempt by the state to offer Dunn\u2019s testimony for the truth of the matter of Duncan\u2019s (or Duncan\u2019s mother\u2019s) statement to Bean. It is disingenuous to assert that Dunn\u2019s testimony was offered for any reason other than to prove the \u201cfact\u201d that Duncan was involved in a shooting in Lincoln Heights. Therefore, the trial court erred in allowing Dunn to testify concerning his conversation with Bean.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">{\u00b6 69} Because of our ruling on Duncan\u2019s first assignment of error, there is no need to determine whether the trial court\u2019s error in admitting the hearsay testimony of Bean and Dunn was harmless or reversible error. Either way, in Duncan\u2019s next trial, that testimony will be inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">{\u00b6 70} Duncan also argues that the trial contained numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct, including misstatements of testimony and mischaraeterizations of the evidence. Because we are reversing Duncan\u2019s convictions and remanding his case for a new trial, Duncan\u2019s allegations in this respect are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">\n<em>VII. Sufficiency and Manifest Weight</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">{\u00b6 71} In his fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments of error, Duncan argues that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of all three charges, that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence, and that the trial court erred by denying his Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">{\u00b6 72} In criminal cases, the legal concepts of sufficiency of the evidence and weight of the evidence are distinct.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> A challenge to the sufficiency of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>evidence attacks the adequacy of the evidence presented. Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a verdict is a question of law.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The relevant inquiry in a claim of insufficiency is whether any rational factfinder, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the state, could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">{\u00b6 73} A challenge to the weight of the evidence attacks the credibility of the evidence presented.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> When evaluating the manifest weight of the evidence, we must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The discretionary power to reverse should be invoked only in exceptional cases \u201c[where] the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">{\u00b6 74} The state presented testimony that Baldwin and his friends attacked Duncan and Minor. Three witnesses testified that after the fight, while they were in the parking lot, Baldwin continued to challenge Duncan to fight, and Duncan shot Baldwin. The state also offered evidence from a jailhouse informant that Duncan had admitted that after being attacked by someone, he waited for the person to come out of the building and shot him in the head, and that he planned on offering an alibi defense that he was babysitting for his brother on the night of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">{\u00b6 75} After reviewing the entire record, weighing the evidence and all reasonable inferences, and considering the credibility of the witnesses, we conclude that there was substantial and credible evidence to prove all essential elements of the crimes and to support the jury\u2019s verdicts. Of course, if the jury had been properly instructed, it would not have been able to find Duncan guilty on all three charges. But for purposes of judging the sufficiency of the evidence presented by the state, we conclude that the evidence presented was legally sufficient to sustain Duncan\u2019s convictions. We also conclude that Duncan\u2019s convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>{\u00b6 76} Therefore, we overrule Duncan\u2019s fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\n<em>VIII. Batson Challenge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">{\u00b6 77} In his seventh and final assignment of error, Duncan argues that the trial court erred when it overruled his challenge to the state\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge to excuse an African-American juror. Because we are reversing Duncan\u2019s convictions and remanding this case for a new trial, this assignment of error is moot, and we do not need to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">{\u00b6 78} Accordingly, we sustain Duncan\u2019s first and third assignments of error, reverse his convictions, and remand his case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b300-7\">Doan, P.J., and Hildebrandt, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-10\">.
