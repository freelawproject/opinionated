Bryant, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b486-17\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Jonathan Kuhner, brings this appeal from the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Seneca County denying his motion to suppress all evidence obtained against him as a result of a search and seizure of his property by the Tiffin Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-18\">{\u00b6 2} On February 26, 2002, Jessica Benton, a residence coordinator at Heidelberg College in Tiffin, Ohio, contacted the police regarding possible-marijuana use in a dormitory room. While awaiting the arrival of the drug-sniffing canine, one individual from the room, Kuhner, handed a backpack to Officer Bryant and told him he had a bag of marijuana in the backpack. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the search of the room was completed, Officer Bryant searched the front pouch of the backpack and discovered a small bag of marijuana. After having Kuhner accompany him to his cruiser, Officer Bryant unzipped the main pocket of the backpack and discovered a larger bag of marijuana with smaller, individual bags inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">{\u00b6 3} Kuhner was indicted on one count of trafficking in marijuana, a felony in the fifth degree. Kuhner timely filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained against him as a result of, and subsequent to, the search and seizure conducted on February 26, 2002. On October 7, 2002, the trial court held a suppression hearing, at which Jessica Benton, residence coordinator at Heidelberg College, and Officers David Horne, Shawn Vallery, and Brian Bryant, gave testimony. On November 18, 2002, the trial court denied the motion to suppress at the court-scheduled plea date. At the same time, Kuhner withdrew his previously entered plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty to one count of trafficking in marijuana in accordance with a previously drafted sentence recommendation from the prosecuting attorney. The trial court accepted the guilty plea entered by Kuhner. Kuhner now seeks to appeal from the denial of his motion to suppress, raising the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred in overruling the motion to suppress filed by appellant by disregarding that there were two separate and independent warrantless searches in this matter, one consensual and, therefore, legal and one nonconsensual and, therefore, a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in overruling the motion to suppress filed by appellant by erroneously applying to the instant case the \u2018objective reasonableness\u2019 standard created in <em>Florida v. Jimeno </em>[500 U.S. 248], 111 S.Ct. 1801 [114 L.Ed.2d 297] (1991).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in overruling the motion to suppress filed by appellant based on its conclusion that appellant did not effectively limit his consent to a warrantless search by the police.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">{\u00b6 4} Before this court can even consider the assignments of error raised by Kuhner, we must first address the issue whether by pleading guilty Kuhner has waived his right to appeal issues regarding the trial court\u2019s denial of his pretrial motion to suppress. A plea of guilty is a complete admission of guilt. Crim.R. 11(B)(1). A defendant who enters a plea of guilty waives the right to appeal all nonjurisdictional issues arising at prior stages of the proceedings, although the defendant may contest the constitutionality of the plea itself. <em>Ross v. Common Pleas Court of Auglaize Cty. </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St.2d 323, 59 O.O.2d 385, 285 N.E.2d 25. \u201cThus, by entering a guilty plea, a defendant waives the right to raise on appeal the propriety of a trial court\u2019s suppression ruling.\u201d <em>State v. McQueeney, 148 Ohio </em>App.3d 606, 2002-Ohio-3731, 774 N.E.2d 1228, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>{\u00b6 5} A plea of no contest permits the defendant to preserve the issue of pretrial motions, including a pretrial motion to suppress evidence. Crim.R. 12(1). However, a defendant does not have an unqualified right to plead no contest. A trial court has discretion whether to accept a no-contest plea. Crim.R. 11(A). The decision of the trial court whether to accept or reject a no-eontest plea will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264. In Ohio, the universally-accepted definition of an abuse of discretion is a judgment that reflects an attitude by the court that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">{\u00b6 6} Both the Second District Court of Appeals and the Tenth District Court of Appeals have found that a trial court\u2019s policy to refuse to accept no-contest pleas constituted an abuse of discretion because the trial courts failed to consider the facts and circumstances of the individual cases presented before them. <em>State v. Carter </em>(1997), 124 Ohio App.3d 423, 706 N.E.2d 409; <em>State v. Graves </em>(Nov. 19, 1998), 10th Dist. No. 98AP-272, 1998 WL 808356. The trial court decisions were instead rendered based solely upon a blanket court policy that precluded the use of such pleas regardless of the facts of a particular case or a defendant\u2019s individual situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">{\u00b6 7} This court also has followed this line of decisions in <em>Smith v. Smith </em>(Aug. 16, 2001), Wyandot App. No. 16-01-03, 2001 WL 929375. In <em>Smith, </em>during a hearing for a civil protection order against the appellant, the magistrate made statements that indicated that the trial court\u2019s decision to grant a civil protection order was based upon a court policy to formulate decisions concerning child abuse, and not upon the evidence and testimony before him. However, in <em>Smith, </em>we held that \u201cwhile the trial court made unfortunate statements suggesting an established court policy that raises concern for all litigants by this court, the decision rendered herein reflects that the trial court did properly weigh the evidence before it * * *.\u201d Id. at * 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">{\u00b6 8} While the magistrate\u2019s remarks taken in isolation would likely lead to the assumption that the trial court based its decision on a blanket court policy, a complete review of the record and the magistrate\u2019s written decision led to a different conclusion. We found that \u201cthe magistrate\u2019s decision [was] supported by sufficient evidence and there [was] sufficient explanation by the magistrate to demonstrate that the evidence was fairly considered and the credibility of witnesses was appropriately weighed.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">{\u00b6 9} The case at hand can be distinguished from the <em>Smith </em>case. The magistrate in <em>Smith </em>rendered his decision to grant a civil protection order based on the merits of the case. The trial judge in Kuhner made his decision based on procedural concerns. In this case the matter came before the court on a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>to change the defendant\u2019s plea two days before the scheduled trial for which the jury had been summoned and witnesses had been subpoenaed. The transcript from the hearing reveals the trial judge\u2019s concern with the timing of the motion to change the plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">\u201cThe Court: Then the plea is to take place immediately; that will vacate the jury trial for this Thursday and Friday, you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">\u201cMr. Zavelson: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">\u201cThe Court: We have a jury ready, so they\u2019re summoned and ready to go but your client prefers to plead guilty rather than proceed with a jury trial? \u201cMr. Zavelson: Yes, he does, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">\u201cThe Court: Does he understand that the jury trial scheduled for Thursday, November 14th and Friday, November 15th will now, for this case, be vacated, though jury trials, others are scheduled?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">\u201cMr. Zavelson: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">\u201cThe Court: Then, Mr. Kuhner and counsel may sign the plea report. Court has before it a Report After Plea Date [sic]. Is that your signature, Mr. Kuhner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">\u201cMr. Kuhner: Yes, Your Honor, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-12\">\u201cThe Court: You understand what you\u2019re proposing to do is change your plea from not guilty to guilty, is that what you wish to do?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">{\u00b6 10} Kuhner sought to avail himself of a plea bargain, previously offered by the prosecution, of a recommendation of a reduced sentence in exchange for a plea of guilty to the charged offense. Because the sentence recommendation called for the defendant to enter a plea of guilty in exchange for a recommended lesser sentence to the charge, Kuhner\u2019s counsel suggested to the court an amendment of that agreement from a plea of guilty to one of no contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">{\u00b6 11} The trial judge\u2019s refusal to accept a no-contest plea in contravention of the sentence recommendation did not amount to the trial judge\u2019s participating in the terms of the plea bargain. A trial judge should not participate in plea discussions and such participation is considered prejudicial to the defendant. <em>State v. Harper </em>(1988), 47 Ohio App.3d 109, 547 N.E.2d 395. The trial judge did not give Kuhner an ultimatum of pleading guilty in order to partake in the recommended sentence by the prosecutor, nor was his reason for refusing to accept the no-contest plea to prevent Kuhner from appealing his ruling on the motion to suppress. The trial judge based his decision of not accepting the no-contest plea on the timing of the motion to change the plea, as Kuhner sought to change his plea and accept the sentence recommendation two days before his scheduled trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Although a trial court may not adopt a blanket policy of never allowing a no-contest plea, it cannot be determined from the record in this case whether the trial judge was referring to a fixed rule or the application of the local rule under the circumstances when he refused to accept Kuhner\u2019s plea of no contest. In the local rules of the Common Pleas Court of Seneca County, Criminal Rule 25.02 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">\u201cOn the date scheduled as the Plea Date, counsel and the defendant shall be present. If the defendant wishes to enter a plea of guilty, the plea will take place at that time. If the defendant does not wish to enter a plea of guilty, that decision is placed on the record. After this date the Court will accept no plea except to the original charge(s). If the defendant does not enter a plea on the plea date, the Jury Trial proceeds as scheduled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">{\u00b6 13} The trial judge\u2019s refusal to enter into a plea bargain with the defendant, who was seeking to avail himself of the prosecutor\u2019s written bargain\u2014 outside of the recommendation\u2019s original terms and, in fact, on better terms \u2014 is not an abuse of discretion. A trial judge is within the bounds of his discretion in refusing a no-contest plea based on procedural considerations in the particular case before him. We find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court with regard to the denial of the no-contest plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">{\u00b6 14} The issues raised by the trial court\u2019s judgment denying suppression of evidence are not preserved for appeal, and thus we do not reach the assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">{\u00b6 15} Nevertheless, the record discloses that the facts found by the trial court are supported by substantial, credible evidence adduced at the hearing, and depend in large part on assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. We must accept those findings of fact so supported and determined and thus find no error in the trial court\u2019s application of the relevant legal principles when entering its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">{\u00b6 16} The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Seneca County is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b490-11\">Shaw and Walters, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
