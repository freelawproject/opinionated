Miller was killed in an auto accident caused by an underinsured motorist. Miller was survived by, among others, his grandmother, Thom. At the time of the accident, Thom was employed by the American Standard Company, which was covered by a commercial automobile policy of insurance issued by the Traveler\u2019s Indemnity Company. Thom filed an underinsured motorist (\u201cUIM\u201d) claim with Traveler\u2019s for her damages resulting from Miller\u2019s accident pursuant to <em>Scott-Pontzer, </em>which Traveler\u2019s denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">{\u00b6 3} On January 15, 2002, Thom filed a complaint against Traveler\u2019s, and on June 21, 2002, she filed a motion for partial summary judgment. Traveler\u2019s also filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court held oral argument and on February 27, 2003, granted summary judgment in favor of Traveler\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">{\u00b6 4} Thom now appeals, asserting three assignments of error which will be discussed together.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-13\">\u201cThe trial court erred when it failed to hold that Ohio law applied to and was incorporated in the Ohio uninsured motorist endorsement in the Traveler\u2019s Policy and denied Bernita Thom\u2019s motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-14\">\u201cThe trial court erred when it failed to hold that the insurer and insured in writing agreed in the reduction form that the laws of Ohio applied to the Ohio uninsured motorist coverage provided by the policy, or was at least ambiguous in that regard, and erred denying Bernita Thom\u2019s motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>\u201cThe trial court erred in failing to recognize that if all the uninsured motorist coverage provided by the policy was to be governed by New Jersey law, there would be no need for 30 separate UM endorsements for each state that the policy contains, and erred in granting the Traveler\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">{\u00b6 5} An appellate court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Lorain Natl. Bank v. Saratoga Apts. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 127, 129, 572 N.E.2d 198. Summary judgment is proper if the evidence filed in a case shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Civ.R. 56(C). Furthermore, summary judgment should be granted if \u201cit appears from such evidence or stipulation and only therefrom, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, such party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">{\u00b6 6} Thom contends that Ohio law applied to her claim under the Traveler\u2019s policy and that she was entitled to UIM coverage pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 710 N.E.2d 1116. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">{\u00b6 7} In <em>Ohayon v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Illinois </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 474, 747 N.E.2d 206, the Ohio Supreme Court held that an action by an insured against his or her insurance carrier for payment of UIM coverage is a cause of action sounding in contract, rather than tort, even though tortious conduct triggered the applicable contractual provisions. Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus. Courts must determine questions involving the nature and extent of the parties\u2019 rights and duties under an insurance contract\u2019s UIM provision by applying the rules in Sections 187 and 188 of the Restatement of the Law 2d, Conflict of Laws (1971). <em>Ohayon, </em>supra, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">{\u00b6 8} Section 187 of the Restatement provides that, subject to very limited exceptions, the law of the state chosen by the parties to a contract will govern their contractual rights and duties. Id. at 477, 747 N.E.2d 206. The court in <em>Ohayon </em>stated, \u201cWe do not invoke Restatement Section 187 to apply the law of the state chosen by the parties unless we are satisfied that the parties have actually made an express choice of law regarding the issue before the court.\u201d <em>Ohayon, </em>supra, 91 Ohio St.3d at 486, 747 N.E.2d 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">{\u00b6 9} Thom argues that by offering Ohio UIM coverage pursuant to R.C. 3937.18, Traveler\u2019s acknowledged that Ohio law was applicable to her claim. However, the mere presence of state-specific endorsements in an insurance policy is not an affirmative choice of the law of any particular state as required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Section 187. See <em>Register v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>Hamilton App. Nos. C-020318 and C-020319, 2003-Ohio-1544, 2003 WL 1571597, \u00b6 10; <em>Nationwide Ins. v. Phelps, </em>Columbiana App. No. 2002 CO 27, 2003-Ohio-497, 2003 WL 220418, at \u00b6 13. To hold otherwise would be contrary to the Restatement\u2019s stated rationale for Section 187: \u201cPrime objectives of contract law are to protect the justified expectations of the parties and to make it possible for them to foretell with accuracy what will be their rights and liabilities under the contract.\u201d Restatement of the Law 2d, Conflict of Laws, Section 187, Comment <em>e; Ohayon, </em>supra, at 476-477, 747 N.E.2d 206. Further, the Supreme Court has stated that R.C. 3937.18, Ohio\u2019s UIM statute, \u201cunlike some Ohio statutes that apply to contractual relationships, imposes no choice of law on the parties if a dispute arises concerning the existence or extent of coverage.\u201d <em>Ohayon, </em>supra, 91 Ohio St.3d at 481, 747 N.E.2d 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 10} Absent an effective choice of law by the parties, pursuant to Section 188 of the Restatement, the parties\u2019 rights and duties under the contract are determined by the law of the state that has \u201cthe most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties.\u201d <em>Ohayon, </em>supra, 91 Ohio St.3d at 477, 747 N.E.2d 206; <em>Phelps, </em>supra, at \u00b6 14. Section 188(2) provides that, in making this determination, courts should consider (1) the place of contracting, (2) the place of negotiation, (3) the place of performance, (4) the location of the subject matter, and (5) the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of business of the parties. <em>Ohayon, </em>supra, 91 Ohio St.3d at 477, 747 N.E.2d 206. As to insurance cases, the Ohio Supreme Court has stated that the focus on these factors \u201cwill often correspond with the Restatement\u2019s view that the rights created by an insurance contract should be determined \u2018by the law of the state which the parties understood was to be the <em>principal location of the insured risk during the term of the policy, </em>unless * * * some other state has a more significant relationship to the transaction and the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohayon, </em>supra, 91 Ohio St.3d at 479, 747 N.E.2d 206, quoting Restatement 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 11} Thom argues that since Traveler\u2019s provided an Ohio UIM endorsement to American Standard pursuant to R.C. 3937.18, Ohio law necessarily applies. We disagree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See, also, <em>Phelps, </em>supra. If all insurance policies that included an Ohio UIM endorsement pursuant to R.C. 3937.18 were to be interpreted using Ohio law, the court would have had no reason to hold that \u201cR.C. 3937.18 * * * imposes no choice of law on the parties if a dispute arises concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>existence or extent of coverage.\u201d <em>Ohayon, </em>supra; see, also, <em>Goings v. Emerson Elec. Co. </em>(Apr. 23, 2003), S.D. Ohio, No. C-3-01-353.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 12} The evidence in this case that is applicable to the <em>Ohayon </em>test reveals that (1) the contract was formed in New Jersey, (2) the contract was negotiated in New Jersey, (3) the contract was performed throughout the United States, (4) the automobiles that were insured were located throughout the United States with a small number in Ohio, and (5) American Standard is incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in New Jersey, and Travelers has its headquarters in Connecticut. Under these circumstances, we find that the connection to New Jersey represents the \u201cmore significant relationship to the transaction and the parties.\u201d See, generally, <em>Powers v. CGU Indiana-Ohio Valley </em>(Dec. 31, 2001), Franklin App. No. 01AP-440, 2001 WL 1661893, <em>Phelps, </em>supra; <em>Carr v. Isaacs, </em>Butler App. No. CA2001-08-191, 2002-Ohio-1734, 2002 WL 553715; <em>Pennsylvania Gen. Ins. Co. v. Shoults, </em>(Mar. 28, 2002), S.D. Ohio No. C2-00-1107, 2002 WL 485017. Consequently, pursuant to <em>Ohayon, </em>we will utilize New Jersey law to interpret the existence and extent of coverage in the Travelers policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 13} The Traveler\u2019s policy provides uninsured motorist coverage to an insured, which is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">\u201c1. You.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">\u201c2. If you are an individual, any \u2018family member.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">\u201c3. Anyone else \u2018occupying\u2019 a covered \u2018auto\u2019 or a temporary substitute for a covered \u2018auto.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-10\">\u201c4. Anyone for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 sustained by another \u2018insured.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">{\u00b6 14} Furthermore, the Traveler\u2019s policy defines \u201cyou\u201d as the \u201cnamed insured shown in the declarations,\u201d which is listed as American Standard Inc., Piscataway, New Jersey. In this case, neither Thom nor her grandson was listed as a named insured, and there is no evidence in the record that Thom\u2019s grandson was driving a covered automobile. Consequently, pursuant to New Jersey law, Thom is not an insured under the Traveler\u2019s policy. See <em>Progressive Cas. Ins. v. Hurley </em>(Jan. 29, 2001), 166 N.J. 260, 765 A.2d 195.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>{\u00b6 15} Based on the foregoing, we cannot find that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Traveler\u2019s and denying Thom\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Consequently, Thom\u2019s first, second, and third assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b573-5\">Walters and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-7\">. Thom argues that <em>Henderson v. Lincoln Natl. Speciality Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 303, 626 N.E.2d 657, governs in this case, requiring this court to apply Ohio law. However, the court in <em>Henderson </em>did not discuss which law would apply \u201cif a dispute arises concerning the existence or extent of coverage\u201d as was the situation in <em>Ohayon </em>and in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b572-12\">. The New Jersey Supreme Court has not determined, as has the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Scott-Pontzer, </em>supra that the use of the word \"you\u201d alone, as a definition for who is an insured in an insurance policy when referring solely to a corporation, creates an ambiguity which results in employees of that corporation receiving coverage as an insured. On the contrary, the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>Progressive, supra, </em>implied that the same language as reflected above in the Traveler\u2019s policy defining \"who is an insured\u201d was not ambiguous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
