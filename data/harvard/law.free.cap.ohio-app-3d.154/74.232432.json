(Attached as Appendix A.) The magistrate decided that the requested -writ of mandamus should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">{\u00b6 3} In February 2000, claimant filed an application for approval to settle a claim for $95,000. On March 2, 2000, someone with the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation orally advised claimant\u2019s attorney that it would approve settlement of the claim for $80,000, and, on March 6, 2000, claimant faxed his agreement to settle for that amount. The fax shows the signature of both claimant and his attorney. Claimant died on March 13, 2000, apparently of causes unrelated to the claim. On March 22, 2000, the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation issued a letter approving settlement in the amount of $80,000. On April 1, 2000, the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation notified relator\u2019s attorney that the settlement application was denied, as no settlement had been reached, and it was withdrawing its consent, pursuant to R.C. 4123.65(C), as the claim abated with claimant\u2019s death. Relator filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement, and a staff hearing officer found that the claim abated with the claimant\u2019s death. The staff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>hearing officer reasoned that the settlement approval was effective March 22, 2000, the date of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation\u2019s written order, \u201cas the BWC, like the Industrial Commission, speaks only through its written orders and decisions. Furthermore, the BWC did not have jurisdiction to issue the 3/22/00 order as the claim had previously abated due to the claimant\u2019s death on 3/13/00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">{\u00b6 4} At the outset, we note that, although none of the parties has filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact, it appears that the correct date in Finding of Fact No. 3 should be March 2, 2000, not March 17, 2000. With this correction, the court adopts the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">{\u00b6 5} In her objections, relator contends that the magistrate failed to address Industrial Commission Policy No. 7, which exempts settlements that have been approved by the Administrator of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation from the abatement provisions of R.C. 4123.65. Relator argues that R.C. 4123.65 does not preclude oral settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">{\u00b6 6} R.C. 4123.65 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">\u201c(A) A state fund employer or the employee of such an employer may file an application with the administrator of workers\u2019 compensation for approval of a final settlement of a claim under this chapter. The application shall include the settlement agreement, be signed by the claimant and employer, and clearly set forth the circumstances by reason of which the proposed settlement is deemed desirable and that the parties agree to the terms of the settlement agreement * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-11\">ii* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">\u201c(C) No settlement agreed to under division (A) of this section or agreed to by a self-insuring employer and the self-insuring employer\u2019s employee shall take effect until thirty days after the administrator approves the settlement for state fund employees * * *. During the thirty-day period, the employer, employee, or administrator, for state fund settlements, * * * may withdraw consent to the settlement * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">{\u00b6 7} Ohio Adm.Code 4123-5-21 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-14\">\u201c(A) When a claimant dies, action on any application filed by the claimant, and pending before the bureau or the industrial commission at the time of his death, is abated by claimant\u2019s death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">{\u00b6 8} Ohio Adm.Code 4123-3-34(F) and (G) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-16\">\u201c(F) * * * When a settlement agreement has been approved by the administrator, a notice of approval shall be sent to the claimant, the employer, and their representatives, informing them of their rights to withdraw consent to the settlement agreement within thirty days. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>\u201c(G) The administrator shall also send the notice of approval to the industrial commission within five days from the date of the bureau order of approval. \u2021 <em>91</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">{\u00b6 9} Industrial Commission Policy No. 7 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">\u201cPursuant to Ohio Revised Code Section 4123.65 as effective October 20, 1993 settlements are not subject to the abatement provisions contained in Ohio Administrative Code Rule 4123-5-21 if the settlement has reached the stage of being approved by the Administrator in state fund claims or has been signed by both the employer and the injured worker in self-insured claims. If the settlement has reached this stage, it will be unaffected by the death of the injured worker during the pendency of the 30 day cooling off period unless there is evidence that, <em>prior to the death, </em>either the injured worker, the employer, or the administrator or Industrial Commission had initiated action to withdraw from or disapprove of the settlement. Absent evidence of withdrawal or disapproval, the settlement will become final upon the expiration of the 30 day cooling off period as provided in Ohio Revised Code Section 4123.65.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">{\u00b6 10} The issue herein is whether the oral offer of an $80,000 settlement and claimant\u2019s acceptance of that offer constituted approval of the settlement by the Administrator of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation so that Policy No. 7 would override the abatement provisions of R.C. 4123.65 and Ohio Adm.Code 4123-5-21 (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">{\u00b6 11} While the result may appear unduly harsh, we agree with the magistrate that an oral offer from an unidentified employee at the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation to settle a claim does not constitute approval by the administrator. Clearly, Ohio Adm.Code 4123-3-34(F) and (G), requiring that notice of approval be sent to the claimant, employer, their representatives, and the Industrial Commission, contemplate written, not oral, approval by the administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">{\u00b6 12} Thus, this case differs from <em>Halley v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 391, 657 N.E.2d 340, wherein this court found that, under the former version of R.C. 4123.65, the signature of the chief of the workers\u2019 compensation section of the Attorney General\u2019s Office, as counsel for the administrator, and that of a commission hearing officer constituted approval of a settlement. Because the settlement had not been approved in writing by the administrator, there was no approved settlement and claimant\u2019s claim abated with his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">{\u00b6 13} Therefore, upon a review of the magistrate\u2019s decision and an independent review of the record, this court adopts the magistrate\u2019s decision as its own with the correction to Finding of Fact. No. 3; relator\u2019s objections to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>magistrate\u2019s decision are overruled, and the requested writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Objections overruled and writ of mandamus denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b106-5\">Brown and Klatt, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">MAGISTRATE\u2019S DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Rendered on May 1, 2003 IN MANDAMUS</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">{\u00b6 14} Relator, Judith Carmickle, as the administrator of the estate of Jerry Carmickle (\u201cclaimant\u201d), who is deceased, has filed this original action requesting that this court issue a writ of mandamus ordering respondent Industrial Commission of Ohio (\u201ccommission\u201d) to vacate its order which determined that claimant\u2019s claim had abated upon his death and that relator is not entitled to have a settlement agreement enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">{\u00b6 15} 1. Claimant sustained a work-related injury on January 18, 1978, and his claim has been allowed for: \u201csyncope and collapse; postconcussion syndrome; sprain sacroiliac; concussion nos; open wound of head nec.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">{\u00b6 16} 2. On February 27, 2000, claimant filed a C-240 Settlement Agreement and Application for Approval of Settlement Agreement with the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d). Claimant sought to settle his workers\u2019 compensation claim for $95,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">{\u00b6 17} 3. On March 17, 2000, the BWC verbally advised claimant that it would not agree to the settlement as proposed, but that the BWC would approve a settlement in the amount of $80,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-14\">{\u00b6 18} 4. Claimant, through his attorney, faxed a C-241 Amended Settlement Agreement and Release to the BWC on March 6, 2000, indicating claimant\u2019s willingness to settle his claim for $80,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-15\">{\u00b6 19} 5. Claimant died on March 13, 2000 prior to the BWC having approved his settlement application.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-16\">{\u00b6 20} 6. On March 22, 2000, the BWC sent claimant and his attorney a letter approving the settlement sought in the C-241 form in the amount of $80,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-17\">{\u00b6 21} 7. On April 1, 2000, the BWC advised relator and her attorney in writing that the settlement application previously submitted had been denied on the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>that all parties did not agree with the settlement terms, and that, pursuant to R.C. 4123.65, the BWC withdrew its consent from the March 22, 2000 settlement approval on the grounds that claimant\u2019s settlement application abated with his death March 13, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">{\u00b6 22} 8. On April 27, 2000, relator filed a motion with the BWC requesting that the purported settlement agreement be honored and paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">{\u00b6 23} 9. Relator\u2019s motion was heard before a staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) on June 5, 2000, and resulted in an order denying relator\u2019s motion as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cThe claimant\u2019s request to order enforcement of the settlement agreement in the amount of $80,000.00 is denied, as it is found that the claim abated by the claimant\u2019s death on 3/13/00, prior to the issuance of the BWC order of 3/22/00 approving the settlement application.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe claimant had filed an initial application to settle the claim (C-240) on 2/17/00, in the amount of $95,000.00. The BWC tentatively agreed to settle the claim on 3/2/00 in the amount of $80,000.00, and verbally informed the claimant\u2019s representative of that at that time. Thereafter, the claimant\u2019s representative faxed a C-241 form to the BWC on 3/6/00, agreeing to the proposed settlement in the amount of $80,000.00. The BWC then issued an order approving this on 3/22/00, subsequent to the claimant\u2019s death on 3/13/00.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe claimant has argued that the settlement agreement took effect on 3/6/00, the date of the C-241 response to the BWC\u2019s $80,000.00 offer. The Staff Hearing Officer finds, however, that the agreement became valid and took effect on 3/22/00, the date of the BWC written order approving the settlement, as the BWC, like the Industrial Commission, speaks only through its written orders and decisions. Furthermore, the BWC did not have jurisdiction to issue the 3/22/00 order as the claim had previously abated due to the claimant\u2019s death on 3/13/00.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThe Staff Hearing Officer relies on Hearing Officer Policy 0.7, and the case of <em>State ex rel Johnston v. Conrad, I.C., and TFE, Inc., </em>March 5, 1999, No. 98 AP-1236 (10th Dist.Ct.Appeals) in making this decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">{\u00b6 28} 10. Relator\u2019s request for reconsideration was denied by order of the commission mailed September 21, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">{\u00b6 29} 11. Thereafter, relator filed the instant mandamus action in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">{\u00b6 30} R.C. 4123.65 pertains to the settlement of claims, as provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b107-15\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(A) A state fund employer or the employee of such an employer may file an application with the administrator of workers\u2019 compensation for approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>of a final settlement of a claim under this chapter. The application shall include the settlement agreement, be signed by the claimant and employer, and clearly set forth the circumstances by reason of which the proposed settlement is deemed desirable and that the parties agree to the terms of the settlement agreement * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c(C) No settlement agreed to under division (A) of this section or agreed to by a self-insuring employer and the self-insuring employer\u2019s employee shall take effect until thirty days after the administrator approves the settlement for state fund employees * * *. During the thirty-day period, the employer, employee, or administrator, for state fund settlements, * * * may withdraw consent to the settlement * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(D) At the time of agreement to any final settlement agreement under division (A) of this section * * * the administrator, for state fund settlements, * * * immediately shall send a copy of the agreement to the industrial commission who shall assign the matter to a staff hearing officer. The staff hearing officer shall determine, within the time limitations specified in division (C) of this section, whether the settlement agreement is or is not a gross miscarriage of justice. If the staff hearing officer determines within that time period that the settlement is clearly unfair, the staff hearing officer shall issue an order disapproving the settlement agreement. If the staff hearing officer determines that the settlement agreement is not clearly unfair or fails to act within those time limits, the settlement agreement is approved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">{\u00b6 35} Ohio Adm.Code 4123-5-21 pertains to the abatement of claims and provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(A) When a claimant dies, action on any application filed by the claimant, and pending before the bureau or the industrial commission at the time of his death, is abated by claimant\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">{\u00b6 37} In the present case, the commission found that claimant\u2019s application for approval of settlement agreement was pending at the time that he died on March 13, 2000. Because the date of his death preceded the March 22, 2000 letter from the BWC approving claimant\u2019s March 6, 2000 settlement offer, the commission determined that there was no approved settlement and that claimant\u2019s claim abated at the time of his death. As such, the commission denied relator\u2019s request to make payment on the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">{\u00b6 38} In <em>Finnerty v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc. </em>(1988), 47 Ohio App.3d 186, 548 N.E.2d 949, the claimant and his employer, a self-insuring employer, had reached a settlement agreement providing for a release of all his claims for a lump-sum payment of $50,000. The claimant and the employer filed a joint application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u201cApproval of Final Settlement and Dismissal of Claim and Waiver of Hearing\u201d with the commission pursuant to R.C. 4123.65. Claimant died from non work-related causes prior to the commission ruling on the application. As such, the commission dismissed the application because claimant\u2019s claim had abated by reason of his death. Finding that the settlement agreement was contingent upon approval by the commission, the appellate court upheld the commission\u2019s order dismissing the joint application because the claimant died before the settlement agreement was approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">{\u00b6 39} In <em>Halley v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 391, 657 N.E.2d 340, this court held that a claimant\u2019s claim did not abate upon his death when the claim had been approved by the commission prior to the claimant\u2019s death. This court reasoned that the signing of the settlement agreement by an attorney or a staff hearing officer of the commission met the requirements of R.C. 4123.65. As such, the majority concluded that the requirements of R.C. 4123.65 had been substantially fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">{\u00b6 40} The present case differs from both <em>Finnerty </em>and <em>Halley. </em>Relator contends that claimant already had the approval of the BWC when the BWC refused to settle the case for $95,000, but indicated a willingness to settle the case for $80,000. Relator wants to equate the verbal statement of a person at the BWC that the claim could be settled for $80,000 with meeting the requirements of R.C. 4123.65. However, no matter how harsh the result appears, the parties did not have an agreement at the time claimant died. As such, claimant\u2019s claim abated at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">{\u00b6 41} Based on the foregoing, it is this magistrate\u2019s decision that relator has not demonstrated that the commission abused its discretion in determining that claimant\u2019s claim abated at the time of his death, and relator\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">/s/ Stephanie Bisca Brooks STEPHANIE BISCA BROOKS MAGISTRATE</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
