O\u2019Neill, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b673-15\">{\u00b6 1} Appellant and cross-appellee, Niles City School District Board of Education (\u201cthe board\u201d), appeals from the judgment of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas. Appellee and cross-appellant, Diane DeCesare (\u201cDeCesare\u201d), also appeals from the judgment of the trial court. The trial court entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>summary judgment in favor of DeCesare on her claim under the Family Medical Leave Act and in favor of the board on DeCesare\u2019s claim under R.C. 4112.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">{\u00b6 2} DeCesare worked as a teacher in the Niles School District and was employed by the board. Unfortunately, DeCesare became sick with leukemia. She met with Superintendent Guliano and asked to be excused from teaching her first-period class. The board refused this request. Subsequently, DeCesare resigned her teaching position. She is currently collecting disability payments from the State Teachers Retirement System.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">{\u00b6 3} DeCesare filed the instant lawsuit against the board, alleging that the board violated the Family Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d) and R.C. 4112.02, which prohibit discrimination based on disability. DeCesare moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability. The board filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted DeCesare\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment regarding the FMLA issue. The trial court granted the board\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment regarding the claim for handicap discrimination, pursuant to R.C. 4112.02. Although DeCesare\u2019s complaint alleges handicap discrimination, we note that the statutory language of R.C. 4112.02 has been changed from \u201chandicap\u201d to \u201cdisability\u201d; thus, we will use the term \u201cdisability discrimination\u201d in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">{\u00b6 4} Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The standard of review for the granting of a motion for summary judgment is de novo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">{\u00b6 5} In a summary judgment exercise, the burden is on the moving party to point to some evidence that shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact. If the moving party does not meet this burden, summary judgment should not be entered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">{\u00b6 6} The board raises the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of Niles in granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff/appellee, as to count one of the complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">{\u00b6 8} In her motion for partial summary judgment, DeCesare sought judgment on two issues relating to the FMLA. The first is that the board violated the FMLA by not granting her request for leave, and the second is that the board violated the FMLA by not discussing her rights under the FMLA with her. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>trial court apparently granted DeCesare\u2019s motion in toto on the FMLA issues, as the language of the judgment entry merely states that DeCesare\u2019s motion regarding FMLA is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">{\u00b6 9} DeCesare cites <em>Knussman v. Maryland </em>for an analysis of the distinction between the general and customized notice requirements of FMLA. This case states:</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c[T]he FMLA and accompanying regulations <em>require </em>employers to issue two forms of notice to employees \u2014 a generalized notice posted at the employer\u2019s premises and a customized notice of FMLA rights and procedures issued to an employee <em>who indicates a need to take leave </em>for an FMLA-qualifying purpose. 29 U.S.C. 2619(a)(Supp.l997) (posting requirement); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 825.301(c) &amp; 825.302(c) (customized notice requirements).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">{\u00b6 11} In the case sub judice, there was general language in the contract between the union and the board advising employees about the FMLA. Although this language may have satisfied the general posting requirement, it did not satisfy the customized posting requirement. The board needed to notify DeCesare specifically of the FMLA when she requested leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">{\u00b6 12} The board argues that an employer has a duty to discuss only applicable provisions of the FMLA if the employee requests a qualifying leave. The FMLA guarantees \u201c \u2018eligible employees 12 weeks of leave in a 1-year period following certain events: a disabling health problem; a family member\u2019s serious illness; or the arrival of a new son or daughter.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> DeCesare requested leave because she had leukemia, a disabling health problem. Therefore, she requested a FMLA qualifying leave. We are not stating that DeCesare is entitled to leave under FMLA, only that she was requesting a qualifying leave. However, she was entitled to notice so that she could explore her options, including applying for leave under the FMLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">{\u00b6 13} The board contends that DeCesare did not qualify for leave under the FMLA because she did not want a reduction in pay or benefits. However, this fact did not reheve the board of its duty to discuss the FMLA with DeCesare so that she was aware of her options. Moreover, while the FMLA does provide for unpaid leave, it also permits paid leave through the use of accrued sick or vacation time at the discretion of the employee or employer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>{\u00b6 14} The board had an obligation to specifically discuss the FMLA with DeCesare. This duty arose when DeCesare indicated her desire to have a reduction in her workload as a result of a disability. Therefore, the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of DeCesare on the issue that the board violated the FMLA by not notifying DeCesare of her rights under the FMLA. The board\u2019s assignment of error is without merit, as it relates to the notice issue of DeCesare\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">{\u00b6 15} However, there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the board violated the FMLA by not providing leave to DeCesare. The board did not notify DeCesare of her rights under the FMLA, nor did DeCesare specifically request or apply for leave under the Act. This issue needs to be decided by a trier of fact. Thus, the trial court erred by granting DeCesare\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue that the board violated DeCesare\u2019s rights under the FMLA by not granting her leave. The board\u2019s assignment of error has merit regarding this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">{\u00b6 16} DeCesare raises the following assignment of error on her cross-appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe trial court erred by granting summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs cause of action based on Ohio Revised Code Chapter 4112.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">{\u00b6 18} Both parties cite <em>Hood v. Diamond Products, Inc., </em>as authority for a claim of disability discrimination under R.C. Chapter 4112, wherein the Supreme Court of Ohio held:</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cIn order to establish a prima facie case of [disability] discrimination, the person seeking relief must demonstrate (1) that he or she was [disabled], (2) that an adverse employment action was taken by an employer, at least in part, because the individual was [disabled], and (3) that the person, though [disabled], can safely and substantially perform the essential functions of the job in question.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">{\u00b6 20} Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case for disability discrimination, the burden shifts to the defendant to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the defendant can establish a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the action, the plaintiff must show that the defendant\u2019s stated reason was a pretext for impermissible discrimination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This burden-shifting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>exercise was derived from the analysis set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">{\u00b6 21} It is uncontested that DeCesare is disabled due to her disease. This fact was admitted by the board in its answer to the complaint. The board asserts that DeCesare was unable to meet her burden of a prima facie case for disability discrimination because she was unable to prove the second or third prongs of the <em>Hood </em>test, supra. Even if it was determined that the board\u2019s refusal to allow DeCesare to be excused from teaching first period is not an adverse employment action, she would not be barred from recovery under R.C. Chapter 4112. This is because \u201cdisability discrimination [claims] under the ADA can include both an employer\u2019s taking an adverse employment action based on an employee\u2019s disability and an employer\u2019s failure to make a reasonable accommodation.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In addition, this court has noted that the Ohio Administrative Code places a duty on employers to make reasonable accommodations:</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe employer has an obligation to make a reasonable accommodation to the [disability] of an employee unless the employer can prove that such accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the conduct of employer\u2019s business.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">{\u00b6 23} The <em>Hood/McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting exercise and prima facie case requirements do not apply to failure-to-accommodate cases.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Rather, employees must demonstrate that (1) they were disabled, (2) the employer knew of the disability, and (3) they were qualified for the position, i.e., they met the prerequisites for the position and could perform the essential functions of the job with, or without, reasonable accommodations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">{\u00b6 24} In <em>Shaver, </em>the Tenth Appellate District conducted a detailed examination of federal case law regarding an employer\u2019s duty to assist an employee in finding a reasonable accommodation. Various federal courts have held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>duty ranges from participating in an interactive process with the employee, to the duty being placed on both parties, to the employer\u2019s duty being triggered only after the employee had demonstrated that a reasonable accommodation is available.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">{\u00b6 25} The Tenth Appellate District proceeded to follow the holdings of the Third and Fifth Circuits, that an employer\u2019s duty to participate in an interactive process is triggered upon an employee\u2019s request for accommodation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This holding is consistent with this court\u2019s decision in <em>Kent State Univ. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm., </em>where this court held that Kent State\u2019s minimal attempts at accommodation were not sufficient and that Kent State had a duty to provide a reasonable accommodation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Accordingly, we adopt the following test set forth by the Third Circuit and adopted by the Tenth District:</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c \u2018To show that an employer failed to participate in the interactive process, a disabled employee must demonstrate: 1) the employer knew about the employee\u2019s disability; 2) the employee requested accommodations or assistance for his or her disability; 3) the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and 4) the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer\u2019s lack of good faith.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">{\u00b6 27} There was evidence before the trial court showing that DeCesare was disabled and that she requested an accommodation. Thus, the first two prongs of the above test have been satisfied. This court has previously turned to the Administrative Code for guidance on what type of accommodations would be suitable:</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c \u2018Accommodations may take the form, for example, of providing access to the job, job restructuring, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, or a combination of any of these. <em>Job restructuring may consist, among other things, of realignment of duties, revision of job descriptions or modified and part-time work schedules.\u2019 </em>* * *\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">{\u00b6 29} By asking to be relieved of her first-period teaching assignment, DeCesare was requesting either a realignment of duties or a part-time work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>schedule. There remains genuine issues of material fact as to whether the board made a good-faith effort reasonably to accommodate DeCesare\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">{\u00b6 30} The board argues that an undue hardship would be created if it were forced to accommodate DeCesare\u2019s request. The board notes that part-time employees are not recognized by the contract between the board and the teacher\u2019s union. The board claims that there would be considerable expense and risk if the accommodation was made. Whether there was an undue hardship is also a material question of fact. Moreover, the suggestion that a reasonable accommodation cannot be made due to a conflict with the contract is irrelevant, as an employee\u2019s rights under federal and state law cannot be superseded by contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">{\u00b6 31} As there remain genuine issues of material fact on the handicap-discrimination issue, the trial court erred by entering summary judgment in favor of the board. DeCesare\u2019s assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">{\u00b6 32} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed only in respect to granting partial summary judgment in favor of DeCesare regarding the board\u2019s failure to notify her of her rights under the FMLA. We note that this judgment goes only to the issue of liability. The remaining judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b679-8\">Donald R.
