Upon arriving at the scene, Officer Ron Barber found four-year-old DeShun Moreland dead, lying on a couch with blood and brain matter surrounding him. He then found DeShun\u2019s mother, Lashawnda Aziz, dead, lying on a bedroom floor. Lashawnda was five months pregnant at the time, and her unborn child was also dead. Finally, Officer Barber found Lashawnda\u2019s three-year-old daughter, Brea Aziz, wrapped in a blanket lying in a pool of blood. Brea was alive. All of the victims had been shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-15\">{\u00b6 3} On the evening of the murders, appellant and Kevin Calwise approached Jamar Prieto to borrow a gun. Prieto gave appellant a .38 revolver and saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>appellant give it to Calwise. Appellant and Calwise planned to commit a \u201click,\u201d the street term for robbery. According to Prieto, appellant asked him to drop them off near Waddell Casey\u2019s home. Casey lived with his girlfriend Lashawnda and her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">{\u00b6 4} According to Prieto, he dropped appellant and Calwise off near Casey\u2019s home and drove around the block, waiting for appellant and Calwise to complete the lick and return to the car. Appellant and Calwise came through a backyard and got back in the car. At the time, appellant had a Glock 9. After returning to the car, appellant gave Calwise some money and the Glock 9. Appellant also returned the .38 to Prieto. Prieto noticed that the gun had been fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">{\u00b6 5} Brea survived the shooting and identified appellant as the man who shot her, Lashawnda, and DeShun. She stated that after appellant shot her, she went into the bedroom and covered up with a blanket. Appellant admitted to the police that he knew Lashawnda and her children and that Brea knew him.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">{\u00b6 6} The police recovered evidence from the scene, including numerous nine-millimeter shell casings and a lead slug. Based on information gained during the investigation, Detective Jose Morales searched Prieto\u2019s home, where he found a .38 caliber gun loaded with five rounds, a .45 caliber gun, and a nine-millimeter gun. Next, Detective Morales searched Calwise\u2019s home. There, he found a box of nine-millimeter rounds and some clothing that matched the description of what the shooters wore during the murders and robbery. Detective Morales also searched appellant\u2019s home and recovered weapons and ammunition. It was later determined that the bullets recovered from the crime scene were chemically identical to those found at appellant\u2019s house and that they were all from the same melt and made at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">{\u00b6 7} On November 19, 1998, a Mahoning County Grand Jury indicted appellant and Calwise on three counts of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B) with death-penalty specifications, one count of attempted aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2923.02(A) and 2903.01(B), and one count of aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A), all with firearm specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">{\u00b6 8} Approximately six months after the murders and robbery, Calwise confessed to his role in the crimes. He told police that he and appellant had planned to commit a lick and borrowed a gun from Prieto. He stated that he and appellant went to Casey\u2019s home armed with guns. Calwise said that appellant shot Lashawnda, DeShim, and Brea. He admitted that he stood by the door while appellant shot the victims. He also admitted shooting DeShun in the neck, but he said that he thought DeShun was already dead. Calwise further admitted searching the kitchen for drugs and receiving money and a Glock 9 for his part in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Appellant\u2019s trial began on October 1, 2001. On October 24, 2001, the jury-returned guilty verdicts on all charges. The trial court sentenced appellant on November 2, 2001. The jury recommended sentences of life imprisonment without parole on each of the three murder convictions. The court sentenced appellant to life in prison without parole on each of Counts 1, 2, and 3. On Counts 4 and 5, the court sentenced appellant to ten-year prison terms. Additionally, the court sentenced appellant to three-year prison terms on each of the five firearm specifications. The court ordered appellant to serve all sentences consecutively. Appellant filed his timely notice of appeal on November 29, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant raises three assignments of error, the first of which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cIt was error to admit the taped confession of Kevin Calwise in evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">{\u00b6 12} At trial, plaintiff-appellee, the state of Ohio, called Calwise as a witness. Calwise refused to testify. This took appellee by surprise. Calwise had already been convicted of the murders and robbery and had testified at his own trial. Even upon the court\u2019s order for him to testify, Calwise refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">{\u00b6 13} When it became clear that Calwise would not testify, appellee sought to introduce his videotaped confession. Several months after he was arrested, Calwise began to contact Detective Morales. Detective Morales refused to speak with him, telling Calwise that he could not communicate with him without his attorney present. After several requests by Calwise to speak with Detective Morales without his attorney, Detective Morales contacted the prosecuting attorney\u2019s office. An assistant prosecutor told Detective Morales that he could speak with Calwise as long as he made clear to Calwise his rights and Calwise knowingly and voluntarily waived those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">{\u00b6 14} Upon this advice, Detective Morales met with Calwise without his attorney present. Calwise was informed repeatedly of his rights and repeatedly waived them. Calwise then gave Detective Morales a detailed account of the robbery and shootings, incriminating both himself and appellant. Calwise stated that he and appellant had a plan to commit a lick and went together to the Lansdowne home. He said that appellant took Lashawnda to a back room and he heard two shots. He also implicated appellant as both Brea\u2019s and DeShun\u2019s shooter. After appellant shot DeShun, Calwise said, appellant told him to shoot \u201cthe little dude.\u201d So he too shot DeShun. Calwise contended that he believed DeShun was already dead when he shot him. Calwise also admitted to looking through the kitchen cupboards for drugs and standing watch by the front door. Following the shootings, Calwise said the two ran out of the house to Prieto\u2019s waiting car. For his part in the crimes, appellant gave Calwise $1,000 and a Glock 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>{\u00b6 15} After giving his confession, Calwise accompanied Detective Morales, Detective Jerry Maietta, and Captain Kane to the Lansdowne home. At the house, Calwise gave a detailed description of how the furniture was arranged and where everyone was on the night of the robbery and shootings. He walked the police through the events of the night, showing them how he looked through the cupboards, where he held his gun, and the path he and appellant took out of the house to the getaway car. This reenactment of the crimes was also videotaped as part of Calwise\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">{\u00b6 16} Appellant contends that the court erred in admitting Calwise\u2019s confession. He relies on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s statement that a nontestifying eodefendant\u2019s statements implicating a defendant are presumptively unreliable and their admission violates the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause, citing <em>Douglas v. Alabama </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934, and <em>Lee v. Illinois </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 530, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 90 L.Ed.2d 514. Appellant also points to the court\u2019s discussion considering the scope of the federal hearsay exception for statements against penal interest. The court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cIn our view, the most faithful reading of Rule 804(b)(3) is that it does not allow admission of non-self-inculpatory statements, even if they are made within a broader narrative that is generally self-inculpatory. The district court may not just assume for purposes of Rule 804(b)(3) that a statement is self-inculpatory because it is part of a fuller confession, and this is especially true when the statement implicates someone else. \u2018[T]he arrest statements of a codefendant have traditionally been viewed with special suspicion. Due to his strong motivation to implicate the defendant and to exonerate himself, a codefendant\u2019s statements about what the defendant said or did are less credible than ordinary hearsay evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williamson v. United States </em>(1994), 512 U.S. 594, 600-601, 114 S.Ct. 2431, 129 L.Ed.2d 476, quoting <em>Lee v. Illinois </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 530, 541, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 90 L.Ed.2d 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">{\u00b6 18} In short, only those portions of a statement that directly inculpate the declarant bear sufficient indicia of reliability for admission in evidence. The greater portion of the statement is not admissible against the codefendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">{\u00b6 19} Next, appellant points to the court\u2019s holding that accomplice confessions that inculpate a defendant are not within a firmly rooted hearsay exception, citing <em>Lilly v. Virginia </em>(1999), 527 U.S. 116, 134, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117. Appellant argues that since Calwise\u2019s confession was not within a firmly rooted hearsay exception, appellee was required to prove that it contained indicia of reliability by virtue of its inherent trustworthiness, not by reference to other evidence. He contends that Calwise\u2019s statement was not inherently trustworthy. He points out that Calwise had been under arrest for six months before making his statement. He notes that Calwise\u2019s attorney had informed Calwise of DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>evidence linking him to the crime scene. He also contends that the detective who questioned Calwise used leading questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">{\u00b6 20} Finally, appellant argues that the trial court applied state law when it should have applied federal law. He asserts that the trial court relied on the self-inculpatory nature of the statement to find particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. This, appellant claims, is prohibited by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">{\u00b6 21} The admission and exclusion of evidence are within the broad discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Mays </em>(1996), 108 Ohio App.3d 598, 617, 671 N.E.2d 553. Abuse of discretion is more than a mere error of judgment; it is conduct that is arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unconscionable. <em>State v. Moreland </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 61, 552 N.E.2d 894.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">{\u00b6 22} The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d In <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 721 N.E.2d 52, the Ohio Supreme Court was faced with the question whether Madrigal\u2019s right to confrontation was violated when the court admitted an accomplice\u2019s taped statement that implicated Madrigal in a robbery and murder and implicated the accomplice as going with Madrigal but waiting in the car. In discussing the standard to apply, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe state may deny the accused the right to cross-examination without violating the Confrontation Clause if the court deems the proffered out-of-court statements to be \u2018so trustworthy that adversarial testing can be expected to add little to [the statements\u2019] reliability.\u2019 <em>White v. Illinois </em>(1992), 502 U.S. 346, 357, 112 S.Ct. 736, 743, 116 L.Ed.2d 848, 860. That is, the right to confrontation is not absolute and \u2018does not necessarily prohibit the admission of hearsay statements against a criminal defendant.\u2019 <em>Idaho v. Wright </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 805, 813, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3145, 111 L.Ed.2d 638, 651. Hearsay statements are deemed sufficiently reliable to allow their admission without the benefit of cross-examination when the statements (1) \u2018[fall] within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,\u2019 or (2) contain \u2018 \u201cadequate indicia of reliability.\u201d \u2019 <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, 608.\u201d <em>Madrigal, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 385, 721 N.E.2d 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">{\u00b6 24} The court explained, however, that the <em>Roberts </em>decision no longer allowed a court to find that an accomplice\u2019s statement against penal interest, in the declarant\u2019s absence, offered by the prosecution, categorically satisfied the Confrontation Clause. Id. at 386-387, 721 N.E.2d 52, citing <em>Lilly, </em>527 U.S. 116, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117. Therefore, in order to admit an accomplice\u2019s statement against interest, offered by the prosecution, the court must first find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>that the statement contains adequate indicia of reliability. Id. at 386, 721 N.E.2d 52. But courts have consistently considered these statements as \u201cpresumptively unreliable.\u201d See id. at 386-387, 721 N.E.2d 52; <em>Lilly, </em>527 U.S. at 130, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117; <em>Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 541, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 90 L.Ed.2d 514. The <em>Madrigal </em>court commented on this presumption of unreliability:</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cWhile the Supreme Court has clearly stated that \u2018the presumption of unreliability that attaches to codefendants\u2019 confessions * * * may be rebutted,\u2019 <em>Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 543, 106 S.Ct. at 2063, 90 L.Ed.2d at 527, the more recent <em>Lilly </em>plurality cautions us that \u2018[i]t is highly unlikely that the presumptive unreliability that attaches to accomplices\u2019 confessions that shift or spread blame can be effectively rebutted when the statements are given under conditions that implicate the core concerns of the old ex parte affidavit practice \u2014 that is, when the government is involved in the statements\u2019 production, and when the statements describe past events and have not been subjected to adversarial testing.\u2019 <em>Lilly, </em>527 U.S. at 137, 119 S.Ct. at 1900, 144 L.Ed.2d at 135.\u201d <em>Madrigal, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 387, 721 N.E.2d 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">{\u00b6 26} After reviewing the law on accomplice statements, the <em>Madrigal </em>court analyzed the state\u2019s arguments in support of the trustworthiness of the accomplice\u2019s statement. The court determined that the state\u2019s only support for the statement\u2019s trustworthiness was that other evidence corroborated the accomplice\u2019s statement. The court noted, however, that the <em>Lilly </em>plurality held that corroborating evidence is irrelevant. Id., citing <em>Lilly, </em>527 U.S. at 137, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117. The court concluded that the relevant circumstances included \u201c <em>\u2018only those that surround </em>the making of the statement and that render the declarant particularly worthy of belief.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)\u201d Id., quoting <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 819, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638. Relying on <em>Wright, </em>the court stated that the circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness are those that existed when the statement was made and do not include those that may be added by using hindsight. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">{\u00b6 27} The <em>Madrigal </em>court also noted that the statement indicated a desire by the accomplice to minimize his involvement by attempting \u201cto portray himself as an innocent bystander\u201d and place the sole blame on Madrigal. Id., 87 Ohio St.3d at 384, 388, 721 N.E.2d 52. Additionally, the court noted that Madrigal\u2019s defense tried to place the blame for the crimes on the accomplice, which made the need for cross-examination more crucial. The court concluded that the admission of the accomplice\u2019s statement violated Madrigal\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights. But it found the error was harmless due to other eyewitness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">{\u00b6 28} We must now apply the law set out by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Madrigal </em>in analyzing Calwise\u2019s confession. As instructed by <em>Madrigal, </em>the trial court explained that it was not permitted to use corroborating evidence to find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>that Calwise\u2019s confession was reliable and would not do so. The court demonstrated that it applied the law correctly, noting that had Calwise stated in his confession that he merely accompanied appellant but did not participate in the crimes, the confession would not be admissible. But the court went on to observe that in this case, Calwise\u2019s confession implicated both appellant and Calwise, thus demonstrating its reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">{\u00b6 29} The court stated several other factors it found to indicate reliability. First, the court stated that one of its reasons for allowing the tape was Calwise\u2019s reenactment of the crime at the scene. The court noted that Calwise\u2019s detail of what was where, who was where, and how things occurred demonstrated reliability. It said that the reenactment \u201cclearly shows someone who was there and someone who knew what happened there and helps to render that statement admissible.\u201d Second, the court pointed to the fact that the state did not offer Calwise a deal for his confession. Third, it took note of the fact that it was Calwise himself who contacted Detective Morales to give his confession. Here the court continued to follow <em>Madrigal\u2019s </em>dictates, along with those of <em>Lilly </em>and <em>Wright, </em>because it considered the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement that rendered Calwise particularly worthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">{\u00b6 30} The trial court also took guidance from <em>State v. Marshall </em>(2000), 136 Ohio App.3d 742, 737 N.E.2d 1005, in making its decision. In <em>Marshall, </em>the Eighth District held that a \u201cvoluntary confession, not made pursuant to a deal with the prosecution, and which implicates both the accomplice and the defendant has sufficient indicia of reliability.\u201d Id. at 748, 737 N.E.2d 1005. The <em>Marshall </em>court reversed the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude an accomplice\u2019s confession in a robbery and murder. In finding that the confession contained particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, the court relied on several factors. It pointed to the fact the accomplice\u2019s entire narrative was self-inculpatory, in that he admitted to assisting in the robbery and acting as the lookout. The court noted that the accomplice was not under the influence when he made the statement and was not responding to leading questions. Finally, although the police initially said they might be able to cut him some slack if he confessed, they did not offer the accomplice a deal in exchange for his confession. Thus, the court concluded the introduction of the accomplice\u2019s statement did not violate the defendant\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">{\u00b6 31} All of the same factors the court relied on in <em>Marshall </em>in finding-particularized guarantees of trustworthiness are present in this case. Several of the factors were discussed above. Additionally, there is no indication that Calwise was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. And Calwise\u2019s entire narrative was self-inculpatory. Furthermore, Detective Morales asked only a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>leading questions after Calwise volunteered the information first. Most of his statement was in narrative form.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">{\u00b6 32} The court also took an additional safeguard in allowing appellee to play Calwise\u2019s confession for the jury. The court gave the jury an instruction on Calwise\u2019s credibility before allowing appellee to play the tape. It instructed:</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cThe testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his complicity in the crimes, his moral turpitude or his self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject to grave suspicion and require that it be weighed with great caution. It is for you as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and worth or its lack of quality and worth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">{\u00b6 34} Thus, the court made an effort to inform the jury that it should view Calwise\u2019s statement with great caution.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">{\u00b6 35} Appellant contends that Calwise\u2019s confession was inherently unreliable given the surrounding circumstances. During the investigation, the police recovered some clothes from Calwise\u2019s house, which they sent for DNA testing. The DNA results came back on or about March 29, 1999. The results revealed that some of DeShun\u2019s blood was on Calwise\u2019s clothes. Appellant alleges that Calwise learned of the DNA results, and because he knew DeShun\u2019s blood was found on his clothes, he sought to talk with Detective Morales in order to explain why DeShun\u2019s blood was found on his clothes and otherwise minimize his involvement. Detective Morales testified that he informed Calwise\u2019s father that blood test results had come back positive. Shortly thereafter, Calwise gave his confession. Additionally, Calwise\u2019s attorney testified that he informed Calwise of the DNA evidence linking him to the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">{\u00b6 36} Appellant alleges that Calwise gave his confession in an effort to minimize his own involvement and place the blame on appellant. He tries to demonstrate this theory with the above timeline of events. Yet the timeline does not support appellant\u2019s theory. Calwise had been in jail for several months when he began contacting Detective Morales. Detective Morales testified that appellant began contacting him, wanting to talk, sometime in February 1999. Appellant tried several more times to talk with Detective Morales before the DNA results were known. Each time appellant contacted him, Detective Morales told him he needed to speak with his attorney. After appellant persisted, Detective Morales contacted the prosecuting attorney\u2019s office seeking advice on whether to talk to Calwise. Upon advice from the office, Detective Morales met with Calwise on April 20, 1999, and Calwise gave his confession. Thus, if appellant\u2019s theory had merit, Calwise would not have started contacting Detective Morales until after the DNA results linking him to the crime scene were known. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Furthermore, even though Calwise implicated appellant as the principal shooter, he hardly minimized his own involvement. He admitted to shooting a four-year-old boy in the neck, standing watch while appellant shot three people, and planning and carrying out an armed robbery. Accordingly, the circumstances surrounding Calwise\u2019s confession were not inherently unreliable, as appellant suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">{\u00b6 37} Next, appellant argues that the court erred in applying state law instead of federal law. The court properly applied both state and federal law. It relied on <em>Madrigal, </em>a recent Ohio Supreme Court case, which in turn relied on a number of United States Supreme Court cases in reaching its decision including, <em>Lilly, </em>527 U.S. 116, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117; <em>White, </em>502 U.S. 346, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848; <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638; and <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">{\u00b6 38} Finally, in his reply brief, appellant argues that the police violated Calwise\u2019s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to counsel when they took his statement. But appellant does not have standing to raise this issue. Generally, one can assert violations only of his own constitutional rights and not those of third parties. <em>State v. Bencic </em>(May 3, 1995), 9th Dist. No. 16895, 1995 WL 256188, citing <em>Warth v. Seldin </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 490, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343. This rule applies in the context of constitutional criminal procedure. <em>Bencic, </em>9th Dist. No. 16895, citing <em>Rakas v. Illinois </em>(1978), 439 U.S. 128, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387. Thus, appellant cannot argue that Calwise\u2019s constitutional rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">{\u00b6 39} Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Calwise\u2019s confession, and appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">{\u00b6 40} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cIt was an abuse of discretion and error to admit the testimony of Brea Aziz.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">{\u00b642} Brea was an eyewitness to the crimes. She was able to identify appellant as the one who shot her, Lashawnda, and DeShun. At the time of the shootings, Brea was three and a half years old. Appellee planned to call her as a witness at trial. Appellant filed a motion challenging Brea\u2019s competence based on her young age. The court held a hearing and questioned Brea. At that time, Brea was four years old. It determined she was competent to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">{\u00b6 43} Appellant again raised the issue of Brea\u2019s competence at trial. The court briefly requestioned Brea, then age six, and again determined her to be a competent witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>{\u00b6 44} Appellant argues that Brea was incompetent as a witness. Appellant contends that the court\u2019s examinations of Brea did not deal with her ability to receive accurate impressions of fact about which she would have to testify or with her ability to recollect those impressions of fact and her ability to communicate what she observed. He also asserts that Brea\u2019s examination established that she was generally incapable of accurate impressions and lacked the ability to recollect and relate what she experienced.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cEvery person is competent to be a witness except * * * children under ten years of age, who appear incapable of receiving just impressions of the facts and transactions respecting which they are examined, or of relating them truly.\u201d Evid.R. 601(A). When presented with a child witness under ten, the trial court must conduct a voir dire examination of the child to determine whether the child is competent to testify. <em>State v. Frazier </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 247, 251, 574 N.E.2d 483. The competence determination is within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion and will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">{\u00b6 46} When evaluating a child\u2019s competence, the trial court must consider \u201c(1) the child\u2019s ability to receive accurate impressions of fact or to observe acts about which he or she will testify, (2) the child\u2019s ability to recollect those impressions or observations, (3) the child\u2019s ability to communicate what was observed, (4) the child\u2019s understanding of truth and falsity and (5) the child\u2019s appreciation of his or her responsibility to be truthful.\u201d <em>Frazier, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 247, 574 N.E.2d 483, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">{\u00b6 47} In the present case, the trial court conducted a lengthy interview with Brea. The court, appellant\u2019s counsel, and appellee all questioned Brea. At the time, Brea was four years old. The court asked Brea what she liked to watch on television, and she stated that she liked \u201cRugrats.\u201d The court asked her who was in the Rugrats, and Brea correctly stated, \u201cAngelica and Tommy and Chuckie.\u201d The court asked Brea if she believed in Santa Claus, to which she responded, \u201cYes.\u201d The court asked her if she remembered anything she got for Christmas last year. Brea told the court she got \u201cA Bug\u2019s Life\u201d and some coffee cups, which she still plays with. The court next asked Brea what she did for her birthday. Brea told the court that she got a bus. When the court asked if she had a party, Brea said, \u201cYeah,\u201d and said that her friend Dar\u00edan came over.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">{\u00b6 48} Brea\u2019s responses to the above questions demonstrated her ability to accurately receive impressions of fact, to recollect those impressions, and to relate her impressions to the court. She demonstrated that she remembered things that took place at Christmastime (approximately eight months before the hearing), at her birthday party, and on television. All of these recollections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>showed that Brea was able to observe something, remember it, and convey her memory to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">{\u00b6 49} Brea also demonstrated that she knew the difference between truth and falsity and understood that she should tell the truth. The court asked Brea what her mommy told her about telling the truth. She responded that if she tells the truth, she will not get a whopping. Brea stated that she tells the truth. When the court asked Brea if she ever told a fib, she said no because if she did, she would get a whopping. Later, the judge again inquired about Brea\u2019s ability to differentiate between truth and falsity and her obligation to tell the truth. The following colloquy took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cQ. Do you know when you come to a courtroom that you have to tell the truth?</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cQ. What is the truth, can you tell me what it is?</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cA. Good word.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cQ. All right. Do you know what happens if you don\u2019t tell the truth when you come to court?</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cA. You will get a whopping.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cQ. Did you ever get a whopping?</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cA. Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cQ. Do you like that?</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cA. No, I don\u2019t like whoppings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-15\">{\u00b6 60} Appellee also questioned Brea to determine whether she knew what a lie was. Appellee asked Brea what color her slip was. Brea said it was white. Appellee asked her if he said her slip was blue, would he be telling the truth or a lie. Brea stated it would be a lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-16\">{\u00b6 61} Brea\u2019s responses to these questions demonstrated her understanding of truth and falsity and her appreciation of her responsibility to be truthful. The court took time to make certain that Brea knew she had to tell the truth and that she knew what truth was. Additionally, appellee\u2019s questions further demonstrated that Brea understood the difference between the truth and a lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-17\">{\u00b6 62} Appellant points to some of Brea\u2019s incorrect responses in arguing that she was incompetent. Specifically, he claims that since she incorrectly stated when her birthday was and did not know how old her brother was, this demonstrated her incompetence. Other courts have held child witnesses competent to testify even though they answered some questions wrong. For example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>in <em>State v. Goins </em>(Dec. 3, 2001), 12th Dist. No. CA2000-09-190, 2001 WL 1525298, the seven-year-old witness did not know her grandmother\u2019s last name, what day of the week or what month it was, thought summer came before spring, stated that her birthday, which was November 15, was in the summertime, and could not remember what she had received for Easter that year. Nonetheless, the court found her competent to testify, noting that she answered other questions correctly. And in <em>State v. Brooks </em>(Oct. 26, 2001), 2d Dist. No. 18502, 2001 WL 1295285, the court found the four-year-old witness competent even though she was unable to state the sequence of months and the time frames of the holidays, and was unable to recall the name of her school or her teacher. The court stated that the fact that the child could not remember certain generalities did not render her incompetent to testify. As was the case in <em>Goins </em>and <em>Brooks, </em>the court in this case conducted a thorough examination of Brea, which revealed that she met all five elements of the <em>Frazier </em>test. Although Brea answered some questions incorrectly, she answered many questions correctly, such as her brother\u2019s, sister\u2019s, and mother\u2019s names, the characters on a television show, what color Barney is, and what she received for Christmas.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">{\u00b6 63} Appellant also points to Brea\u2019s imaginative responses to support his incompetence argument. Particularly, he refers to her statement that she believes in Santa Claus, a point during the questioning when she placed her fingers over her eyes and pretended she was looking through binoculars, and her statement that she sees monsters like Freddie Kruger and the bogeyman. When counsel brought up concerns about Brea\u2019s \u201cfigments of imagination,\u201d the court responded:</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cShe is three years old, four years old. I would be disappointed if she didn\u2019t have an imagination. You know, one of the things that I have to consider in all of this is how old this child is, how tender she is. And certainly she may very well be someone with an imagination, someone who acts and thinks like a child. The determination I have to make is whether or not she can tell accurately the story about what happened to her on the night in question or the day in question, whatever it is. And all those other things are part of her makeup, certainly, but they are not things that disqualify her. In my interpretation they may qualify her because she appears to be a normal child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">{\u00b6 65} The trial court was correct in its statement to counsel regarding Brea\u2019s imaginative responses. The Fifth District found a child witness competent to testify regardless of his imaginative beliefs that the \u201cPokemon\u201d cartoon characters were real and that TV wrestling was real. <em>State v. Reardon, </em>5th Dist. No. 2001AP080082, 2002-Ohio-2537, 2002 WL 1025488. Four-year-old children generally believe in such things as Santa Claus and the bogeyman and frequently play make-believe. Brea\u2019s responses did not indicate that she was unable to perceive or relate facts or that she did not understand her responsibility to be truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>{\u00b6 66} Finally, appellant contends that the court could not find Brea competent because it failed to question her about the shootings. The court in <em>Brooks, </em>2d Dist. No. 18502, addressed this issue and concluded that while it would have been helpful if the trial court had questioned the child about the crime, it was not necessary in the court\u2019s competence determination. The court, quoting <em>State v. Mayhew </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 622, 629, 594 N.E.2d 1133, stated, \u201c \u2018Once the court determines that a person can properly recount events from the past and knows that she should tell the truth in court, she is competent.\u2019 \u201d Id. In the present case, the court determined Brea\u2019s competence by asking her questions that demonstrated that she could recount and relate past events and that she knew she should tell the truth in court. Therefore, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in failing to question Brea about the shootings.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">{\u00b6 67} Hence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding Brea competent to testily. The trial judge who saw Brea and listened to her testify was in a far better position to judge her competence than this court, which only reads her testimony from the record. <em>State v. Clark </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 466, 470, 644 N.E.2d 331. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">{\u00b6 68} Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cThe court erred when it failed to suppress testimony concerning an out of court identification of Anderson by Brea Aziz.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">{\u00b6 70} At trial, Detective Morales testified regarding a photo lineup that he showed Brea while she was in the hospital. The lineup consisted of six photographs, including one of appellant. Detective Morales asked Brea if she could pick out the man who shot her. Brea identified appellant. Detective Morales switched the pictures around several times and asked Brea the same question. Each time she picked out appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">{\u00b6 71} Appellant filed a motion to suppress Brea\u2019s identification of him. On September 15, 1999, the court held a hearing on the motion. After hearing testimony from Detective Morales, the court overruled the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">{\u00b6 72} Appellant argues that at the time of the photo lineup, Brea was not competent as a witness. He also argues that her identification constituted hearsay. Appellant contends that the admission of hearsay statements presupposes that the speaker had the qualifications of a witness, including competence. Appellant contends that due to Brea\u2019s incompetence, the trial court should have suppressed Detective Morales\u2019s testimony concerning Brea\u2019s out-of-court identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">{\u00b6 73} When reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress, an appellate court accepts the trial court\u2019s factual findings and relies upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>the trial court\u2019s ability to assess the witness\u2019s credibility, but independently determines, without deference to the trial court, whether the trial court applied the appropriate legal standard. <em>State v. Rice </em>(1998), 129 Ohio App.3d 91, 94, 717 N.E.2d 351. A trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress will not be disturbed when it is supported by substantial credible evidence. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">{\u00b6 74} First, Brea\u2019s identification of appellant was not hearsay. A statement is not hearsay if it is a prior statement by a witness and \u201c[t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is * * * one of identification of a person soon after perceiving him, if the circumstances demonstrate the reliability of the prior identification.\u201d Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">{\u00b6 75} Brea testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination. Additionally, her statement was one of identification of a person soon after perceiving him (the shootings occurred on November 8, 1998, and Brea identified appellant on November 12, 1998). Finally, the circumstances surrounding the identification demonstrate its reliability. Brea was still hospitalized. Detective Morales and Detective Maietta went to Brea\u2019s hospital room to talk with her and brought the photo lineup. The lineup contained six pictures, all of men with characteristics similar to appellant\u2019s. Appellant has not alleged that the photo array was unduly suggestive in any way. Before showing her the photo array, Detective Morales asked Brea who shot her. Brea stated that \u201cAnt\u201d shot her. Appellant goes by the nickname \u201cAnt\u201d and even has it tattooed on his arm. When Detective Morales showed Brea the photo array, she identified appellant. Detective Morales switched the order of the photos several times, and each time Brea identified appellant. Since Brea\u2019s identification met the requirements of Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c), it was not hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">{\u00b6 76} Additionally, as discussed in appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, the court held a thorough hearing on the issue of Brea\u2019s competence. The hearing took place approximately nine months after she identified appellant. The basis for appellant\u2019s argument is that the court erred in finding Brea competent at that hearing. We have already determined that the court did not abuse its discretion in ruling Brea a competent witness. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">{\u00b6 77} For the reasons stated above, the trial court\u2019s judgment is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b833-10\">Vukovich and Ford, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b833-11\">Donald R.
