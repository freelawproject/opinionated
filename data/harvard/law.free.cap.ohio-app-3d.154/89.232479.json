McEvoy and his former employer, Cooper Energy Services (\u201cCooper\u201d), entered into the agreement after McEvoy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>sustained a work-related injury. In order to compensate McEvoy, Cooper, a self-insured employer under Ohio workers\u2019 compensation laws, agreed to provide future periodic payments by purchasing an annuity for him. In particular, the agreement provided for McEvoy to receive $10,000 in 2002, $12,000 in 2004, $15,000 in 2007, $20,000 in 2010, and $25,000 in 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">{\u00b6 3} McEvoy and Cooper submitted the foregoing agreement to the Industrial Commission, which reviewed it and lodged no objection. Cooper then purchased the annuity from Liberty Life. Thereafter, McEvoy decided to transfer his periodic payment rights under the annuity to Stratcap Investments, Inc. (\u201cStratcap\u201d), in exchange for a reduced, lump-sum payment. Pursuant to the Ohio Structured Settlement Transfer Act (\u201cTransfer Act\u201d), R.C. 2323.58 et seq., Stratcap filed a petition in the probate division, seeking approval of the proposed transfer. After hearing argument, the probate division filed a March 4, 2003 decision and entry, approving the transfer. Liberty Life then filed a timely appeal, advancing four assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">{\u00b6 4} In its first assignment of error, Liberty Life argues that the probate division lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain Stratcap\u2019s petition. In support, Liberty Life cites R.C. 2323.584(A), which under certain circumstances authorizes the probate division of a common pleas court to approve the transfer of \u201cstructured settlement payment rights.\u201d Liberty Life argues, however, that the settlement agreement between McEvoy and Cooper does not qualify as a \u201cstructured settlement\u201d within the meaning of the Transfer Act. Based on its belief that McEvoy\u2019s agreement with Cooper does not qualify as a \u201cstructured settlement\u201d under the Transfer Act, Liberty Life argues that the probate division lacked jurisdiction over Stratcap\u2019s petition. In short, Liberty Life\u2019s argument is illustrated by the following syllogism: (1) the Transfer Act gives the probate division subject-matter jurisdiction to review a proposed transfer of \u201cstructured settlement payment rights\u201d; (2) the agreement between McEvoy and Cooper does not qualify as a \u201cstructured settlement\u201d under the Transfer Act; (3) therefore, the probate division lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">{\u00b6 5} Upon review, we find the foregoing argument to be persuasive. Although Liberty Life did not raise its jurisdictional argument before the probate division, it is well settled that a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time, even for the first time on appeal. <em>Jenkins v. Keller </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St.2d 122, 126, 35 O.O.2d 147, 216 N.E.2d 379. As a court of limited jurisdiction, the probate division may exercise only such jurisdiction as is expressly granted to it by the Ohio Constitution or a statute. <em>Dumas v. Estate of Dumas </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 405, 408, 627 N.E.2d 978. The jurisdiction of the probate division is set forth in R.C. 2101.24(A)(1), which identifies various types of cases over which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>it has subject-matter jurisdiction. None of those types of cases involves approving the transfer of rights under any settlement agreement. We note, however, that R.C. 2101.24(A)(2) contains an additional grant of jurisdiction where another section of the Revised Code expressly confers subject-matter jurisdiction on the probate division. The purported basis of the probate division\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction in this case was the Transfer Act. After examining that legislation, however, we conclude that it does not confer subject-matter jurisdiction on the probate division to approve a transfer of the payment rights at issue herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">{\u00b6 6} When a \u201cstructured settlement agreement\u201d has not been approved by an Ohio court, the Transfer Act provides that \u201c[a] person shall file an application [under the Transfer Act] for the approval in advance of a transfer of structured settlement payment rights in the probate division of the court of common pleas of the county in which the payee, the structured settlement obligor, or the annuity issuer resides.\u201d R.C. 2823.584. Notably, the Transfer Act defines the phrase \u201cstructured settlement\u201d as \u201can arrangement for periodic payments of damages for injury to a person that is established by a settlement or a court judgment in resolution of a tort claim.\u201d R.C. 2323.58(L). Thus, only when an agreement involving the settlement of a tort claim has not been approved by an Ohio court does R.C. 2323.584 provide for filing an application in the probate division for advance approval of a transfer of payment rights thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">{\u00b6 7} It is axiomatic that a tort claim is a claim for relief in a tort action. A \u201ctort action\u201d is defined by R.C. 2323.56 as a \u201ccivil action for damages for injury to person.\u201d Pursuant to Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, workers\u2019 compensation is in lieu of all other rights to compensation, and an employer who complies with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is not obligated to respond in damages in common law or by statute for a worker\u2019s occupational injury. See R.C. 4123.74. Indeed, the Ohio Supreme Court has long recognized that when an injured worker pursues a workers\u2019 compensation claim, he relinquishes his common-law tort remedy and accepts lower benefits coupled with a greater assurance of recovery. See, e.g., <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chemicals, Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 608, 614, 23 O.O.3d 504, 433 N.E.2d 572. Therefore, we agree with Liberty Life\u2019s assertion that a workers\u2019 compensation claim is not a form of tort claim to which the Transfer Act applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">{\u00b6 8} In the present case, the record demonstrates that McEvoy settled a workers\u2019 compensation claim with Cooper, his self-insured employer. Given that McEvoy\u2019s settlement agreement involved a workers\u2019 compensation claim rather than a tort claim, the Transfer Act did not grant the probate division subject-matter jurisdiction to entertain Stratcap\u2019s petition for approval of the transfer of payment rights under the agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>entry approving the transfer must be vacated for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">{\u00b6 9} In opposition to the foregoing conclusion, Stratcap reasons that R.C. 2323.584 gives the probate division jurisdiction over <em>applications </em>for the approval of a transfer of structured settlement payment rights. Because it styled its petition as such an application and cited the Transfer Act, Stratcap contends that the probate division had subject-matter jurisdiction to hear and to determine its petition. According to Stratcap, if the settlement agreement at issue involves a workers\u2019 compensation claim rather than a tort claim, that fact would go to the <em>merits </em>of its petition rather than to the probate division\u2019s <em>jurisdiction </em>to entertain it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">{\u00b6 10} Upon review, we find Stratcap\u2019s argument to be unpersuasive. The language of R.C. 2323.584 suggests that the settlement of a tort claim was a jurisdictional prerequisite to the probate division\u2019s entertaining Stratcap\u2019s petition. As noted above, the relevant statutory language provides: \u201cIf the structured settlement agreement was not approved by an Ohio court, a person shall file an application * * * for the approval in advance of a transfer of structured settlement payment rights in the probate division of the court of common pleas[.]\u201d The first part of this sentence plainly presupposes the existence of a \u201cstructured settlement,\u201d which the Transfer Act defines as involving the settlement of a tort claim. See R.C. 2323.58(L). Because the Transfer Act applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>only to \u201cstructured settlements,\u201d and because R.C. 2323.584(A) authorizes the probate division only to approve or disapprove the transfer of payment rights under a \u201cstructured settlement,\u201d we conclude that the existence of a \u201cstructured settlement\u201d (i.e., the settlement of a tort claim) is a jurisdictional requirement. Although Stratcap filed an application that it styled as a petition for the approval of a transfer of \u201cstructured settlement payment rights,\u201d the underlying settlement agreement actually involved a workers\u2019 compensation claim, not a tort claim. Therefore, Stratcap\u2019s filing fell outside the scope of the probate division\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction, regardless of how it was styled. Cf. <em>Zelenak v. Indus. Comm., </em>148 Ohio App.3d 589, 2002-Ohio-3887, 774 N.E.2d 769, \u00b6 15 (observing that \u201chow appellants choose to characterize or phrase their claims is not dispositive\u201d with regard to where an action is properly filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">{\u00b6 11} Stratcap next argues that R.C. 2323.58(L) does not require a settlement to involve resolution of a tort claim in order for the Transfer Act to apply. As we have recognized, R.C. 2323.58(L) defines a \u201cstructured settlement\u201d as \u201can arrangement for periodic payments of damages for injury to a person that is established by a settlement or a court judgment in resolution of a tort claim.\u201d Under this definition, Stratcap reasons that a \u201cstructured settlement\u201d can arise from either (1) a settlement or (2) a court judgment in resolution of a tort claim. We reject this reading of the statute. In our view, a more natural reading of the language is that a \u201cstructured settlement\u201d is established by (1) a settlement or a court judgment that is (2) in resolution of a tort claim. Under the interpretation advanced by Stratcap, a \u201cstructured settlement\u201d would arise from the settlement of any type of claim or from a court judgment resolving only a tort claim. Such a distinction has no readily apparent justification and could not have been intended by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">{\u00b6 12} Stratcap next attempts to distinguish a tort \u201caction\u201d from a tort \u201cclaim.\u201d Although the workers\u2019 compensation statutes precluded McEvoy from bringing a tort \u201caction\u201d against Cooper, Stratcap insists that what he settled still may be considered a tort \u201cclaim\u201d for purposes of the Transfer Act. We find this argument unpersuasive. The distinction between a claim and an action has nothing to do with the subject matter of the dispute. The existence of a legal \u201cclaim\u201d is a precursor to the filing of a judicial \u201caction,\u201d which may be composed of many claims. See <em>United States v. Atlas Lederer Co. </em>(S.D.Ohio 2000), 97 F.Supp.2d 830, 833 (discussing the distinction between an \u201caction\u201d and a \u201cclaim\u201d). As a result of this state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws, McEvoy possessed only a workers\u2019 compensation claim against Cooper, not a tort claim. Therefore, we find no basis for treating the claim as a tort claim under the Transfer Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">{\u00b6 13} Finally, we reject Stratcap\u2019s arguments that \u201cfor all practical purposes\u201d McEvoy\u2019s settlement with Cooper involved a tort claim and that \u201cpublic policy\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>supports treating the settlement as one involving a tort claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Regardless of how many ways Stratcap presents its argument, we remain convinced that a workers\u2019 compensation claim is not a tort claim, and that McEvoy settled a workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">{\u00b6 14} Based on the reasoning and citation of authority set forth above, we conclude that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to file its March 4, 2003 decision and entry approving Stratcap\u2019s petition, and we sustain Liberty Life\u2019s first assignment of error. In light of our determination that the trial court acted without subject-matter jurisdiction, we have no occasion to address Liberty Life\u2019s other three assignments of error, which concern the merits of the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">{\u00b6 15} The trial court\u2019s March 4, 2003 judgment entry is hereby reversed and vacated for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Judgment reversed and vacated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b123-8\">Grady and Frederick N. Young, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-8\">. Although adverse parties may not confer subject-matter jurisdiction on a court by consent, the Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that they may admit the existence of facts which, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>turn, demonstrate the existence of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Beatrice Foods Co. v. Porterfield </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St.2d 50, 54, 59 O.O.2d 76, 282 N.E.2d 355; see, also, <em>Sturgill </em>v. <em>Sturgill </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 94, 572 N.E.2d 178. In the present case, however, the record does not reflect that the parties admitted jurisdictional facts sufficient to establish the subject-matter jurisdiction of the probate division. The record is devoid of any explicit agreement between the parties that McEvoy's settlement with Cooper involved the settlement of a tort claim. The probate division and the parties simply appear to have overlooked the issue. In any event, whether the settlement agreement at issue involved a tort claim or a workers\u2019 compensation claim is at least a mixed question of fact and law; and a court is not bound by a stipulation insofar as it relates to a question of law. A court may even disregard stipulations of fact where the stipulated facts are controverted by competent, credible evidence. <em>Turner v. Turner </em>(Oct. 18, 1995), Clark App. No. 94-CA-57, 1995 WL 634382; see, also, <em>Mead\u2019s Bakery, Inc. v. C.I.R. </em>(C.A.5, 1966), 364 F.2d 101, 106 (recognizing that a court is not bound by stipulations of fact that are contrary to facts disclosed by the record). In the present case, the' facts disclosed by the record reveal that the settlement agreement involved a workers' compensation claim. As a result, even if it could be said that the parties implicitly stipulated the existence of a tort claim by proceeding without objection in the court below, it would be proper to disregard such a stipulation in the face of the clear evidence that the settlement agreement actually involved a workers' compensation claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\">. This distinction is significant. If the existence of a tort claim is a \"merits\u201d issue rather than a jurisdictional prerequisite, then Liberty Life waived the issue by failing to raise it in the trial court. As noted above, however, if the existence of a tort claim is a jurisdictional prerequisite, then the issue may be raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b123-11\">. Stratcap\u2019s \"public policy\u201d argument is premised on an assumption that R.C. 2323.58(L) is ambiguous insofar as it refers to the settlement of a \"tort claim.\u201d In our view, however, the phrase \"tort claim\u201d is not ambiguous. We certainly find no ambiguity sufficient to justify interpreting a \"tort claim\u201d as encompassing McEvoy's workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b123-9\">Frederick N. Young, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AS\">concurring separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">{\u00b6 16} The crux of this decision is that the approval by the probate court of this structured settlement transfer is unnecessary. McEvoy is presumably a competent adult. He is also represented by able counsel. He has every right to deal with his own assets as he wishes. I see no legal impediment to his transfer of his right to receive periodic payments in order to obtain the benefit of an immediate lump-sum payment. Furthermore, without the application of the Transfer Act, Liberty Life lacks standing to object to McEvoy\u2019s transfer of his assets. McEvoy and Stratcap can proceed with their transaction as they wish.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
