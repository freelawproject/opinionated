Kirch, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas granting summary judgment to defendant-appellee, Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, and denying plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs complaint seeking declaratory judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>ment and injunctive relief against defendant, his former employer. Plaintiffs complaint is based on a claim that he had a right under R.C. 9.84 to be represented by counsel when his employer asked him questions at work. On appeal, plaintiff assigns a single error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">\u201cThe decision of the trial court is not supported by the evidence and is contrary to law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">{\u00b6 2} Because the R.C. 9.84 right to counsel was not implicated in plaintiffs interview with bureau personnel, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">{\u00b6 3} Plaintiff was employed as a computer consultant in the bureau\u2019s Information Technology (\u201cIT\u201d) Division of the Network Department. Throughout his employment, plaintiff was a member of a collective bargaining unit, represented by the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association (\u201cOCSEA\u201d) and subject to a collective bargaining agreement. In June 1999, plaintiff admitted to the bureau\u2019s \u201cInternal Affairs\u201d (\u201cIA\u201d) department that he had been using the bureau\u2019s computer equipment in his private internet business. Plaintiff was discharged, but in August 1999 he entered a \u201clast chance\u201d agreement with the bureau. The agreement reduced plaintiffs discharge to a 30-day suspension, but it further stipulated that \u201cany violation\u201d of the bureau\u2019s work rules or lack of good behavior would result in termination of plaintiffs employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">{\u00b6 4} On April 3, 2000, one of plaintiffs coworkers provided a statement to the bureau regarding an incident involving plaintiff that had occurred in December 1999. Specifically, Michelle Brown stated that plaintiff had sought a private meeting with her, in which he told her that he had used his computer at the bureau to access the bureau\u2019s IA files. According to Brown, plaintiff said that he would deny the conversation if asked, but he wanted her to know that \u201che was in the IA files\u201d to see what he could find \u201cabout any activities IA was pursuing in his case.\u201d He informed Brown that he had come across information that Brown and her husband, also an employee, were being investigated, and he wanted her to know so that \u201cno one else had to go through\u201d what he had experienced in IA\u2019s prior investigation of him. Brown further recounted to the bureau that, on one occasion, plaintiff complained about certain employees\u2019 ability to track who went into certain files, and he tried to use her computer to change the file-auditing log.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">{\u00b6 5} The day following Brown\u2019s statement, one of the IT managers, Leo Genders, approached plaintiff at his desk. According to plaintiffs deposition, Genders asked plaintiff to stop working and come with him. Genders and plaintiff went to a conference room, where an employee from the labor relations or human resources office, Samantha Coon, joined them.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">{\u00b6 6} Plaintiff was told that the meeting was an \u201cinvestigatory interview.\u201d Genders gave plaintiff a written explanation stating that the purpose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>meeting was \u201cto gather facts regarding a situation that has come to our attention,\u201d and that the interview \u201cmay lead to discipline.\u201d The sheet further explained that Genders \u201cexpect[s] you to answer the questions honestly and accurately. Please understand that my expectation that you will answer the questions honestly and accurately is a direct order. Failure to comply with this direct order could lead to discipline, in addition to the discipline you already may face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">{\u00b6 7} Plaintiff signed the paper, acknowledging that he had been advised of \u201cthe disciplinary nature of this meeting\u201d and that he had received a direct order to answer the questions honestly and accurately. In response to the question whether he had \u201cany requests at this time,\u201d plaintiff wrote: \u201cNo, I\u2019d rather not have the union present. The last time they hurt me more than they helped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">{\u00b6 8} Genders asked plaintiff about his job duties, and then inquired whether plaintiff had ever accessed a file or files on the shared drive for purposes unrelated to his work. Genders also questioned plaintiff about his knowledge of network tools or procedures that would permit the bureau to track file access, and he questioned plaintiff about security, file permissions, and file access. Plaintiff denied gaining access to IA files.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">{\u00b6 9} After the interview on April 4, 2000, plaintiff was placed on administrative leave, and he left the building. The next day, the bureau sent plaintiff a letter stating that plaintiffs removal from employment was being contemplated. The letter notified plaintiff that he was charged with several listed infractions, and it stated that a \u201cpredisciplinary meeting\u201d had been scheduled \u201cto provide you with a chance to tell your side of the story\u201d and to rebut charges that plaintiff had used his position as an IT employee to gain access to confidential files for purposes unrelated to his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">{\u00b6 10} Plaintiff filed an application for disability leave and stated that he was unable to participate in the June 2000 predisciplinary meeting on the advice of his psychiatrist. Plaintiffs attorneys attended the meeting, along with his union steward. On June 12, 2000, the bureau notified plaintiff that his employment was terminated as of June 14, 2000. Plaintiff filed a grievance, and hearings began under the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">{\u00b6 11} In August 2000, plaintiff filed an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the bureau. In it, plaintiff sought a declaration that the April 4, 2000 interview with Leo Genders and Samantha Coon was an \u201cadministrative or executive proceeding or investigation\u201d at which he was \u201cappearing as a witness\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 9.84, and that, accordingly, the bureau was obliged to advise him of his right to counsel before he was interrogated.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. In a decision filed October 28, 2002, the trial court granted the bureau\u2019s motion and denied plaintiffs motion. Applying the language of R.C. 9.84, the trial court concluded that the April 2000 interview lacked the requisite formality to constitute an \u201cadministrative or executive proceeding or investigation\u201d and that plaintiff was not a \u201cwitness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">{\u00b6 18} In addition, the court addressed the bureau\u2019s alternative argument that even if R.C. 9.84 generally were applicable to the type of interview plaintiff experienced, statutory and contractual provisions specifically governed plaintiffs employment and, in this instance, superceded R.C. 9.84. Plaintiff disagreed, contending that R.C. 9.84 takes precedence because it grants a \u201ccivil right.\u201d The trial court rejected plaintiffs argument, ruling that R.C. 9.84 did not grant a civil right.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">{\u00b6 14} In support of his single assignment of error on appeal, plaintiff sets forth four assertions: that the April 2000 interview was an \u201cadministrative or executive proceeding or investigation\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 9.84; that he was a \u201cwitness\u201d within the'meaning of the statute; that R.C. 9.84 does not conflict with the collective bargaining agreement; and that even if R.C. 9.84 conflicts with the bargaining agreement, it grants a civil right and therefore takes precedence over the bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 9.84 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag0\">\u201cAny person appearing as a witness before any public official, department, board, bureau, commission, agency, or representative thereof, in any <em>administrative or executive proceeding or investigation, </em>public or private, if he so requests, shall be permitted to be accompanied, represented, and advised by an attorney, whose participation in the hearing shall be limited to the protection of the rights of the witness, and who may not examine or cross-examine witnesses, and <em>the witness shall be advised of his right to counsel </em>before he is interrogated. This section shall not apply to proceedings before a grand jury.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">{\u00b6 16} The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>In re Civ. Serv. Charges &amp; Specs. Against Piper </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 308, 725 N.E.2d 659, addressed whether a person was appearing \u201cas a witness\u201d under R.C. 9.84, and it rejected the proposition that a person is not appearing \u201cas a witness\u201d unless he or she is testifying under oath. The Supreme Court instead agreed with this court\u2019s rationale in <em>State FOP Grand Lodge No. 1 v. State </em>(Dec. 31, 1981), Franklin App. No. 80AP-744, 1981 WL 3707, where we concluded that the term \u201cwitness\u201d in R.C. 9.84 is used in its broadest sense and should not be interpreted to exclude a person who is also a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>{\u00b6 17} The majority in <em>Piper, </em>which was decided on April 5, 2000, did not address the meaning of other words or phrases in R.C. 9.84, but in a concurring opinion three justices joined to clarify the meaning of the term \u201cadministrative or executive proceeding or investigation.\u201d The concurring opinion made explicit what the majority opinion suggested: that appearing as a \u201cwitness\u201d is not sufficient by itself to trigger the right to counsel under R.C. 9.84, because one must also be appearing in an administrative or executive proceeding or investigation for the statute to apply. <em>Piper, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 312, 725 N.E.2d 659. In the concurring opinion, the justices concluded that an informal interview does not trigger a right to counsel under R.C. 9.84 and that the benefits of the statute are triggered only where the circumstances demonstrate \u201cthe requisite formality\u201d that distinguishes an administrative or executive proceeding or investigation from an informal interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">{\u00b6 18} In reaching that conclusion, the concurring justices observed that the \u201clevel of formality in any proceeding or investigation is a function of the rules applicable to the manner in which the proceeding or investigation is conducted.\u201d Id. Reviewing the record in <em>Piper, </em>they noted a number of factors that reflected the requisite formality.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">{\u00b6 19} Initially, the record showed that the inquiry was an \u201cofficial\u201d internal investigation conducted by the IA department of a police department. In addition, the police department had administrative rules providing that the subject of an administrative investigation could be required to participate in a videotaping of the questioning when necessary. Further, the police department\u2019s rules provided that the subject of an IA administrative investigation must be given formal notice of the interview at least 24 hours before the interview and formal notice of the right to representation. Similarly, the collective bargaining agreement required that the city give the person at least 24 hours\u2019 notice of such questioning and formally inform the subject of his right to representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">{\u00b6 20} Moreover, the subject of interrogation in <em>Piper </em>was given a Garrity Warning, advising that he was being questioned as part of an official investigation and that a refusal to answer would be cause for termination of employment. The subject was warned that any statements he made could be used against him in disciplinary hearings but could not be used against him in any criminal proceedings. Id. at 309, 725 N.E.2d 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">{\u00b6 21} Lastly, not only was the inquiry in <em>Piper </em>a videotaped questioning resulting in a formal record of the inquiry, but the officer under investigation protested that he wanted his attorney, who could not attend on short notice, present at the videotaped questioning. After a disciplinary hearing, the officer was discharged for insubordination based solely on his refusal to participate without his attorney. The concurring justices concluded that the record incontro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>vertibly satisfied \u201cthe requirement of formality contemplated by R.C. 9.84.\u201d Id. at 313, 725 N.E.2d 659. Although <em>Piper </em>established that an oath is not necessary for the person to be deemed a witness within the meaning of R.C. 9.84, the administration of an oath nonetheless is an indicia of formality that a court could consider in determining whether an inquiry had the requisite level of formality to be deemed an executive or administrative proceeding or investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">{\u00b6 22} Similarly, in <em>FOP, </em>which involved questioning of State Highway Patrol-employees during internal investigative disciplinary proceedings, this court noted that the Highway Patrol had promulgated a written procedure that provided for a \u201ccharged\u201d employee to appear and be \u201cexamined\u201d at a \u201chearing.\u201d. In that case, a formal \u201cproceeding or investigation,\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 9.84, was deemed to have occurred where charges had been made and the party was being questioned at an administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">{\u00b6 23} By contrast, in <em>Erb v. Landreth </em>(Dec. 2, 1985), Butler App. No. CA8505-049,1985 WL 3973, two police officers were called in for separate meetings with a superior officer regarding compliance with departmental policy for proper searches of persons in custody. Both alleged that their request to have counsel present was denied. Subsequently, the officers were suspended for violating the policy for searching persons in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">{\u00b6 24} The court of appeals in <em>Erb </em>determined that no administrative or executive proceeding or investigation had occurred, as the officers \u201csimply were called into appellee\u2019s office for meetings concerning their activities\u201d as employees. Id. The court concluded this despite procedures and rules that the city was obliged to follow in suspending or removing an officer from employment, including a (1) detailed procedure for notifying the officer of the suspension or removal and the required contents of the notice, (2) a city ordinance providing a right to a postsuspension hearing, and (3) an employee\u2019s right to appeal the suspension to the city\u2019s civil service commission. Based on all the circumstances, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling that neither officer had been called in to answer questions in an administrative or executive proceeding or investigation and that accordingly, R.C. 9.84 did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">{\u00b6 25} In the present action, the evidence is insufficient to establish that the level of formality necessary for R.C. 9.84 to apply occurred. On April 3, 2000, Michelle Brown informed the bureau that plaintiff had been using his computer at the bureau to gain access to confidential IA files. On the following day, a manager in the IT division, who was not a member of the IA office, called plaintiff in for a meeting to address whether he had used his IT capacities to gain access to confidential files that his duties in IT did not require.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>{\u00b6 26} The record includes no evidence that the bureau had initiated an IA investigation to determine whether plaintiff had engaged in misconduct by using his IT capabilities to enter files without authority or permission. As to the matter for which he was discharged in 2000, plaintiff himself admitted that he had never had contact with anyone who worked with IA.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">{\u00b6 27} Moreover, even if the questioning in April 2000 triggered a contractual right to have the union steward present, it did not rise to the level of a proceeding or investigation within the meaning of R.C. 9.84. In contrast to <em>Piper, </em>no court reporter, electronic recording device, or polygraph equipment was present, and no official internal investigation took place. See <em>Piper, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 309, 725 N.E.2d 659. Moreover, unlike <em>Piper, </em>no hearing or adjudication took place until the June predisciplinary meeting, at which plaintiffs attorneys appeared on his behalf. Rather, the facts here are more like those in <em>Erb, </em>where an employee was called in for an informal interview to gain preliminary information and responses concerning the employee\u2019s possibly violating a departmental policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">{\u00b6 28} Because the April 2000 interview lacked the level of formality to trigger the application of R.C. 9.84, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling that no executive or administrative proceeding or investigation occurred within the meaning of R.C. 9.84 and, therefore, no right to have an attorney present arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">{\u00b6 29} As a result, the question of whether plaintiff was appearing as a witness is moot. In addition, because R.C. 9.84 does not apply, whether R.C. 9.84 conflicts with the collective bargaining agreement also is moot. Likewise, the question of whether R.C. 9.84 is a statute that grants a civil right need not be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">{\u00b6 30} Accordingly, we overrule plaintiffs single assignment of error. We affirm the judgment of the trial court on the grounds that it correctly determined the April 2000 interview was not a proceeding or investigation within the meaning of R.C. 9.84.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b686-9\">Petree, P.J., and Brown, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
