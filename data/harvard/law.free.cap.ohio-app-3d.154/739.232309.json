Hoffman, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">{\u00b6 1} Protestors-appellants Keith Brooks and James M. Wright appeal from the February 26, 2003 judgment entry-decision entered by the Ashland County Court of Common Pleas, which denied appellants\u2019 protests to certain part-petitions that appellee Ashland County Board of Elections (\u201cthe board\u201d) had certified as valid. Additional appellees are William Burga, Athena Godet-Calogeras, Dale Miller, Robert Hagan, and the Ohio Coalition for Affordable Prescriptions Drugs (collectively \u201cthe committee\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-13\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b768-14\">{\u00b6 2} The board received various initiative petitions from the Ohio Secretary of State for purposes of determining the validity of various signatures on the petitions as required by R.C. 3519.15. The initiative petitions proposed legislation known as the \u201cOhio Prescription Drug Fair Pricing Act.\u201d The board reviewed the part-petitions and submitted a report to the Secretary of State, indicating the sufficiency or insufficiency of the signatures and indicating whether or not each part-petition was properly verified.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>{\u00b6 3} On January 14 and 15, 2003, appellants filed protests to the board\u2019s decision. The board called an emergency public meeting to consider the protests on January 16, 2003. Prior to the meeting, the board verbally notified counsel for appellants of the meeting. Counsel for appellants was present at the January 16, 2003 meeting. At the meeting, the board considered the protests and voted to uphold some portions and deny other portions thereof. Pursuant to R.C. 3519.16, the board filed a petition with the Ashland County Court of Common Pleas to establish the sufficiency of the part-petitions. Appellants filed a Civ.R. 24 motion to intervene as respondents in the proceedings. The committee also filed a motion to intervene. Via judgment entry filed February 5, 2003, the trial court granted both motions to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">{\u00b6 4} The parties filed joint stipulations of fact on February 18, 2003. The trial court conducted a hearing on the board\u2019s petition on February 19, 2003. Via judgment entry-decision filed February 26, 2003, the trial court denied appellants\u2019 protests specific to part-petitions Nos. 194 and 1508.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">{\u00b6 5} It is from this judgment entry that appellants appeal, raising the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cI. The trial court erroneously deviated from the well-established standard of strict compliance with Ohio election law when it refused to invalidate an initiative part-petition on which one person affixed more than one signature and for which the circulator\u2019s statement was false as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cII. The trial court improperly deviated from the applicable standard of strict compliance with Ohio election law by refusing to invalidate signatures accompanied by incomplete disclosure of the signer\u2019s address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">I, II</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">{\u00b6 8} Because appellants\u2019 assignments of error are interrelated, we shall address them together. In their first assignment of error, appellants contend that the trial court failed to strictly comply with Ohio election laws by refusing to invalidate part-petition 194, on which one person had affixed more than one signature and for which the circulator\u2019s statement was false. Appellants argue the trial court failed to properly apply R.C. 3519.06 to the stipulated facts. In their second assignment of error, appellants assert that the trial court failed to apply the strict compliance standard when it refused to invalidate a signature on part-petition No. 1508 where the signer had an incomplete disclosure of his address.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. 3519.06 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cNo initiative or referendum part-petition is properly verified if it appears on the face thereof, or is made to appear by satisfactory evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>{\u00b6 11} \u201c(A) That the statement required by section 3519.05 of the Revised Code is not properly filled out;</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(B) That the statement is not properly signed;</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(C) That the statement is altered by erasure, interlineation, or otherwise;</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(D) That the statement is false in any respect;</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(E) That any one person has affixed more than one signature thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 3519.16 sets forth the mechanism by which the validity of a part-petition may be challenged. That section provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cIf the circulator of any part-petition, the committee interested therein, or any elector files with the board of elections a protest against the board\u2019s findings made pursuant to section 3519.15 of the Revised Code, then the board shall proceed to establish the sufficiency or insufficiency of the signatures and of the verification thereof in an action before the court of common pleas in the county. Such action must be brought within three days after the protest has been filed, and the case shall be heard forthwith by a judge of such court whose decision shall be certified to the board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">{\u00b6 18} R.C. 3519.16 contemplates a de novo review by the trial court. In the instant action, the trial court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">{\u00b6 19} \u201ce) While the facts of the cases cited by the challenger here [appellants] <em>(Scioto County </em>and <em>Lorain </em>County) are not at all similar to the instant case, this Court is finding that the <em>Foster [v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1977), 53 Ohio App.2d 213, 7 O.O.3d 282, 373 N.E.2d 1274] case cited by the Board is applicable, by analogy here. In pertinent part, that Court held: \u2018However, we conclude, because protest procedures to the qualifications of write-in candidates are not specifically provided by statute or the Civil Rule, and where no protest proceeding is, in fact, held, that the initial approval or disapproval by a board of elections of a write-in candidacy is final absent fraud, corruption, abuse of discretion, or clear disregard of statutes, or applicable legal provisions. See Section 3501.11(K).\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cBy analogy here, no specific provision exists with regard to gathering initiative petition signatures. Therefore, this Court holds that the same standard should be applied to these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-13\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cf) In applying this standard to these facts, this Court does not find fraud, corruption, abuse of discretion or clear disregard of statute, etc., in the conduct of Marcia Clark in obtaining Mr. Randleman\u2019s signature. Therefore, the Request to have the entire part-petition # 194 is hereby denied.\u201d February 26, 2003 judgment entry-decision at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>{\u00b6 22} It is somewhat unclear from the aforequoted language whether the trial court believed that it was required to give deference to the board\u2019s decision, or was required to conduct a de novo review of circulator Marcia Clark\u2019s conduct to determine whether Clark had engaged in fraud, corruption, abuse of discretion, or clear disregard of statutes, or applicable legal provisions. The trial court relied upon the Eighth District Court of Appeals\u2019 holding in <em>Foster v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1977), 53 Ohio App.2d 213, 7 O.O.3d 282, 373 N.E.2d 1274, finding the case to be analogous to the matter sub judice. We disagree. Unlike <em>Foster, </em>the statute at issue herein provides a specific protest procedure. We would not find the lack of a specific provision regarding gathering initiative petition signatures analogous to the lack of a specific provision regarding protest procedure. Furthermore, R.C. 3519 does include specific provisions regarding the gathering of initiative-petition signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">{\u00b6 23} The statute at issue in <em>Foster </em>did not specifically provide for a statutory protest procedure. Because R.C. 3519.16 sets forth a specific protest procedure, the board\u2019s determination of the validity of the signatures was purely gratuitous and should not be afforded deferential review. Likewise, Clark\u2019s conduct in gathering the signatures must strictly comply with the requirements set forth in R.C. 3519. The trial court must then determine whether the part-petition was properly verified in accordance with R.C. 3519.06. We find the trial court\u2019s requirement of a demonstration of fraud, corruption, abuse of discretion, or clear disregard of statutes or applicable legal provisions on the part of Clark to be erroneous and contrary to the requirement of strict compliance with the statutes. See <em>State ex rel. Commt. for the Referendum of Lorain Ordinance No. 77-01 v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 308, 2002-Ohio-4194, 774 N.E.2d 239; and <em>State ex rel. Citizens for Responsible Taxation v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 167, 169, 602 N.E.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">{\u00b6 24} When reviewing the challenge to line 20 of part-petition No. 194, the trial court applied a substantial-compliance standard and found no clear showing of disregard of any applicable legal provision. When reviewing the challenge to fine 2 of part-petition No. 1508, we surmise that the trial court again failed to apply the strict-compliance standard. The trial court recited the board\u2019s contention that the signator \u201cadequately described\u201d his house number and street.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">{\u00b6 25} Because we believe the trial court applied the wrong standard in reaching its decision with regard to the validity or invalidity of the entire part-petition No. 194, part-petition No. 194, line 20, and part-petition No. 1508, line 2, we sustain appellants\u2019 assignments of error. The trial court\u2019s judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial court for redetermination applying a strict-compliance standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>{\u00b6 26} The judgment of the Ashland County Court of Common Pleas is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b772-5\">John W.
