Appellant Forester Nursing Home appeals from the judgment of the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas dismissing their administrative appeal based upon the lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The issue presented to this court is whether Forester may bring an appeal under R.C. 4123.512 to challenge the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision that appellee Linda Baker has not reached maximum medical improvement and may therefore continue receiving temporary total benefits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Because the trial court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction to hear that type of appeal under R.C. 4123.512 as it deals with the extent of an injury, we affirm the judgment of the trial court dismissing Forester\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">{\u00b6 2} On May 1, 2001, Baker sustained an injury during the course of and arising out of her employment with Forester. Accordingly, a worker\u2019s compensation claim was allowed for right shoulder strain and aggravation of a pre-existing cervical strain. Disability compensation benefits were paid by the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, with Forester being a contributor to the State Insurance Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">{\u00b6 3} At a subsequent hearing held before a staff hearing officer, Forester argued Baker\u2019s temporary total disability (\u201cTTD\u201d) benefits should be terminated with finality based upon her ability to return to work and her achievement of maximum medical improvement (\u201cMMI\u201d). The hearing officer ruled against Forester on these issues, so Forester appealed the decision to the Industrial Commission, which affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">{\u00b6 4} Forester proceeded to file an appeal with the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas challenging the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision. In response, Baker filed a petition with the court praying for the right to participate in the Worker\u2019s Compensation Fund in addition to a motion to dismiss Forester\u2019s notice of appeal. Soon after, the Administrator of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation filed an answer, which raised the trial court\u2019s lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Forester then filed an answer, in addition to a counterclaim for declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">{\u00b6 5} On August 16, 2002, the trial court dismissed both Forester\u2019s appeal under R.C. 4123.512 and its declaratory judgment action based on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. It is from that decision that Forester appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Review of Administrative Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"AvW\">A. Appeal or Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">{\u00b6 6} As its first assignment of error, Forester asserts:</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cWhere the determination of an issue (including the issue of whether an employee is able to return to work or has achieved MMI) may terminate an employee\u2019s right to participate in temporary total disability benefits, the administrative decision of the Industrial Commission and Staff Hearing Officer is appealable to the common pleas court under 4123.512.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Forester filed an appeal with the trial court challenging the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision permitting Baker to continue to receive temporary total disability benefits. The Industrial Commission based its decision upon her inability to return to work and her failure to achieve maximum medical improvement. The trial court dismissed the case based on its lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">{\u00b6 9} Under R.C. 4123.512, claimants and employers can appeal Industrial Commission orders to a common pleas court only when the order grants or denies the claimant\u2019s right to participate. Determinations as to the extent of a claimant\u2019s disability, on the other hand, are not appealable and must be challenged in mandamus. <em>State ex rel. Liposchak v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 276, 737 N.E.2d 519; <em>Thomas v. Conrad </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 475, 477, 692 N.E.2d 205, 207; <em>Felty v. AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 234, 237, 602 N.E.2d 1141; <em>Zavatsky v. Stringer </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 386, 10 O.O.3d 503, 384 N.E.2d 693, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">{\u00b6 10} Significantly, the Ohio Supreme Court has concluded that the only right-to-participate question that is appealable is whether an employee\u2019s injury, disease, or death occurred in the course of and arising out of his or her employment. <em>Liposchak, </em>99 Ohio St.3d at 279, 737 N.E.2d 519, citing <em>Felty, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Afrates v. Lorain </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 22, 584 N.E.2d 1175, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 236, 594 N.E.2d 609; and <em>Zavatsky, </em>paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">{\u00b6 11} In the present case, Forester argues that where the determination of an issue may terminate an employee\u2019s right to participate in temporary total disability benefits, including the issue of whether an employee is able to return to work or has achieved MMI, this decision could be properly appealed to the trial court under R.C. 4123.512. This argument is misplaced. The Industrial Commission\u2019s decision to allow Baker <em>to continue to participate </em>in the fund in no way established whether Baker\u2019s injury occurred in the course of and arising out of her employment. That decision had been made long ago when her claim was originally allowed. Therefore, the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision did not determine her right to participate as defined by the holding in <em>Liposchak. </em>Thus, it was improper to appeal that decision to the trial court under R.C. 4123.512. Instead, Forester should have filed a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">{\u00b6 12} This does not conclude our analysis. Forester challenges this application of the law, claiming that it violates the constitutional right to equal protection under Section 2, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Specifically, Forester maintains that a decision of the Industrial Commission terminating a claimant\u2019s partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>ipation in the system allows a claimant to appeal to the common pleas court pursuant to R.C. 4123.512. However, a decision that claimant\u2019s ongoing participation in the system is not terminated prevents an employer from appealing to the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">{\u00b6 13} The Eleventh District previously dispelled this very argument in <em>Bishop v. Thomas Steel Strip Corp. </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 522, 655 N.E.2d 1370:</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cAppellant\u2019s constitutional argument is without merit. One goal of the workers\u2019 compensation system is that it operate largely outside the courts. <em>Felty, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 238, 602 N.E.2d at 1144-1145. To this end, the General Assembly has restricted the right of litigants to appeal decisions of the commission to those decisions involving an employee\u2019s right to participation in the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cOnce such a right is determined \u2018no subsequent rulings, <em>except a ruling that terminates the right to participate, </em>are appealable pursuant to R.C. [4123.512].\u2019 (Emphasis added.) <em>Felty </em>at 240, 602 N.E.2d at 1146. There is a rational basis for such a distinction \u2014 the orderly and efficient operation of the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cAs the <em>Felty </em>court observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c* * * Because the workers\u2019 compensation system was designed to give employees an exclusive statutory remedy for work-related injuries, \u2018a litigant has no inherent right of appeal in this area * * *.\u2019 <em>Cadle v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>[1976], 45 Ohio St.2d 28, 33, 74 O.O.2d 50, 52, 340 N.E.2d 403, 406. Therefore, a party\u2019s right to appeal workers\u2019 compensation decisions to the courts is conferred solely by statute.\u2019 <em>Felty </em>at 237, 602 N.E.2d at 1144.\u201d Id. at 526-527, 655 N.E.2d 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">{\u00b6 18} Because the reasoning of the Eleventh District is sound, we adopt the <em>Bishop </em>holding and on that basis conclude that Forester\u2019s first assignment of error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">B. Declaratory Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">{\u00b6 19} As its second assignment of error, Forester asserts:</p>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cWhere the determination of an issue (including the MMI issue or the ability to return to work issue) will determine a claimant\u2019s right to participate in TTD benefits, the common pleas court has jurisdiction to entertain a declaratory judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Felty, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court identified the procedural mechanisms for obtaining judicial review over the commission\u2019s rulings: (1) a direct appeal to a court of common pleas pursuant to R.C. 4123.512 (then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>numbered R.C. 4123.519); (2) a mandamus petition; or, (3) an action for declaratory judgment filed pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2721. The mechanism appropriate for a particular litigant depends upon the nature of the commission\u2019s decision. Id. at 237, 602 N.E.2d 1141. \u201c[I]f the litigant seeking judicial review does not make the proper choice, the reviewing court will not have subject matter jurisdiction and the case must be dismissed.\u201d Id. at 237, 602 N.E.2d 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>State ex rel. McCullough v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 156, 761 N.E.2d 24, the Ohio Supreme Court was recently asked to determine whether a particular issue should have been resolved through a writ of mandamus or, in the alternative, through a declaratory judgment action. The appellant in <em>McCullough </em>was injured while playing football for the Cincinnati Bengals. The claimant filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim that was allowed. After his player\u2019s contract had expired, appellant applied for permanent partial disability compensation (\u201cPPD\u201d). A temporary order issued from the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation awarding appellant a 24 percent PPD. The Bengals objected to this order, disputing not the amount or existence of a PPD, but appellant\u2019s right to receive it under the provisions of R.C. 4123.56(C). A district hearing officer for appellee Industrial Commission overruled the Bengals\u2019 objection. A staff hearing officer then ruled in favor of the Bengals.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">{\u00b623} Appellant filed a complaint in mandamus in the court of appeals requesting a determination that his employment contract superseded the provisions of R.C. 4123.56(C). Alternatively, appellant sought a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional. The court of appeals concluded that appellant had an adequate remedy of law by way of a declaratory judgment action. A writ was accordingly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">{\u00b6 24} The appellant then appealed the case to the Ohio Supreme Court, which affirmed the decision of the appellate court, stating that the controversy did not invoke the subject matter that is specifically encompassed by mandamus, i.e. \u201cextent of disability\u201d claims. The court referenced both R.C. 4123.512(A) and its prior decision, <em>Afrates v. Lorain </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 22, 584 N.E.2d 1175, explaining:</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThis action does not challenge a determination concerning the numeric percentage of appellant\u2019s disability or a determination concerning the permanency of appellant\u2019s injury. To the contrary, none of the parties alleges that the award incorrectly reflects appellant\u2019s degree of disability. Instead, appellant seeks a determination of his rights under his contract of employment vis-a-vis R.C. 4123.56(C). Alternatively, he seeks a declaration of the statute\u2019s constitutionality or unconstitutionality. We agree with the court of appeals that these are issues that are well suited to an action in declaratory judgment.\u201d <em>McCullough, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 159, 761 N.E.2d 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>{\u00b6 26} In contrast, the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>State ex rel. St. Francis-St. George Hosp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 498, 639 N.E.2d 452, held that a claim challenging an impaired-earning-capacity award would be more appropriate for a writ of mandamus. The court determined that the issue was actually an extent-of-disability question that would be the proper subject of mandamus rather than declaratory judgment. The court rejected the claimant\u2019s assertion that declaratory judgment was an adequate remedy at law, distinguishing the case upon which claimant relied, <em>State ex rel. Marks v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 184, 586 N.E.2d 109, explaining:</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cIn <em>Marks, </em>the claimant\u2019s initial allowance was denied by the district hearing officer, granted by the regional board and denied by staff hearing officers. The claimant then properly appealed to common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cDuring the appeal\u2019s pendency, the claimant sought compensation and benefits for the period between the regional board\u2019s allowance and the staff hearing officer\u2019s denial. The commission held claimant\u2019s request in abeyance pending the outcome of her appeal. Claimant then went forward in mandamus to compel compensation and benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cAnchoring claimant\u2019s request was former R.C. 4123.515, which provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c \u2018[Wjhere the regional board rules in favor of the claimant, compensation and benefits shall be paid * * * whether or not further appeal is taken.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cWe declined to address claimant\u2019s rights under R.C. 4123.515, finding declaratory judgment to be the appropriate vehicle for relief. Resolution here, however, does not hinge on a declaration of statutory rights under either R.C. 4123.57(A) or R.C. 4123.56, since no one contests the impropriety of concurrent compensation for temporary total disability and impaired earning capacity for the same condition. Instead, the parties disagree as to whether the same condition is indeed involved in both claims. Statutory analysis will, accordingly, be of no assistance, negating the utility of a declaratory judgment action.\u201d <em>State ex rel. St. Francis-St. George Hosp., </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 501, 639 N.E.2d 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">{\u00b6 32} Similarly here, Forester did not call into question the Industrial Commission\u2019s interpretation of the law. Instead, Forester merely challenged the factual determination that Baker has not reached MMI. In other words, Forester has challenged the extent of Baker\u2019s disability, the subject of a writ of mandamus. Accordingly, we find that the trial court properly dismissed Forester\u2019s complaint for declaratory judgment. Forester\u2019s second assignment of error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>{\u00b6 33} As Forester\u2019s assignments of error are meritless, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b745-6\">Waite, P.J., and Gene Donofrio, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
