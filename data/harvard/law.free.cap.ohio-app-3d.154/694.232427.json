(collectively referred to as \u201cthe hospital\u201d) on their counterclaims alleging defamation and disparagement.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">{\u00b6 <em>2} On </em>May 15, 2000, Dr. Mousset sought a temporary restraining order against the hospital on claims arising out of the hospital\u2019s refusal to renew his contract, which was granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 12, 2000, the hospital filed counterclaims against Dr. Mousset, alleging defamation and disparagement, arising out of statements made by Dr. Mousset on his website, http://patientsshouldchoose.com, to the news media, in published newspaper ads, and in letters to physicians and patients. The trial court granted the hospital summary judgment on Dr. Mousset\u2019s claims, which Dr. Mousset appealed. Dr. Mousset\u2019s appeal, however, was fully dismissed by this court on October 15, 2002. Accordingly, the only issues on appeal concern the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Dr. Mousset against the hospital on its defamation and disparagement counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">{\u00b6 3} The hospital raises the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cFirst Assignment of Error:</p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court erred in holding that Dr. Mousset\u2019s statements accusing the Toledo Hospital and ProMedica of making anticompetitive deals and of engaging in many anticompetitive business practices were not actionable, defamatory statements of fact, but rather were protected opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cSecond Assignment of Error:</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred in holding that Dr. Mousset\u2019s statements that the Toledo Hospital and ProMedica unlawfully failed to maintain an open medical staff and thereby risked losing millions of dollars annually were not actionable, defamatory statements of fact, but rather were protected opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThird Assignment of Error:</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court erred in dismissing the Toledo Hospital\u2019s disparagement claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">{\u00b6 10} Upon thorough review of the record, applicable law, the hospital\u2019s arguments on appeal, and the decision of the trial court, we find that the trial court correctly considered the pertinent facts and issues in dispute, correctly applied the law to the facts, and rendered judgment accordingly. We therefore adopt the well-reasoned decision of the trial court as our own. (See <em>Toledo Heart Surgeons, Inc. v. Toledo Hosp. </em>(Nov. 16, 2001), Lucas C.P. No. CI2000-2618, at \u00b6 12-35, attached hereto as Appendix A.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">{\u00b6 11} The hospital\u2019s assignments of error are therefore found not well taken. On consideration whereof, the court finds that substantial justice has been done the party complaining and that the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. The hospital is ordered to pay the court costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b724-9\">Mark L. Pietrykowski and Arlene Singer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">Decided Nov. 16, 2001</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">Judith Ann Lanzinger, Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON COUNTERCLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b724-14\">{\u00b6 12} The plaintiffs have filed a motion for summary judgment on the counterclaims of defamation and disparagement. The court agrees that disparagement is duplicative rather than separate from the defamation claim and, therefore, dismisses the Second Claim for Relief outright. See, e.g., <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Ohio v. Schmidt </em>(Feb. 16, 1996), Lucas App. No. L-94-291, 1996 WL 71006 (when quality of a business\u2019s goods or services has been demeaned a commercial disparagement claim may be asserted; if allegations relate to integrity, defamation is proper claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-15\">{\u00b6 13} Summary judgment motions are to be resolved in light of the dictates of Civ.R. 56. Civ.R. 56(C) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-16\">\u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>evidence in the pending case, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law * * *. A summary judgment shall not be rendered unless it appears from such evidence or stipulation and only therefrom, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, such party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">{\u00b6 14} Summary judgment is not to be entered if it appears that a material fact is genuinely disputed. In order to survive a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must produce evidence on any issue to which that party bears the burden of production at trial. <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">{\u00b6 15} To establish a case of defamation, a plaintiff must show (1) that a false statement of fact was made; (2) that the statement was defamatory (i.e., ruinous to reputation); (3) that the statement was published; (4) that the plaintiff suffered injury as a proximate result of the publication; and (5) that the defendant acted with the required degree of fault in publishing the statement. See <em>Pollock v. Rashid </em>(1996), 117 Ohio App.3d 361, 368, 690 N.E.2d 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">{\u00b6 16} The Hospital counterclaimants support their opposition to the motion with the affidavits of Ursula Strausbaugh, Dean Vanderhoof, Greg Burton, and Barbara Steele, and the depositions of B.J. Fischer, Mark Luetke, and Dr. Xavier Mousset. They complain of a number of statements \u2014 several within their counterclaim and others within their brief in opposition. The statements set forth in the counterclaims\u2019 first claim for relief are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-8\">a. The Hospital decided to deny patients the right to life-saving treatment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-9\">b. The Hospital placed politics and power ahead of patient care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-10\">c. The Hospital\u2019s President testified that the Hospital is not required to follow due process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-11\">d. The Hospital terminated the privileges of Drs. Mousset and Levy and did not state an official reason. (Paragraph 2 of Counterclaim.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">{\u00b6 17} The Hospital alleges that these statements were made on an Internet website,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the news media, and in published newspaper ads and letters mailed to patients and physicians. In addition, the statements complained of in the brief accompanying defendants\u2019 opposition are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-13\">1. The Hospital terminated Dr. Mousset\u2019s cardiac surgery privileges;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>2. The Hospital acted unfairly and violated the Medical Staff Bylaws;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">3. The Hospital decided to enter into an exclusive agreement with CSNO for economic and political reasons without regard for patient care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">4. The Hospital illegally \u201cclosed\u201d the medical staff and jeopardized its nonprofit status, risking the loss of millions of dollars by entering into the agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">5. The Hospital administrators, described as bureaucrats, acted unprofessionally and unconscionably; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\">6. The Hospital engaged in many illegal, anti-competitive business activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">{\u00b6 18} The foregoing statements were not specifically set forth in the answer to interrogatories requested by the plaintiffs. Nor were the following statements mentioned in their brief, where counterclaimants refer to the following statements within patient letters and website:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">1. ProMedica \u201cterminated the privileges * * * of Drs. Mousset and Levy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-11\">2. \u201cThese privileges were terminated without due process, as required by the medical staff By-laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-12\">3. \u201cBarbara Steele testified that she is not required to follow basic due process rights as required by the medical staff by-laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-13\">4. \u201cProMedica has decided to deny patients\u2019 right to life-saving treatment from the practice that allowed Toledo Hospital to be named to the 100 Top Hospital: Cardiovascular Hospitals by Modern Health Care. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-14\">5. \u201cIt means that politics and personalities were placed ahead of patient care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-15\">6. \u201c* * * If ProMedica could hand-pick who practices medicine * * * it seriously jeopardizes each physician\u2019s freedom to treat patients as they were trained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-16\">{\u00b6 19} Ursula Strausbaugh\u2019s affidavit alleges that Mousset acted with the intent to close down the cardiac surgery program. The Hospital claims that it was injured by this negative publicity and that it incurred significant expense to advance a positive publicity campaign in response. Barbara Steele asserts that the Hospital expended $34,024.30 for this purpose. (Steele aff. \u00b6 6.) Defendants also seek $25,000 in punitive damages, alleging that Mousset made these statements with malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-17\">{\u00b6 20} The Hospital counterclaimants have offered evidence on the publication of the statements, their allegations of injury as a result, and their allegations of Mousset\u2019s acting with intent. The important question, which is one of law for the court, is whether these statements are \u201cdefamatory\u201d or whether they are nonactionable opinion statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-18\">{\u00b6 21} Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution protects the expression of opinions. It provides: \u201cEvery citizen may freely speak, write, and publish his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right; and no law shall be passed to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech, or of the press.\u201d The Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Scott v. News-Herald </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 243, 25 OBR 302, 496 N.E.2d 699, paragraph one of the syllabus, articulated the distinction between fact and opinion and explained: \u201cThe totality of the circumstances must be examined to determine whether a published statement is constitutionally protected opinion.\u201d The \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d can be determined through a four-part test that the court originally approved in <em>Scott </em>and clarified in <em>Vail v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 279, 649 N.E.2d 182. This test considers at least four factors: first, the specific language used; second whether the statement is verifiable; third, the general context of the statement; and fourth, the broader context in which the statement appeared. The standard is not rigid but must be fluid. As the <em>Vail </em>court noted: \u201cEvery case will present facts that must be analyzed in the context of the general test. Each of the four factors should be addressed, but the weight given to any one will conceivably vary depending on the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>Vail </em>at 282, 649 N.E.2d 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">{\u00b6 22} Vail, a candidate for the Ohio Senate, had sued the Plain Dealer and a columnist after an allegedly defamatory article about her appeared in the newspaper\u2019s Forum section. The article, entitled \u201cGay-basher takes refuge in the closet,\u201d stated that Vail \u201cdoesn\u2019t like gay people\u201d and that she \u201cadded gay-bashing to the repertoire of right-wing, neo-numbskull tactics she is employing * * * in her increasingly distasteful campaign.\u201d 72 Ohio St.3d at 279, 649 N.E.2d 182. Other statements in the article accused Vail of engaging in \u201canti-homosexual diatribe,\u201d and stated, among other things, that \u201cVail wouldn\u2019t be the first candidate to latch onto homophobia as a ticket to Columbus.\u201d Id. In analyzing the statements, the Supreme Court found that the general context of the article was opinion and that the general tenor of the article was sarcastic, thus \u201cmore typical of persuasive speech than factual reporting.\u201d 72 Ohio St.3d at 282, 649 N.E.2d 182. Additionally, the specific language used in the article would be understood to be \u201cone person\u2019s attempt to persuade public opinion.\u201d <em>Vail </em>at 283, 649 N.E.2d 182. And finally, the statements were not verifiable. Without a plausible method of verification, a reasonable reader would not believe that the statement had specific factual content. Because the newspaper\u2019s column constituted an opinion, it was constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">{\u00b6 23} The Supreme Court of Ohio recently determined that constitutional protection for expressed opinion is not limited to media defendants. <em>Wampler v. Higgins </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 111, 752 N.E.2d 962. Wampler had sued Higgins for defamation in the Common Pleas Court of Pickaway County, alleging that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Higgins had falsely stated in a letter to the newspaper that Wampler had forced McKee out of business by charging exorbitant rent, describing Wampler as a \u201cruthless speculator.\u201d Applying the <em>Scott-Vail </em>test, the Supreme Court concluded that under the totality of the circumstances, \u201cthe language used by defendant in his letter would be understood by the ordinary reader for just what it is \u2014 one person\u2019s frustration with the perceived plight of many small downtown areas due to small business closures and large corporate takeovers. * * * [T]he average reader would believe that statements contained in defendant\u2019s letter are the opinions of the writer and not facts.\u201d 93 Ohio St.3d at 113-114, 752 N.E.2d 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">{\u00b6 24} The Sixth District Court of Appeals distinguished between fact and opinion in <em>El-Shiekh v. Northwest Ohio Cardiology Consultants </em>(Sept. 15, 2000), Lucas App. No. L-99-1380, 2000 WL 1298761. There, physicians who were in charge of El-Shiekh\u2019s training at Toledo Hospital were found entitled, in the interest of public health and safety, to express concerns or dissatisfaction with his performance. El-Shiekh had acknowledged in deposition that the letters included only subjective opinions regarding his performance. The physician letters were found to be protected opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">{\u00b6 25} Here, Mousset responded throughout his deposition that all the statements being challenged by the Hospital were expressions of \u201chis opinion.\u201d Thus, the four <em>Vail </em>factors need to be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">A. General Context</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">{\u00b6 26} First, the several statements complained of will first be placed in context rather than isolated. The statements appeared on the Internet and in letters to doctors and patients. As far as publication on the website, the marketplace of ideas has widened to include computer communications, and an ordinary \u2018surfer\u2019 is attuned to the blend of hyperbole and exaggeration in the expression of opinion that is contained on the Internet.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Letters sent to physicians and patients clearly related to Mousset\u2019s advocacy of his position involving his lawsuit against the Hospital. In his opinion, he was being treated unfairly, and he commented in response. Thus, he comments that the Hospital\u2019s decision \u201cseriously jeopardizes each physician\u2019s freedom to treat patients as they were trained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">{\u00b6 27} Mousset hired a public relations firm (see deposition of Mark Luetke, president of Funk, Luetke and Skunda) to advocate his position and obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>support. As such, his comments were made as expressions of opinion over perceived unjust treatment. The overall tenor of the remarks may have been emotional and ill advised. They are, however, constitutionally protected opinion; as such, they are not actionable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">B. Broader Context</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">{\u00b6 28} All statements relate either to the Hospital\u2019s decision to renew only one of two exclusive cardiac surgical services contracts or to the purported consequences of that decision. As seen in previous rulings in this case, Ohio law upholds exclusive contracts of the type involved here. See, e.g., <em>Holt v. Good Samaritan Hosp. &amp; Health Ctr. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 701, 569 N.E.2d 504; <em>Williams v. Hobbs </em>(1993), 9 Ohio App.3d 331, 9 OBR 599, 460 N.E.2d 287; <em>Gonzaga v. Massillon Community Hosp. </em>(Nov. 15, 1990), Stark App. No. 90-332. The Hospital prevailed on the law and will be compensated for damages it sustained by virtue of the TRO. The case record, however, also demonstrates that plaintiffs consistently advocated a contrary view of the law. Mousset was obviously frustrated over the nonrenewal of his and Levy\u2019s contract. He strenuously advanced his position that his \u201cprivileges were terminated,\u201d since he could no longer perform cardiac surgery at the Hospital. His arguments had initial appeal, as can be seen by this court\u2019s improvident grant of the TRO. When common meaning is given to the terms used, it is understandable how a party could argue that by entering a new exclusive contract, the Hospital \u201cterminated Dr. Mousset\u2019s cardiac surgery privileges.\u201d Mousset had been allowed to practice surgery before; now he could not. Although this court eventually held under Ohio law that his position was inaccurate, the characterizations themselves were not totally unreasonable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The same holds true for the statement that \u201cthe Hospital acted unfairly and violated the Medical Staff Bylaws.\u201d Barbara Steele\u2019s testimony was that under the circumstances (i.e., nonrenewal of contract) the bylaws were not implicated and so did not apply to Mousset\u2019s situation. In context, these statements are not defamatory.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>C. Specific Language Used</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">{\u00b6 29} This factor focuses on the common meaning ascribed to the words by an ordinary reader. Statements \u201cloosely definable or variously interpretable\u201d cannot in most contexts support a claim for defamation. Here, the language complained of can be understood by the ordinary reader to be the result of acrimony between the doctor and his former hospital. The language at issue is value-laden and subjective in its point of view. The phrases complained of are in many instances capable of being interpreted in various subjective ways. For example, that the Hospital acted \u201cunprofessionally and unconscionably,\u201d or that it entered into the new agreement \u201cfor economic and political reasons without regard for patient care,\u201d or that \u201cpolitics and personalities were placed ahead of patient care,\u201d are not precise and cannot be construed as objective. The language conveys subjective interpretation rather than objective fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">D. Verifiability</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">{\u00b6 30} Because opinion, as a matter of law, cannot be proven false, the remarks must be measured to see whether they are capable of proof or disproof. Many of Mousset\u2019s statements are standardless characterizations. Without a plausible method of verification, a reasonable reader will not believe that a statement has specific factual context. Comments such as that the Hospital decided to \u201cdeny patients the right to life-saving treatment,\u201d \u201cillegally closed the medical staff and jeopardized its non-profit status risking the loss of millions of dollars by entering into the agreement,\u201d and \u201cengaged in many illegal, anti-competitive business activities,\u201d all relate to Mousset\u2019s unverifiable opinion over his contract nonrenewal. <em>Scott v. News-Herald, </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 243, 251-252, 25 OBR 302, 496 N.E.2d 699. They are one person\u2019s opinion only: Mousset\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">{\u00b6 31} In summary, when viewed against the <em>Scott-Vail </em>test, the counterclaims of defamation must fail, and plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">{\u00b6 32} IT IS ORDERED:</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">{\u00b6 33} That the court finds that the TRO should not have been issued on May 16, 2000, in this case, and that the defendants\u2019 motion for damages on bond is therefore GRANTED. Plaintiffs shall pay a sum of no more than $75,000 as established by stipulation of the parties or by a hearing on damages on December 20 at 1:30 p.m.; and</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>{\u00b6 34} IT IS FURTHER ORDERED:</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">{\u00b6 35} That plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on defendants\u2019 counterclaims is GRANTED. All counts against plaintiffs are dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-15\">.
