A.), J.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"AJt\">Appellant, David Alan Mansfield, was found guilty by a jury of one count of lewd and lascivious conduct upon a child under 14 years of age (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a))* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and two counts of misdemeanor child molestation (\u00a7 647a\u2014now 647.6). He was found not guilty on an additional five counts and one count was dismissed after the jury could not agree as to that count. Imposition of sentence was suspended and appellant was placed on probation for three years on condition he serve twelve months in the county jail. He appeals. We will reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">On February 8, 1986, April G. went to visit and spend the night with her friend, the victim, Lisa B. Two days earlier, Lisa had turned twelve years old. Appellant was present at the apartment in Atwater occupied by Lisa and her mother at this time, for Lisa\u2019s mother, a friend of appellant\u2019s, had permitted him to move in with them several months earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">Lisa testified that on this evening in February of 1986 she and April played a wrestling game with appellant, after which April and Lisa sat on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>appellant\u2019s lap. Appellant began rubbing Lisa\u2019s thigh through her pants leg, and was breathing on her neck. At this time April noticed what was happening and she suggested that she and Lisa go upstairs to Lisa\u2019s room, which is what the girls did. According to April, Lisa asked her not to tell because Lisa was afraid she might get into trouble, and then Lisa cried. About an hour later, Lisa and April went back down to the living room to watch a movie. When Lisa moved to the couch, appellant got out of his chair and moved to the couch. After April fell asleep during the movie, appellant rubbed Lisa\u2019s chest, kissed her on the mouth, and took off her shirt and kissed her on the breasts. He then took off her pants, kissed her on the vagina, and put his tongue inside her vagina. He took off his clothes and attempted to penetrate her vagina with his penis, but when April stirred appellant, got up and left Lisa alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">On March 12, 1986, appellant moved into the new residence that Lisa and her mother had just moved into. A couple of weeks after this, while Lisa\u2019s mother and her live-in flane\u00e9 were asleep in a bedroom, Lisa and appellant were in the living room watching television. Lisa testified appellant began kissing her on the lips, took off her shirt, took off her pants, and began kissing her on the vagina. He put his tongue into her vagina, then tried to insert his penis into it. Lisa resisted, got away, and retreated to her bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Approximately two weeks after this, on a Sunday evening, Lisa and appellant were watching television in the living room. After a time, each retreated to their respective rooms. However, Lisa\u2019s television set was not working correctly, so she asked appellant if she could watch the remainder of the program on the set in his bedroom. Appellant agreed, so Lisa went into the room, sat on the floor, and watched the show while he sat on the bed. Because she was having a hard time seeing the set and became uncomfortable, she got onto the bed with him. Lisa testified that at this time appellant again began kissing her on the lips. Appellant then took off Lisa\u2019s shirt, began kissing her on her breasts, removed her pants, began kissing her on the vagina, and attempted penetration with his tongue. He also attempted penetration with his penis, but was interrupted by a knock on the door. Lisa\u2019s mother had knocked on the door, but went downstairs and into the kitchen when she heard a noise downstairs. Appellant stopped after the knock and let Lisa get dressed. Lisa\u2019s mother returned to the bedroom and found Lisa lying on a pile of blankets in front of the television set, while appellant was lying on the bed. She then told Lisa that it was time for Lisa to go to bed, so Lisa retreated to her bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Throughout all of this, Lisa was afraid to tell her mother because she was afraid appellant would hurt her. She was also afraid of her mother\u2019s temper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>and that it could cause her mother and her mother\u2019s fiance not to get married. Appellant and the fiance were friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The investigation that led to the charges in this case came about when April and another of Lisa\u2019s friends, Carrie, became worried about Lisa and told the school authorities what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The Defense\u2019s Case</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Appellant took the stand in his own defense and testified no improper contact between him and Lisa had ever taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Appellant called as witnesses his mother and brother, who each stated Lisa did not have a very good reputation for telling the truth. Appellant also called as a witness a former live-in lover of Lisa\u2019s mother who testified Lisa had, on one occasion, made up a story about him being her \u201cboyfriend,\u201d and sitting on the couch together, \u201ctouching and kissing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Appellant called as a fourth witness a man who testified he observed appellant and Lisa together during February through March 1986 and, in his opinion, Lisa did not fear appellant at this time. Lastly, appellant called the police officer who had investigated this case, Detective Richard Hawthorne. Detective Hawthorne testified that when he had originally interviewed Lisa she referred to appellant touching her breasts, rather than rubbing her thigh, in summarizing the first incident in February.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">The crucial issues in this case arise out of the denial by the trial court of appellant\u2019s prejury impanelment motion to disallow the use of a prior felony conviction of felony battery (\u00a7 243, subd. (d))<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for impeachment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant testified in the instant case, and the prior felony was used to impeach him. CALJIC No. 2.23,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which instructs the jury in substance that prior felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>convictions can be used only for the purpose of determining credibility, was not given. It is conceded by respondent to be a sua sponte instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We will conclude that a prior conviction of violating section 243, subdivision (d) (felony battery) does not qualify under <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111] as a felony involving moral turpitude and therefore should not have been used to impeach appellant and we will further decide that the error, under the circumstances of this case, was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Pursuant to <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 301, and subject to the trial court\u2019s discretion under Evidence Code section 352, only prior felony convictions that necessarily involve moral turpitude may be used to impeach a witness in a criminal proceeding. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 306.)  \u201cMoral turpitude\u201d means a general \u201c\u2018readiness <em>to </em>do evil\u2019\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 314), i.e., \u201can act of baseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellowmen, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man.\u201d <em>(In re Craig </em>(1938) 12 Cal.2d 93, 97 [82 P.2d 442]; 2 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dict. (3d rev. 1914) p. 2247; 1 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Attorneys, \u00a7 375, pp. 424-426; see also Annot. (1975) 23 A.L.R. Fed. 480, 488 involving exclusion or deportation of aliens under Federal Immigration and Naturalization Act.) <em>Castro </em>makes no attempt to list or define those felonies which involve moral turpitude, but it makes clear that moral turpitude does not depend on dishonesty being an element of the felony. \u201c[I]t is undeniable that a witness\u2019 moral depravity of <em>any kind </em>has some \u2018tendency in reason\u2019 (Evid. Code, \u00a7 210) to shake one\u2019s confidence in his honesty.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 315; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Finally, <em>Castro </em>holds that in deciding whether a felony offered for impeachment necessarily involves moral turpitude, the trial court may look only to the \u201cleast adjudicated elements\u201d of the crime for which the witness was previously convicted. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 317.) This concept simply means that in determining whether a previous felony involves moral turpitude the court cannot go behind the conviction and take evidence on or consider the facts and circumstances of the particular offense. Instead, the court must look to the statutory definition of the particular crime and only if the least adjudicated elements of the crime necessarily involve moral turpitude is the prior conviction admissible for impeachment purposes. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Statler </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 46, 53 [219 Cal.Rptr. 713].)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">\u201cA <em>battery </em>is any willful and unlawful use of force or violence upon the person of another.\u201d (\u00a7 242, italics added.) The word \u201cviolence\u201d has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>real significance. \u201cIt has long been established, both in tort and criminal law, that \u2018the least touching\u2019 may constitute battery. In other words, <em>force </em>against the person is enough; it need not be violent or severe, it need not cause bodily harm or even pain, and it need not leave any mark.\u201d (1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) Crimes Against the Person, \u00a7 258, pp. 243-244; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradbury </em>(1907) 151 Cal. 675, 676 [91 P. 497]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cavazos </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 589, 594 [218 Cal.Rptr. 269]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Whalen </em>(1954) 124 Cal.App.2d 713, 720 [269 P.2d 181].) A person need not have an intent to injure to commit a battery. He only needs to intend to commit the act. (1 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 258, subd. (3), p. 244.) Thus, a simple battery does not necessarily show readiness to do evil or necessarily involve moral turpitude. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cavazos, supra, </em>172 Cal.App.3d at p. 594.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The offense of felony battery is a simple battery which results in serious bodily injury. As the court explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hopkins </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 316 [142 Cal.Rptr. 572], \u201c\u2018technically\u2019 force likely to cause serious bodily injury is not a requirement of section 243.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 320.) Also, \u201c[t]he statute (\u00a7 243) makes a felony of the act of battery which results in serious bodily harm to the victim no matter what means or force was used.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Further, \u201csection 243 focuses on the actual injury inflicted, not on the force used.\u201d <em>(Ibid; </em>see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Parrish </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 336, 343 [217 Cal.Rptr. 700].)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Thus, the state of mind necessary for the commission of a battery with serious bodily injury is the same as that for simple battery; it is only the result which is different. It follows that because simple battery is not a crime involving moral turpitude, battery resulting in serious bodily injury necessarily cannot be a crime of moral turpitude because it also can arise from the \u201cleast touching.\u201d Although serious injury resulting from a simple offensive touching may not be likely,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in determining whether a certain crime is one of moral turpitude, the reviewing court may not go behind the conviction and take evidence on the underlying facts. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">This analysis dictates the least adjudicated elements of battery resulting in serious bodily injury do not necessarily involve force <em>likely </em>to cause serious injury. Again, since it is the least adjudicated elements of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>crime which are looked to in determining whether the crime is one of moral turpitude, and the crime at issue on this appeal can occur from the least offensive \u201cpush,\u201d it is not a crime of moral turpitude. This conclusion that battery resulting in serious bodily injury does not involve moral turpitude accords with common sense and generally accepted community standards. The average person walking down the street would not believe that someone who pushes another is a culprit guilty of moral laxity or \u201cgeneral readiness to do evil,\u201d even if the push was willful and results in serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">We conclude a battery resulting in serious bodily injury in violation of section 243, subdivision (d) is not a crime necessarily involving moral turpitude and the trial court erred in admitting its use for impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Respondent cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 951 [215 Cal.Rptr. 612] as authority for the proposition that battery resulting in serious bodily injury is a crime of moral turpitude. In <em>Williams, </em>the trial court entered a judgment of conviction against defendant upon jury verdicts of guilty of receiving stolen property and possession of a concealable firearm. The trial court had denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of three prior felony convictions for automobile theft, battery by a jail inmate upon a noninmate, and burglary, on the ground Proposition 8 deprived it of discretion to suppress such evidence. On appeal, the defendant asserted that decision was error. The Court of Appeal affirmed. The court held that the trial court erred in failing to exercise discretion to admit or exclude any crimes involved, but such error was not reversible in light of the strong evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. With respect to the prior conviction for battery, the court stated: \u201cIt will be remembered that the prior convictions of the case before us were burglary, automobile theft, and battery by a jail inmate upon a noninmate. As to the burglary and automobile theft convictions, moral turpitude was clearly involved. And, we opine, that battery by a jail inmate upon a noninmate, a crime of violence, demonstrates \u2018a general readiness to do evil,\u2019 and thus moral turpitude. All reasonably lay within the broad discretion reposed in the trial court by <em>Castro </em>and Evidence Code section 352.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>169 Cal.App.3d at P. 957.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">At no point did the court discuss the least adjudicated elements of battery by a jail inmate upon a noninmate, as required by <em>Castro. </em>The conclusion of the <em>Williams </em>court that this is a crime of moral turpitude appears to be a conclusion which relied on the underlying facts of the conviction, contrary to the precepts of <em>Castro. </em>We disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Hamlin, Acting P. J., and Ballantyne, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 4, 1988, and respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 21, 1988.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b60-13\"> Retired Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal sitting under assignment by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b60-14\"> All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b62-13\"> Section 243, subdivision (d) provides: \u201cWhen a battery is committed against any person and serious bodily injury is inflicted on the person, the battery is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more than one year or imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or four years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b62-14\"> The circumstances of the prior conviction were that appellant and his friends had gotten involved in a brawl at a pizza restaurant, and he struck a person in the face with a motorcycle helmet, inflicting serious facial injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b62-15\"> CALJIC No. 2.23 provides: \u201cThe fact that a witness had been convicted of a felony, if such be a fact, may be considered by you only for the purpose of determining the credibility of that witness. The fact of such a conviction does not necessarily destroy or impair the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>witness\u2019 credibility. It is one of the circumstances that you may take into consideration in weighing the testimony of such a witness.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b64-8\"> Such a scenario may not be likely, but at least one court in another context has recognized it could happen: \u201c *. . . section 243 addresses the result of conduct rather than proscribing specific conduct. Thus, one may conceivably commit a felony battery without committing an aggravated assault. For example, a push that results in a fall and concomitant serious injury may not be sufficient deadly force to permit successful prosecution under section 245, subdivision (a). <em>However, it is triable as felony battery. </em>\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Ronnie N. </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 731, 735 [220 Cal.Rptr. 365], italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 82.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
