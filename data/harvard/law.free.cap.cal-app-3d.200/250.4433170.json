The question presented is whether a cause of action has been stated according to the \u201cmarket share\u201d theory of liability adopted in <em>Sindell </em>v. <em>Abbott Laboratories </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 588 [163 Cal.Rptr. 132, 607 P.2d 924, 2 A.L.R.4th 1061], for the removal of asbestos products from residential housing throughout the state. We hold that no such cause of action has been alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Measured against the familiar rules governing our review (see <em>Sklar </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 616, 621 [230 Cal.Rptr. 42]), these are the salient allegations of the amended complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">Plaintiffs Evelyn Mullen, Robert Doherty, and John M. Korn are the owners of homes located in San Francisco, Marin, and Contra Costa counties, respectively. On behalf of a class consisting of all natural persons who own \u201chomes\u201d built from 1912 through 1978 which contain \u201cfriable asbestos, friable asbestos materials, or friable asbestos-containing products mined, manufactured, sold or distributed by defendants,\u201d they commenced this action against more than 40 companies \u201cwhich have been and/or are now engaged in the mining, manufacturing or supplying of friable asbestos, friable-asbestos containing materials, or friable asbestos-containing products.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Plaintiffs alleged that \u201casbestos is a known human carcinogen\u201d and causative agent for numerous other ailments. When it deteriorates into the \u201cfriable\u201d condition, \u201casbestos in homes results in the present and continuing contamination of persons and property as well as creating a serious risk of harm to persons ... as well as . . . rendering plaintiffs\u2019 property unsafe and unreasonably dangerous.\u201d \u201cAsbestos is but a single ingredient in various insulation, fireproofing and decorative materials applied in plaintiffs\u2019 homes. Asbestos has contaminated, among other things, the remainder of the insulator fireproofing and decorative materials, the curtains, drapes, walls, floors, carpets, ceilings, furniture, clothing and food of the occupants of the homes. . . . Asbestos cannot be effectively removed from said materials and . . . ordinary cleaning merely . . . worsens the contamination.\u201d These conditions have significantly reduced the value of plaintiffs\u2019 homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Plaintiffs further alleged that defendants knew of these dangers but intentionally suppressed public disclosure, failed to label their products, and failed to warn of the dangers \u201con the relationship between asbestos exposure and disease\u201d when asbestos products were \u201cplaced into the stream of commerce.\u201d In addition, \u201c[t]he asbestos products of [some of] the defendants were functionally interchangeable with the asbestos products of the remaining defendants\u201d and \u201c[t]here are no adequate testing or sampling procedures available to identify which defendant made a particular asbestos-containing product.\u201d It would for these reasons \u201cbe impossible for plaintiffs and the class to identify which of the defendants is responsible for the mining, milling, fabricating, manufacturing or selling of the friable asbestos or materials and the asbestos-containing products used in their homes.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe present harm and threat to health and safety posed by friable asbestos, friable asbestos materials, and friable asbestos-containing products does not vary significantly as between such asbestos materials or products produced by the different defendants. The materials and products are fungible in this regard, among others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Based upon these allegations, plaintiffs purported to state causes of action for negligence, strict liability, nuisance, breach of implied warranty, civil conspiracy, \u201cfailure to warn,\u201d and \u201cconcert of action.\u201d The primary feature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>of plaintiffs\u2019 prayer was their request for \u201crecovery of the general and special compensatory damages for the costs of inspection, estimation of damages, analysis, containment, removal, replacement, and abatement of friable asbestos-containing materials and friable asbestos-containing products in plaintiffs\u2019 homes and to pay for alternative living accommodations while their homes are being repaired and the asbestos abated (their homes being uninhabitable and dangerous during such repair and abatement work) in an amount to be determined, but estimated to be in excess of <em>$ 1,000,000,000.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>They also sought prejudgment interest, exemplary damages in an undetermined amount, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and general relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">A salvo of general demurrers were interposed to each count of the amended complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A common theme developed by defendants was that their respective products were capable of being individually identified, thus defeating application of the <em>Sindell </em>approach. After conducting extensive hearings on the demurrers, the trial court sustained them without leave to amend. A judgment of dismissal ensued which is the subject of this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\"><em>Sindell </em>v. <em>Abbott Laboratories </em>involved a class action by women who developed or were likely to develop cancer caused by their mothers\u2019 prenatal ingestion of the drug diethylstilbesterol (DES). Their complaint was dismissed after the manufacturers successfully demurred on the ground that the plaintiffs could not identify which of the manufacturers had produced the DES administered to each plaintiff\u2019s mother. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of dismissal. The essential holding of <em>Sindell </em>has been summarized in these terms: \u201c[T]he likelihood that any one of several manufacturers of a generic drug, marketed and promoted for a use which proved to produce harmful effects in the yet unborn daughters of the women to whom it was administered, supplied the product that allegedly injured the plaintifljs] may be measured by the percentage which the product sold by each such manufacturer bears to the entire production of the drug sold by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>all for that purpose.\u201d <em>(Sheffield </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 583, 593 [192 Cal.Rptr. 870].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">One of the predicates for <em>Sindell </em>liability is the absence of discernible distinguishing features or characterics of the instrumentalities produced by the industry defendants. The court took pains to establish that it was dealing with \u201cfungible goods\u201d\u2014specifically, a drug produced \u201cfrom an identical formula.\u201d <em>(Sindell </em>v. <em>Abbott Laboratories, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d 588 at pp. 610611.)  Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that market share liability should be extended from the DES field of <em>Sindell </em>to the asbestos industry proceeds on the premise that DES and asbestos are simple equivalents. This is far from being the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u201cThe word \u2018asbestos\u2019 is derived from the Greek word meaning \u2018inextinguishable\u2019 and the origin of its name reflects one of its principal characteristics: fire resistance. But asbestos has many other qualities which enhance its commercial utility, among them tensile strength, durability, flexibility, and resistance to heat, wear, and corrosion.\u201d (1 Rep. of the Royal Com. on Matters of Health and Safety Arising from the Use of Asbestos in Ontario (1984) 75 [fn. omitted].) \u201cOver 3,000 separate uses of asbestos have been identified .... [T]hese uses depend principally upon the physical and chemical properties of asbestos fibres and the particular characteristics of individual fibre types.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 89.) It has figured in commercial production for more than a century. (See <em>Borel </em>v. <em>Fibreboard Paper Products Corporation </em>(5th Cir. 1973) 493 F.2d 1076, 1083, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The briefest consideration demonstrates numerous inherent differences between DES and asbestos. We quote from the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of this problem: \u201cDES was produced by hundreds of companies <em>pursuant to one formula. </em>As a result, all DES had identical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>physical properties and chemical compositions and, consequently, all DES prescribed to pregnant women created the same risk of harm ....</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u201cAsbestos products, on the other hand, have widely divergent toxicities, with some asbestos products presenting a much greater risk of harm than others. [Citations.] This divergence is caused by a combination of factors, including: the specific type of asbestos fiber incorporated into the product; the physical properties of the product itself; and the percentage of asbestos used in the product. There are six different asbestos silicates used in industrial applications and each presents a distinct degree of toxicity in accordance with the shape and aerodynamics of the individual fibers. Further, it has been established that the geographical origin of the mineral can affect the substance\u2019s harmful effects. A product\u2019s toxicity is also related to whether the product is in the form of a solid block or a loosely packed insulating blanket and to the amount of dust a product generates. The product\u2019s form determines the ability of the asbestos fibers to become airborne and, hence, to be inhaled or ingested. The greater the product\u2019s susceptibility to produce airborne fibers, the greater the product\u2019s potential to produce disease. Finally, those products with high concentrations of asbestos fibers have corresponding high potentials for inducing asbestos-related injuries.\u201d <em>(Celotex Corp. </em>v. <em>Copeland </em>(Fla. 1985) 471 So.2d 533, 537-538; accord <em>Vigiolto </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Corp. </em>(W.D.Pa. 1986) 643 F.Supp. 1454, 1463.)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\"><em>Sindell </em>involved a group of 11 defendants all \u201cengaged in the business of manufacturing, promoting, and marketing\u201d a single product \u201cproduced . . . from an identical formula.\u201d <em>(Sindell </em>v. <em>Abbott Laboratories, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d 588 at pp. 593, 611.) By contrast, asbestos is a generic designation possessing a rainbow-like diversity and a bewildering array of potential uses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The scope of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is not quite so broad, but it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>reach \u201cvarious insulation, fireproofing and decorative materials applied in plaintiffs\u2019 homes.\u201d Such diverse products are obviously not \u201cproduced . . . from an identical formula.\u201d The activities of our defendants are likewise correspondingly greater than those of the defendants in <em>Sindell: </em>the more than 40 defendants named by plaintiffs are identified as having \u201cmined, milled, . . . designed, manufactured, developed, fabricated, assembled, labeled, advertised, marketed, sold, distributed, supplied, installed, and/or applied\u201d asbestos in various forms. In addition, market share liability was formulated in the singular situation of <em>Sindell </em>where the injured parties attacked \u201ca product which carried with it a singular risk factor.\u201d <em>(Case </em>v. <em>Fibreboard Corp., supra, </em>743 P.2d 1062 at p. 1066; see <em>Sindell </em>v. <em>Abbott Laboratories, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d 588 at pp. 611-612.) By contrast, plaintiffs here seek recovery for damage to their persons and their property. Because \u201casbestos is not a \u2018product,\u2019 but rather a generic name for a family of minerals\u201d <em>(Goldman </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Sales Corp. </em>(1987) 33 Ohio St.3d 40 [514 N.E.2d 691, 700]) employed in a myriad of uses, the unavoidable conclusion is that plaintiffs are attacking an entire industry, not seeking recovery for damages caused by a single fungible product \u201ccarr[y]ing with it a singular risk factor.\u201d In light of these circumstances, the prerequisite of fungibility has not been demonstrated. Plaintiffs have therefore failed to state a cause of action for market share liability. We thus align California, the progenitor of the market share theory of liability, with the great majority of jurisdictions which have declined to extend it to the field of asbestos-related injuries.

(See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 430.30, 430.70; Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 452-453.) The court granted defendants\u2019 request in full and plaintiffs\u2019 request in part. Further requests for judicial notice of additional materials were granted by this court during the pendency of this appeal. Certain of the matters noticed by both courts will figure in our resolution of the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\"> \u201cDescribing the theory of market share liability is much easier than defining it:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">\u201c \u2018Under this doctrine, the traditional prerequisite of identifying the manufacturer of the injury-causing product is eliminated when the product is a generic item produced by several manufacturers. In such cases, plaintiffs need only allege inability to identify the actual manufacturer and join as defendants those manufacturers that compose a \u201csubstantial share\u201d of the market. Plaintiffs then proceed with their case against those members of the industry that are named as defendants. This theory shifts the burden of proof to each manufacturer to prove its innocence....</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">\u201c \u2018If, after proceeding against the industry in this manner, plaintiff successfully establishes liability, damages are simply apportioned among defendants on the basis of each defendant\u2019s share of the product market. The resultant market share liability imposed thus \u201capproximate^ each manufacturer\u2019s] responsibility for the injuries caused by its own products.\u201d A defendant can avoid liability only by proving that it did not produce the specific product that harmed the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hannon </em>v. <em>Waterman S.S.

The minerals\u2019 physical properties vary so that only six varieties are of substantial economic value. These six minerals are chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, anthophyllite, tremolite, and actinolite. Chrysotile, known for its silky white color, its durability, and its flexibility, is the most widely used asbestos fiber. Manufacturers use it in the production of asbestos textiles, cement products, friction materials, insulation, and paper products. It is the least dangerous of the economically useful fibers. Crocidolite, a harsher, blue fiber, is used in pipes, cement products, textiles, and felts for plastics. Crocidolite, which is resistant to acids and alkalides, is more difficult to process than many of the other fibers and is the most dangerous of the asbestos fibers. Amosite is a harsh, brown fiber. It is extremely heat resistant, and manufacturers use it in cement, pipes, refractory tiles, and plastic reinforcement. It is a moderately dangerous fiber. Anthophyllite is used in cement production and the chemical industry. Tremolite is used for talc filters and in the chemical industry. <em>Actinolite </em>usually is not used commercially. .. .</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>\u201c \u2018Primary uses of asbestos include floor tile; gaskets and packing; friction products; paints; coatings; sealants; plastics; asbestos-cement pipe; asbestos textiles; asbestos paper; and asbestos-cement sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u201c \u2018Secondary uses of asbestos include flooring; valve, flange, and pump sealants; clutch, transmission, and brake components; industrial friction materials; automobile coatings; roof coating and patch; electric motor components; piping; conduits for electric wires; packaging components; gasket components; heat and fireproof clothing; insulation for wiring; theater curtains; fireproof drapery; table pads and heat protective mats; molten glass handling equipment; insulation products; filters for beverages; appliance insulation; hood vents for corrosive materials; electric switchboards; miscellaneous building materials; appliance components; and cooling tower components.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\u201c \u2018Consumer uses include piping; decorative building panels; plaster and stucco; molded plastics; acoustical products; asphalt paving; caulking; motor armatures; paints; welding materials; drip cloths; fire doors; car components; oven and stove insulation; siding; shingles; floor tiles; chemical tanks; fire hoses; garments; gloves; filter media; boiler insulation; furniture; motion picture screens; roofing; rugs; wallboard; acoustical ceiling materials; insulation; electrical switches; hair dryers; clothes dryers; toasters; humidifiers; and toothbrushes.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Case </em>v. <em>Fibreboard Corp. </em>(Okla. 1987) 743 P.2d 1062, 1065-1066 [citing and quoting <em>An Analysis of the Legal, Social, and Political Issues Raised by Asbestos Litigation </em>(1983) 36 Vand.

Action No. 828-684 [General Order No. 21, filed Mar. 13, 1985].)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Defendants also argue that the number and diversity of uses to which asbestos has been employed makes it impossible to identify the \u201crelevant market\u201d as contemplated by <em>Sindell. </em>The court in <em>Sindell </em>expressly noted that it was \u201cnot unmindful of the practical problems involved in defining the market and determining market share, but these are largely matters of proof which properly cannot be determined at the pleading stage . . . .\u201d <em>(Sindell </em>v. <em>Abbott Laboratories, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d 588 at p. 613 [fn. omitted].) Counsel have informed us that several asbestos manufacturers\u2014including the industry\u2019s largest, Johns-Manville\u2014are currently involved in bankruptcy proceedings. (See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Sales Corp. </em>(5th Cir. 1985) 750 F.2d 1314, 1336.) Although we agree that the absence of these firms would aggravate considerably the difficulty or even feasibility of ascertaining the market shares of the firms dealing with asbestos which have been joined as defendants in this action (see <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Sales Corp., supra, </em>514 N.E.2d 691 at p. 701; <em>Hannon </em>v. <em>Waterman S.S.
