Held that the bill for review was properly dismissed for the reason that he had a complete remedy in the foreclosure proceeding if his contention was correct, first, by demurring to the foreclosure hill; second, by appealing from the deficiency decree entered against him; or third, by taking a writ of error and reviewing the whole proceeding for failure to find his ownership of the land, it also appearing that he could have answered the original bill setting up his conveyance, and it further appearing that he still had a right to prosecute a writ of error from the entire proceeding.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"A4O\" pgmap=\"283\">2.
