In an action to recover a sum due for milk cans furnished the defendant, where the amount alleged to he due was unquestioned, and defendant sought to recoup damages for breach of the contract, held that a verdict and judgment in favor of plaintiff for a sum which showed that defendant was allowed more on his claim of recoupment than he claimed and proved, could not be sustained, it appearing from the pleadings and proofs there was no basis for exemplary damages and the only question presented being whether in quality and weight the cans were such as plaintiff contracted to furnish.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"A9g\" pgmap=\"98\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
