Brown against Edward M. Brown praying for a divorce on the grounds of cruelty and adultery. The bill alleged that after the marriage complainant bought real estate with her own money, that the defendant without complainant\u2019s knowledge and consent procured the insertion of his name as a grantee jointly with complainant, and that defendant thereafter refused to release to her his interest thus acquired. The bill prayed for a decree requiring defendant to execute such release and convey to complainant all his interest in the real estate. The court dismissed the bill for want of equity, and complainant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-5\" pgmap=\"135\">The appellant assigned as errors the action of the court in refusing a decree of divorce and also in refusing to require appellee to release and convey to complainant his interest in said real estate.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-6\" pgmap=\"135\">Chytraus, Healy &amp; Frost and Edwin White Moore, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-7\" pgmap=\"135\">Bluim &amp; Teed, for appellee.</attorneys><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b135-9\" pgmap=\"135\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aql\" pgmap=\"135\">1.

Praying and perfecting an appeal to the Appellate Court and assigning errors which such court has jurisdiction to determine, held not to constitute a waiver or abandonment of the question whether a freehold is involved, where the appellant made his motion for a transfer of the appeal to the Supreme Court before any briefs or abstracts were filed in the Appellate Court.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"Abt\" pgmap=\"135\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
