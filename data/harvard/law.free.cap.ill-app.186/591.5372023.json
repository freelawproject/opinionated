The declaration consisted of three counts. The first count alleged that defendant permitted the roof of the mine where deceased was working to remain in dangerous condition and that it failed to place, a conspicuous mark at the place of danger. The second count charged, in addition to the first, that defendant failed to withhold the entrance check of deceased, and the third count charged common-law negligence in not furnishing deceased a safe place to work. From a judgment entered on a verdict in favor of plaintiff for seven hundred and fifty dollars, defendant appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b638-5\" pgmap=\"638\">M.

In an action for the death of a miner resulting from a fall of a piece of slate from the roof of the mine, where the questions raised were whether the roof of the mine was in a dangerous condition and whether such dangerous condition could have been ascertained by a reasonable careful examination on the part of defendant made at the usual time required by law, held that a verdict for plaintiff was sustained by the evidence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Abhd\" pgmap=\"638\">2.
