In a suit against the Security Insurance Company plaintiff recovered a judgment for seven hundred and seventy-five dollars, but on appeal to the Appellate Court the judgment was reversed and the cause remanded. Security Ins. Co. v. Slack, 183 Ill. App. 579. The pleadings in that case and the present one appear to be identical and the evidence much the same except in some minor particulars. The decision in the former case is controlling on some of the questions raised in the present case, and reference must be had to the opinion in that case for the decision on those questions.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b611-10\" pgmap=\"611\">E.
