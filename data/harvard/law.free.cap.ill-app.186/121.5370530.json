The bailiff was unable to obtain possession of the goods, and thereafter the defendants entered their appearance and the court gave leave to plaintiff to file a statement of claim in trover. No such statement was filed, but the parties treated the action as one of trover. The jury found defendants guilty and assessed plaintiff\u2019s damages at three hundred and fifty dollars.

In an action of trover against several defendants to recover for certain furniture, held that a judgment against the defendants was erroneous as to one of the defendants and must be reversed as to all, there being no evidence to show that such defendant had possession of any of the furniture in question at the time the demand was made or at any other time, nor that she ever claimed to he entitled to possession of or to have any right in the property.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"A_V\" pgmap=\"168\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
