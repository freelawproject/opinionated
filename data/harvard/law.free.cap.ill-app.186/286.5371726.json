Adams against J ohn Gordon praying for an injunction restraining defendant from interfering with her use of a path and well, claiming an easement therein,' It appeared that defendant owned a tract of land and conveyed a portion of the same to complainant\u2019s grantor, whose contract of sale gave him the right to nse a well and its appurtenances and a path not exceeding eight feet in width leading to the well located on that part of the defendant\u2019s tract not sold, until such time as public water should be laid and installed in an adjoining public street or highway. The conveyance to' complainant was by an ordinary warranty deed with no recital of easements or appurtenances. A demurrer was filed to complainant\u2019s bill, the demurrer was sustained and on complainant electing to stand by her bill the bill was dismissed for want of equity. To reverse the decree, complainant appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-5\" pgmap=\"333\">Shepard, McCormick &amp; Thomasson, John D. Pope, and Perry S.
