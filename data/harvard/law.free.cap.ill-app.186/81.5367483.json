The plaintiff was a manufacturer of ladies\u2019 suits and cloaks and occupied a floor of a fireproof building. He carried insurance amounting to $17,000 upon his stock of merchandise, represented by seventeen policies of $1,000 each, issued in different insurance companies. The statement of claim alleged that the plaintiff sustained a loss of $24,993.06; that he made proofs of loss; that an appraisement was made pursuant to the provisions of the policy; and that the appraisers fixed the sound value of plaintiff\u2019s property at the sum of $11,550, and the loss and damage thereon at the same amount. Upon a trial before a jury, a verdict was rendered for plaintiff for $710.55, being one-seventeenth of $11,-550, with interest. To reverse a judgment, entered upon the verdict, defendant brings error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b127-9\" pgmap=\"127\">Charles B.
