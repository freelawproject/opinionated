Wright against Anton J. Cermak, bailiff of the Municipal Court of Chicago, and H. P. Cullen to recover $15 as attorney\u2019s fees and $8.75 claimed to have been paid for storage charges on an automobile. Previous to the action the defendant, Cermak, levied an execution on plaintiff\u2019s automobile and had it stored in a warehouse. The plaintiff brought a proceeding to try the right of property under section 311a, ch. 37, Hurd\u2019s B. S., J &amp; A. \u00b6 3361, and recovered a judgment awarding an execution for the automobile and for cost of the proceedings. The warehouse receipt was turned over to the plaintiff and when plaintiff called for his automobile he was compelled to pay $8.75 for storage charges; and this action was brought for that sum and attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered by plaintiff\u2019s attorney in the proceeding for trial of right of property. To reverse a judgment in favor of plaintiff for $8.75, defendant Cermak brings error.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-10\" pgmap=\"87\">On the trial, proof of the amount claimed for attorney\u2019s fees was excluded as not a proper element of damages.
