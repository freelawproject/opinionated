Sales, \u00a7 330<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when direction of verdict for plaintiff improper. In an action to recover a balance due for belt butts sold and delivered to defendants, defendant set up in an affidavit of merits and urged upon the trial as a defense that plaintiff, with intent to defraud defendant, knowingly and wilfully loaded, charged or treated the belt butts with large quantities of glucose for the purpose of wrongfully increasing their weight. At the close of defendant\u2019s case the court instructed the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff. Held that a direction of a verdict for plaintiff was error, where the testimony introduced on behalf of defendant tended to show that it could not be determined from an inspection that the butts contained glucose; that the president of plaintiff Company represented that they had not been loaded or doped, but as a matter of fact he had knowledge that glucose had been applied to them; and that there was shrinkage in weight after the butts were \"curried\u201d owing to their containing large quantities of glucose.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"ALL\" pgmap=\"59\"> See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.

Where there is in the record any evidence from which, if it stood alone, the jury could, without acting unreasonably in the eye of the law, find that all the material averments of the declaration had been proved, then the cause should be submitted to the jury. The same rules are applicable where the defendant introduces evidence tending to support an affirmative defense to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action and the plaintiff, at the close of defendant\u2019s evidence, moves for a directed verdict in his favor.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"A6p\" pgmap=\"60\">4.
