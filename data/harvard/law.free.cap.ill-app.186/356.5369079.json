Assumpsit, action of, \u00a7 89<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when recovery for digging ditch sustained by evidence. In an action to recover charges for digging a ditch across defendant\u2019s land, plaintiff claimed that the work was done under an express contract that he was to be paid a certain sum per rod, and defendant claimed that he made no such contract but that he gave plaintiff permission to cross his land with the ditch if a third party, who was benefited by the ditch as an outlet, would pay for it, and that plaintiff said he would charge the work to the third party: Held that a verdict for plaintiff was sustained by the evidence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aj7\" pgmap=\"403\">2.

Appeal and ereob, \u00a7 1560<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when refusal of requested instruction harmless. Refusal of a requested instruction which was not based upon any proof and was against appellant\u2019s interest, held harmless.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ax_\" pgmap=\"403\">5. Contracts, \u00a7 393<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when requested instruction properly refused. In an action to recover charges for digging a ditch, an instruction requested by defendant stated that if the minds of the parties did not come together upon all the terms and conditions of the alleged contract plaintiff could not recover. Held that the instruction was too broad as applied to the case, the pleadings being oral and defendant testifying that plaintiff said nothing about the price, in which case it would appear that defendant retained a bill for the work, without objection, for such a time as to establish an admission and acquiescence\" in the price charged.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b403-13\" pgmap=\"403\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
