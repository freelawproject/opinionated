Master and servant, \u00a7 696<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when finding that coemploye was vice-principal sustained 6y the evidence. In an action for personal injuries sustained, by plaintiff while in the employ of defendant and engaged in working with a riveting gang on a building, it appeared that plaintiff was a new man and that the injury resulted from the breaking of a defective board on which he was standing while performing his work. Plaintiff claimed that one of the gang with whom he was working was directing the work and that his failure to provide a proper scaffold was negligence of the defendant, while defendant claimed that such person was a fellow-servant. Held that the question whether such person was a vice-principal and had charge of the work was a question of fact and that a 'finding of the jury in favor of plaintiff was sustained by the evidence.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b552-17\" pgmap=\"552\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
