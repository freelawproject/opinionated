(2) That the judgment is against the law and the evidence. (3) That upon the facts disclosed by the record, the judgment must necessarily be rendered against the appellee and in favor of the appellant. (4) That the court erred in admitting improper evidence on the part of appell\u00e9e and erroneously overruled a motion of appellant, made at the close of appellee\u2019s case, to strike out all the evidence and find for appellant.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-5\" pgmap=\"292\">A.
