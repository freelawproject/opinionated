H. Fitzsimmons against William Cowan and Maggie Cowan, his wife, the McHenry Comity State Bank and Fred Siebel to forclose a trust deed securing a promissory note for $2,500. The note and mortgage were executed by the Cowans to J. D. Donovan upon a lot in the city of Woodstock, and the note became the property of the complainant. Subsequent to the execution of the trust deed, William Cowan executed two promissory notes for $1,000 each to the Bank and gave the Bank a second trust deed on the same real estate to secure the same. This trust deed was not executed by Cowan\u2019s wife. After the second trust deed was recorded, Fred Siebel obtained a judgment against the Cowans and had an execution within one year. The Bank was not served and Donovan was not made a party to the bill. A decree was entered finding the amount due to complainant and directed a sale of the premises and the payment of said sum to complainant from the proceeds of the sale. The decree further directed that the master, out of the interest of William Cowan in the remainder of said proceeds, pay the Bank the sum found due it \u201cif he can determine his interest\u201d and bring the balance into court. The master made his report of sale and of payment to complainant in full and that he had in his hands $1,107.96, the balance of the proceeds of said sale, awaiting further order for distribution, as he was unable to ascertain William Cowan\u2019s interest in the real estate. Thereafter the court entered an order that the balance of the proceeds be paid by the master to the Bank \u201cand that it be accepted by the Bank subject to the inchoate right of dower which the defendant Maggie Cowan, may or might have in and to said sum.\u201d From the last order, Fred Siebel appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-4\" pgmap=\"405\">M.
