E. Blakeslee and P. J. Cruise charging that defendants were unlawfully holding and executing the positions of mayor and alderman of the city of Earlville, and the positions of president, secretary and member of the board of local improvements of said city, and prayed that they be required to answer by what warrant they and each of them claimed to hold and execute said offices. Respondents filed a plea setting up their title to said offices. A general and special demurrer was interposed to said plea, and the demurrer was overruled and the People elected to abide by its demurrer. The court entered a rule on the People to reply instanter, defaulted the People for want of a reply, found the respondents not guilty, and entered a judgment that the defendant recover from the People, on the relation of Charles Agnew, their costs, with execution therefor.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-5\" pgmap=\"264\">From the order, plaintiff prosecutes an appeal.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-6\" pgmap=\"264\">L.

Where plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to a plea has been overruled and the plaintiff has elected to abide by its demurrer, it is improper for the court to enter a rule upon plaintiff to reply and to default plaintiff and enter a finding on his failure to reply; and on appeal from the order such matters appearing in the record are surplusage and the appeal will be dismissed for want of a final judgment.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b264-12\" pgmap=\"264\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
