Thompson, county treasurer of Cook county, making Nicholas Streit, Frederick H. Streit, Adam Streit, Adam J. Kasper, Catherine S. Fay, Thomas Fay, John Esten Cooke, H. Brent Cooke, John Esten Cooke, Jr., Elizabeth B. Cooke,' Pauline M. Cooke, H.' Brent Cooke, Jr., Sallie W\". Cooke, Lydia W. Cooke Wickliffe and City of Chicago parties to the proceeding to determine the ownership of a certain fund in the hands of the county treasurer. The fund in question arose out of a condemnation proceeding instituted by the South Park Commissioners to condemn two lots in a certain part of Chicago, in which the jury awarded a verdict fixing the value of the lots at $3,226.25, and the value of the improvements on the lots at $2,690. The Park Commissioners paid the total award into the hands of the county treasurer of Cook county, and upon a dispute arising as to the ownership of the fund the bill was filed. Subsequently, William L. O\u2019Connell became successor of John B. Thompson to the office of county treasurer. Nicholas Streit and Frederick H. Streit were defaulted for failure to file answers. The court found and decreed the equities as to the sum of $2,690 to be with Adam J. Kasper at the time of the condemnation suit as owner of the buildings and improvements, that Catherine S. Fay was entitled to receive out of the sum of $3,226.25 the value of certain life estates, and that the Cookes were each entitled to receive one-sixth of the remainder of the sum of $3,226.-25 after deducting the interest of said Catherine S. Fay. Catherine S. Fay and the Cookes appeal to reverse that part of the decree awarding $2,690 to defendant Kaspar.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-5\" pgmap=\"160\">Charles S.
