Hale against Edward A. Ferguson, Union Central Life Insurance Company and Charles W. Sampson to enjoin the collection of a judgment entered against complainant in favor of Ferguson on a promissory note, and also to enjoin the collection of a judgment recovered on an appeal bond. A demurrer was filed setting up that the face of the bill showed that the matter was res adjudicaba and that there had been laches in prosecuting it. The demurrer was sustained and the bill dismissed. Later the complainant moved to vacate the order of dismissal and to make Lelia H. Hale a party complainant and the motion was denied. Thereupon complainant sued out a writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-9\" pgmap=\"202\">Previous to the filing of the bill, Ferguson recovered a judgment against the complainant on a promissory note before a justice of the peace, and on appeal to the Circuit Court a judgment was entered for the same amount, and from the judgment Hale appealed to the Appellate Court and the judgment was affirmed.

On appeal from the judgment to the Appellate Court the judgment was affirmed. See 162 Ill. App. 523.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-3\" pgmap=\"203\">Edward J.
