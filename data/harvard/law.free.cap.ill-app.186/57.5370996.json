In an action on a county clerk\u2019s official bond, certain counts in the declaration alleged that the county clerk charged and collected excessive fees for the issuance of tax deeds and for recording the evidence upon which they were based, and the remaining counts were based on a claim that in each deed issued on the affidavit required as a foundation therefor the county clerk included but a single parcel of land instead of several, thus causing an increased cost to the relator for record of the tax deeds. Held that assuming the action would lie on the bond for\" such breaches, a general demurrer to the declaration was properly sustained for the reason that no one of the former counts alleged what amount or fee could legally have been required for recording such evidence, and for the reason that the allegations of the latter counts were hut mere conclusions, there being no allegations of fact from which the court could infer whether more than one lot should have been included in a tax deed or not.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"AfO\" pgmap=\"103\"> See Illinois Notes Digest, Veis.
