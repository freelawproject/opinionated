On petition for mandamus by highway commissioners to compel drainage commissioners to build a bridge over a ditch dug by defendants at a point where such ditch crossed a public highway, a plea stating that the commissioners condemned the right of way over and across the lands of a railroad company and that the ditch was constructed along the right of way as condemned against said railroad company and that by virtue of condemnation and payment of the sum found due the railroad company, the railroad was required to maintain necessary crossings for highways, held demurrable for the reason that the fact that the defendants had condemned the right of way as to the railroad company would not excuse the performance of their duty to build the bridge.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
