Section 8 of the divorce statute, J. &amp; A. j[ 4223, requiring, that the cause of divorce be fully proven by reliable witnesses, does not apply when a trial is had and issues joined by bill, answer and replication. In such case the ordinary chancery rules apply and the weight of the testimony is the thing to be considered even though that question may be decided in favor of a party having but one witness.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AsKA\" pgmap=\"280\">2.

Decree of divorce finding wife guilty of adultery, held sustained by the testimony of the paramour, where the wife denies what the paramour says and is discredited in her testimony by the fact that she denies other circumstances tending to incriminate her that are sworn to by other witnesses in corroboration of the paramour, and there is also testimony of other witnesses of her acts tending to show an adulterous disposition.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aibc\" pgmap=\"280\">3.
