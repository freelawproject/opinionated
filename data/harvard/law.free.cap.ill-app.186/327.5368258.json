In an action to recover overpayments made on a carload of junk purchased by plaintiffs of defendants at a certain price a pound, it appeared that an agent of defendants represented in a memorandum that there was a certain number of pounds of different kinds of metal consisting of, brass, copper, white borings, yellow borings, brass and iron, and copper and iron, and that one of the plaintiffs inquired what the white borings were and was told to go to investigate the same at the place they were loaded in the car, which he did, and it appeared that the plaintiffs after receiving the car found there was a shortage in weight on several items and very much less \u201cbrass\u201d than the memorandum called for, and a very much greater weight of the item of \u201cbrass and iron.\u201d The defense to the action was that defendants did not warrant the brass to be free from iron and that plaintiffs could not recover the shortage because one of them inspected the car. Held, that the inspection was to ascertain what was meant by \u201cwhite borings,\u201d that the plaintiffs had no opportunity to ascertain the weights of each kind of metals in the car and that a verdict for plaintiffs was proper.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
