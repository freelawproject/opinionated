A requested instruction telling the jury \u201cthat, although you may believe from the evidence that the defendant did not stop its car for plaintiff to alight, yet that fact does not justify the plaintiff in going upon the platform and so near to the step as to be in a dangerous position while the car was running at a high rate of speed, and if you believe, from the evidence, that before the defendant\u2019s car began to slacken its speed the plaintiff went upon said platform and near to the steps of said car while it was running at a high rate of speed, and that his action in so doing was negligent, and a lack of due care for his own safety, and that such action on his part helped to bring about the injury, then you should find the defendant not guilty,\u201d held improperly refused.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b629-12\" pgmap=\"629\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
