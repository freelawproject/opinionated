To reverse this judgment they prosecute this writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b239-3\">Mr. Aechibald, for defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhD\">suggested diminution of the record in two points: That the transcript return\u00e9d heretofore omits to show, as the fact is, that the interrogatories, exhibited to the now plaintiff in error, and the answer thereto were indorsed upon the writ of attachment in the court below. Also, that by the said transcript it appears that the answer to said interrogatories were given on the 3d day of July, whereas in truth, the same was given on the 23d day of July, and he prayed for a <em>certiorari </em>commanding the county court to certify a full transcript.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b239-4\">Mr. Yeaman, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALz\">stipulated to admit the alleged diminution as to the second point, and that the record might be treated as amended according to the suggestion ; as to the first point he insisted that whether the alleged diminution exists or not is immaterial.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b239-5\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Atr\">As to the second point of diminution alleged, the stipulation of counsel of plaintiff in error will be entered of record, and may supply the place of the <em>certiorari </em>and return. The record will be amended in this point according to the defendant\u2019s suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">As to the first point in which the transcript is alleged to be defective, the writ may go. The materiality of the alleged defect will not in general be inquired into on suggestion of diminution. <em>Reed </em>v. Curry, 40 Ill. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">It is unnecessary, however, that the county court should-certify matters already before us. The writ will, therefore, direct the county court to certify whether the writ of attachment has indorsed thereon the interrogatories propounded to the plaintiff in error as garnishee, and the answer thereto, or either of them. Counsel for defendant are advised to frame the writ, for which a precedent may be found. 2 Cow. 38-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\n<em>Writ of certiorari allowed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
