Kenney, Jr., on an indictment charging possession of child pornography, in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress approximately 323 computer images depicting children in a state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>of nudity, or depicting children engaged in sexual conduct, which were contained in files stored on the hard drive of his computer, and on electronic storage disks, seized by police during a search of his apartment. Following an evidentiary hearing, a judge in the Superior Court denied the motion to suppress. In this appeal (here on our granting the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review) the defendant claims that probable cause did not exist to support the issuance of a warrant to search his apartment. Alternatively, the defendant challenges his conviction on the ground that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, is overbroad, vague, and ambiguous, and hence unconstitutional on its face. We conclude that the motion to suppress was properly denied and affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The defendant in his appellate brief concedes that images seized from his home meet the core definition of child pornography under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C. We need not, therefore, recite the facts of this case as the jury might have found them based on the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. With respect to the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the judge found the facts as summarized below. All of the findings are supported by the evidence that the judge found credible, and we accept them.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sparks, </em>433 Mass. 654, 656 (2001), and cases cited.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In early January of 2002, Alexandria Tardif contacted the Massachusetts State police with concerns related to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>the defendant\u2019s possession of child pornography. On January 14, 2002, during an interview with Trooper Thomas R. Ryan, Tardif identified herself and related that she had a past relationship with a person she had met \u201con-line who goes by the name Steven Kenney.\u201d Tardif informed Trooper Ryan that she had once visited the defendant\u2019s home at 230 Westminster Hill Road, apartment 2, in Fitchburg, and had seen a computer there. Tardif also stated that, on December 27 and December 28, 2001, using the electronic mail (e-mail) address (\u201cbocult@hotmail. com\u201d) and password (\u201cExcalibur\u201d) the defendant had given her, Tardif gained access to the defendant\u2019s e-mail account. She told Trooper Ryan that she opened several of the defendant\u2019s e-mails, including one with an attached \u201cvideo clip\u201d showing a male performing oral sex on a six to eight year old girl. Tardif further provided Trooper Ryan with three e-mails (which she had printed) that were sent to the \u201cbocult@hotmail.com\u201d address in January, 2002.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Tardif also reported that the defendant maintained a second e-mail address named \u201cbocmastr@gis. net.\u201d She told Trooper Ryan that the registration plate on the defendant\u2019s automobile read \u201cBOCULT.\u201d Tardif also described to Trooper Ryan the defendant\u2019s apartment and physical appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">Based on the information given by Tardif, Trooper Ryan and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>other State troopers commenced an investigation of the defendant. Pursuant to a grand jury subpoena issued on January 28, 2002, the Internet mail service known as \u201cHotmail\u201d provided Trooper Ryan with information that the user profile of the screen name \u201cbocult@hotmail.com\u201d included the first name \u201cSteve,\u201d a state of residence as \u201cMassachusetts,\u201d and a zip code of \u201c01453.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hotmail also informed Trooper Ryan that the e-mail address had been accessed on December 27 and 28, 2001, from Oxford Instruments and Galaxy Internet Service (GIS), which are, respectively, the defendant\u2019s place of employment and Internet service provider. Pursuant to another subpoena, this one served on June 25, 2002, GIS confirmed that \u201cbocmastr@gis.net\u201d was an active e-mail account owned by Steven E. Kenney, Jr., of 230 Westminster Hill Road, apartment 2, in Fitchburg. GIS also informed Trooper Ryan that the password to that account was \u201cexcalibu.\u201d State police observed a motor vehicle bearing the registration plate \u201cBOCULT\u201d parked in the driveway of 230 Westminster Hill Road, and confirmed that photographs provided by Tardif were consistent with the photograph on the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">In June, 2002, State police obtained a warrant to search the defendant\u2019s apartment and to seize sexually explicit visual images, whether on paper or its equivalent or stored on electronic or magnetic media, any computer file text, any computer data file containing sexually explicit visual images the dissemination, purchase, or possession of which is specifically prohibited by G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 29B and 29C, and seize and transport all computer systems to a secure location to search for any sexually explicit images, prohibited by \u00a7\u00a7 29B and 29C, which may be stored, or referred to, in directories, subdirectories, files, or logs, therein. The warrant application was supplemented by a ten-page affidavit sworn to by Trooper Ryan. The search took place on June 25, 2002, and among other things, police seized the defendant\u2019s computer and eighty-six three and one-half inch electronic storage disks. When examined by a lieutenant in the State police forensic unit, the computer\u2019s hard drive was found to contain over forty images consistent with child pornography; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>deleted file sections of the hard drive were found to contain twenty-five images consistent with child, pornography; nine additional images consistent with child pornography were located in the unallocated space section of the hard drive; and each of fifteen three and one-half inch disks seized from the defendant\u2019s home contained multiple images consistent with child pornography. All of the images were submitted as exhibits for the jury to view.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">1. We reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the affidavit supporting the issuance of the warrant to search his apartment failed to establish probable cause to believe that child pornography would be found there. \u201cTo establish probable cause to search, the facts contained in an affidavit, and reasonable inferences that may be drawn from them, must be sufficient for the magistrate to conclude \u2018that the items sought are related to the criminal activity under investigation and that they reasonably may be expected to be located in the place to be searched at the time the search warrant issues.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>438 Mass. 246, 249 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>430 Mass. 710, 712 (2000). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robles, </em>423 Mass. 62, 65-66 (1996), and cases cited. We give considerable deference to the magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">We are satisfied that the material presented in the ten-page affidavit, when read as a whole and examined under settled standards, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>424 Mass. 770, 777-778 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jean-Charles, </em>398 Mass. 752, 757 (1986), establishes probable cause. The facts contained in the affidavit included (1) all of the information about the defendant (aforementioned in this opinion), as related by Tardif to Trooper Ryan six months earlier; (2) Tardif\u2019s description of the video clip that was attached to an e-mail sent to the defendant\u2019s Internet address; (3) Trooper Ryan\u2019s description of the printed e-mails sent to the defendant\u2019s Internet address; (4) all of the information received from Hotmail and GIS; (5) that the driver\u2019s license photograph of the defendant obtained from the registry of motor vehicles matched the photographs of the defendant provided by Tardif; (6) that a motor vehicle bearing the registration plate \u201cBOCULT,\u201d was observed in the driveway of 230 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>Westminster Hill Road in Fitchburg and, according to records of the registry of motor vehicles, that plate was registered to the defendant, at the address given police by Taxdif.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The affidavit also presented at length Trooper Ryan\u2019s extensive knowledge, learned from his six years of personal experience and training in the investigation of sexually related crimes and computer related crimes, and gleaned from other law enforcement officers, as to terminology, paraphernalia, and computer activities common to those involved with the sexual exploitation of others. According to the affidavit, those who are interested in sexual activity with children, or in sexually explicit visual images depicting children, are likely to keep such images secreted, but close at hand, as a means of attracting interest of new child victims, or as a means of arousing the possessor. The affidavit states: \u201cThese depictions tend to be extremely important to such individuals and are likely to remain in the possession of or under the control of such an individual for extensive time periods, perhaps a lifetime.\u201d Further, such depictions typically may be stored as data in a computer file, and even so-called \u201cdeleted\u201d files or data may, in fact, often still be present on the computer\u2019s storage medium, and thus recoverable by law enforcement, for months, years, even decades. Specifically, Trooper Ryan attested to his belief, based on the facts known to him, as set forth in the affidavit, that the defendant had access to an e-mail account from his computer at 230 Westminster Hill Road, apartment 2, in Fitchburg, which had been used, and continued to be used, by the defendant to engage in the trading or possession of child pornography. We do not rely on Trooper Ryan\u2019s conclusion as to what the facts in the affidavit mean to him as \u201ca talismanic formula,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiAntonio, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 434, 440-441 (1979), to provide probable cause where evidence to support such a finding is otherwise lacking. The magistrate, however, could reasonably rely on the inference drawn by a law enforcement officer experienced in the investigation of child pornography, that evidence of that crime would be found at 230 Westminster Hill Road, apartment 2, in Fitchburg. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taglieri, </em>378 Mass. 196, 199, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 937 (1979). The judge properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>218 F.3d 72, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>73-74 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1025 (2000) (warrant properly issued for defendant\u2019s home after screen name associated with the defendant showed Internet activity relating to child pornography). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fabiano, </em>169 F.3d 1299, 1302 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 852 (1999) (warrant issued for defendant\u2019s home after screen name linked to defendant appeared on child pornography \u201cchat room\u201d and defendant was sent two images of child pornography); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hibbler, </em>159 F.3d 233, 235 (6th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1030 (1999) (warrant issued for defendant\u2019s home after e-mail sent from defendant\u2019s screen name was found during investigation of another person\u2019s e-mails, which included image of child pornography and spoke of trading child pornography).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">2. We now consider the principal question to be resolved \u2014 whether our statute criminalizing the purchase or possession of child pornography, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, inserted by St. 1997, c. 181, \u00a7 2, is impermissibly vague or overbroad, or otherwise punishes an excessive range of constitutionally protected speech.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We do so for the first time and, if our answer is \u201cyes,\u201d even though the defendant concedes that his conduct fell within the legitimate scope of the statute, his conviction cannot stand. This is so because, owing to the high value placed on protected expression, statutes that impose criminal penalties on constitutionally protected speech are strictly scrutinized, and a law prohibiting a substantial amount of protected expression is unconstitutional on its face. See <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>482 U.S. 451, 459 (1987); <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 612 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Provost, </em>418 Mass. 416, 422-423 (1994). To hold otherwise would have a chilling effect on the exercise of rights protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution due to the threat of criminal sanctions imposed by a statute which, because of vagueness, ambiguity, or overbreadth, is susceptible of being applied to protected expression. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number><em>Schaumburg </em>v. <em>Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>444 U.S. 620, 634 (1980); <em>Baggett </em>v. <em>Bullitt, 377 </em>U.S. 360, 372 (1964); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 586-587 n.4 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Our task has been made simpler by two decisions of the United States Supreme Court setting clear guidelines for the application of the First Amendment to the category of child pornography: <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747 (1982), and <em>Ashcroft </em>v. <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234 (2002). In <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, supra, </em>the Court examined whether States could, within the framework of the First Amendment, regulate the dissemination of materials showing children engaged in sexual conduct, regardless whether the conduct was obscene in nature. <em>Id. </em>at 753. The Court recognized that a State\u2019s interest in \u201csafeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor\u201d is \u201ccompelling,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 756-757, quoting <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>457 U.S. 596, 607 (1982), and, further, that States have a \u201ccompelling interest in prosecuting those who promote the sexual exploitation of children.\u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, supra </em>at 761. In cases involving child pornography, the Court reasoned, \u201cthe evil to be restricted so overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interests, if any, at stake,\u201d that States may constitutionally proscribe the production, and distribution, of child pornography, whether or not it depicts works of value. <em>Id. </em>at 761, 763-764. See <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>495 U.S. 103, 111 (1990) (State \u201cmay constitutionally proscribe the possession and viewing of child pornography\u201d). The <em>Ferber </em>Court held that child pornography was \u201cunprotected speech subject to content-based regulation.\u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, supra </em>at 765-766 n.18. The Court recognized, however, that, as with all criminal statutes \u201cin this sensitive area,\u201d the conduct prohibited must be \u201cadequately defined by the applicable [Sjtate law, as written or authoritatively construed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764. The Court also cautioned that the scope of conduct penalized by a statute must not be overboard so as to encompass not only a \u201creal, but substantial\u201d amount of protected speech, \u201cjudged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 770, quoting <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, supra </em>at 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Twenty years later, in <em>Ashcroft </em>v. <em>Free Speech Coalition, supra, </em>the Supreme Court struck down certain provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251 et seq. (2000). The CPPA extended the Federal prohibition against child pornography to so-called \u201cvirtual child pornography,\u201d or those sexually explicit images that appear to depict real children but which, in fact, are created using adults (who look like children) or through the use of computer imaging technology. The Court pointed to congressional findings indicating that new technology \u201cmakes it possible to create realistic images of children who do not exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240, 241. Because \u00a7 2256 (8)(B) of the challenged statute prohibited \u201cany visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture\u201d that \u201cis, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,\u201d the Court observed that the statute could be read to encompass computer images that were not of real children; depictions of adults who only looked to be under eighteen years old; or \u201ca Renaissance painting depicting a scene from classical mythology.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241. The Court reasoned that none of these images \u201cinvolve, let alone harm, any children in the production process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Section 2256 (8)(D) of the CCPA banned sexually explicit images that are \u201cadvertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression\u201d that they depict minors (whether or not, in fact, they actually do). The Court emphasized that \u201c[t]he sexual abuse of a child is a most serious crime and an act repugnant to the moral instincts of a decent people\u201d and reiterated the holding of its earlier <em>Ferber </em>decision, that the First Amendment right to freedom of expression does not embrace child pornography. <em>Ashcroft </em>v. <em>Free Speech Coalition, supra </em>at 244, 246. See <em>id. </em>at 246-248 (recognizing that many of the images prohibited by the statute, but not involving children, would survive the obscenity test announced in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 24 [1973]). In the end, however, the <em>Ashcroft </em>Court concluded that \u00a7\u00a7 2256 (8)(B) and (D) of the statute abridged the freedom to engage in a substantial amount of lawful speech. For this reason, the Court held the statute to be overbroad and unconstitutional. See <em>id. </em>at 256, 258 (\u201cThe First Amendment requires a more precise restriction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">With the above principles in mind, we turn to the defendant\u2019s arguments that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>a. The defendant first claims that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C (set forth in note 1, <em>supra), </em>which punishes the knowing purchase or possession of a \u201cnegative, slide, book, magazine, film, videotape, photograph or other similar visual reproduction, or depiction by computer\u201d of a child whom the person \u201cknows or reasonably should know to be under the age of 18 years of age\u201d and such child is portrayed as engaged in one of six acts of a sexual nature (enumerated in subsections [i] through [vi]) \u201cactually or by simulation,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is unconstitutionally vague. Specifically, the defendant argues that, because the statute lacks clear definition of the terms \u201cdepiction by computer\u201d and \u201csimulation,\u201d it fails to provide sufficient notice of what conduct will violate its provisions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is well established that due process requires criminal statutes that are not \u201csufficiently explicit to give clear warning as to proscribed activities\u201d to be declared unconstitutional. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>371 Mass. 732, 734 (1977). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, </em>391 Mass. 394, 395-396 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. 108, 117-118 (1980). Prohibited imprecision includes ambiguity in the terms in a criminal statute, especially one implicating the right to freedom of expression, that might give rise to arbitrary enforcement. See <em>Speiser </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>357 U.S. 513, 525 (1958) (\u201cthe line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be regulated, suppressed, or punished is finely drawn\u201d). Any ambiguity in the terms of a criminal statute must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>426 Mass. 391, 394 (1998). Even in the realm of the First Amendment, however, we are not limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>the literal definition of the words as written by the Legislature: we also may consider any authoritative construction given by this court in the past. \u201c[A] law is not vague [in the constitutional sense] if its meaning is ascertainable by reference to similar or related statutes ... if the questioned [term has] a commonly understood meaning [or if] even a vague statute may be made constitutionally definite by giving it a reasonable construction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arthur, </em>420 Mass. 535, 539 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, supra </em>at 111. See also <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649, 652 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1189 (2003); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lammi, </em>386 Mass. 299, 301 (1982) (court must presume every enactment of Legislature intended to comply with constitutional constraints).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">We have previously examined the phrase \u201cdepiction by computer,\u201d as set forth in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, to determine whether evidence of child pornography stored in the form of data contained in an unopened file on a hard drive sufficed to convict a defendant under the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hinds, </em>437 Mass. 54, 63-64 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1205 (2003). We concluded that it did. See <em>id. </em>at 64. We recognized in the <em>Hinds </em>case that the statute lists types of physically tangible media (\u201ca negative, slide, book, magazine, film, videotape, photograph or other similar visual reproduction\u201d) and stated, \u201c[T]he Legislature\u2019s creation of a separate and distinct category for \u2018depiction by computer\u2019 manifests an intent to give special treatment to the unique issues presented by computers, including the fact that stored data, although intangible in their unprocessed form, are readily transferrable to a graphic image. Our reading comports with the Legislature\u2019s expressed design to eliminate permanent records of sexually exploitive material harmful to children. See St. 1997, c. 181, \u00a7 2. As such, \u2018depiction by computer\u2019 includes graphic computer images stored in the form of data.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63-64. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washbum, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 493, 496 n.3 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">We reject the defendant\u2019s suggestion, raised in conjunction with his claims of vagueness and overbreadth, that \u201cdepiction by computer\u201d could just as reasonably be read to encompass computer-created images (and thus not depictions of a live event) consistent with \u201cvirtual child pornography\u201d declared by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>the <em>Ashcroft </em>Court to be speech protected by the First Amendment. See <em>Ashcroft </em>v. <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234, 256 (2002). Although we agree with the defendant\u2019s premise that our <em>Hinds </em>decision did not necessarily limit \u201cdepiction by computer\u201d to refer only to stored electronic data, we are convinced, by what was said in that case, and by our own commonsense understanding of the term, which precedes in the statute the phrase \u201cof any child,\u201d that it cannot reasonably be interpreted to mean images created without the use of real children. Read in pertinent part, the statute prohibits the knowing possession of \u201ca negative, slide, book, magazine, film, videotape, photograph or other similar visual reproduction, or depiction by computer, of any child.\u201d We conclude that the term \u201cdepiction by computer\u201d refers to the method by which the image is possessed and not its content. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>426 Mass. 689, 690 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wotan, </em>422 Mass. 740, 743 (1996) (court must not \u201creject \u2018an available and sensible interpretation ... in favor of a fanciful or perverse one\u2019 \u201d). Our conclusion accords with those reached by appellate courts in other jurisdictions construing the same, or similar, terms in their own child pornography statutes. See, e.g., <em>Fink </em>v. <em>State, </em>817 A.2d 781, 791 (Del. 2003); <em>People </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>204 Ill. 2d 472, 485-487, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 983 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">The defendant raises a second argument in support of his claim that the statute is unconstitutionally vague. He contends that the word \u201csimulation,\u201d as it appears in subsections (i) though (vi), is ambiguous because it could be interpreted to include sexual conduct that actually never took place, but was merely imagery generated by a computer to appear as though it were a real occurrence. The defendant\u2019s logic is not unlike what he relied on in connection with his objection to \u201cdepiction by computer,\u201d and we reject it, for basically the same reasons. We point out as well that, although \u201csimulation\u201d is undefined in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, a related section of that chapter, \u00a7 31, expressly provides that \u201c[sjexual conduct\u201d includes \u201chuman masturbation, sexual intercourse, actual or simulated, normal or perverted\u201d and that \u201c[sjexual intercourse is simulated when it depicts explicit sexual intercourse which gives the appearance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>of the consummation of sexual intercourse, normal or perverted.\u201d We examined the definition of \u201c[s]exual conduct\u201d prohibited by \u00a7 31, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>707 Main Corp., </em>371 Mass. 374, 386 (1976), and held it to be constitutional. \u201c[A] law is not vague if its meaning is ascertainable by reference to similar or related statutes, or if the questioned terms have a commonly understood meaning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, supra. </em>Further, as has been discussed, the United States Supreme Court in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747 (1982), upheld the constitutionality of a New York child pornography statute, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 263.15 and 263.00 (3) (McKinney 1980), which defined \u201c[s]exual conduct\u201d as \u201cactual or simulated sexual intercourse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 765. The Court stated, \u201cThe forbidden acts to be depicted are listed with sufficient precision and represent the kind of conduct that, if it were the theme of a work, could render it legally obscene.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We presume that the Legislature, at the time of the statute\u2019s enactment in 1997, knew of preexisting law and of the decisions of our court and the United States Supreme Court, and intended the statutory language to be interpreted consistent with those statutes and decisions. See <em>Joslyn </em>v. <em>Chang, </em>445 Mass. 344, 350 (2005).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Finally, we think it important to note that the Legislature enacted G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, in recognition that the \u201cmere possession or control of any sexually exploitative material results in continuing victimization of children [because] such material is a permanent record of an act or acts of sexual abuse of exploitation of a child and that each time such material is viewed the child is harmed.\u201d St. 1997, c. 181, \u00a7 1 (2). Further, in order to \u201cstop the sexual abuse and exploitation of children, it [was] necessary to ban the possession of any sexually exploitative materials.\u201d St. 1997, c. 181, \u00a7 1 (5). The Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the statute could not be clearer: \u201c[T]o protect children from sexual exploitation . . . [by] prohibiting] the production of material which involves or is derived from such exploitation and to exclude all such material from the channels of trade and commerce.\u201d St. 1997, c. 181, \u00a7 1 (1). Our construction of the statute clearly effectuates the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>b. The challenged terms thus interpreted and clarified, we address the defendant\u2019s next argument \u2014 that the statute remains unconstitutionally overbroad because its legitimate ambit imposes a deterrent effect on speech protected by the First Amendment. The defendant argues that language in \u00a7 29C, even as limited above, will inevitably require subjective judgments as to what is proscribed, and thus impinge on areas of common pursuit and interest, such as the arts, which may be outside the realm of easily identifiable child pornography.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Using as his primary example a film recently released at the Sundance Film Festival (\u201cHounddog\u201d), starring a twelve year old girl (Dakota Fanning), who, in the film, is depicted in the act of being raped,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the defendant calls the court\u2019s attention to the public controversy surrounding the film and the current debate (portrayed in the media) as to the film\u2019s artistic merit compared with the film maker\u2019s inherent exploitation of its child star.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">In <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747 (1982), the United States Supreme Court addressed the issue now raised by the defendant, essentially, that the statute under review was overbroad because it would prohibit the possession of materials with serious literary, scientific, or educational value. See <em>id. </em>at 773. The Court had two responses. First, it rejected the argument that \u201cvisual depictions of children performing sexual acts or lewdly exhibiting their genitals would . . . constitute an important and necessary part of a literary performance or scientific or educational work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 762-763. Second, the Court reasoned that the harm sought to be prevented by the statute, the sexual exploitation of children, \u201cis irrelevant to the child [who has been abused] whether or not the material . . . has. a literary, artistic, political, or social value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 761. The Court questioned whether any arguably impermissible applications of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>the statute would constitute \u201cmore than a tiny fraction of the materials within the statute\u2019s reach,\u201d and held that \u201cwhatever overbreadth . . . should be cured through case-by-case analysis of the fact situations to which its sanctions, assertedly, may not be applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 773-774. Although the Legislature is, of course, free to enact a more lenient set of exemptions, we conclude, indeed as we must in light of the <em>Ferber </em>case, that the Legislature\u2019s choice not to provide an exemption for artistic or scientific materials does not invalidate the statute. \u201c[W]hatever overbreadth may exist [such as, perhaps, application of the statute to the possession of the film \u201cHounddog\u201d] should be cured through case-by-case analysis of the fact situations to which its sanctions, assertedly, may not be applied.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Provost, </em>418 Mass. 416, 423 (1994), quoting <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 615-616 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">c. The defendant makes a third attack on the statute\u2019s constitutionality, which, although related conceptually to the doctrines of vagueness and overbreadth, is sufficiently distinct to deserve separate consideration. He claims that the Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cknows or reasonably should know to be under the age of 18 years of age\u201d constitutes an impermissible scienter requirement because it might include situations where a defendant is mistaken about a child\u2019s age and, therefore, criminalizes an error of judgment. In support of his claim, the defendant cites the decision of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pittman, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 28 (1987), in which the Appeals Court vac\u00e1ted a defendant\u2019s sentence under G. L. c. 265, 19 <em>(a), </em>for unarmed robbery of person over age of sixty-five, stating, \u201cExcept at the poles, judging age on physical appearance is a guess and a guess is not a basis for sending someone to jail.\u201d In general, a depiction or image of an adult person may not disclose, with any certainty, that person\u2019s age. Pictures or images of children, particularly young children, however, are different and are ordinarily distinctive such that a person viewing the picture or image knows that it depicts a child under the age of eighteen. (The defendant here appears to admit that he actually knew the children in the materials he possessed were under the age of eighteen.)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">What level of scienter as to the age of a subject child is constitutionally required to convict a defendant of possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>child pornography was not considered in either the <em>Ferber </em>or <em>Ashcroft </em>decision and, so far as we are aware, the issue has yet to be addressed by the United States Supreme Court. We have had occasion to consider a scienter requirement, similar to that challenged here, in the context of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 <em>29A </em>(criminalizing the posing or exhibiting a child in a state of nudity). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>432 Mass. 657 (2000). In that case, the defendant maintained that the Commonwealth\u2019s proof was insufficient to support his conviction because the Commonwealth failed to present any evidence that he knew or was \u201cin possession of such facts that he should have [had] reason to know\u201d that the naked child depicted in a photograph (taken by the defendant) was under eighteen years of age. See <em>id. </em>at 661-663. We held that the record warranted the conclusion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant knew, or had reason to know, the victim\u2019s age, because (a) the jury reasonably could have inferred from the evidence that the child in the picture was in fact the defendant\u2019s then eight year old niece; (b) the jury also could have inferred that the defendant knew or should have known that his niece was younger than eighteen years of age; and further, (c) even if the jury had concluded that the child in the picture was not the defendant\u2019s niece, based on physical characteristics observable from the inculpatory photograph, the defendant\u2019s constructive knowledge of the child\u2019s age could be inferred. See <em>id. </em>at 662-663. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Emmons, </em>98 Mass. 6, 8 (1867) (jury may consider physical appearance as factor in determining age). We noted that \u201cthe finder of fact may rely entirely on physical appearance only in cases involving \u2018marked extremes of old age and youth,\u2019 \u201d but concluded that the difference in terms of sexual development between a girl eleven and one-half years old (as the Commonwealth\u2019s expert had opined the photograph depicted) and one eighteen years old, is sufficiently \u201c \u2018extreme\u2019 to sustain the Commonwealth\u2019s burden.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, supra </em>at 663, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pittman, supra </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Drawing from the analysis in the <em>O\u2019Connell </em>decision, we conclude that, in a prosecution for possession of child pornography under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, in circumstances where the defendant\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge of a child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>age is disputed, the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof on that element may be satisfied with evidence that the physical disparity between the subject of the sexually explicit material and a person who is eighteen years of age is such that it would be obvious (beyond a reasonable doubt) to a reasonable person that the material was proscribed. Put differently, the Commonwealth must prove that no reasonable person would not have known that the child subject was under the age of eighteen. In most child pornography cases, \u201cthe images themselves [will] provide[] evidence of the ages of the persons depicted.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Girard, </em>269 Mich. App. 15, 22 (2005). See <em>State </em>v. <em>May, </em>362 N.J. Super. 572, 594 (2003) (images admitted at trial were, themselves, evidence of ages of persons depicted). Further, the Commonwealth in many, if not most, cases will have corroborative evidence that a defendant reasonably should have known the age of a child. This evidence may often take the form of related criminal conduct (involving children) with which a defendant is charged; people or Web sites with whom the defendant has contacts; the content of e-mails sent to and from a defendant\u2019s Internet address; testimony as to admissions made by the defendant to others in the past; or the content of other evidence (i.e., books, pamphlets, notes, telephone numbers) found in the defendant\u2019s possession.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">A defendant may, if he or she so chooses, present evidence indicating that he or she was honestly mistaken with regard to (or reasonably did not know) the age of the child depicted in the material. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>433 Mass. 722, 725 &amp; n.3 (2001) (mistake of fact \u201cdefense\u201d is available where mistake negates existence of mental state essential to material element of offense). In this manner, on a case-by-case basis, any ambiguities in the statutory requirement that the Commonwealth prove that a defendant knew, or reasonably should have known, a child\u2019s age will be eliminated and the possibility of a conviction of a defendant who reasonably, but mistakenly, believed that his conduct was lawful will be unlikely. See <em>New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number><em>York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 773-774 (1982) (de minimis over-breadth in otherwise constitutional child pornography statute may be cured through case-by-case analysis). Cases raising the defense of reasonable mistake will, we expect, be rare, because as is the situation here, the children involved in the pornography will ordinarily be readily ascertainable as children. The fact that there will be very few cases at the margin raising doubt as to the age of the child, with the vast majority of cases being self-evident as to age, is sufficient, given the authority of the Legislature to regulate in this area, to conclude that the scienter requirement of the statute is constitutionally valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">We emphasize that the language of the statute requires a defendant in all cases to \u201cknowingly purchaseQ or possess[]\u201d the proscribed materials. It is the scope of the proscribed material that the defendant challenges as an unconstitutional infringement on expression protected by the First Amendment. We scrutinize carefully facial challenges to all criminal statutes capable, to any extent, of punishing expression protected by the First Amendment. As has been stated many times in this opinion, and others, such a statute is within constitutional limits, for purposes of challenges, such as here, to vagueness and over-breadth, so long as the statute is sufficiently explicit to give clear notice as to the proscribed conduct and does not prohibit a substantial amount of protected expression. See <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, supra </em>at 764, 769-770, 773; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. 108, 111, 117-118 (1980); <em>Commonwealth v. Orlando, </em>371 Mass. 732, 734 (1977). See also <em>Commonwealth v. Arthur, </em>420 Mass. 535, 539 (1995); <em>Commonwealth v. Lammi, </em>386 Mass. 299, 301 (1982). We hold that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, as construed in this opinion, satisfies these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">3.
